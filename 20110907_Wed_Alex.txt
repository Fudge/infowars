[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.080]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:46.240]  okay a very important broadcast lined up for you today it is just incredible what is now unfolding
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.200]  on so many fronts and i'm going to announce coming up at the start of the next segment
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.800]  a new contest with five thousand dollars in prizes but i'm only going to put a
[01:00.800 --> 01:08.400]  a one-week turnaround on this i'm not going to have or maybe a two-week turnaround i haven't
[01:08.400 --> 01:15.280]  even basically written up the um rules yet so i'll just announce them on air and then paul
[01:15.280 --> 01:23.120]  watson or curt nemo can codify it into a page on info wars dot com and prism planet dot com and
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.880]  what does the contest have to do with well i'll tell you about that coming up again later in
[01:28.880 --> 01:42.160]  the next segment it has to do with the fact that everything we've basically predicted is now unfolding
[01:42.960 --> 01:48.240]  and i don't have the crew or the personnel to sit there and mark down all of my predictions
[01:48.960 --> 01:55.920]  and so we're going to have a contest to see out there with listeners who can go through
[01:55.920 --> 02:02.160]  and put together the best compilation in 10 minutes or less of different predictions i've
[02:02.160 --> 02:11.280]  made that then come true here's one it it it it makes my brain burn with frustration
[02:12.320 --> 02:18.480]  that i know for at least 10 years i have said every week that they will set up three economic
[02:18.480 --> 02:26.560]  unions north american european and asian with subunions and then get those countries in debt
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.640]  through fiat fraud and then implode them and then merge them into a global open banking
[02:32.640 --> 02:37.760]  dictatorship now that is openly being announced for europe it will then be announced for north
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.840]  america and asia they are openly announcing it i listened to bloomberg last night on the radio
[02:43.840 --> 02:49.440]  bloomberg radio they had five guests on this show as i drove home at 10 o'clock at night
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.440]  for 35 minutes and every one of them was reading office scripts saying the same thing even in the
[02:55.440 --> 03:04.000]  same order that well europe's got to now get rid of its sovereignty entirely and set up a private
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.560]  economic union over it a united states of europe uh which is the opposite of that no republic no
[03:10.560 --> 03:18.960]  no no freedom and then this morning the prime minister of england uh a bunch of other leaders
[03:18.960 --> 03:23.680]  said the only way to save the world economy is for all sovereignty to be fully removed
[03:24.240 --> 03:29.360]  not just from the individual countries in europe but from the euro itself to this new private cartel
[03:31.040 --> 03:37.200]  this is ruled by bankers openly not even through their government puppets it's basically like the
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.760]  federal reserve here just getting rid of congress which they basically have done i mean they've said
[03:41.760 --> 03:47.600]  they're above the law and run everything and now the super congress uh has control of the purse
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.480]  so really they've done that now here not with a bang but with a whimper this is earth shattering
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.360]  and there's all the club of rum documents there's all their statements there's
[03:57.360 --> 04:03.840]  eu founders bragging uh and what the eu observer i mean just all the data flashes before my eyes
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.640]  it makes my brain burn that they planned this decades ago and are now going jeepers creepers
[04:10.640 --> 04:17.680]  we just got the idea to save you give us all the power get rid of any liberty you have and and the
[04:17.680 --> 04:23.200]  head of the central bank in ireland four months ago telling the bvc and other publications
[04:23.920 --> 04:29.360]  it was a quote at a press conference i think it's best to have ireland run by foreign banks that's a
[04:29.360 --> 04:39.840]  quote i mean that's like saying i think it's best at zorg from the planet popple zoppel run everything

[09:00.960 --> 09:07.040]  building at public meetings and telling them he was recording them and this all began when he
[09:07.040 --> 09:14.000]  requested a court reporter uh at some of these hearings and they said no you're not getting a
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.080]  court reporter and he said well i'm gonna record it and they just said that's it pal life in present
[09:18.880 --> 09:26.240]  this is america slaves do not record gods and of course it turns out michael allison is a listener
[09:26.240 --> 09:30.800]  and been trying to get in contact with us since before this broke and somehow he got a hold of
[09:30.800 --> 09:36.960]  mike hanson so i want to thank mike hanson the mike hanson channel over on youtube it's like 300
[09:36.960 --> 09:43.200]  thousand views of the local newscast that mike uploaded of michael allison the thought criminal
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.640]  will be joining us and then mike adams i don't know how much mike wants to get into this because
[09:48.640 --> 09:52.800]  he moved austin a while back and wanted to be private that he even moved here which i understand
[09:52.800 --> 10:00.080]  wanting to be private uh when you know you've got a huge news website uh and the preeminent in
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.800]  natural health news and information reaching millions a week uh and i don't know how much he
[10:04.800 --> 10:12.240]  wants to get into it but let's just say mike's had a first hand visit with the flames and uh
[10:12.240 --> 10:17.600]  was able to defend his property for now it's like mordor or something outside because i'm here in
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.160]  south austin the smoke from bastrop one of the biggest fires in texas history well they're now
[10:22.160 --> 10:27.440]  seeing the biggest actually uh is like black smoke in the sky i thought i was driving into a war zone
[10:27.440 --> 10:34.800]  uh this morning where i live in southwest austin it's all smoky too but um uh certainly getting
[10:34.800 --> 10:39.840]  my carbon monoxide today so mike adams is going to be joining us for your video skype
[10:39.840 --> 10:46.320]  he dare not leave his home or he might not get back into it but but i'll i'll see how far mike
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.760]  wants to go i mean he's got an article out today that deals with the big story that uh we broke
[10:51.760 --> 11:01.040]  nationally last night uh the and that's coming up in the next hour uh that the gonzalez cannon
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.480]  first broke and then i've since talked to firefighters and i have more firefighter phone
[11:06.480 --> 11:13.680]  numbers i need to get my producer to get on the show today also uh talked to shane steiner uh one
[11:13.680 --> 11:23.120]  of the uh owners of the steiner ponderosa uh that uh has been on fire but he he didn't want to comment
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.480]  at this time but i did learn some interesting inside baseball but that's how it works i'm not
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.520]  allowed to talk about what was going on over at steiner ranch but luckily those fires are
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.000]  almost extinguished over there and they lost something like 27 houses they've lost over 1200
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.160]  and bass drop um what 15 austin firefighters have lost their houses and fires in austin
[11:44.960 --> 11:48.880]  i mean that gives you an idea that so many homes have been lost 15 austin firefighters
[11:49.520 --> 11:55.280]  and guess what this whole started on sunday and the austin fire chief who's known for total
[11:55.280 --> 12:03.680]  political correctness this lady she's she's she's another uh janet napolitano type uh she has uh
[12:03.680 --> 12:10.000]  out in colorado playing golf and uh said she's on her vacation and so there's calls for her
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  head to be on a platter uh that 100 year event and it it's fires all around the city and inside
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.960]  the city some deaths as well a bunch of deaths in other parts of the states i mean it is it is
[12:24.960 --> 12:30.480]  it is something else i mean you walk outside you think you're downwind from a campfire you're
[12:30.480 --> 12:38.960]  you're huffing a cedar and and and and oak and uh mesquite actually smells pretty good in a way
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.760]  makes me think of grill and steaks or something you could you could hang steaks outside the
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.920]  office here and marinate them with the smoke flavoring uh by the way the fire is coming this way
[12:50.800 --> 12:56.000]  it's miles away but i hope that they didn't burn down the studio we've got it insured but the way
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.040]  society's collapsing who knows if that would help anything all right let me just reset here for a
[13:01.040 --> 13:10.080]  moment because what happens is i was up here till 10 o'clock last night finishing up the hour long
[13:10.080 --> 13:14.640]  plus tv show we did in full works nightly news normally 30 minutes over an hour last night
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.600]  and then i listened to bloomberg driving home and i did about two hours of research then
[13:19.600 --> 13:27.760]  and couldn't sleep i was so upset and then by the time i get here with all this news
[13:28.400 --> 13:35.440]  i've already been upset about it and thinking about it often on the last 10 hours and i'm
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.800]  i'm almost befuddled with it and that's what the globalist social engineers admit in their
[13:40.800 --> 13:45.920]  white papers and psychological warfare perspectives that we've ferreted out and published at info wars
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.520]  dot com and prison planet dot com is there is an attempt to overwhelm you there is an attempt
[13:51.520 --> 13:59.280]  to give you so much stimuli that you basically just just marvel at the beast as john the revelator
[13:59.280 --> 14:06.320]  said on the isle of patmos been given a vision by god of what would come in the future he marveled
[14:06.320 --> 14:19.040]  at the beast uh with his mouth hanging open and uh more and more i marvel at the brazen
[14:20.080 --> 14:29.200]  cubarus the the the abject wickedness the the open tyranny this is not like an elephant in
[14:29.200 --> 14:38.640]  the room this is like a giant trotting whale in the room and one side of me just says i should
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.800]  just cancel all the guests today i'm not going to because i want to talk about all this news
[14:43.680 --> 14:50.960]  they are announcing forced inoculations of Gardasil for all girls in mexico a a a a crippling
[14:50.960 --> 14:57.280]  maiming sentence for many death for many others that right there has got me ready to drive to
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.360]  mexico with an interpreter to try to bullhorn and warn people and of course be beat up and arrested
[15:01.360 --> 15:05.920]  by the police whose own daughters will be maimed maimed by it they don't care it's the nature of
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.720]  this compartmentalized system how we destroy ourselves they're now announcing they're trying
[15:10.720 --> 15:15.200]  to push mandatory Gardasil shots for all boys in the u.s that's in the associated press today
[15:15.200 --> 15:28.240]  um napolitano has come out and attacked drudge with a bunch of lies and we've written an article
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.320]  the 10 lies uh 10 facts that prove big sis is wrong and drudge of course linked to that last
[15:34.320 --> 15:40.240]  night and i saw it this morning i don't know if it's still there uh also a well-known uh reporter
[15:40.240 --> 15:49.200]  and blogger and um i guess actress uh very lovely lady uh reportedly had the tsa woman
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.880]  actually insert her fingers into her body through the clothing she was shocked she was able to do
[15:54.880 --> 16:00.640]  that uh and be screamed and cried and begged for help and was reportedly laughed at so she
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.920]  spoke out against it and the tsa is now announcing that they're going to sue her that's in forms and
[16:05.920 --> 16:12.880]  associated press uh and then big sis announced last night that they're going to have MRI powered
[16:12.880 --> 16:18.880]  level uh scanners to see what to take your shoes off oh i'll be taking my shoes off
[16:18.880 --> 16:22.800]  and braving the athlete's foot and flesh eating bacteria where thousands of people have walked
[16:22.800 --> 16:29.120]  through that day at you know newark liberty or lax or all the other hell holes that i have to fly
[16:29.120 --> 16:36.480]  through ladies and gentlemen uh you can pull up just just type MRIs cancer they had the new
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.720]  york times last year showing thousands of people permanently made bald including women
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.560]  by the cone of the MRI scanner because they're so high powered you have to calibrate them each week
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.840]  under federal and state law a regular dental type x-ray once a month even a checks x-ray once a
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.880]  month a private firm has to come in and certify you have to have a radiation officer with a
[16:58.880 --> 17:05.040]  badge tsa is to totally exempt from all of that they don't even give congress radiation records
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.960]  and when they were forced to they were all fake and they've had them in for eight years almost
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.880]  eight years and boston logan right at an eight time increase in cancer over eight years in that
[17:14.880 --> 17:21.680]  cancer cluster so they're eight for eight uh and she just announces super high powered feet scanners
[17:21.680 --> 17:29.680]  that will give a complete imaging scan of your feet i mean blasting you a MRI dwarfs a chest x-ray
[17:30.240 --> 17:39.360]  MRIs are extremely dangerous they fire high powered waves into your body i mean how do you think
[17:39.360 --> 17:44.240]  they're mapping every contour of the brain every contour of the heart in a 3d model i mean this
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.560]  is hardcore pounding and a lot of them are uncalibrated or aren't calibrated right and boy
[17:50.560 --> 17:56.320]  when they don't calibrate one right sometimes people have strokes and i just call watson told
[17:56.320 --> 17:59.120]  him you ought to do an article on this he's like i'm already writing one on the global
[17:59.120 --> 18:03.600]  government announcement and i said i know so i'll go talk to nemo or erin was up here ladies not

[18:14.800 --> 18:20.800]  they're putting up random highway scanners that are so high powered to make MRIs look tame
[18:20.800 --> 18:26.720]  where they have families i have newscast drive under it and troops national guard are running it
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.920]  instead of fighting fires are out there with cops running people through as they drive their cars
[18:31.920 --> 18:39.520]  under things i've talked to different radiologists 10 to 100 times a chest x-ray i mean
[18:39.520 --> 18:46.400]  20 years ago they wouldn't let troops use du now they just hand it out to everybody and say it's
[18:46.400 --> 18:50.960]  fine when their own manuals say it's a death sentence it ignites going out the barrel and gives
[18:50.960 --> 18:58.720]  you a lethal dose it may take 20 years to kill you one round of du fired you should be wearing a
[18:58.720 --> 19:06.160]  full mop gear total decontamination just to fire one round it was only to be used inside of a full
[19:06.160 --> 19:11.760]  nuclear war with the russians with a 10 to 1 superiority when they poured across out of eastern
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.680]  europe into germany for ground troops to knock out tanks and attend to one superiority and even

[24:19.920 --> 24:26.560]  plug info wars dot com and pointed out that the war on terror is basically a fraud that our
[24:26.560 --> 24:32.960]  government is enabling al qaeda and rebranding the terror apparatus to suppress the american people
[24:33.840 --> 24:41.680]  this was all over every major big conservative news magazine town hall world net daily ammo land
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.360]  it just a huge story we didn't get chucked back on the show and always been a listener
[24:47.360 --> 24:50.960]  i don't know he said 15 years he's been listening since close to the start
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.320]  and uh it's it's hard to believe that there's criminal elements running the government
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.240]  see i'm not saying al qaeda doesn't exist so there aren't muslim terrorist extremists
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.880]  i'm explaining this global corporate interest that are funding and protecting them to then
[25:06.880 --> 25:13.040]  menace the west to take our liberties and set up a control grid that's then used on the general public
[25:13.040 --> 25:20.240]  and now it's all come true and chuck heard me talk about this seven eight nine years ago
[25:22.000 --> 25:30.080]  and now he's starting to really go public look at the drudge report the king of all news drivers
[25:30.080 --> 25:35.280]  linking to us on a weekly basis sometimes more often carrying our report as a counter
[25:35.280 --> 25:42.080]  the big sis attacking him yesterday we're really having a huge effect because we understand reality
[25:42.080 --> 25:48.640]  we study how things really work and we're willing to talk about it when most people aren't aware of
[25:48.640 --> 25:58.080]  it knowing that over time the truth will defeat the lies i'm hated i'm demonized i'm vilified i'm
[25:58.080 --> 26:03.680]  attacked but in the final equation it doesn't matter because somebody's got to tell the truth
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.040]  as mark twain said in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and brave
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.880]  but in time when his cause succeeds the tim had joined him because then it costs nothing to be a
[26:14.880 --> 26:20.000]  patriot well we haven't gotten to the point where it costs nothing but if we are going to save this
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.520]  country and save western civilization and save any form of our republic we're going to have to face
[26:25.520 --> 26:33.520]  reality and it's an ugly reality denial has let corrupt individuals really go far to the point
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.760]  where they think they've got us we're going to stick our hands down your pants we're going to arrest
[26:37.760 --> 26:40.560]  10 year old cell eliminate we're not going to let you have gardens

[26:53.680 --> 26:57.040]  what's she going to what's she going to do about it well we're going to do a lot about it's what
[26:57.040 --> 27:03.360]  we're going to do now i'll have to get to this more later again what is my top story
[27:03.360 --> 27:11.440]  they're now announcing they're going to put MRIs in that blast you blast your feet and of course
[27:11.440 --> 27:19.360]  it'll it'll continue the radiation up towards your genitals i mean that right there just just
[27:19.360 --> 27:25.040]  insane hidden in blame view or the huge announcements in hundreds of newspapers and i the talking
[27:25.040 --> 27:28.480]  point must have gone out yesterday because i sort of seen it in the news and then heard it on
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.560]  bloomberg financial we're all five of the guest all were reading and i kept seeing as they're playing
[27:34.560 --> 27:41.280]  the same tape and it wasn't it was their in studio economist all reading the exact same thing
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.320]  and i got home and searched it and there it was in hundreds of news articles
[27:47.760 --> 27:53.200]  the world will go into total depression there'll be martial law and total collapse that's that's in
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.320]  major newspapers today if you don't give unlimited trillions for the banks and let them set up a
[27:58.320 --> 28:08.800]  financial union where you pay your carbon taxes in vat to them we must get rid of all sovereignty
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.920]  the problem is democracy in germany they are voting merkel's people out because they're
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.360]  handing all power over to this system we've got to and then in the next parts well i think
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.480]  in the end it's all we can do so yes we'll do the reasonable thing and set up the governance system
[28:24.480 --> 28:30.960]  for the european financial structure to consolidate into a financial private corporate union yes it
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.720]  is the plan we're doing quite well and then you know bloomberg financial is is propagandizing for
[28:36.720 --> 28:41.760]  carbon taxes to shut us down victim disarmament i mean it's just you listen to them but they all

[39:23.920 --> 39:29.360]  this is openly being put out by the head of the big mega bank ubs central banker trichet
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.680]  reduced call for european global governance curtain immo that's got links to mainstream articles
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.920]  herman von rupey head of the eu calling for global government through this crisis
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.480]  they've said this crisis is going to give them world government and i can't get the average
[39:42.480 --> 39:49.680]  yuppie to wake up and say no to foreign banker occupation because that doesn't exist all right
[39:49.680 --> 39:56.240]  now we go to our guest who i appreciate holding michael allison and and and just to reintroducing
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.480]  to you this is the clip in the last week and a half it's gone viral all together millions of
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.600]  views on youtube with the different versions of the local newscast uh that are out there
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.480]  and there were quite a few michael allison's in his town up in illinois uh and so i just
[40:10.480 --> 40:15.680]  given up on trying to get him and then he ended up contacting getting all to us through mic hanson
[40:15.680 --> 40:21.280]  one of my old cameramen so glad that uh michael allison is here with us and i wasn't surprised
[40:21.280 --> 40:26.160]  to learn that he's a listener and has been contacting us since before this even broke
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.120]  and became a big national story uh you you remember he's he's facing life in prison
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.880]  and for videotaping and audio taping police in public places uh here's a clip of the local news
[40:36.880 --> 40:44.640]  on that 75 years behind bars a prison sentence that long is rarely handed down and it's usually
[40:44.640 --> 40:51.360]  just for murderers or rapists but a local man faces 75 years in prison for a nonviolent crime
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.480]  what he's accused of doing is something many people have done but most don't realize it's
[40:56.480 --> 41:03.120]  actually illegal let him go what you're witnessing is now against the law in some states
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.840]  police is also shooting people as well as this don't chase me bro getting people scenes are
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.640]  being banned in more and more states chasing people the police and these recordings are not
[41:16.640 --> 41:22.640]  necessarily the ones breaking the law it's the people recording the police recording audio of
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.680]  law so there you have it uh and and and the police have been charging people in those incidents the
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.880]  new shows where you're 200 yards away the cops ride somebody over the horse for no reason or knock
[41:32.880 --> 41:37.120]  a woman off a bike they go ahead and come over beat you up arrest you charge you for taping them
[41:37.840 --> 41:44.240]  they videotape you in public how does a cop have a microphone on his on his tie or a camera in his
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.880]  car an audio hooked onto his uniform because there's no perception of privacy in public
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.120]  it's not wiretapping but they run this hoax in 12 states and put people behind bars who don't
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.720]  know how to defend themselves or get a good lawyer now in other cases it's it's thrown out and people
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.920]  fight it in a first circuit court of appeals uh just ruled that of course it's first amendment
[42:05.920 --> 42:12.080]  but the police in 12 states don't care they are arresting also beating people who tape them in
[42:12.080 --> 42:17.600]  public they'll come in your yard and arrest you now this is a true sign of tyranny uh and and some
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.880]  people are serving i've looked it up five year sentences 12 year sentences for videotaping police
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.520]  in some cases in their own homes when police come now they're calling it wiretapping uh very
[42:29.520 --> 42:34.160]  frightening that police would would send us away like we weren't humans and and and violate our
[42:34.160 --> 42:39.600]  rights and and then laugh about it i mean very i mean that that even shocks me that they become
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.080]  that criminal in 12 states and that the state governments are saying yes do it we're going
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.840]  to throw the book at you along with the counties uh but but i've heard of no one facing life in prison
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.920]  and and and michael allison faces life in prison and he's going to give us the some of the rest of
[42:53.920 --> 42:59.520]  the story today he's been investigating what he believes is corruption and inside deals and he
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.920]  he's been in court with him and requested a court reporter they won't do that so he tries to record
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.600]  himself publicly in court that or or on the street that's where all these charges are stemming from
[43:09.600 --> 43:15.360]  um uh so michael allison joins us uh from illinois michael tell us where you're based and uh
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.040]  basically what's happened to you and where all this is going all right uh first of all it's
[43:21.040 --> 43:29.360]  good to be here i'm i'm glad you you uh had me on and uh i'm a long-term resident of bridgeport
[43:29.360 --> 43:39.120]  illinois and uh basically the whole situation started in bridgeport uh basically over uh
[43:39.120 --> 43:47.520]  i've said the ordinance and uh that violates my rights to uh fix up and restore uh classic cars
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.600]  as a form of hobby and and a public interest i mean so it's more of the banning lemonade stands
[43:53.600 --> 44:00.880]  and gardening more of just uh rob do and his housing division the the the office building has trash
[44:00.880 --> 44:05.680]  cans all out front but he's not even allowed to to to have the trash cans on the side of his house
[44:05.680 --> 44:10.320]  so he went to show the hypocritical nature and they don't care so just just just just more control
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.480]  freaks yeah it's definitely a situation uh deprives the citizens of their freedom and
[44:16.480 --> 44:23.200]  rights and liberties and uh so i saw it as an injustice and a violation of my rights and i
[44:23.760 --> 44:30.000]  proceeded to uh sue them in federal court after they had taken action illegal action against me
[44:30.000 --> 44:41.120]  and uh the case was pending from 2005 until 2008 and uh it survived the motion to dismiss the case
[44:41.120 --> 44:51.040]  was valid uh it had merit and uh when we went through uh depositions that took place in 2007
[44:51.760 --> 44:58.240]  i had uh discovered uh a little bit of information by asking a few questions and getting the answers
[44:58.240 --> 45:05.840]  which led me to uh request uh uh documents from the state of illinois vehicle services department
[45:05.840 --> 45:14.480]  in springfield illinois and by getting those documents i was able to uh ascertain that they were
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.760]  illegally and fraudulently converting titles to these uh vehicles that were illegally being seized
[45:21.760 --> 45:29.200]  and basically stolen off of private property and because they were were stolen and illegally seized
[45:29.200 --> 45:36.080]  the way they were um they didn't have a a clear title that was actually signed over legally by
[45:36.080 --> 45:43.600]  the the legal title holder so they had to come up with a scheme to somehow get a title to these
[45:43.600 --> 45:48.800]  stolen cars okay so it's the classic thing we've seen this i don't know about your particulars but
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.760]  i've seen it even the washington times and washington posts where police it turned out were running
[45:53.760 --> 45:59.680]  their own records in uniform and even hauling cars off mcdonald's parking lots and then chopping
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.400]  them themselves or charging fees i know that's hard to believe you can look up the mainstream news
[46:04.400 --> 46:09.040]  it was like five years ago but that happened so so you're alleging and you're saying you had a
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.800]  a court case a lawsuit dealing with this with your cars being hauled off and folks connected to
[46:14.800 --> 46:22.480]  government profiting from it but regardless of the of the backside now we know how this uh
[46:23.360 --> 46:28.160]  how this confrontation began now the system wanted to come after you and where we do know they are
[46:28.160 --> 46:35.200]  guilty is they've now charged you with counts that add up to life in prison or publicly audio and
[46:35.200 --> 46:41.200]  videotaping them and telling them you were in public places and that there is official oppression
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.800]  it's false charges uh because a bunch of them were involved mr allison it is racketeering and
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.760]  and so specifically tell us about the wiretapping charges and how that came to be and where the
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.720]  case is going i mean are you going to disappear into the illinois prisons at taxpayer expense
[46:56.720 --> 47:02.640]  because you you dare audio and videotape uh our owners no i don't i don't believe that i'll ever
[47:02.640 --> 47:10.560]  be convicted uh the the whole case that they have put against me as bogus and uh even if i would
[47:10.560 --> 47:16.560]  would uh it's not likely but even if i was to be convicted in the uh lower courts
[47:18.400 --> 47:25.200]  i would have a very solid case in an appellant court and uh but the amazing thing is i've seen
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.560]  the arrogant prosecutor on the news he looks very pleased with himself but won't talk to reporters
[47:30.560 --> 47:38.800]  but is smiling and smirking like a cat that just got caught eating a canary well uh i i i get a
[47:38.800 --> 47:44.320]  different perception i i think that uh that that face maybe just to cover up the fact that they he
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.960]  knows that he's in deep trouble i think that as soon as they realized that i was going to fight back
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.200]  and not just tower in the corner and plead guilty to some lesser charge uh they they knew that they
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.640]  had a situation on their hands and they was going to have to deal with it well michael allison is one
[48:02.640 --> 48:10.320]  of those evil things they call a 1776 or an american uh a quiet hardworking man who was
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.240]  pushed too far and abused and had his cars taken from him so he began to stand up for
[48:16.240 --> 48:23.120]  himself six years ago and now this story leads us to him facing life in prison we're simply trying
[48:23.120 --> 48:30.480]  to get a record of his own court cases and to interview on the street uh the people that were
[48:30.480 --> 48:35.360]  persecuting him and now in the court of public opinion they've been convicted by the mere fact
[48:35.360 --> 48:41.680]  that they would charge this man with illegal wiretapping and try to put him in prison for life
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.360]  i mean they are definitely guilty of being jack booted out of control on american thugs there
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.040]  there is no doubt about that when they charged you with this they showed just how out of control
[48:53.040 --> 49:01.280]  they are yeah i i believe that they uh whenever this came up the the way that it all thankful
[49:01.280 --> 49:08.320]  that took place and and went down it was just a smacks of a clear case of uh retaliation
[49:08.880 --> 49:14.800]  that they did it with intent to to try to to shut me up and and bring me down
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.840]  and so that i couldn't expose their little extortion scheme that they have been running
[49:19.840 --> 49:23.680]  for years well that needs to be looked into by the state police and others i don't know the
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.000]  particulars and and we've talked about some of the backstory but specifically uh tell us about
[49:28.000 --> 49:37.920]  the charges where it's going uh i've recently had a court hearing on august 18th and the uh
[49:37.920 --> 49:45.440]  assistant attorney general came down from chicago illinois to basically defend the constitutionality
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.520]  of this illegal uh eavesdropping statute yeah again this isn't just to stop right
[49:51.520 --> 49:57.120]  to this isn't just some rogue county or city the state and that's why it's happening in 12 states
[49:57.120 --> 50:03.360]  they are pushing this this shows this is organized this isn't some boss hog doing it this is boss hog
[50:03.360 --> 50:09.600]  statewide please continue uh yeah it's the it started out as a boss hog situation where
[50:09.600 --> 50:15.520]  uh these these little towns in these little counties uh in larnes county and crawford county
[50:15.520 --> 50:23.680]  illinois are about as corrupt as you can get and the the difference between chicago and and small
[50:23.680 --> 50:31.360]  town illinois is that uh in chicago there's a lot of corruption but um there's a lot of people that
[50:31.360 --> 50:38.160]  are are charged with the duty of of discovering and prosecuting that corruption and uh in downstate
[50:38.160 --> 50:45.760]  illinois and these little small corrupt towns uh there is no oversight you're you're just at the

[54:25.360 --> 54:32.160]  you woke up in a society where the population let our servants get out of control and now they're
[54:32.160 --> 54:37.680]  treating us like we're prisoners in a super max and the state of illinois is putting their full
[54:37.680 --> 54:46.160]  power behind trying to make sure that michael allison does spend life in prison and you think
[54:46.160 --> 54:52.800]  oh they'll never do that oh they will try and they will be proud of it i'm seeing more and more of
[54:52.800 --> 54:57.680]  this they want the precedent just like they promoted torture in public and said it was an american
[54:57.680 --> 55:03.280]  thing to do just like the tsa sticking their hands down people's pants it's about setting
[55:03.840 --> 55:11.760]  the precedent to do whatever they want this is what tyrants do they want to dominate us now because
[55:11.760 --> 55:16.560]  they're imploding us by design that's coming up the next hour the biggest news i've reported in a
[55:16.560 --> 55:23.120]  long time them mr allison go back to the to the state prosecutor coming down that was on the local
[55:23.120 --> 55:30.720]  news i mean they they're really trying to do this uh go back over that yeah the the way that it
[55:30.720 --> 55:37.760]  started uh i believe that uh they they wanted to keep it contained right here in this town and uh
[55:37.760 --> 55:46.160]  uh just uh deal with it like i said in the boss hall type of situation and uh after i i refuse to
[55:46.160 --> 55:55.200]  uh plead guilty and and uh make the whole thing go away uh i eventually found an attorney who was
[55:55.200 --> 56:01.840]  interested in the issue because he believes that the statute is unconstitutional also and uh well
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.880]  the first circuit court of appeals that's right below the supreme court just ruled it was unconstitutional
[56:06.880 --> 56:15.280]  last week i saw that uh and and i'm i'm glad for the people in the first circuit uh but as far as
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.800]  what i can tell and i'm not an attorney but uh i believe that the first circuit will not be binding
[56:21.360 --> 56:28.880]  on the seventh circuit which is where my case is at uh and uh i don't think that it'll have a
[56:30.160 --> 56:35.360]  direct effect yeah well just to be clear though there's all sorts of local rulings as well this
[56:35.360 --> 56:41.360]  is one of the most well documented things that there's no perception of privacy uh in public uh
[56:41.360 --> 56:46.800]  and and then that's why they can videotape us or audio tape us i mean this is this is ridiculous so
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.840]  so so so where is it going now because you were hinting at the fact that they're not so arrogant
[56:51.840 --> 56:59.920]  now and give us the time frame of when your court case is coming up uh on the 18th of august uh
[56:59.920 --> 57:08.400]  the uh the uh hearing was set for uh pending motions which were uh basically challenging
[57:08.400 --> 57:13.520]  my attorney challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the state uh defending the
[57:13.520 --> 57:20.880]  constitutionality of the statute and uh the at the uh the hearing they argued those motions
[57:21.600 --> 57:27.920]  and at the end of the hearing the judge said that he was going to read and reread the the uh
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.760]  documents that he had available and uh he would let us know uh what his decision is
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.760]  and that's basically a pending motion for a motion to dismiss why would a judge
[57:40.480 --> 57:46.000]  who's got five brain cells in their noggin need to go let me see recording police in public
[57:46.560 --> 57:53.520]  at public places recording prosecutors uh asking for a court reporter being refused one

[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:38.160]  tv with us tonight seven o'clock michael allison the gentleman in southern illinois who faces life
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:46.000]  in prison for audio taping police in public places and telling him he was audio taping him
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.720]  for his own personal true witness uh safety and they've arrested him twice he faces life
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.120]  in prison for it it all began when they started to tow his cars off his own property that he
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.840]  restores they're in the rural area this is happening they're passing zoning laws and
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.960]  showing up on old farmers places and saying get all your old cars out the back i mean it's just
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.160]  total bureaucracy there's no real private property rights in this country we pay daily
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.720]  yearly rent to them to be able to be on our own property uh and then the state is there
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.360]  defending uh the city going after him and uh you were telling me mr allison that you need
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.400]  help with a lawyer i mean what this lawyer's only helped you so far what what do you need
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.720]  another lawyer for uh to counter sue or something yeah i i believe that the the charges will be
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.600]  dismissed or i will i will be victorious in defeating the criminal charges and the attorney
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:50.560]  that i have um he he does criminal uh criminal cases and uh i mean he that's what he he's doing
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:57.360]  right now he's he's helping me with that aspect of the case and uh i i ask him if he would uh
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.040]  help me with the civil case and uh he he has basically said that he cannot do it and uh
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.960]  one of the things i'd like to clear up uh the the patrick fosio from channel two news
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.880]  out of tarot indiana did a real good job of putting this story together and getting the
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.000]  information out there and i really appreciate it and there was one thing that he got wrong on the
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.880]  on the uh story is that uh my attorney is is not that i know of affiliated with the aclu
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.680]  my attorney has taken on this case pro bono and uh because he believes that the statute is unconstitutional
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:44.160]  and he's doing it as a favor to me and another attorney that i had contacted uh asking for help
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.600]  well i've seen this before where the aclu is giving credit for grass growing birds chirping
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:56.800]  um the sun rising but in in my experience the aclu are globalist operatives who basically
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.040]  lose cases on purpose there might be some good ones out there some of their members are good people
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.200]  but they sure don't defend things like the second amendment um this is a very dangerous precedent
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.400]  and it's now it was nine states about six months ago now it's 12 states doing it and it's always
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.360]  by the central state puts the word out start arresting people and they use old wiretapping
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:23.280]  provisions that clearly aren't applicable for me this is really creepy that all over the country
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.400]  they try to put people under the jail for videotape and police i mean i'm seeing cases where a woman
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.360]  videotapes the cops at a traffic stop while they videotape her and they charge her and you know
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.600]  and i've seen them convicted five years in jail and they they go to jail you know i mean i mean
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.640]  and the cops laugh about it i mean we've gone to the point now where we're becoming like north
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.840]  korea where they actually enjoy putting the innocent people in jail with fake trumped up
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.560]  charges and have kangaroo juries if this goes to trial are you are you confident they're not
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:01.120]  going to put their their cousins and brothers and mommies on the jury i believe that if it goes
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:08.960]  that far i should be entitled to a change of venue to get it away from all of the uh we've
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:15.440]  referred to before as the posthole type situation this the small town everybody is connected to
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.640]  everybody yeah but even if they're connected everybody this is sending a man a law abiding

[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:38.800]  mega six banks are not given a quote financial power and union over the once sovereign countries
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:45.360]  of europe the european union was publicly set up to be a receivership yarn to take control
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.680]  of countries implode them and then roll them into a global cashless society private corporate
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:59.440]  government i've been hammering this for 16 years it's in my film in game the general public won't
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:05.600]  look at documents the general public won't look at research but they do remember me talking about
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.440]  this thousands of times and laying out exactly how this would would be done so i'm going to tell
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.480]  you what's going to happen in europe and then i'm going to tell you the next steps after that if we
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.560]  don't stop them and let me give you the bad news we haven't stopped them so i can tell you exactly
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.920]  what's going to happen in a general time frame and of course they're saying they're setting up this
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:34.720]  private global corporate government this they just got this idea yesterday they just got this idea
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.520]  but we told just 16 years ago what they would do from their own public documents they have their
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.160]  public statements but then they have their their corporate statements which aren't highly publicized
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.680]  and i'm going to announce a contest at the bottom of the hour because i don't have the crew
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.680]  or the infrastructure to go through all of the countless radio tv shows i've done where i laid
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.120]  out everything that's happening not just with this but other issues so we're going to have $5,000
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.480]  in prizes because every time i have contests it's about getting the word out four people
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:15.120]  will have three prizes total total prizes will be $5,000 uh and i don't know first place will be
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:24.800]  3,000 second place what 1500 third place 500 how's that sound who put together videos and clips of
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.240]  where i've predicted exactly what was going to happen and i don't do this to go oh look alex
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.680]  jones is right again no no no no no no when i'm covering it i'm reading their quotes their documents
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.960]  where they planned it and then if you really want to win you want to then edit in their statements
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.320]  today where they're saying oh we just got this idea because that's what really wakes up sheeple
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.640]  that's what really really finally gets them to wake up even uh slate and a bunch of other
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.640]  publications have to admit i did predict 9-11 before it happened i did pick the building
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.720]  i did pick who they would say blew it up and that freaks people out that actually gets their attention
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.840]  well there's hundreds of those and it's not that i'm that smart they're following an exact blueprint
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.880]  they've done the same thing in other countries now they're doing it on regional and global bases
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:21.760]  so that's coming up a little bit after the bottom of the hour then i've got all this tsa news huge
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:31.440]  developments i've got uh it's all coming up today it's all coming up today but i want to go to
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:37.120]  mike adams who i don't know moved to austin six eight months ago and only just the last few months
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.280]  is you know now it's day i live in austin i know how it is to be a public figure and want to be left
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:47.200]  want to be left alone and he lives outside austin in the last few days couldn't come on because he
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:55.200]  was battling in uh fires to not burn down his place now he's at ranchers outside where he lives
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:03.040]  in smithville helping them deal with what's happening uh i talked to uh shane steiner this
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.920]  morning of the steiner family on a bunch of ranches around town and uh the the the the
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.760]  fire lines right along the line of their ranch they're they're fighting to keep that off their
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.240]  ranch right now their housing big housing development uh has pretty much knocked out
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:23.600]  most the fires over there thank god only 27 homes burned down um and i got some intel but i may be
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.680]  able to release it later they're still looking at it about what did that over there at steiner ranch
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.480]  but that's interesting uh but joining us is mike adams and and out of the gates this was in the
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:43.520]  gonzalez cannon yesterday and then we called some firefighters and confirmed it um that indeed the
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.680]  feds it took over tuesday though perry said it was wednesday and just like in katrina where they
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.040]  came in and cut communications lines at the police station cut down their radio tower that's cbs news
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:00.640]  just like that happened um fema the headline at info wars dot com they want to take control of the
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:08.400]  situation fema forces firefighters to stand down in texas and they just turned them back and told them
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.520]  no uh we're in command and and and now mike adams has written an article as wall fires rage across
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.400]  texas feds take control and scuttle volunteer firefighters so we've got that report at natural
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.760]  news dot com and info wars dot com and we've got more on that but uh joining us via video skype
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.840]  is mike adams mike thank you for coming on with us hey alex thanks for having me on good to join
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.480]  you today you bet so so tell us what it's been like with you trying to keep your place safe
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.440]  and now you're helping your neighbor you're out uh in the middle of it well my place fortunately
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:43.760]  wasn't really in the in the big uh target zone of the fires so i once i knew my place was safe i
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.560]  headed out i headed out east to smithville where i'm i'm calling you from smithville right now
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.280]  that's why we have a different uh background here maybe even a better connection than usual
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.840]  but uh i i know i have a good friend out in smithville and i've been working with him to protect
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.280]  his ranch uh we were running machinery yesterday bulldozers and excavators and working to create
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.840]  fire breaks and talking with local ranchers and the the word is i mean the the ranchers they were
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.280]  not wanting to evacuate at all they were going to stay there and defend their places and they
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.960]  didn't want the feds to come in and tell them what to do so we had farmers running their tractors
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.600]  plowing in the the grass fields so that the fields wouldn't catch on fire and i can tell
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.520]  you today alex that that some of the firefighting that's been the most effective has been individual
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.840]  ranchers and farmers who just began bulldozing trees and and tearing up fields to make a fire break
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.560]  in fact there there's a whole section of south vastrop and south smithville
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.680]  that is not on fire today because of a particular rancher and i don't have his name
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:55.280]  who who stopped a fire at his front door just yesterday so the the ranchers and the local
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.680]  community is what's solving the problem here the churches have opened their doors and taken in the
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.600]  refugees and and evacuees the ymca is open the public school here has opened up for evacuees
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.320]  and uh now the feds come in and want to take over and the the fear is they're only going to make
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.080]  things worse well mike again you're an eyewitness to this you're you're out there in bass drop
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.680]  you're in smithville and and that's the reports i've gotten as well uh confirmed that firefighters
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.760]  showed up with bulldozers bobcats on the back of uh trailers they showed up with their shovels
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.960]  by the thousands ready to dig fire breaks and the feds told them and this is confirmed now
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:43.760]  now we're not doing fire breaks we're not building earth dams against the fire we're only uh
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.640]  quote squirting water it's a quote if it doesn't squirt water we don't want it but everybody knows
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.240]  i'm not a firefighter and i know with big fires out of control what you do is is is in the direction
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.280]  of the wind you you meet it and try to defeat it at that point you don't run around the edges
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.840]  spraying water on it uh and the fact that they would turn back thousands of people and and say
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.520]  hey we're the feds we don't want you here uh because it's all about their power is just outrageous
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.920]  it is and you got to understand especially for your listeners to set the right context
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.880]  central texas is a place of self-reliance and relying on on your neighbors and your local
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:27.200]  community people here in smithville where i am today they don't rely on the feds and they don't
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:34.080]  call 911 alex if there's trouble they take care of it themselves whether it's burglaries or fires
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.240]  or anything and and so they immediately jumped into action you know if you look at what burned down
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.480]  in austin and west of austin and and now to the east of austin it was mostly the neighborhoods
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.400]  high density housing houses built out of a lot of uh plywood and and not really fire resistant and
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.560]  built in in forests and you know my heart goes out to those people but uh many of those people all
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.720]  they could do was really flee they didn't have the equipment they didn't have the farming know how
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.680]  the practical knowledge that the ranchers have because ranchers have to fight for their livelihoods
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.720]  every single day and so that's what they're doing and and you know the the the feds should just let
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.560]  these people do their jobs and and and protect their farms and get out of the way frankly
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:24.720]  well that's what ron paul has said about these uh different hurricanes i mean fema showed up five
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.520]  and a half years ago it's on record and cut the police communications that's why the cops all
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:37.280]  wandered off uh and then went and cut the lines at the radio tower and uh we've interviewed the
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.680]  sheriff we've interviewed other officials it's been on national news they had to post arm guards
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.040]  around their communications towers just to keep power fema is all about power grabs so they take
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.640]  our national guard away they federalize them what's left is trained to take on veterans and gun owners
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.960]  as a domestic military force and so they take away the the governor's resources the governor
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.400]  then begs for fema to come in fema comes in and says we don't want all these local firefighters
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.040]  and people here trying to help us just go home we're going to fly around with our helicopters
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:15.760]  and dump water on it which is good but uh again uh it's this control freak mentality
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.680]  of totally centralizing control and setting the precedent that we're the boss and so many times
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.480]  when there's a disaster fema rolls in and says hey your house isn't in trouble give me your guns
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.360]  and i just hope they don't start doing that here because if the winds kick back up this stuff's
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.080]  going to accelerate as you know these fires are still out of control everywhere and it's like
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.400]  mordor outside i mean it's black outside with the smoke it was it was very black uh i i posted
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.200]  some photos there lots of photos out there but you know on the firearms issue the very first thing
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.280]  that i did when i was leaving my place to head out east i grabbed my farm rifle threw it in the car
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.320]  and and headed out and i noticed a lot of people are open carrying firearms and it's not a problem
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.880]  there has been no looting there has been no crime there are firearms everywhere people the ranchers
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.640]  have them on their hips people are out here getting the job done protecting property wearing their
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.320]  firearms and there is there are no crime problems whatsoever and i i think it's because everybody
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.800]  knows the ranchers are well armed but they're also upstanding high integrity citizens who are
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.480]  solution oriented so if fema tries to come in and and you know take away firearms uh forget it
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.880]  that's not going to happen in central texas well that's what's beautiful about this farmers and
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:36.000]  ranchers were intimidated into hiding their guns over the years but now the movement to say these
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.760]  are my guns they're not in the closet 1776 is coming out of the closet and it's time for all
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.280]  of us that love liberty to stop being ashamed of it and to stop hiding it we need to get out in the
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:53.840]  open and say hey it's not bad to be into freedom it's not bad to have a lemonade stand it's not
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:58.880]  bad to have a garage sale it's not bad to have a garden it's not bad to protect your own property
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.240]  it's bad to try to stop that what you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40

[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:31.040]  they're smoking hot i'm the fireman but that's my name oh yeah george straight maybe that's not
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.880]  they had a bad one a mile or two down the road that's good country music right there everybody
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:43.760]  walked out and left this woman burning out of control oh well i was down there no matter
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.040]  the hour or so with a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go if he's just tuned in we have an
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:56.240]  image uh that one of our crew photo shop kade put together of lord parry he's got a text tag
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.320]  tattoo on him he's got an illuminati eye tattooed on him he's got uh
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.080]  he's got a garter sills shot injector tattooed on him he's a good globalist why when he told us
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.080]  he was going to save us from the fires everybody went yay of course he also prayed for rain it
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:24.880]  didn't happen i don't think of diablo praise for you it does much good uh let me ask you that question
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.840]  mike adams out there with evil texans that are have their own bulldozers protecting their own
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:36.160]  property uh wearing firearms openly this has got to be upsetting uh the fame of people that are
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.800]  running around turning back firefighters and ordering them not to help uh because you've
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.320]  got to be i guess under the federal uh lari conquista operation uh to be part of it what
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:53.360]  do you think of rick perry it turns out cut the firefighting budget from 30 million down to seven
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.800]  million again i'm not for big government but more and more of our taxes go for big boondoggles
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.520]  8 000 miles of toll roads four shots taxpayer paid for uh millions of dollars in that program but
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.320]  getting rid of firefighters essential things shouldn't perry be saying i want our national
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:16.080]  guard back instead of being all over the world helping grow opium in afghanistan yeah well i'm
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.760]  i'm of the belief alex that if government would just take less from us uh we could solve our own
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.800]  firefighting problems and our own local problems without government interference and without having
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.040]  to apply for fema grants to to reimburse us for the expenses you know you got to look at ranchers
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:39.440]  and farmers out here they have water trucks uh they have bulldozers they have equipment i'm not
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.840]  saying they're all professional firefighters but there are thousands of volunteer firefighters
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.920]  and they have to buy their own equipment in many cases alex so if they had more money that wasn't
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.040]  taken away by the government then obviously they could afford to buy more of their own equipment
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.400]  and be more effective firefighters well in most areas of texas and other rural areas most places
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.960]  don't have a regular fire department it is a volunteer fire department and they go in houses
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.080]  and fight fires and get killed and it's just the same thing as a big city fire department it's just
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.960]  that a lot of times the community pays for the trucks or citizens have to pay for them themselves
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.920]  and go through all the training because they need a fire department and but they're looked down upon
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.280]  by our lords at fema but at the end of the day mic isn't it about the system not wanting to send
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.360]  the message that own guns and protect yourself know your neighbors grow your own food have your own
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.720]  chickens have your own lemonade stands have your own swap meats anything that's independent
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:43.120]  anything that's normal human activity instead of the big corporate big box uh wastelands
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:49.280]  is under attack and that's why they're so angry about the idea of citizen posseys
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:56.240]  militias that idea of civil defense is anathema because the feds want to get rid of state responses
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.840]  they certainly don't want individuals at the county level well yeah the overall tone is one of
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.600]  how dare you be self-reliant how dare you grow your own food or own your own gold or or be able
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:12.320]  to defend your property and your family with with firearms if you're out in the country you know how
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.440]  dare you try to put out your own fires uh how dare you run your own finances or save your own money
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.800]  you got to depend on social security which of course as we know is a complete failure so the
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.840]  the tone of the feds and uh i apologize for the background noise maybe maybe maybe see that has
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.840]  found me and they're gonna try to take something away now but the overall tone is that the feds
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:40.640]  really don't want people to be self-reliant it's a nanny state system they want you to be enslaved
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:46.720]  by the medical system to the agriculture system to the police system they do not want self-reliance
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.680]  at all well that's it and that's why i've read they're actually out in the countryside trying to
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.960]  order people on their own farms and ranches off of it and a lot of the ranchers are just ignoring
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.640]  them those ranchers know a lot more than you know the the sheriff's deputy under FEMA orders to tell
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.280]  you to get off your property and if people die on their own property that's their business this is
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.080]  what freedom is all about at the end of the day the government can't and won't protect you and
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:17.280]  that's been proven yet again most of these fires burning out of control mike adams the health ranger
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.280]  thank you so much for spending time with us thanks for having me on alex great to join you we'll

[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.440]  almost everything there's a few things it just reduces down to almost non detectable levels
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:39.120]  uh and it's the high quality info wars uh is embolst on the bottom eco vessel uh insulated

[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:58.240]  available now at info wars dot com okay let me just stop right there for just a moment because
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:06.480]  i feel like there should be a drum roll i feel like i should have some fireworks go off
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.480]  because i get up here and i chatter and i talk about important issues
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:20.480]  but we're just floating around in a sea of out of control corrupt behavior
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:30.080]  and so i just want to announce this contest right now in detail and then i'll get to the news
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:39.680]  uh i only do obviously uh contest to get the word out i do contest on key issues
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.640]  that i believe are the most important like tsa groping fluoride in the water the deadly vaccines
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:55.360]  when obama and people were talking about having folks arrested that were showing him as the joker
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.920]  saying there was no first amendment i said well we gotta now have everybody post these everywhere
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.680]  to say hey buddy you know you're not gonna get rid of freedom of speech
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:13.840]  but one thing i found that's very effective waking people up is if they can see me going back
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.200]  10 years ago or more five years ago every year whatever the case is and predicting exactly
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:27.360]  what then came true i think that's very effective and we do these contest thousands of people
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.320]  make videos the average video probably gets a couple thousand views some get a hundred thousand
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:41.280]  views so we reach conservatively a million or more people and then five thousand dollars is
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.880]  a good price to pay to reach a million people with the message of liberty
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.680]  and at the end of the day we probably end up getting enough traffic back to the sites to
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.800]  to maybe pay for it uh with our advertisers thank god for them and thank god for you supporting
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:06.720]  them so this morning i burned with frustration because how many of you have heard me explain
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.160]  well i mean i know it's an in game i know i can go watch my two and a half hour seminal film i
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.200]  say seminal because i care i i covered the full spectrum of news and information
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.600]  and i know in that film i explained the european union american union asian union
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.200]  then financially collapse each one of those unions and then offer it the solution a new global
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:39.200]  financial mega union that will be banking and will be digital currency that all of their currencies
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:45.680]  are based in so you've still got yen and yawn and euros and dollars and pesos but they're all
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:54.080]  internationally pegged and their value is decided by this big six bank cartel and that gives them
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.760]  total control now in the last two years we've seen time magazine newsweek all of them promote and
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.520]  it's in my film fall the republic a new bank of the world
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.880]  some even telling listeners in the contest you know where you can find this stuff and that they
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.640]  would push the bank of the world as the solution now they're now calling it a private
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:27.040]  economic union a quote powerful federalism watching seeing it in listening to bloomberg last night
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:34.480]  i was tuning into bloomberg and driving home at 10 o'clock at night and they had five economists
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:41.040]  on the show and they were all reading a script that varied only slightly in fact some of the
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.080]  times it was word for word like they were passing a script around and it went something like this
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.880]  we're going to have a total collapse of everything uh the rich countries have to pay for the poor
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:55.680]  countries this is just the way it is it's reasonable we had a total federal power that's private a
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.000]  financial union in europe and the court ruling is going to allow this uh in germany for them to finance
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.600]  it uh that's just the way it is we need to force people like switzerland into this because you can't
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:13.440]  have any country that's above this in this new system we're setting up this is global federalism
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.240]  and we'll need the same thing here as well uh and and and they just said this is the only path you
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.080]  can take or you'll never get your pension funds you'll never get yourself some security so they
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:27.360]  were there holding everybody hostage and then the talk went into yes it could cause martial law
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:33.120]  yes it could cause breakdown of society yes it's going to cause civil war and this is in the london
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:41.280]  guardian you name it today so the talking point went out and i'm hearing operatives on a international
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.240]  program bloomberg that is openly to shut down us industry and carbon taxes bloomberg heads that
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:51.920]  up with bill clinton openly wants total abolition of gun ownership i mean these are criminal bankers
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.840]  they want your guns they want your property but but again they're little eggheaded old men in
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.080]  little suits so everybody expects it to be a headler in us in a uniform or a Stalin in a uniform
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.560]  you know with the 1940s mustache that isn't how this works these are finance oligarch these are
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:18.800]  burning made-offs kin lays with an army and with media systems they own they got propaganda which
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.320]  is 90 percent of warfare psychological warfare they got physical operatives they got private
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.880]  corporate spies they've got their minions that work for them in control of every regulatory
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:35.520]  position in the big six banks in government they run the national security council they put the
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.560]  president and the last president in power and they own all the major candidates on the republican
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:50.800]  side except ron paul so so they mean business they mean business now the good news is 10 years ago
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.800]  these bankers would go before congress and everyone groveled and their voices would shake
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:00.960]  when when when when committee chairman talked to them and they were they hyped the arrogant
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.680]  behaving as if they were god now they're ridiculed now they're attacked now we're learning they're
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:13.760]  not invincible that's why they try to keep the con artists confidence face up there but it is us or
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:21.920]  them that's why i'm saying five thousand dollars three thousand the first place 1500 the second
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.640]  place 500 the third place fourth place gets some steak knives fifth place you're fired all right a
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:36.080]  joke from a movie one of my favorite movies alex balvin's in and mr lemon was it glen larry glenn
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:43.760]  ross i forget the exact name i need to rent that movie or buy it but the point here is that
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:56.480]  we are seeing a open financial dictatorship that's what globalism is that's why for 50 years
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:01.600]  they've had tax incentives to move jobs out of europe jobs out of america jobs out of canada the
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.880]  third world it was not to build up the third world it was to get them financially under the
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.360]  globalist control in the name of development which was actually the opposite of development
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.680]  a globalist takeover and that's in their own imf world bank documents out for nine years
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.920]  leaked to the bbc joseph sticklets who worked at the world bank double prize winner
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:32.000]  and this is a premeditated plan and i'm here watching it with horror and here's a microcosm
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.280]  example and and and again the contest just isn't about this though you'd probably do well to do
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.600]  a video about this because i mean thousands of times i've laid out what i just repeated
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.720]  might as well just have a recording i had the point is it's now here
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:50.720]  and and do you know what comes next i mean i'm gonna tell you that
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.200]  here in a moment i mean if they get away with this i'm gonna tell you what comes next
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.160]  and then what comes after that oh my god i mean this is not a road we want to go down
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.280]  this is not a road we want to go down these people have written up what they're gonna do to us
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.920]  even their public statements are only thinly veiled and it's so horrific
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:18.480]  and it's so ridiculously corrupt that if we just get the word out they will fall
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.800]  if we just get mainline talk show hosts to decide that hey maybe it's not best to go along with the
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  new world order maybe look at your children i mean even the most arrogant think you're part of
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.720]  the establishment rush limbaugh making you know 80 million dollars a year bubba you can only get
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.960]  so much money and hang out with so many fake plastic people at the golf course and so many
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.400]  executives i mean this is treason against humanity the globalists aren't just consolidators and
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:53.520]  conquerors there have been a lot of conquerors who were people who wanted to build things
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.400]  and who were into creating and and you can rationalize those conquerors of history
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:07.360]  who actually built some civilizations the globalist are a scientific conqueror who
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:14.720]  seek to pull down everything independent and strong it is a creeping death you don't sell
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.920]  out to cancer you don't sell out to for all intents and purposes you know let's say you
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:24.160]  don't believe in god let's play devil's advocate god doesn't exist you might as well be the devil
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:32.880]  these people are so diabolical so hateful so manipulative so multivariate multifaceted interwoven
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.880]  interlockered that might as well be the devil these people are beyond the devil well the devil's
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:45.920]  beyond what you thought he was evil spirit in the universe whatever people who like to destroy
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:51.680]  versus those that like to build you know i always thought everybody likes seeing other
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.480]  people do good i always thought everybody was i see a guy with an incredibly beautiful girlfriend
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.680]  or wife i'm like man she is just absolutely gorgeous in life wonderful look at those shining eyes
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.360]  look at the poise of that woman look at the grace man i admire that woman i'm not even
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:12.000]  thinking about her sexually i was 16 or 17 i would have been i was 20 i would have been now
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.560]  i just admire the grace but i was never even jealous then the guys that had girlfriends
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.760]  better looking than you know my girlfriend i usually had smoking girlfriends a lot of times
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.680]  it was just personality i like a woman's personality over even what her supposed looks are
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:31.680]  but the two go together when they got both it's a great thing i just admire people that know how
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.400]  to restore a car until it's just absolutely immaculate and beautiful or people that know how
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:41.200]  to garden well or people that know how to do fine woodwork or people that have made a lot of money
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:47.840]  and built a beautiful house or or or people that have better bodies than i do and i've learned now
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:55.200]  i am not the minority but i'm part one part of humanity and then there are those who get upset
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.040]  i was the kid who was always giving my toys away to other kids not because i want them to be my
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:06.880]  friend i i like to have people over and cook them dinner i like to give people things and i learned
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:14.560]  that's not how a lot of people are they're from the other side they're from the other side and they
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.880]  they don't like people knowing how things work they like knowing how things work and keeping
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  it from people they're the types that like to put their foot out and trip somebody
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:33.680]  and i instinctively see them i know what they are and i want to defeat them and to defeat them i
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.680]  need you who are good to get up on your hind legs and wake up and get angry and identify these people
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.480]  with me and help wake up others or we don't have any chance at a civilization because these people
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.000]  like cancer will not stop they will race through the system pulling everything down until they're
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:01.360]  sitting on a pile of of garbage praising their power they have no honor they have no beauty
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:04.880]  nothing is good that comes out of these people death destruction
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.560]  horribleness now i haven't even gotten to the top news yet it's it's a prelude to it
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.760]  but the issue here is we have a global government
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:23.120]  it is a corporate government that operates by increments they've studied human psychology they
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:28.960]  know you're built to face a threat that comes on quick so they hide it in the water they hide it in
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.840]  the gmo they hide it in the fine print of the mortgage they hide it in the fine print at the
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:40.480]  contract at school they hide it in the fine print they they they they lawyer everything but to boil
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:46.560]  it down they created a giant Ponzi scheme they got near total control at a fractional reserve
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.880]  banking for every dollar they could loan out 10 that wasn't enough 12 years ago they said we can
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:55.520]  loan out a trillion for every dollar that's derivatives they took over the planet with that
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:01.840]  unlimited money people would sell their souls for something fraudsters made out of nothing see
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  once you have the power of the Ponzi you don't go to jail you take over the world and these
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.400]  aren't Ponzi's that just want wealth they've had so much power for hundreds of years in Europe
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:20.000]  now over the US the last 90 or so that they're into literally ending humanity as you know it
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.760]  in fact guys get that 1984 clip ready that I sent you a human a boot stomping on the human face
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.720]  forever a clip from the movie I know it's low audio see if it's high enough to play
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:35.040]  so I think that says it all and of course George R. Will worked for the system he worked for the
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:40.240]  imperial government then for the communist then for the BBC and propaganda and he wrote a book
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:47.120]  and he said before he died this is what they plan to do and and O'Brien explains that it's about
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.960]  dominating it's about destroying things it's about trampling and being trampled it's about

[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:41.280]  liars to be able to operate with impunity against the general population all the compartmentalized
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:46.160]  idiots themselves are basically tested upon all right let me start getting into this and then
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.120]  i'll give the number out and take your calls and get into some of the other issues
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:58.000]  it is illegal it's been in the news for germany to continue to have to bail out other EU nations
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.800]  that's how they got countries into the EU saying don't worry you won't have to bail out other
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.960]  countries but if you go back just a year ago ireland was per capita the fastest growing
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:16.320]  and least in debt country and as soon as they enter the euro six months later suddenly it was
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.800]  all over they were bankrupt well that's because their minister had them in a contract now and
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:25.920]  signed them on to the foreign debt that 90 plus percent was not theirs just like in iceland just
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:34.000]  like in Greece so see it it's such a huge hoax the banksters say our derivatives are in trouble
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.680]  you've invested your social security shine on to all of our debt and then they tell the public
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.360]  you owe it you're bad we're going to cut everything now and raise your taxes and they've now raised
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.480]  taxes something like 20 percent in Greece on restaurants everything and people are rebelling
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:57.360]  and not paying it and it literally goes offshore to bankers who created the debt but see they know
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:02.880]  you're not paying attention you know about dancing with the stars and a sex change operation
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:08.720]  so they're just laughing at you they're going to run you over this is financial Armageddon
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:13.040]  we're not being conquered by nice folks that want to take good care of us we're being caught
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.120]  being taken over by some very wicked people so after two bailouts in europe they're now saying
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.120]  oh we're going to have another Bear Stearns Lehman brothers we're going to implode
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.720]  we're going to have martial law and we've got all the articles up on info wars.com and prison
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:33.840]  body.com with the big bank head saying this today this is on drudge report today sounds like Alex
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.320]  Jones five years ago it's now becoming mainline but drudge is the only one that will actually
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.000]  point to what's happening in europe most americans don't even know this is happening right now
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:50.480]  and it openly says yes we're going to have a new federal government that's private a financial
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:57.360]  union run by mega banks that you'll pay your vat and carbon taxes too again paying mega bankers
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:01.760]  the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the queen of england that's who owns these mega private banks
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.040]  our fellow reserve the european union banks they're going to issue bonds that the government is
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.120]  going to buy even if you don't buy the bonds the government's going to buy it with your tax money
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:18.400]  and the profit goes to the bankers so you pay the bankers because they're too big to fail see
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.560]  they make money on the front end of the Ponzi scheme and then take over on the other end
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.120]  holding you hostage and then of course that won't pay it off and so the next phase
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.840]  will be oh my gosh we've had all these currency wars the last decade you know 2014 or so
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.520]  now we've got to merge the american union with the european union to the asian union
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:43.600]  and this new body will globally standardize it and they're already announcing that and already
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:49.200]  beta testing the str so that's already going on but see it's now just going to be brought out in the
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:55.360]  open and then george sorrell says oh i'm having a great crisis he's saying similar things again
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:00.880]  of course they're having great crises they're taking over because they took time to get their
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:06.720]  operatives into office everywhere they finance all the campaigns of the countries in latin america
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:12.320]  in most the countries in africa asia and if you don't let them they go look you get you get the
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.920]  money or you get the gun they send in operatives and they it's on record and they say listen we're
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.560]  either going to bankroll you to sell out your country we're going to kill you most people say
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.560]  well i'll take the bankroll how big's my palace in switzerland i just got to sell folks out over

[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:16.240]  in their own words we cover an in-game and other films once it's in place then they start
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.560]  turning the resources off even faster they've now gotten to that point trying to turn off
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.560]  power plants here and shutting down competition and going after any type of self-sufficient
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:33.520]  activity i've got an article today where under agenda 21 and this is put out by the big cattle
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:41.280]  association rcaf you can't make this up epa declares hey a pollutant in effort to antagonize
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:46.800]  small and mid-sized us cattle feeders and uh yeah no that's part of agenda 21 and the new rural
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.800]  council that obama set up who needs governors or local elected people you got the new homeland
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:59.840]  security uh pentagon run oh the pentagon's your friend the military yeah and your local area
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.640]  they help with the fires but also they're trying to turn them into spies
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.200]  so you got bad people in control the military it's not the military's bad it's bad people are in
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:18.960]  control and they're saying any dust from plowing any dust from hay any dust period is a pollutant
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:27.040]  and you're going to be shut down but then if you're big agra you're exempt so uh during
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.640]  his presentation on the status of the nation's new country of origin labeling or cool law oh it's
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:41.360]  cool like the patriot act so patriotic and on behalf of the rcaf us cool committee rcaf usa
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:49.680]  member in kansas cattle feeder mike callacrate was asked a non-cool question that set conversation
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:56.800]  goers on their heels during the 12th annual rcaf us convention held august 26 27th rapid city south
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:02.800]  dakota and then it goes on to say has the environmental protection agency declared hey a
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:07.680]  pollutant not its member s callacrate responded affirmatively and explained that the environmental
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:13.120]  protection agency recently initiated a formal enforcement action against his kansas feedlot
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:19.760]  for among other things failure to store his hay in a pollution containment zone that's right grass
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:26.240]  is now a pollution now that the epa has declared hey a pollutant every farmer and rancher that
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:33.200]  stores hay or that leaves a broken hay bale in a field is potentially violating epa rules and
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:38.720]  suggest an epa enforcement action callacrate said how far are we going to let this agency go
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.400]  before we stand up and do something about it and i'm going to try to get we're kind of filled up
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:48.240]  with guests already on the nightly news this week but i want to get um the rcaf folks or mr
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:55.200]  callacrate uh on the show because uh i've actually seen this a year ago under the new epa rules it's
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:02.240]  not a law uh they say any dust from plowing thousand dollar fines per piece of dust i mean just
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.360]  they they videotape you did dust you're going to jail i mean it's it could be criminal if you

[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:48.480]  control over of whatever sovereignty they've got left of their individual nation states and the
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:54.160]  EU itself that's already very dictatorial where the bureaucracy has more power than the elected people
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.040]  you've got to turn all that power over to a private economic union a consortium of private
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.800]  banks who you will now pay your taxes directly to or there will be a total collapse of everything
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:12.080]  oh i thought all the other bailouts of the bankers when the lion's share of the debt is theirs
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.920]  we're going to fix it literally handing everything over to the bankers now here in the us they've
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:26.560]  passed the super congress where now spending and cutting bills do not come out of individual house
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:33.920]  members as is the constitution and federal law totally unconstitutional now a 12 member board
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:41.840]  with the president is the 13th tiebreaker they create the spending bills and if congress doesn't
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:47.360]  pass what they give them it reverts back to the committee so it's saying you can order whatever
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:54.400]  you want off the menu but if you don't order what i tell you to order then i i i feed you what i want
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:10:00.080]  yeah there's 20 things on the menu but i say you get uh the tuna sandwich you've got a choice you
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:05.040]  can have the tuna sandwich well that's not a choice at all shut up conspiracy theorist i mean
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:11.920]  we're living in the twilight zone and because this is just a little bit complex about as complex as
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:18.720]  tying your shoelaces it's not oh that's that finance stuff and that's what those bankers do
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:24.960]  they're old men with suits i'm sure they're running things oh but the federal reserve secret and they
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:29.760]  say that they're above the law well let them be secret and run things i'm sure they want to abuse
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:33.920]  us oh no they just created over a thousand trillion in fake derivatives and took over
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.120]  so america the united states is already under this system
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.280]  they'll reserve running the monetary situation congress more and more having the power of the
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:48.560]  purse officially taken away they've advocated and handed over their authority a long time ago
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:53.440]  but now they're trying to officially take away the power of the purse the power to make war
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.880]  the the state tent the amendment power same year they gave us the private fellow reserve and the
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:06.800]  income tax to fund it 1913 they got rid of the senators being elected by the legislature
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.720]  the legislatures ran things your state rep could get that u.s. center on the line and say i'ma start
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:19.840]  to move to you know davie crocket got recalled when he was in the congress by the state they used to
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:28.240]  you didn't do exactly as we told you get down here boy get down here davie crocket you didn't do exactly
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:39.440]  you didn't do exactly as tennessee told you mister he's all right i'll just go to texas start my own
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:46.720]  country but imagine what we've turned into and now the feds get on tv there's no states rights
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:52.000]  whatsoever the federal government can do whatever it likes on any issue the public's like oh okay
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:59.040]  we don't need congress anymore for war or spending bills oh okay he sets up and by the way we're
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:06.320]  going to have a now a new financial private union and you'll pay your taxes to it and then see
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.240]  then they'll implode that even more and like oh there's a new crisis we've got a merge with the
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:16.000]  us and asia under this private cartel and then they'll turn the economy on for a couple more years
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.720]  and then hope another problem we just got this new idea hope you've got to pay all these new
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:26.720]  taxes to fix it and by the way they're under the austerity taxes in ireland in greece they go
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:33.760]  from boom economies overnight to being in just abject poverty pension funds gone huge new taxes

[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.560]  and then it actually coming through exactly as i've said that tends to even get the dumbest
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:38.000]  people's attention because again they're not really dumb they want to be dumb they think they're
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  getting away with something not caring about the world or being informed or being involved

[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.680]  when you listen to the engine of mornin' out his one old song
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:33.440]  you think about the woman the girl you knew the night before
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:38.320]  all right i'm gonna go to your phone calls
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  i just want to really impress this upon everybody when you tune in to bloomberg
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:52.720]  and you hear five economists in 35 minutes that's how long i listened last night driving home
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:59.600]  all read the exact same script and say it's very reasonable we're gonna have a private financial
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:06.080]  system that runs europe a financial federal union and yes it's going to be private and
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:11.040]  you'll pay your taxes to them and they know how to manage things very good these governments
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:15.760]  have been bad and we're and it's the banks that engineered all this it's the banks that put people
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:21.200]  in over the governments and they're announcing they're basically going to take most the money
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:25.840]  from the german people because that's the most wealthy country there to give to the banks and
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.560]  they lie and say it's for the quote poor countries and then you know it's going to lead to an even
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:35.520]  greater collapse a few years after which they'll then stand up and say now we're going to save you
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:43.200]  again and they have this army of guys in suits on radio and tv sitting there saying chief chief
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  operating analyst at blah blah says this oh it's absolutely imperative that they create the new super
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:55.360]  union to be privately run as an economic union for part of global governance an excellent system
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.520]  you know let's cut to this person and then and they're saying global governance this global
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:08.800]  governance that i mean that's all over the news today and and again i i see people attacking
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.600]  me on the internet saying i'm making this stuff up i think a lot of must be paid or something but
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:19.920]  we're being financially taken over by scam artist and it's only going to get worse and
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.280]  bernack you say i'm not worried about the problem in europe we're not connected to that it turns
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.440]  out most of the bailout money went to foreign banks because it's foreign banks that own america
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:39.760]  through fraud it's fraudulent it's a scam but to carry out the really big frauds they get control
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:45.360]  of governments they get away with it and the german court is ruled even though it's against the law
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:51.440]  under e rules that they're going to basically put these private people in charge in the euro zone
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:57.440]  banking fear feeds on itself oh see it's fear and the bankers are like if you're just reasonable
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.880]  and set up the new system and pay us the money things are financially bad because there's fear
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.280]  that you're not going to pay the new bailout you know they've engineered the collapse and then
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:14.320]  up it's your fault for not paying us trillions more and then people hear thousands of paid
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:19.760]  pundits parroting the same thing literally repeating the same thing over and over again
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:25.920]  like an endless parade of parents you know when you tune into the nightly news it's the same story
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:31.600]  in the same order with the same sponsors on every network it's a script boys and girls
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:38.000]  they admit the white house puts out talking points and see this is talking point free
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:44.480]  this is teleprompter free this is real here it is europe inching towards financial union
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:48.800]  city mourning herald they're not inching the unresolved debt crisis is forcing change
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.280]  oh yes it's forcing change more of the same more power for the globalist here it is ubs euro
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.800]  collapse could lead to martial law in a similar vein to how hank paulson we'll give you a document
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.360]  cam shot of this if we can in a similar vein to how hank paulson threatened martial law
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:10.800]  on the streets of america if the bailout failed to pass top banks like ubs are now warning of
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:16.560]  authoritarian or military government and civil war in a bid to frighten away member states from
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:22.240]  leaving the euro it's a transparent ploy designed to create the pretext for empowering the eu to
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:27.600]  enforce a common economic policy across all member states something that british prime minister
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:33.840]  david cameron is now openly backing in a ubs investment research release the swiss bank
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:39.680]  warns that should member states begin to uh desert the euro participating collapse
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:47.680]  of the single currency some form of authoritarian or military government or civil war would likely
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:54.240]  ensue oh there's going to be an authoritarian government if you don't let the bankers establish
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.320]  an authoritarian government because they've screwed things up so much you've got to again
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:05.680]  live with the cancer just cutting it out would kill you but the cancer keeps growing and then
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:14.480]  it's got the ubs investment research release from the top swiss bank warning of civil war
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:21.200]  economic collapse total collapse of global system that's the top swiss bank one of the most
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:26.400]  powerful in the world and it's got all the incredible quotes about troops on the streets
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:34.560]  marshal law how long ago folks when they got rid of glass steagle the rand corporation others said
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:41.680]  it was for this see see this isn't some problem this is all engineered they've learned that if they
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:46.080]  just take part of your paycheck part of your pension and then say okay we're gonna take part
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:52.720]  but keep the rest safe next year take part keep the rest safe we're on the march the empires on
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:30:04.720]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in

[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:29.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:34.320]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.880]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:33.360]  all right i'm gonna try to shut up now it's it's just i'm marveling that i've
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:39.440]  we've been absolutely accurate about what the globalists would do because they said what they
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:46.160]  would do but then it's it's amazing that we were so accurate and it's amazing that they're getting
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:52.960]  away with it and it's amazing to know what comes after this i mean these people goldman sacks jp
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:34:02.320]  morgan bank of england bank of america they all wells fargo all openly are the financiers of the
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:09.840]  carbon taxes the one child policies i mean these are brutal nasty anti-human control freaks
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:17.520]  and they're criminals i mean these big banks have all been caught taking houses they never had a deed
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:23.040]  to that are 100 paid for and the courts just give it to them you don't believe me just type bank of
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:28.000]  america took houses that were paid for they didn't know you'll get seen in and they go is it reasonable
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:34.080]  they take houses they don't know well maybe they need to because you know they're i mean that's the
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:39.600]  thing these people aren't going to pop up like dictators from 1940s they're not going to look
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:44.720]  like fidel Castro and you go there's the dictator they just creep around there are little brief cases
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:51.360]  and and and and have all this you know complex gibberish that once you've studied it is just that
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:59.920]  pure unmitigated diarrhea of the mouth meant to confuse you there are a bunch of finance
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:05.680]  oligarchs with an army of lawyers and high tech pr campaigns to sit there and confuse everybody
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.160]  and listen it's real simple these scam artists have bought off the politicians and created
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:15.360]  giant debts that they bought the world with and then handed us at the end of the day saying it was
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:21.440]  our debt and we now serve them as slaves i don't owe them anything i don't want to be domesticated
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:26.080]  by them i don't the feds are federalizing everything they've announced they're going to put
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:35.600]  MRI power feet scanners in don't worry don't take your shoes off do you have any idea in fact i'll
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:41.440]  have an article out later today or tomorrow i don't know watson's a workhorse a true trojan when it
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:54.640]  comes to busting his back uh but um some are the other writers do you understand they're not exempt
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:02.080]  from radiology rules they just don't care and do it and it's all on purpose my god those idiot tsa
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.640]  workers i knew it would come out they were dying of cancer and it turns out where they've had the
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:12.240]  scanners for close to eight years most of them are getting cancer and they've proven it's from
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:17.440]  the scanners of course it is you got two different types of microwave ovens you're basically living
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:23.600]  in eight hours a day i mean what does that say about the elite that they know full well that it's
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:28.400]  a death sentence to everybody that works in tsa and they just do it they know full well it's a death
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:33.760]  sentence to the troops that use du they just do it they know full well and they just
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:46.800]  good people have a blind spot to evil and when it's big and bold and wild we got a blind spot you
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:54.080]  can drive the titanic through and man i see these people i see them getting away with it and i'm
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:59.680]  just like when is it and you can't even hate the tsa goons that you know want the job for money
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:05.760]  you're a petty power trip and they they typecast and generally hire a certain type of wimpy pot
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:09.920]  bellied type you know who looks like pat from saturday night live you can't tell them it's a male
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:15.760]  or female and i care about these people i want to lift them up they'd make good little farmers or
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:19.760]  good little artisans or whatever you know they they were just giving something other than tv growing
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:24.240]  up but instead they want a petty power trip like the woman they were stripping down the man they
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:29.040]  pulled his pants down and were asking about his his cloths me bag and yelling at him and he said

[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:31.600]  what freaked me out you know i did this slate magazine interview and he and you know i i don't
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:35.200]  do a lot of these 9-11 interviews because it would take all my time up and i didn't do one for a big
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:40.800]  author of the the national posts and i i say no to a lot of these and he's written like a three-part
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.840]  series already and i did scan over most of the parts last night and it was every cliche about
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:52.000]  conspiracy theorist and i knew the articles would end with 9-11 truth is declining and dying i told
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:57.600]  him i said that when he called i said the latest talking point is 9-11 truth is dying and declining
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.000]  he's like well how did you know that yeah that's this is what of course that's what your editor
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:09.520]  told you to write about dumb bunny you don't get the talking point little man your bosses do
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.960]  do i know this talking points because i've already had a bunch of them call i know what the talking
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:21.600]  point is i just i mean it's talking points i live in a world where a bunch of scum hand down
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:26.240]  talking points and then these mercenaries i mean who knows this guy i bet got paid two three
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:32.320]  thousand dollars to write this five-part series three parts are out with every cliche every i mean
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:38.560]  i mean a lobotomized chimpanzee could have written it and and i gave him historical proof
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:46.480]  total evidence facts and none of it's in there it's just every cliche every every joke every piece
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:53.040]  of garbage and oh i'm not the founder of the 9-11 truth movement david ray griffin is who went
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:40:03.120]  public in 2003 i could care less who the father of the 9-11 truth movement is people ask who started
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:12.080]  it everybody knows i obsess on false flag terror i've been covering that since 1996 i got on air
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:19.040]  in late 95 to expose government sponsored terror oklahoma city that's what i and i don't care
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.400]  that i was obsessing on it and then some other ufo type host few months for 9-11 started getting
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:28.000]  out of that and covering when i was covering because they saw it was popular great good
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:34.400]  more the merrier let's defeat the globalist but the point is i'm the guy okay i don't talk about
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:41.200]  holograms and and and and and video tapes of jesus being sacrificed and floating submarines
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:47.440]  and i don't talk about all that stuff fine talk about if you want to the issue is i went on air
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:50.400]  i said call the white house they're gonna blow up the world trade center and blame it on bin
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:54.960]  laudan i and and the guy kept saying you're not the founder on the phone i was like well i don't
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:02.320]  really care but if you're asking who the progenitor is it's me i mean if you want to ask you know uh
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:09.520]  right brothers kitty hawk you know you could you can say that you know the first aircraft came out
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:16.320]  in 2011 okay i mean i i guess so but it says alex jones is not the grandfather 9-11 truth
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:21.600]  movement that's david ray griffin in 2003 and it's all about false reality well i mean wait a minute
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:27.680]  i'm not the founder of the grandfather 9-11 truth movement a guy that came out two years
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:39.440]  after i did is okay all righty then mm-hmm see that'd be like saying elvis well he's not even as big
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.400]  as elvis the 9-11 truth but the way the media looks at it is like celebrities i don't look at it
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  like that but that's the way the article's written or or one of the three articles again two more
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:55.760]  coming out is it was written where it basically says alex claims he's elvis but david ray griffin
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.080]  is elvis well griffin came so late he'd be more like in the history of rock and roll
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:14.080]  uh maybe uh metallica or something you know 1989 1987 i mean i would be
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:20.800]  little richard who you could say was one of the founders of rock and roll
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:29.440]  see i in 9-11 i would be little richard and not elvis see so basically they're saying i'm the king
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:37.360]  of 9-11 truth no i'm not elvis i'm the little richard of 9-11 truth see i come first understand
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:44.480]  that not david ray griffin who's metallica see rock and roll didn't start in 1987 started
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:51.600]  back in the 40s elvis became the king by popularizing it but again i don't even get into this or
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:43:00.960]  talk about it it's like the article obsesses over this oh my gosh and and and okay i said i'd take
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:15.520]  calls oh boy and and and listen i want to quantify 9-11 truth down to something very simple for all
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:20.320]  of you that are emotionally invested in the fairy tale you've been told it's been proven to be a lie
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:24.560]  the official story if you go research it even six of the ten commissures have said is a fairy tale
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:30.080]  is a criminal line okay let's just start there and let's finish with this just to hope you look
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:35.040]  into it with an open mind you've seen now even Chuck Norris saying why is our government putting
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:39.760]  al-qaeda in in libya why are they protecting amour al-alaki what's he doing at the pentagon
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.680]  there now you're starting to come into reality they think you're so dumb they've got al-qaeda running
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:54.560]  all around on us government payment right now the elephant in the room the whale in the room
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:44:02.560]  wake up okay just start there why well okay bin laden was admitted cia that's admitted let
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:09.040]  let's start there don't say it's crazy to say we should investigate this and ridiculous and
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:13.920]  preposterous when the cops will have an investigation of a hit-and-run action and on the highway with
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:19.680]  20 cops out there investigating it don't say oh it's crazy to look into this when governments
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:26.080]  have done stuff like this including ours over and over again but let's just end it with this it
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:32.800]  isn't our government that did 9-11 the government is compartmentalized like a labyrinth out of out
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:49.120]  of einstein's mind it is a labyrinthine system it is corporate shadow networks when you study it
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:58.080]  deeply that ran the attacks the same groups openly financing al-qaeda today bottom line the hijackers
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:03.200]  were given passports to come back into the us and protect it that's come out they were at bases
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:10.960]  they were living in houses paid for by the fbi this is all mainstream news and never in not one of
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:18.000]  these hit pieces will they ever address any of our questions they go through the same laundry list of
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:26.480]  disinformation and so understand this is real look at all the other criminal activities the
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:31.520]  government's involved in the gun running to mexico to blame the second amendment these people are
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.800]  dangerous it's not fun to go up against them but we have no future if we don't okay everybody i
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:43.440]  appreciate you're holding eric in missouri you're on the air thanks for holding hi alex thank you for
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.320]  taking my call first i would like to like to thank you for warming up the audience on the whole 9-11
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:55.360]  truth thing i want to tell you i'm 19 years old and i am studying firefighting in school now the
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:04.400]  other day they told us they told us that steel melt at a thousand degrees they told us that steel
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:10.720]  melt at a thousand degrees and structures that are made out of steel will become unstable at a
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:15.520]  thousand degrees let me stop you let me stop you in all the firefighting books and the underwriting
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:20.560]  laboratories this has come out in the last five years they're changing insurance now for buildings
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:25.280]  to collapse never happened but three times on that day big fires all the time last for weeks
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:31.920]  nothing collapses uh they're now changing it and yes saying buildings will melt at a thousand degrees
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:38.960]  our world will fall down the big modern steel buildings and uh it's changing all of engineering
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:43.920]  see they're having to go with these fake physics so yes it's changing everything sorry go ahead
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:53.120]  yes um it it it absolutely infuriated me and the moment that he said that i my fists were clenching
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:57.920]  i was sweating well once you do is you bring in the old manuals and old textbooks and say when
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.760]  did this change but you know do they now say a big lighter will burn down uh the most powerfully
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:08.720]  built building that previously wouldn't fall i mean i mean now of course none of them have fallen
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:14.400]  sense but it's just the false reality i know we have to now believe whatever we're told i'm sorry go
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:19.920]  ahead and the thing is that it doesn't only just change the science of it the job of a fireman
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:26.000]  is to protect lives and property so say we got a skyscraper that's on fire and it's real bad and
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.840]  there there's say um say there's propane or something in one of the kitchens and it blows
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:35.600]  up and thumbs here up to a thousand degrees that means that the structure is unstable and the guys
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:41.360]  in charge of incident command will get everybody out all the firefighters will call them on a retreat
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:46.000]  and we will ignore the damage on the property and we will ignore the lives in the building
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:53.600]  because of the 1000 degree uh law and that is actually in the nspa 1500 the national fire
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:59.600]  protection agency no i know they've announced the insurance has gone up because uh before they said
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.560]  steel didn't start weakening and getting more pliable till 2000 didn't start melting even with
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:10.080]  a lower quality steel till around 3000 or more but magically now that i know they say a thousand
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:15.920]  degrees buildings will fall just free fall perfectly with with with last points coming out the sides
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:21.280]  uh huh just want to inform you on the disinformation they're teaching firefighters now well i mean
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.480]  but i mean wait a minute uh a gas powered grill can get up to a thousand so i guess it's all gonna
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.480]  collapse the whole thing free fall because you have a little fire at the top the whole thing's
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:38.240]  just gonna fall on the ground yes you know what about in a fireplace the metal grade is it gonna
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:42.960]  because you know the fire is only one spot is the whole fireplace going to collapse down to
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  obviously not but they but so they've told you there's a new law see that'd be like if they
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:55.520]  said planes could only fly 100 miles an hour now you know the you know there's a new magic barrier
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.280]  people would say well planes never flew past 100 miles an hour government said so
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:05.840]  well i i just got to say thank god for people like you and david ray griffin and the firefighters
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:15.280]  for 911sfreeth.org did anybody else uh did anybody else uh there at the event um
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:20.000]  did anybody else come out and uh
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:25.520]  you know get concerned or everybody said oh a thousand degrees buildings fall i mean do they
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:30.240]  all buy it like oh okay they all just highlighted it in the books and just took the notes and just
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:35.600]  moved on but i was sitting there and i was thinking all of these things all the lectures
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:41.440]  that are on youtube of david ray griffin explaining and breaking it down it was all
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:48.960]  going through my mind and i wanted to say something but he's my instructor and um i you know if i
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:53.760]  say something like 911 truth or 911 was an inside job or what happened to building seven
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:50:01.680]  that would be a real real big red flag and it was just it was just a mess

[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:28.720]  banks so we um i can't i think that the teachers actually put us put us up to this but we supplied
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:33.680]  all the other countries with their money so we actually had to like print it out and um

[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:45.200]  to do that uh the listing of hay as an evil wicked toxic waste to grass to harass the farmers and
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:52.320]  ranchers we're told al-qaeda's striking again in iraq but they're good in in libya uh also the
[03:00:52.320 --> 03:00:59.600]  united states has fallen to fifth place msnbc is showing in global competitiveness survey shows
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:03.840]  well that's what all the regulations and taxes are about there's a big new study out where they
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:10.160]  admit that higher taxes destroys the tax base and productivity that's the plan by the monopoly man
[03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:17.360]  man but but but listen real quick you were you were uh being switzerland in class the the caller was
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:23.680]  uh calling from california and then it ended up where um switzerland was at a certain point
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:29.440]  actually switzerland doesn't print the money they're into the real uh currency uh but go ahead
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:34.240]  and make a point yeah but the point was all you know people people would come to the fair to buy
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:38.960]  stuff but first they had to come to us to get the the money from the other countries so we ended
[03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:45.040]  making like 20 off of everybody but my point is that um we didn't feel like we were in a position
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:49.120]  of i mean i didn't feel like i was in a position of strength when we told all the other all the
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:53.200]  other students what we were going to do we were basically an enslave all of them you know we're
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:57.040]  going to get a percentage off of everybody yeah but you didn't do that no no you you just never
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:01.120]  discuss it and you wouldn't tell them anything you would just say this is where the money comes
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:05.200]  from and you would with all the money and the advantage you had you would then buy off the
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:09.680]  politicians of the next country and then take them over and say now you're going to pay us taxes to
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:14.880]  breathe and and this is a good thing it's not slavery and and al gore invented the sun and
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.120]  the moon and the internet and you and then you will start worshiping him as your high priest
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:24.480]  they actually say they want to make it a religion with environmental priest who teach you gmo is good
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:31.040]  and and the family is bad but paper bags are evil it's all a control freak system i i appreciate

[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:44.640]  hi um my story is actually about the psa oh the great leaders um yes tell me about them
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:52.400]  before i uh tell it i'd like to point out that i'm 17 i'm still under age um so i was in the
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:58.000]  airport in emerald colorado with my family a few weeks ago and we were waiting in line to get
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.360]  screened or whatever they call it nowadays and um there were the normal metal metal detectors and
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:09.440]  then right next to it was the uh those big damn things the big tsa and you are you a nice looking
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:13.760]  young lady you're never too young to be grown by them and what the and then they selected you
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:21.440]  um well actually everyone they pushed everybody into the line to go through the full body scanners
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:28.000]  and um i was next up line and this lady says you know stand on the yellow tape and i say
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:32.880]  through the whole body scanner and she's starting to get impatient already because i'm asking questions
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:39.520]  and uh she says yes and i say well i'm under age you know i'm only 17 i don't think i should go
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:45.120]  through that um can i don't have the option to have another screening like thing and she says
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:52.240]  we have five-year-olds go through here you just go and she was pushing me and they're always claiming
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:56.240]  that you have an option to say no but really they'll try to intimidate you we have five-year-olds
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:01.280]  that go through here honey i'm dying of cancer soon from this now get in there so so what happened
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:06.640]  next started she started shoving you went through and it's amazing what you have to do it was terrible
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.200]  my heart was no it's all about raising your hands acts of submission it's all dog training
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:16.160]  submission training but but to be clear you say she touched you she shoved you in well she was she
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:20.080]  put her hand on my back and she was like you just go through just go through now just get in there
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:27.360]  honey so i go through and you know i spread my stuff like i have to and they run it through once
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:32.240]  and then apparently they did it wrong so they had to run it through another time and something went
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:37.680]  wrong and they said we're gonna have to pat you down no so i get out and i'm like no no i refuse
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:43.360]  to pat down and as she starts to pat me down she says oh it's fine it's probably just your zipper
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:48.560]  and uh you know me and my family walk away and this is the most interesting part of the story
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:54.560]  we're all talking you know we're putting our shoes on and um this guy walked by and he says
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:07.760]  are you guys angry today and we're like no and he said perception
