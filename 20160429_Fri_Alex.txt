[00:00.000 --> 00:09.760]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.760 --> 00:19.520]  It's Alex Chipp and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19.520 --> 00:23.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a particularly jam-packed Friday Worldwide
[00:23.960 --> 00:32.880]  broadcast, the 29th day already of April 2016.
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.560]  We have Roger Stone joining us in 30 minutes to deal with this incredible disinformation
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.560]  job.
[00:38.560 --> 00:41.600]  Quote, it smacks of a political smear job.
[00:41.600 --> 00:47.400]  Former Trump aide tears apart rape lawsuit claiming that Donald Trump eons ago supposedly
[00:47.400 --> 00:48.600]  raped someone.
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.520]  Boy, this is all happening right on time, isn't it, as he clearly takes the lead and
[00:54.520 --> 00:57.800]  is clearly the presumptive nominee.
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.280]  We then also have Dr. Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswoman, joining us.
[01:02.280 --> 01:09.240]  She supports our analysis of the Beyonce situation being a CIA-funded race war program.
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.280]  She's going to be joining us in Seoul, Robert David Steele, formerly of the Central Intelligence
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.280]  Agency.
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.280]  He also, they both reached out to me and said, we'd like to come on because you're absolutely
[01:20.280 --> 01:21.280]  dead on.
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.960]  Well, it's public that that's what's going on, but they made a big deal about it saying
[01:23.960 --> 01:24.960]  it doesn't exist.
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.560]  We'll spend the whole second hour just on Beyonce, but with media control, dirty tricks,
[01:29.560 --> 01:34.080]  some of the other agencies and groups that are involved in manipulating the situation,
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.080]  Rob Dool pop in.
[01:35.080 --> 01:41.920]  He's on the ground in California, or will be landing soon, the site of physical attacks,
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.880]  racial attacks, people trying to run folks over with their cars, just all sorts of horrible
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.880]  stuff.
[01:48.880 --> 01:54.480]  And the mainstream media called it a protest and tried to spin the whole thing.
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.440]  Peter Shipp will then pop in on the incredible jobs numbers and economic numbers that are
[01:59.440 --> 02:07.080]  coming out and then David Knight will anchor the fourth hour of overdrive.
[02:07.080 --> 02:13.240]  First off, simply the worst, Obama is first president ever to not see a single year of
[02:13.240 --> 02:15.440]  3% GDP growth.
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.240]  And that's what some of the most cooked numbers they've ever engaged in will be looking at
[02:19.240 --> 02:20.240]  that.
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.800]  We'll also look at the political correctness area, leftist, hilariously triggered, no,
[02:26.800 --> 02:28.080]  they're conquering society.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.240]  They're not triggered.
[02:29.240 --> 02:31.240]  They rule language.
[02:31.240 --> 02:32.400]  They are our masters.
[02:32.400 --> 02:33.400]  They're not triggered.
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.320]  They are prodding and nudging and bullying.
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.800]  Leftist hilariously triggered by inflammatory sign at target bathrooms, because it said
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.400]  men can use women's and women's can use men.
[02:45.400 --> 02:47.840]  The word man and woman is hurtful.
[02:47.840 --> 02:59.080]  And this is a straight faced headline up on info wars.com out of the Seattle Times.
[02:59.080 --> 03:04.160]  The Washington Post cheerleader tryout advice after angry backlash because it's quote too
[03:04.160 --> 03:07.280]  feminine and talks about looking like a woman.
[03:07.280 --> 03:11.960]  See your identity as a woman or a man is over.
[03:11.960 --> 03:14.400]  They want a sexualism.
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.560]  That's in Brave New World written in 1932 and oldest Huxley, whose brother Julian Huxley
[03:19.560 --> 03:26.360]  run UNESCO that sets the global parameters in 1961, gave a speech at Berkeley, one hour
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.360]  speech.
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.360]  It's online.
[03:28.360 --> 03:29.360]  I read it here.
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.640]  He said, listen, I wrote this book and you see some of it coming true because our goal
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.120]  is by the year 2000 to basically have this book be reality.
[03:39.120 --> 03:41.160]  This is a real plan.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.160]  And he wrote the book.
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.160]  Brave New World revisited.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.760]  Now, you notice they didn't quite get there.
[03:44.760 --> 03:46.920]  They're behind.
[03:46.920 --> 03:54.160]  But this is the ruling class eugenics families that in the 1850s developed this entire Manhattan
[03:54.160 --> 04:02.440]  project on PCP to take over the human system, to take over all biological life and conquer
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.520]  humanity and the earth by creating a new creation, basically, and they're data testing
[04:07.520 --> 04:09.400]  at all right now.
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.280]  They envision computers, the DNA double helix, everything.
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.600]  And they hate the power of femininity.
[04:16.600 --> 04:18.400]  They hate the power of male masculinity.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.160]  They are attacking the species.
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.240]  Even if they said that male tiger is too handsome and strong and has too much prowess, let's
[04:25.240 --> 04:29.280]  drug the animals to make them behave nicer and sweeter.
[04:29.280 --> 04:37.840]  We're supposed to be primal, but see someone like Trigley Puff is threatened by women in
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.760]  traditional beautiful, powerful, feminine roles.
[04:42.760 --> 04:45.240]  So see, first they tell women you should have any role you want.
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.240]  Fine, whatever.
[04:46.240 --> 04:49.200]  Then it's no, your original role is over.
[04:49.200 --> 04:52.160]  This is Species Conquering Event.
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.760]  This is just part of what's coming up today.
[04:54.760 --> 04:56.960]  This is a big transmission.
[04:56.960 --> 04:59.000]  Roger Stone has Gigantor News.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Straight ahead.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.720]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me, and I think it's probably fair
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.160]  to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[05:07.160 --> 05:12.280]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communists Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[05:12.280 --> 05:17.360]  As we see today with a rationing of food, water, medicine, and electricity in Venezuela,
[05:17.360 --> 05:21.480]  the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[05:21.480 --> 05:26.640]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money, and
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.080]  he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.440]  Wait, can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[05:33.440 --> 05:35.400]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[05:35.400 --> 05:40.000]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business, and his business
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  is failing.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.560]  an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[05:49.560 --> 05:53.720]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer and the free press for being a dumb duke.
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.720]  Maybe I am.
[05:54.720 --> 05:57.440]  You know, socialism has duped a lot of people.
[05:57.440 --> 05:59.400]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  We've got it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.920]  That's the experience that's coming to you.
[08:07.920 --> 08:12.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:12.360 --> 08:25.360]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:25.360 --> 08:30.040]  We all knew that there'd be some giant new hit piece coming out.
[08:30.040 --> 08:37.400]  I predicted Wednesday morning when Trump had swept another five states, totally dominating,
[08:37.400 --> 08:44.360]  they would come out and claim he's organized crime, a sexual predator of some type or working
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.920]  for the Russians, you know, something outrageous.
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.800]  And now they have come out and are claiming that some woman says decades ago that Donald
[08:54.800 --> 08:56.840]  Trump raped her.
[08:56.840 --> 09:02.120]  Roger Stone is going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour to address this absolutely
[09:02.120 --> 09:09.560]  ridiculous garbage, and of course, Roger Stone has known Trump 40-plus years and when Trump
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.880]  has been divorced, and Stone's been divorced, he's Trump's wingman.
[09:13.880 --> 09:16.600]  They're like buddies, they're friends.
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.080]  And so that's really the inside baseball, and he can tell the truth about Donald Trump.
[09:21.080 --> 09:23.520]  No one's ever claimed anything like this.
[09:23.520 --> 09:26.800]  This is just horseman-er.
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.960]  But this is what goes on, and you're going to see more of it to try to take down the
[09:29.960 --> 09:31.240]  nationalists.
[09:31.240 --> 09:35.680]  They have basically indicted, well, basically they have indicted Marie Le Pen, who's another
[09:35.680 --> 09:42.800]  nationalist in France, leading in presidential polls, they're talking about wanting to try
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.720]  to arrest the new president of Austria, you know, for his hate speech or whatever.
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.040]  This is what they're doing to counter nationalism and conquer us via globalism.
[09:54.040 --> 09:55.920]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[09:55.920 --> 09:58.920]  Let me get into this first right now.
[09:58.920 --> 10:03.720]  Our reporters are in the air, they will be there in the next few hours.
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.280]  They will be covering events, further Trump events the next two days in California that
[10:10.280 --> 10:16.480]  have been some of the most violent so far.
[10:16.480 --> 10:22.080]  At first California rally, Trump honors families of those killed by illegal aliens.
[10:22.080 --> 10:24.800]  That's real clear politics.
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.200]  But that doesn't end up getting on the controlled news, which has a 6% trusted rate with the
[10:30.200 --> 10:40.040]  people because they're too busy putting out headlines like this that are double lies.
[10:40.040 --> 10:46.240]  They don't report about why Trump's there, and then they twist and spin and engage in
[10:46.240 --> 10:55.240]  diversions when it comes to what happened last night in two different cities.
[10:55.240 --> 11:02.520]  Protest rage outside Trump rally in Orange County, 17 arrested police cars smashed.
[11:02.520 --> 11:10.720]  The headlines should be anti-Trump mob attacks police, men, women and children.
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.840]  I mean just two days ago it was pepper spraying little Hispanic girls.
[11:14.840 --> 11:23.000]  Even these crowds of Mexican wave flag wannabe gangsters, Mexican flag waving wannabe gangsters
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.720]  find Hispanics that are Trump supporters, they physically attack them and start screaming
[11:27.720 --> 11:29.320]  you're a traitor, you're a sellout.
[11:29.320 --> 11:34.960]  Donald Trump's whole family is married to Asians and Hispanics and Jews and everybody
[11:34.960 --> 11:35.960]  else.
[11:35.960 --> 11:38.320]  I mean they're a very, very inclusive family.
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.840]  He's not attacking Mexico.
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.800]  He's saying we've got bad deals with Mexico, Mexico arrest people that are illegal, put
[11:47.800 --> 11:51.520]  some enforced labor camps, we're going to build a wall.
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.120]  And the media creates this giant pity party and goes oh my gosh we're so sorry Hispanics
[11:57.120 --> 12:00.000]  that Trump says you're all criminals and that you're bad people.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.360]  No he said Mexico's dumping its criminals on us and that's an admitted fact.
[12:04.360 --> 12:11.240]  Mexico has collapsed in many areas and has a failed state with 100,000 dead in the last
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.960]  decade known and another 70,000 missing, 170,000 dead.
[12:16.960 --> 12:19.480]  That's worse than the Vietnam War.
[12:19.480 --> 12:22.840]  By the way I wish Mexico would become a first world nation.
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.840]  It's a beautiful country but it's being swallowed into corruption.
[12:27.840 --> 12:34.780]  So he's out there to talk about the violence, the corruption coming across and how nationalism
[12:34.780 --> 12:38.160]  has been demonized in public schools in this country for 50 years.
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.680]  So if you wear an American flag at a public school in California, Oregon or other states,
[12:44.680 --> 12:50.200]  the illegals in many schools are the majority and they're threatened by the American flag
[12:50.200 --> 12:54.040]  and the schools have ruled all across the country you can't have an American flag on
[12:54.040 --> 13:00.320]  your shirt but you can have a Mexican flag.
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.080]  So that's what this is.
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.640]  Protests rage outside Trump rally in Orange County, 17 arrested, police cars smashed.
[13:06.640 --> 13:10.640]  We have the real footage up on infowars.com and we can't really play a lot of it here
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.240]  because of the cussing and out of control behavior but we're talking about illegal aliens, wannabe
[13:16.240 --> 13:24.600]  gang bangers, black lives matter, black supremacist, brain dead teenagers and vile social justice
[13:24.600 --> 13:32.240]  warriors just running around screaming with hate acting like lunatics attacking basically
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.840]  white people.
[13:35.840 --> 13:36.840]  And then laughing and giggling.
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.440]  I mean, if I was driving along with my family and people ran around trying to attack us,
[13:40.440 --> 13:43.360]  I'd just pull the gun out and say, okay, you got two seconds to get back.
[13:43.360 --> 13:44.360]  You don't get back?
[13:44.360 --> 13:47.000]  I mean, I'm going to defend my family.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.200]  That's why this kind of stuff isn't going on in Texas.
[13:50.200 --> 13:53.720]  Turning over police cars, burning things down and of course the police go, get in a
[13:53.720 --> 13:58.040]  fetal position and start urinating on themselves because that's what they've been trained to
[13:58.040 --> 14:04.200]  do in this politically correct situation.
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.000]  So here's one headline, protesters rage outside Trump rally in Orange County, 17 arrests of
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  police car smash.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.120]  They don't tell you who did it.
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.840]  Headlines should be anti-Trump thugs physically attack police and citizens, try to block
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.600]  free speech while holding up their peace signs, which is actually the rune of death in old
[14:23.600 --> 14:24.600]  Norse culture.
[14:24.600 --> 14:31.000]  They don't even know they've got a banner that says death, death to life, to dead tree.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.480]  This is a life rune.
[14:32.480 --> 14:33.480]  This is a death rune.
[14:33.480 --> 14:40.040]  Just let me educate all you morons might want to know what your flag is anti-Trump protesters
[14:40.040 --> 14:43.340]  tangled with drivers, police and customization.
[14:43.340 --> 14:45.880]  So now if I go out and mug you, that's what they did.
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.040]  They robbed people, stole their wallets, knocked their heads in, ran over people.
[14:50.040 --> 14:53.880]  If you do that, you just say, Oh, I tangled.
[14:53.880 --> 14:59.440]  No, if someone mugs you or attacks you, you were assaulted and it's a felony.
[14:59.440 --> 15:01.320]  It wasn't tangling.
[15:01.320 --> 15:02.880]  And there's hundreds of headlines.
[15:02.880 --> 15:05.560]  Did you hear about the tangling last night?
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.000]  CBS News, Los Angeles anti-Trump protesters tangled with drivers, police and customization.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.280]  Oh, they tangled with them.
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.800]  No, they came out and assaulted everyone trying to shut down free speech.
[15:17.800 --> 15:19.800]  Our reporters are going to be there tonight.
[15:19.800 --> 15:20.840]  By the way, I didn't send them.
[15:20.840 --> 15:22.880]  They wanted to go.
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.840]  Now, the Daily Mail actually got it right.
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.080]  Protesters clashed with cops at California Trump rally, hundreds of Mexican flag waving
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.480]  demonstrators, smash up a squad car, punch a Donald supporter and scuffle with riot police
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.360]  amid angry scenes.
[15:41.360 --> 15:42.360]  That itself is a whitewash.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.360]  There's going off.
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.360]  What's on the videos?
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.080]  Now, here's a true headline by Kit Daniels.
[15:47.080 --> 15:48.080]  We can go to infowars.com.
[15:48.080 --> 15:51.800]  You also go to drudgerport.com, where our reports are right up at the top of drudge.
[15:51.800 --> 15:55.480]  If you want to find these, drudgerport.com, we'll put that on screen for folks and click
[15:55.480 --> 15:56.480]  on it for TV viewers.
[15:56.480 --> 15:57.480]  They can find it.
[15:57.480 --> 16:04.480]  One of our listeners is drudgerport.com, anti-Trump protesters riot attack supporters
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.040]  damaged cop car in Orange County.
[16:07.040 --> 16:09.960]  That quite frankly isn't hardcore of enough headline.
[16:09.960 --> 16:12.120]  Protesters block traffic, harass Trump supporters.
[16:12.120 --> 16:14.200]  But it's a truthful headline.
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.120]  I'm just saying, Kit's a great guy, just even our folks can't, you know, get the magnitude
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.120]  of this.
[16:19.120 --> 16:24.960]  Here's Paul Watson's headline up on drudgerport.com, video, Mexican flag waving anti-Trumpers
[16:24.960 --> 16:33.240]  beat Trump supporters attack vehicles gang member one of these stage riot in Orange County.
[16:33.240 --> 16:34.960]  Now this is really the powerful video.
[16:34.960 --> 16:40.680]  It's up on infowars.com and again, even my crew doesn't get it hardcore enough in the
[16:40.680 --> 16:43.120]  fact that we don't want to be sensational.
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.120]  But this is sensational.
[16:44.120 --> 16:49.000]  This guy is doing donuts in the middle of driving into the middle of the pro-Trump people
[16:49.000 --> 16:57.000]  knocking them down almost running over them and the headline should be anti-Trump crazy
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.320]  tries to run over Trump supporters.
[17:01.320 --> 17:06.560]  By the way, I would expect a cop when that's going on to level their firearm and fire into
[17:06.560 --> 17:07.720]  the windshield of that vehicle.
[17:07.720 --> 17:08.720]  Let me tell you something.
[17:08.720 --> 17:11.040]  I see somebody driving around a car like that in the crowd of people.
[17:11.040 --> 17:14.080]  I'm going to pull a gun out of my car and I'm going to kill you.
[17:14.080 --> 17:17.280]  You know why I'm not looking for the trouble, but I'm not going to let somebody menace the
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.800]  public or myself.
[17:18.800 --> 17:25.560]  That is assault with a deadly weapon right there endangering everyone.
[17:25.560 --> 17:28.360]  And that is the type of bedlam that's going to be turned loose in this country and I don't
[17:28.360 --> 17:31.160]  even have anything against these idiot young people out here that believe the mainstream
[17:31.160 --> 17:33.960]  media and think they're going to have to do a good thing and the rap video saying kill
[17:33.960 --> 17:36.840]  Donald Trump, kill Donald Trump.
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.240]  They believe this is okay to do because the TV tells them so and the New York Times has
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.920]  writers saying time to kill Trump and all this garbage.
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.720]  But look at what he's really saying, nothing, but we have bad trade deals, our borders wide
[17:49.720 --> 17:52.840]  open and we shouldn't sit here and put up with it.
[17:52.840 --> 17:57.520]  And that turns into the end of the world with the communist Chinese that have mobile execution
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.400]  vans running around killing people, killing Buddhists that have done nothing.
[18:01.400 --> 18:06.560]  But nobody cares about that or the Apple slave factories because DC is filled with a bunch
[18:06.560 --> 18:11.520]  of potbellied pedophiles like Dennis Hastert, but nobody cares about Penn State or the Catholic
[18:11.520 --> 18:14.800]  Church or the pedophile groups in both parties.
[18:14.800 --> 18:21.720]  No, no, no, it's all Donald Trump is the bad man.
[18:21.720 --> 18:27.840]  And oh my gosh, the University of Washington is banning cheerleaders or they're having
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.280]  a backlash because cheerleaders are pretty and that's too feminine.
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.400]  So being feminine is not allowed now.
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.400]  Here's another one.
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.680]  The rapist kidnappers nearly 20,000 criminal aliens were released last year alone, but
[18:42.680 --> 18:43.680]  that's okay.
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.360]  That's out of the daily color.
[18:45.360 --> 18:48.960]  Lake County undocumented immigrant, I love how they use the word Obama says use illegal
[18:48.960 --> 18:54.960]  alien gets life for deadly crime spree.
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.360]  Powerful moment at Trump rally families who have lost loved ones, illegal immigrant criminals
[18:58.360 --> 18:59.360]  speak out.
[18:59.360 --> 19:01.440]  That's why the illegals are so upset.
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.000]  The border may be open, but the White House will now get a new big giant fence, a big
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.920]  wall around it.
[19:08.920 --> 19:11.360]  That's just some of the news we have in that stack.
[19:11.360 --> 19:14.160]  Then coming up Hillary plays the woman card.
[19:14.160 --> 19:19.160]  And there's a video three minutes of her dozens of rallies saying women, women, women, women,
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.160]  women, we're women.
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.440]  We're standing up to the men.
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.520]  Give me a break.
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.360]  This woman absolutely uses women and everyone else wants you to be a slave of the state.
[19:27.360 --> 19:28.960]  Give me a break.
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.960]  Hillary offers woman card to supporters as campaign focuses on gender.
[19:32.960 --> 19:35.760]  Yeah, we just focused on Obama's black.
[19:35.760 --> 19:40.440]  So it's okay if he doubles black unemployment and is the worst president ever not to see
[19:40.440 --> 19:43.160]  a single year of 3% growth.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.600]  And that's even when they're cook numbers cooking it up.
[19:46.600 --> 19:47.600]  Incredible.
[19:47.600 --> 19:48.600]  Don't worry though.
[19:48.600 --> 19:51.320]  We've already seen premium spikes the last two years under Obamacare.
[19:51.320 --> 19:56.240]  It's being announced to the Associated Press significant premium heights expected now this
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.240]  year and next.
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.680]  Oh, I'm afraid it's a screw job.
[20:00.680 --> 20:05.200]  How would you like to make 17% on your money in only 90 days?

[24:53.120 --> 24:58.880]  guests. Roger Stone coming up in a moment. But I also want to walk through these different
[24:58.880 --> 25:04.360]  video clips that we can play here on radio slash television in FullWars.com forward slash
[25:04.360 --> 25:09.160]  show. If you're a radio listener and want to find the free video feeds. Pro Trump Hispanics
[25:09.160 --> 25:16.480]  detail racist hate from protesters. We also have Trump supporter beaten bloody by the anti
[25:16.480 --> 25:23.200]  Trump attackers. We also have video of the insane reckless protester nearly killing
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.400]  people trying to run him over with a car. Angry mob ransacking Trump supporters car left us
[25:29.400 --> 25:34.360]  destroy cop car and are like trying to get in people's cars and yelling at them. Just
[25:34.360 --> 25:40.840]  because they're white. This is what the media has created and such political correctness
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.840]  that if you're Hispanic and you see an American flag, you're supposed to get scared and upset.
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.520]  Or if you're a woman or a man at the university of Washington or else. And you see an online
[25:51.520 --> 25:58.240]  flyer about cheerleader tryouts and tips on how to look beautiful and feminine. The fact
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.840]  that femininity was being promoted hurt you see father and mother hurt you male or female
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.680]  hurt you he or she what if you don't have them femininity what if you don't identify
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.160]  someone else existing. That hurts you that's why they started these stunts last 10 years
[26:15.160 --> 26:22.040]  you know making the college beauty queen be a tranny. To not be inclusive but to say you
[26:22.040 --> 26:31.680]  can't have it be a woman. See this is a conquering of society. Leftist hilariously triggered by
[26:31.680 --> 26:37.440]  inflammatory clothes quote sign at target bathrooms. Okay so it's shocking and inflammatory
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.420]  clothes quote because it says men might use the transgender law to their favor to peep
[26:42.420 --> 26:49.120]  little girls and women and the ladies room. It says attention ladies. Now see that doesn't
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.240]  exist you don't allow to say that. Target Corps has publicly announced that men may
[26:54.240 --> 27:00.760]  now use the women's restroom and vice versa. No questions asked. Please be cautious reports
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.320]  suspicious hidden cameras report loitering or peeping individuals. A lot of public schools
[27:05.320 --> 27:08.520]  put cameras in the showers now but it's okay the government does it. So see now they're
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.440]  upset by the word he or she or men's or women you just that doesn't exist either. See they
[27:13.440 --> 27:19.040]  control everything. Gender words language they're God. And here's the article linked
[27:19.040 --> 27:25.280]  up on info wars dot com. University of Washington pulls cheerleader tryout. Advice after angry
[27:25.280 --> 27:34.520]  backlash. Makeup do's bronze beachy glow false lashes girl about town lipstick flattering
[27:34.520 --> 27:40.760]  eye shadow make up don'ts dark smoky eyes nude lips. I don't know what the smoky eyes
[27:40.760 --> 27:47.080]  hairdos hairdo color straight volume partially off face hair don'ts ponytails slick back
[27:47.080 --> 27:53.920]  trendy colors. Oh my gosh that's the no one is allowed to have any culture but the culture
[27:53.920 --> 27:59.840]  controllers that the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation UNESCO and the UN will put out
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.280]  monthly the new OK's and the language gets smaller what you're allowed to use gets smaller
[28:05.280 --> 28:12.280]  you properly listen and then use the words they tell you to use. Is it that just so sweet
[28:12.280 --> 28:17.280]  and so special we're going to be breaking all of that down. Now I'm going to roll a
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.920]  Facebook mentions in the control room live because I'm about to introduce on Facebook
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.120]  so folks tune in right now what's about to happen in the next segment. Roger Stone is
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.440]  going to be coming on the consummate Trump insider is wingman of 40 plus years one of
[28:32.440 --> 28:38.600]  his best friends not just former campaign head to break down exactly what is going on

[33:18.240 --> 33:27.920]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world wide it's Alex Jones
[33:27.920 --> 33:34.040]  well we knew that it was coming we knew that it would happen we knew that they would dredge
[33:34.040 --> 33:37.640]  up as soon as it was clear that no one could take the nomination from Trump they would
[33:37.640 --> 33:48.120]  go well past the 1237 that they would absolutely just go into crisis mode and Roger Stone
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.960]  former head of the Trump campaign and of course his good friend and confidant joins us with
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.440]  this breaking information here's the headline out of radar online he'll break down what
[33:58.440 --> 34:03.720]  the allegations are and what the truth is it smacks of a political smear job former
[34:03.720 --> 34:10.400]  Trump aide tears apart rape lawsuit Roger Stone dismisses allegations presidential candidate
[34:10.400 --> 34:15.200]  violated team this is the first time we've ever heard something like this in this man's
[34:15.200 --> 34:23.960]  long almost 50 year public persona so Roger Stone joins us to address this and several
[34:23.960 --> 34:29.480]  other big breaking developments Roger thank you I've only got a little time here Alex
[34:29.480 --> 34:35.000]  but I'm delighted to be with you I'm calling from the trenches here as you can see in the
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.200]  war to make America great again in any event this is a stunning hoax being perpetrated
[34:43.200 --> 34:49.360]  on Donald Trump this shows the extent to which the established order in the ruling class will
[34:49.360 --> 34:58.320]  go to destroy the only man who is a threat to their failed system I personally heavily
[34:58.320 --> 35:04.680]  investigated the entire question of Jeffrey Epstein the multimillionaire billionaire hedge
[35:04.680 --> 35:11.480]  fund manager an intimate of Bill and Hillary Clinton and the fact that he had a tangential
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.600]  connection to Trump because he had paid I don't know two hundred and fifty thousand
[35:16.600 --> 35:23.640]  dollars to be a member of Trump's Palm Beach Club a public facility I can tell you right
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.920]  now the woman who filed this lawsuit claiming she was she met Donald Trump at a sex party
[35:29.920 --> 35:37.720]  so that's absurd Donald Trump is a family man he's a private man he has a very high
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.440]  put very high importance on hygiene that it is nothing that indicate that he would participate
[35:44.440 --> 35:50.960]  in something like that and then secondarily the woman is files the claim on her own behalf
[35:50.960 --> 35:59.080]  with no attorney which legal of course in California on the sixteenth but it is clearly
[35:59.080 --> 36:10.400]  been drafted by an expert lawyer so it Alex it is it is clearly a hoax I tell you looking
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.560]  at this the media is not focusing on the Clintons going to this private island the media is
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.400]  not focused on the real connections to this group with the Clintons instead they're focusing
[36:21.400 --> 36:27.840]  on some tiny link because the guy is part of the golf club that thousands of people are
[36:27.840 --> 36:32.760]  members of I mean this is just crazy it's like saying if Donald Trump ever walked through
[36:32.760 --> 36:38.120]  the same airport as Jeffrey Dahmer that he supposedly in league with with Jeffrey Dahmer
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.440]  this this is really desperate isn't it well the third point of course here is that Epstein
[36:43.440 --> 36:49.120]  is a convicted pedophile I investigated this very thoroughly for my book the Clintons war
[36:49.120 --> 36:58.240]  on women and you can you can see that the women who testified in that civil case two of them
[36:58.240 --> 37:04.600]  said yes they met Donald Trump at a cocktail party yes he was very polite that he was never
[37:04.600 --> 37:12.200]  inappropriate and he left quickly Trump told a instrument in Palm Beach that when he went
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.040]  to a he was invited to a cocktail party at the home of Epstein when he got there he said
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.960]  there were a bunch of teenage girls in the pool and he said to his driver how nice Jeff
[37:22.960 --> 37:28.760]  let the neighborhood children use his pool when he got into the house he didn't realize
[37:28.760 --> 37:34.320]  he realized that there were a lot off a lot of young women there he was polite to everybody
[37:34.320 --> 37:42.280]  and he left that is the extent of of Trump's knowledge now Epstein had everyone pulled
[37:42.280 --> 37:48.960]  he was a major socialite in Palm Beach and in New York so and he certainly had a relationship
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.560]  with Trump he had paid Trump to belong to his club but I thoroughly investigated these
[37:54.560 --> 38:02.800]  claims because there is a little black book held by by Epstein it does contain Trump's
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.640]  number but that's not unusual it also more importantly controls the control contained
[38:09.640 --> 38:18.120]  in number for Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin the two top operatives for Hillary Clinton
[38:18.120 --> 38:25.680]  22 different phone notations for Bubba himself but this woman's name the woman filing the
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.520]  false claim against Trump does not appear in the phone book and by the way the daily
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.280]  mail radar and others they're all basically agreeing with you saying this appears to be
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.680]  a giant hoax Trump's lawyers come out and said rape lawsuit a hoax and says there's
[38:39.680 --> 38:45.120]  no proof accuser exists as he claims her address and phone number are fakes so who do we think
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.600]  is behind this Roger who are the suspects well first of all let's notice that it's the British
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.840]  press even though it's a great worldwide information source but it is the British press
[38:55.840 --> 39:02.360]  to is pointing out the hoax notice the mainstream media press here isn't as discussed it now
[39:02.360 --> 39:09.880]  I could Alex very easily say now who would perpetrate such a hoax I could just as Ted
[39:09.880 --> 39:16.560]  Cruz falsely accused me of planting a story against him in the National Enquirer I could
[39:16.560 --> 39:23.360]  easily accuse Ted Cruz of planting this I must tell you I don't rule it out let's just
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.680]  say we are investigating Wow now a couple days ago you said listen I've got really big
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.520]  news you told me what it was it's huge you said we need to you know get an article out
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.320]  on it but I need to look at all the angles are you getting ready to talk about the huge
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.720]  news you were laid to myself and I know others two days ago yes I think we're going to be
[39:43.720 --> 39:51.160]  able to expose the entire battle plan of the establishment they are passing a an amendment
[39:51.160 --> 40:00.600]  around to the rules they are raising money to for a quote unquote advertising blitz the
[40:00.600 --> 40:11.760]  details are still coming in but very clearly the Romney Bush Cruz alliance the insiders
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.680]  the GOP Brahman are preparing to steal this from Donald Trump they even though Trump
[40:18.680 --> 40:25.160]  moves inexorably towards the nomination Alex the only people who want Trump are the people
[40:25.160 --> 40:33.680]  he wins giant victories across the Northeast he hits 58% in every in every demographic
[40:33.680 --> 40:42.360]  and he is he is he's ignored by the party bosses who I think will still go to any extent
[40:42.360 --> 40:48.440]  so even if he gets the 1237 which I believe he is going to prior to the convention I feel
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.760]  very good about his prospects in Indiana there is a new team in charge at Trump when it comes
[40:54.760 --> 41:00.520]  to delegate selection there's a very strong media campaign first time we've seen that
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.760]  from the Trump operation plus Trump himself is the best campaigner in the Republican Party
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.120]  Trump draws crowds like nobody else can that means but and buzz means both in the few minutes
[41:12.120 --> 41:16.360]  we've got left can you flush out a little bit more of when we're going to be able to
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.280]  see this internal battle planned by the RNC that you've had a few days and who exactly
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.200]  is behind it and what they're planning to do well I want to make sure that everything
[41:26.200 --> 41:31.840]  I tell you Alex and your listeners and those who are engaged in the fight for liberty and
[41:31.840 --> 41:37.160]  who are prepared to take on the establishment that have run this country into the ditch
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.400]  I want to be sure everything that I'm learning is correct so stay tuned you'll hear about
[41:42.400 --> 41:50.200]  it here at info wars.com because unlike CNN unlike MSNBC they don't believe in censorship
[41:50.200 --> 41:55.800]  here in closing we know that this is the type of hit piece that we expected but it doesn't
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.640]  even say who it's from or what it is and the press checks it and it's not even real but
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.520]  our controlled media is still running with it do you think this is going to damage Trump
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.000]  is anybody going to buy into that he's a known ladies man he's been you know he's been married
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.280]  repeatedly you've known him forever you're a personal friend you know you guys run together
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.800]  and this isn't Trump style this isn't what Trump does there's no history of it if he
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.440]  did stuff like this it would already be out in the tabloids I mean this this is going
[42:24.440 --> 42:29.440]  to really blow up in somebody's face I think this is a real act of desperation well and
[42:29.440 --> 42:35.680]  it's a double-edged sword I mean if anybody has exposure on the Epstein issue is it would
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.880]  be Bill Clinton I mean in my book Clinton's war on women I point out that he is on Epstein's
[42:40.880 --> 42:46.280]  plane private plane that they called the Alita Express because it was well like a U.S.
[42:46.280 --> 42:52.280]  their operation you know round bed plenty of teenage girls to play with Bill Clinton
[42:52.280 --> 42:58.720]  was on that plane 17 times he visited Epstein at his home for a private party in Palm Beach
[42:58.720 --> 43:02.880]  one of the neighbors was a tea party member gave me a full lowdown on everything she saw
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.800]  and heard and then Bill Clinton also visited one of his sex parties on his private hedonistic
[43:09.800 --> 43:18.520]  island so he goes to the pedo the a pedo island yes so the question really becomes quite simply
[43:18.520 --> 43:23.760]  you know what was Bill Clinton doing there why was he palling around with a with a convicted
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.800]  pedophile the Palm Beach city police pardon me the Palm Beach County police Sheriff's
[43:28.800 --> 43:37.080]  Office and police determined that Epstein had assaulted 33 underage girls in the county
[43:37.080 --> 43:45.360]  he pled to one count of solicitation when there was a public uproar over that the George
[43:45.360 --> 43:52.600]  Bush Justice Department stepped in to review the entire matter Epstein was sentenced to
[43:52.600 --> 43:59.480]  15 months of which he only spent 13 months unlike any other sex offender in the state
[43:59.480 --> 44:04.920]  of Florida he didn't go to the state penitentiary he was kept in the Palm Beach County jail
[44:04.920 --> 44:09.360]  in a separate wing where he is being protected just like Dennis Haster just got 15 months
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.200]  so in closing correct me if I'm wrong this is pretty clear Trump has come out with you
[44:13.200 --> 44:18.160]  in your book he's exposed the Clintons for their sex crimes Bill doing it Hillary covering
[44:18.160 --> 44:25.080]  it up they know full well you guys have been planning to go up against Hillary with this
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.440]  very Epstein information which you've already been doing here for a year and but now they
[44:30.440 --> 44:33.960]  know your phones are tapped last week you saw him breaking into your computer surfing
[44:33.960 --> 44:38.760]  around on it clicking on things and so the perfect way to not let you use this weapon
[44:38.760 --> 44:44.160]  of truth is to just put a hoax out saying it's Trump so that when Trump tries to go
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.200]  after him for this they go wait a minute that's you but I think they miscalculate I would predict
[44:49.200 --> 44:54.080]  that Trump's gonna go wild now all guns and bring everything out is that an accurate statement
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.360]  knowing his personality well he's put out an infatic statement out and that's all he
[44:58.360 --> 45:05.840]  really should dignify this crap with I mean he put out an indignant categorical statement
[45:05.840 --> 45:12.160]  look I knew Trump is in this time period it's just not him he is just you know that's just
[45:12.160 --> 45:18.360]  not him he would have no interest in underage girls I know the age range that he likes them
[45:18.360 --> 45:24.000]  he's got the greatest life in the world he's very happy he likes the full goddess woman
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.320]  powerful the snyards he wants to him he wants to be the big enchilada let's just be very
[45:30.320 --> 45:35.560]  clear Jeffrey Epstein's youngest victim was 13 some of the girls were 17 now Trump would
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.720]  have no interest in that in fact you would find it disgusting it is he's a father and
[45:40.720 --> 45:47.320]  a family man so this is a this is a ridiculous hoax and it's up to smear the front runner
[45:47.320 --> 45:55.720]  this guy threatens to bust up the entire party duopoly as the Wall Street K Street access
[45:55.720 --> 46:00.400]  that had been running this country they are I've never seen this kind of fear the smear
[46:00.400 --> 46:07.320]  tactic the the the incredible attack it's absurd well thank you for this exclusive I know
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.160]  you're working so hard on the campaign and the last two minutes here roger stonestonezone.com
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.640]  stop the steal dot org how big of victory have we seen going forward the momentum is
[46:17.640 --> 46:22.880]  clear now they're saying even if he gets you know that the 237 they're gonna or the 1237
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.160]  they're gonna ignore that I mean I think their hubris is bitten off more than it can chew
[46:27.160 --> 46:31.160]  what can you say about the state of the Trump campaign and this campaign and the country
[46:31.160 --> 46:37.840]  right now well it unfortunately the establishment continues to nibble around the edges of Trump's
[46:37.840 --> 46:43.720]  majority packing the state delegations with with Trojan horse delegates we saw more of
[46:43.720 --> 46:50.400]  them placed in Georgia last week Indiana has a primary which I think Trump will win smashingly
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.880]  you will have one delegate under the current system and those delegates will not be forced
[46:55.880 --> 47:03.000]  to vote the will of the voters by party rules will they do so it's so that is what we're
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.760]  up against the Donald Trump can win use victories when I say we I say this as a Trump supporter
[47:08.760 --> 47:13.760]  there's all my actions on behalf of Donald Trump or independent I have no affiliation
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.800]  with this campaign I have no formal or informal role I've known Donald Trump 40 years I have
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.680]  great affection for his family I've seen the great things he's achieved and I think he's
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.480]  the only one for you to special interest but I want to be clear Alex that I am just a commando
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.040]  out there in the field I understand you're going to the sound of the guns well knowing
[47:33.040 --> 47:37.080]  his psychology and myself is watching him but you know him so well I understand he's
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.240]  not gonna respond to this anymore but I would expect him to get really aggressive now because
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.000]  every time they do something even close to this he really fires back so I think we're
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.880]  gonna start hearing about Bill Clinton the ripest from Trump here on the campaign trail
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.760]  what do you think well I think you I don't think he will open up on Hillary until an
[47:53.760 --> 47:58.240]  appropriate time and he wants to be the nominee right now he's the presumptive nominee I agree
[47:58.240 --> 48:05.000]  with that there is no mathematical medical way for Ted Cruz to get there but Alex choosing
[48:05.000 --> 48:15.440]  Carly Fiorina she's Mitt Romney in heels layoffs outsourcing giant golden parachute while she's
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.120]  firing people then she gets caught red handed essentially violating the Iranian sanctions
[48:22.120 --> 48:29.840]  so you look Packard can do business in Iran chief domestic policy advisor for cranky John
[48:29.840 --> 48:36.720]  McCain this is a Hail Mary past it makes no sense not only that but because she ran for
[48:36.720 --> 48:44.240]  the Senate in California and because the Democrats feel fully excoriated her on all those issues
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.600]  her negatives in California are sky high they know what Carly Fiorina is a globalist blackie
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.560]  who has run a failed company so a very stupid move and that media keeps saying Trump needs
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.560]  a quick complaining about the big steel no he needs to always talk about it so the delegates
[48:58.560 --> 49:02.400]  themselves fight back and say no and I can really see the fact that you pointed out to
[49:02.400 --> 49:06.600]  him he needs to go after the Sanders people he's doing that now Roger Stone have a great

[54:29.760 --> 54:46.760]  because they cannot tell me races right they were out it was funny see their faces just like oh he's screaming in Spanish like oh but it's still like it was it was like that yeah and I see these people with the Mexican flags this is graceful come on man I'm part of this land now I love it
[54:46.760 --> 54:59.760]  and that's Rob do they're on the scene getting interviews with folks that went through all of that so continue we got more reporters about to land out there to back him up as well
[54:59.760 --> 55:22.760]  but imagine people waving Mexican flags because you want to go to a political rally and try to drive over with cars and beating people up a bunch of black lives matter black supremacist goofy social justice warrior people just out there filled with so much hate and they really go after Hispanics that like are supposedly these traders to Mexico
[55:22.760 --> 55:35.760]  you have Mexico so wonderful why are you here and I'm not saying we're that wonderful either we're falling apart but it's just crazy it's absolute garbage it's brainwashing it's out of control
[55:36.760 --> 55:50.760]  meanwhile multinational corporations that own our big insurance companies in the first year of Obamacare two years ago according to the Wall Street Journal had a global 47 plus percent increase in profit in one year
[55:50.760 --> 56:02.760]  all insurance companies globally off the raping and robbing of us and increasing prices globally saw 47% increase it went up even more the next year
[56:03.760 --> 56:15.760]  my dad's insurance doubled mine has doubled the last two years member Gruber who helped write it up with Obama he said yes thank God the public's dumb and doesn't pay attention we're doubling and tripling prices
[56:15.760 --> 56:31.760]  there was always free healthcare for poor people there was always charity care now they just call that Obamacare so again the total ignorance is how they manipulate significant premium hikes expected under Obama health law
[56:31.760 --> 56:45.760]  that's already gone up repeatedly but this is out of the Associated Press expect insurers to seek significant premium increases under President Obama's health care law in a wave of state level requests rippling across the country ahead of the political conventions this summer
[56:46.760 --> 56:55.760]  insurers say the law coverage has been a financial drain for many of them and they're setting the stage for 2017 hikes that in some cases could reach well into the double digits
[56:55.760 --> 57:07.760]  oh and that's sweet international control over local state systems but don't worry Bloomberg columnist says Trump is America's first Nazi
[57:08.760 --> 57:15.760]  he says America's first is Nazi rhetoric really and the EU's criticizing Trump that was a Nazi project
[57:15.760 --> 57:28.760]  don't you love the total ignorance of how they operate and how they behave again the world is degenerating and the best time to get storeable food high quality storeable food is now

[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.760]  they flew in I guess yesterday got there and are the ones that got all the exclusive footage
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:50.760]  so I was like hey that's Rob do's voice we're playing the video because I hadn't I hadn't really paid attention when I was watching the videos this morning
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.760]  that it was Rob do and Joe Biggs and people so
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.760]  Trump Nazi sign holder gets owned
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.760]  Bernie supporters dance and destroy at Trump rally
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760]  they're uploading all this right now
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.760]  Latino for Trump reveals horrors of socialism
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.760]  Trump supporters protesters face off
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.760]  Trump supporters unload on mob mentality
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.760]  house of cards begins to fail anti-Trump riot quelled
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760]  riot cops march on Bernie supporters
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760]  these are all great headlines but the headline is
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.760]  anti-Trump thugs attack peaceful families
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.760]  I mean that's what happened Trump supporter
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  bloodied by Trump thugs anti-Trump zealots pushed back
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.760]  well it's anti-Trump attackers successfully repulsed
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760]  anti-free speech horde defeated
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.760]  and you see when the police in different cities have attacked peaceful crowds I'm totally against it and I say
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:09.760]  indict them arrest them whenever but when there's peaceful crowds and they're attacked and then the police go and defend the right of free speech that's a good thing
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:17.760]  against people waving foreign flags and I mean literally hopping around people that act just like a trigly puff
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.760]  I mean I was looking at trigly puff last night who I do want to reach out to and have her come here as we go look at you
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:30.760]  you're like a baby throwing a fit about people's free speech and just screaming everybody's racist so you know it's like some title you have
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  this is culture war folks this is total divide and controversy right through it and and they're finding all the white supremacist groups on the other side
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.760]  pro-Trump Hispanics to tell racist hate from protesters
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.760]  I mean there's just a bunch of powerful videos the crew's done an amazing job
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:57.760]  Trump supporters brave mob of illegal aliens I just add that to the headline there whoever's listening to the crew just please
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:06.760]  Trump supporters defend free speech brave mob of illegals left in the way of Mexican flags folks I mean they don't want to be here out of that
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.760]  a foreign invasion force whatever imagine if I was in Mexico running around waving an American flag trying to stop some political demonstration
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:20.760]  imagine with some presidential candidates saying it's giving a speech in Mexico sitting and I showed up with like 50 Americans
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:30.760]  white black Hispanics were trying to beat people up you get killed you would get killed and you probably should be I mean you know it's just crazy
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:42.760]  how this country's like that I know oh Mexico belong to I mean California belong to Mexico and it belonged to the Russians to I mean Texas had eight flags over it not just six or seven
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:51.760]  it was a war zone people that belong to the poor Native Americans do you know what Native Americans lived in Texas and I'm not bashing them I'm related to some of them
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  but the Caracas was on the coast that were headhunters and killed anybody they got a hold of that were feared all over the place and then the Comanches
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:10.760]  there weren't a lot of Apaches in Texas they were some out west but anywhere that had good land good good good forest good the Comanches ran the show
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:21.760]  all the way up through Oklahoma all the way up into the Dakotas the most vicious undoubted most most powerful and warlike of any Native tribe
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:34.760]  the Comanches that's who ran Texas the Comanches and the Karunkawa that's who ran it that's people that would roast you over fire and eat you
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:41.760]  the Comanches would cut your eyelids off and bury you in an ant bed for enjoyment while they took hallucinogens
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:57.760]  and that's why I'm so crazy a little bit of Comanches not much mainly just a little sweetie pie folks out Oklahoma but I tell you it is just so that the image they put out of Native Americans is pure and total bull
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:05.760]  James Madison the father of the Bill of Rights wrote where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:14.760]  no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:22.760]  the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:30.760]  that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:37.760]  there was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution they believe they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:47.760]  but as James Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:56.760]  arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions

[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:11.760]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:34.760]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:49.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:08:04.760]  discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life.com with Anthroplex
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:32.760]  Bernie Sanders wants to audit the private fellow reserve Bernie Sanders thinks it's wrong that big elites are basically tax exempt I agree with him
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:46.760]  I don't think socialism is the way to go because the elites always get control of that pie but the so called system we have is not capitalism it is crony capitalism to the 10th power it is a criminal operation
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:59.760]  and it's seeking to turn the entire west and the rest of the world into giant compartmentalized warring factions that they control
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:16.760]  Now Cynthia McKinney former congresswoman has been demonized so much by the left and the right and they literally put a congressman in to take her place who thinks that islands float remember that that guy that's who they replaced her with he thought that Guam would capsize
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:29.760]  because she would get up there and talk about the child kidnapping range that were in the Chicago Tribune with Dincor and men women and children being disappeared and vaccine deaths in the troops
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:45.760]  That's why they went after and that's why they claimed that she was getting fights with the capital cops when they were ordered to harass her because of what she actually stood for because she had courage and that's why they're scared of Bernie Sanders that's why they're scared of Donald Trump
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:58.760]  it's why they're scared of her it's they're scared of anybody they don't control that's why you have the communist Chinese that Mao Zedong according to the Chinese communists killed 84 million people CIA says 60 something but they're the ones that put him in
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:10.760]  you've got them saying we can't have Donald Trump I got big problems with Donald Trump with his spying and torture and all the rest of it but the point is they don't like him because he doesn't want war with Russia he doesn't want unfair trade deals they're coming after him
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:19.760]  and that's really the biggest seal of approval you can find the red badge of courage is of the establishment across the political spectrum hates you
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:28.760]  the mainstream media has a 6% believability according to the Associated Press just two weeks ago I know I'm hammering that point but it's so important
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:44.760]  and so she's been the Green Party candidate she's gone all over the world to war zones when Libby is getting bombed and Syria she just has incredible courage a lot more courage than I got I mean quite for it I got the courage to do it but I don't want to get killed I want to keep doing my work here
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  but she goes into war zones you name it run Cynthia run.org and she's also a doctor I guess gets a whole bunch of political science you name it and she knows her stuff and I'm always trying to get around the show she's really busy but she reached out to us and so did another gentleman that's going to be on for part of the interview with us coming up we're going to kind of you know have the interviews overlap with each other
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:20.760]  and of course that gentleman was formerly with the CIA not just one of these analysts but an actual field commander who himself carried out false flags now not false flags killing people but still false flags and so Robert David Steele is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  they'll both be on together for 30 minutes then she'll leave and he'll be on with us for 30 minutes the next hour then Rob do out there covering the people attacking the Trump events will be joining us from the ground the video they shot last night will be in San Francisco this evening
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:46.760]  the video they shot last night is all over CNN Fox you name it and they crop it and don't even give us credit but I don't even care the point is is that we're there to get this information out and that's what your support
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  and all of you spreading the word about the broadcast and buying the products and info or store.com you name it it makes it all possible so thank you so much for helping us build a true independent libertarian based
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:15.760]  nationalist constitutionalist pro human organization we are the anti eugenics party we are the anti technocracy party or pro technology anti technotronic takeover and folks if you don't know what that is learn quickly because that's the real system we're going under
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  so Cynthia McKinney joins us all things Cynthia McKinney.com she's got a couple websites I'm not sure which one we should give out but Dr McKinney it is great to have you on with us I know that you originally wanted to pop on about Beyonce
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:39.760]  and my point is this NFL CIA funded that's been admitted Pentagon funded her message where it looks like it's empowering and my view is meant to get people at each other's throat to cause division
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:56.760]  to cause war on the streets while we're looted by the controllers and you want to pop on and give your view on this and more but I know you're an expert for being inside it but also from studying it on the type of psychological warfare going on so Dr McKinney thanks for joining us.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:13.760]  Well thank you so much Alex. I'm sorry after we've been having so many Skype problems like we may have to start abandoning Skype in just a moment let me just stop you for a moment Cynthia. Guys let's get her on the phone or whatever we need to do all right we probably have to abandon Skype here.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.760]  I don't know if it's system wide in the country or if it's here but it's it's with every person let's see if we can hear her now and if not we're going to get her on the phone go ahead Cynthia.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:31.760]  Okay I'm just saying that I'm so happy that you are having me on the show and I hope that I'm coming through now.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:41.760]  Yes you are coming through I mean I really think they're starting to mess with us Roger Stone was on earlier and when he comes on sometimes someone jumps on his computer is controlling the browser.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:47.760]  I mean this is really starting to happen I think what we're seeing is some information warfare but please continue I apologize.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:14:02.760]  Well the situation with Trump and the riot that took place let me first say I'm not in the United States for the past two weeks I've been in Africa and I've been in Asia.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:21.760]  And let me tell you that people are concerned about a the potential for a President Trump and this stems from things that he has said or things that have reported he has reportedly said.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:36.760]  At the same time let me just remind folks that if you run a draw play too many times then the defense is going to be able to tell when you're running a draw play.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:49.760]  Now this situation with the riot at the campaign event well I'm here to tell you that this happened in my very own campaign.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  I remember this happened actually twice and so one time the first time it happened homeless people were told that I was giving away money and all they had to do was come to my campaign headquarters and collect a check collect some cash.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  And of course people have been in.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:40.760]  We're having Skype problems with Cynthia McKinney she's getting into dirty tricks how these type of operations run when her Skype comes back we'll attempt to go to her and then it break we're going to attempt to get on a phone line with her she's in Bangladesh so that may be the reason we're having some Skype problems but with Roger Stone they've been breaking into his computers.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  Of course he's one of the top Trump advisors so what do you expect I mean he's with the front runner of the so-called free world they're really coming after him and absolutely Trump does some things I disagree with some things that scare people the media also kind of misrepresent a lot of it.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:01.760]  The bigger question I'm going to ask Cynthia McKinney is why did why does she think the system across the board is so scared of him but we'll get to that question in a moment.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:09.760]  Your Skype was cutting out again Dr McKinney you were getting into they sent the homeless claiming that you were offering free money please continue.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:17.760]  And so eventually I was totally embarrassed all of the media were there to cover it.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:44.760]  And I was totally embarrassed this is exactly a replay this is an instant replay of what happened to me so I recognize it and so the objective is to make Trump so unpalatable that one doesn't have any choice but to cast their vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:51.760]  And under no circumstance should any thinking voter vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:17:00.760]  Well even Lewis Farrakhan has been saying good things about Trump overall compared to the other establishment candidates even though he disagrees with some of the things.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  And of course Trump obviously disagrees with some of the stuff Lewis Farrakhan says all I know is I've never seen the power structure so scared of somebody.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:14.760]  What is your view as somebody that's been inside Congress but also been all over the world Dr McKinney of why the system so scared of Trump.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.760]  Well you know he he his instincts.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.760]  He said something that caught my attention.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.760]  Of course he said a lot of things that caught a lot of attention right.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:37.760]  OK. However he started talking about NATO. You and I know that NATO is an anachronism.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:45.760]  NATO should have been dismantled a decade ago or more at the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:55.760]  That was basically the end of NATO except for the fact that you've got a group of people who want to rekindle the cold war.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.760]  And so NATO is a vehicle by which they can accomplish that.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:10.760]  And then NATO will try and keep submit together these entities that are basically drifting apart.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.760]  If you look at what's happening in Europe today and then he also wants peace with Russia.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760]  I mean that is such a big positive.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:27.760]  That's right. And so now you've got NATO has become a global army.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:45.760]  To destabilize other parts of the world in pursuit of the Cold War against Russia and a hot war it seems against China.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.760]  That's right. You were we're about to go to break.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760]  You were getting into Hillary Clinton saying under no circumstances vote for her.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.760]  Why are you against Hillary Clinton?
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.760]  I think her record speaks volumes for the kind of president that she would be.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:17.760]  And I can't even imagine that we're talking about a president Hillary Clinton when we really ought to be talking about who's going to prosecute her for war crimes, torture, crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:26.760]  That's right. Libya, Syria, the war mongering, the lying about being a hero like like Brian Williams, all the other things she's done.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  And then we're just supposed to vote for her. She's a woman and that's a total gimmick.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:44.760]  Well, you're absolutely right. And first of all, there's a woman by the name of Jane Cherpstra who wrote a fabulous piece called Beware the Women of the Hegemon.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.760]  And so she talks about how there was a time when women candidates for political office.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:59.760]  Stay there, stay there. Dr. McKinney, stay there from Bangladesh. Wow, didn't know she was there joining us straight ahead. We'll be back. We'll get to the CIA.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:06.760]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become in these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or even a future collapse?

[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:23.760]  Alex Jones here, back live. Dr. Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney is our guest. She'll be with us till the end of the hour and then Robert David Steele will take over for 30 minutes. He's going to be joining us in the next segment as the two who I know know each other's work will be discussing propaganda in our media manipulation.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:37.760]  There's so many different types of it but just here in the break, I have seen in on in the break room and I went to get a cup of coffee and Wolf Blitzer was interviewing one of the Trump campaign people and the headline was violence at Trump campaign.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:53.760]  And then he was saying Trump needs to apologize that he's causing this and she's saying but they're the ones that attacked. So see it's this inversion of reality and it's like the Egyptian government. I'm not defending the stuff they were doing but we overthrow them, put people in worse.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:07.760]  They start murdering tens of thousands of people. Syria doing nothing to anybody trying to overthrow them kill hundreds of thousands. Libya even worse. I mean Gaddafi been working with the West for eight years, invested all his money.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:18.760]  He was basically putting 98% of the government money back to the people. I don't like socialism unless Gaddafi's running it. I mean when Gaddafi ran it he actually really did take the oil the money and then actually create a country.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  That's what they took him out folks. I'm not lionizing Muir Gaddafi. He did some bad stuff. The point is, compared to our leaders, well I've got her on to be the guest. I'm just ranting. It makes me so mad.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:36.760]  We're going to talk about Beyonce and the rest of it but you were getting into Hillary and just the things she's done and the women of the hegemon.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  Look, I say get more women in government but at the same time some of the biggest war mongers we've ever seen have been women. I don't know where this idea comes in that just because it's a woman it's going to be great. Cynthia?
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:26:06.760]  Well you know, Alex, I used to think that. I used to think that if you put women in policy making positions that people would be taken care of, that the healthcare system would be better, that the education system would be better
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:16.760]  and that neighborhoods would be safer and cleaner. I thought that because that's what women generally do.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  If it was your mother or my mother, I mean it was the women we know but just not these women.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  That's exactly right. And so Dr. Terpstra mentions particularly women like Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice, you know these women of the hegemon don't know a particular political party.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:52.760]  They span the political spectrum and yet their policies are worse than the policies of any man. So Hillary Clinton fits in that number.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:01.760]  She is a part of that plus of all of the other criminality, you know, the war crimes, tortures, crimes against humanity, crimes against peace.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:14.760]  But we also have a three at least, three outstanding investigations of the way Secretary Clinton ran the State Department.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:36.760]  That's right. And so we need to be very, very careful about casting a vote for this particular woman slash family because I think they have demonstrated time and time again just exactly what their values are.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:43.760]  And their values have nothing to do with the values I believe of the people who are hurting right now.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:52.760]  You're right. She's like the leader of Specter or she's like a master villain like Lex Luthor. I mean, I've got to think about all the crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:28:02.760]  As bad as Bill is now that I've studied over the years, she really is kind of the boss, quarterbacking the whole deal. Bill's off raping people and doing drugs. That's bad too, but she wants the power.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:14.760]  You're absolutely right. She wants the power and she has had the opportunity to wield power and we have seen the results of her wielding of power.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:33.760]  And so on the one hand, let me also say something to you, Alex, that probably, you know, I shouldn't broach this subject, but I'm extremely disappointed with black voters who are bailing out the Hillary Clinton campaign when she doesn't deserve black votes.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:55.760]  I just don't understand the affinity for someone who has been so detrimental to the community at large and to the, you know, I didn't think Bill Clinton's Africa policy, his foreign policy could be worse than that.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:08.760]  A cruise missile and baby formula factors. Let me ask this one minute we have to go to break. Looking at what's happening, why wouldn't Obama do something for the black community? He almost did less than anybody else and unemployment doubled.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.760]  It seemed to me he had it out for the black community.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:33.760]  Well, he definitely, well, you know, I ran against Obama and I was running because I understood that my values were not going to be reflected by policy coming from the Democratic Party as it is constituted today.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:44.760]  And so I think President Obama's administration, his tenure has demonstrated exactly that.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.760]  Dr. McKinney, stay there from Bangladesh. I'm Alex Jones and Robert David Seales coming up as well.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:05.760]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:10.760]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communists and Anistas 30 years ago.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:20.760]  As we see today with a rationing of food, water, medicine and electricity in Venezuela, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:28.760]  Now Bernie Sandernista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money and he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:33.760]  Wait, can't he just create jobs out of thin air, have them dig ditches or something?
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.760]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business and his business is failing.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:48.760]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour, he still can't make ends meet.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.760]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer and the free press for being a dumb duke, maybe I am.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760]  You know socialism has duped a lot of people.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:17.760]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:50.760]  I'm David Knight.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.760]  Now available at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:30.760]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:50.760]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:33:00.760]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:37.760]  All right, for the next hour, we're going to be joined by Dr. Cynthia McKinney and a gentleman who can really add a lot of information to what we're breaking down, Robert David Steele.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:45.760]  His website is RobertDavidSteel.com and Dr. McKinney's site is something everybody should visit as well.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:53.760]  We will also give you that address. It's allthingsynthiamkinney.com and I'm going to go to them in just a moment.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:10.760]  The point to understand here is transcending left and right. Both the left and right have real issues and real beefs, but it's all being weaponized and dumbed down to create societal divide and conquer so that multinationals can literally make us poor as a tool of economic warfare.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:18.760]  And that's their admitted globalist plan and they sell it as if it's for the earth and the environment. It's actually ending innovation and bringing in feudalism again.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:32.760]  That's what they admit they're setting up and Cynthia McKinney, Dr. McKinney and of course Robert David Steele and others are fighting back against that and I'm trying to get people to really get organized as they are around understanding what the real game plan is.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:40.760]  Now before we go any further, our reporters, you see their footage all over CNN, all over Fox, no credit. That's fine, I don't care.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:53.760]  People can see that it's folks with Mexican flags running around through liberation theology taught in the colleges by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation and by the CIA on record to teach liberation theology.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:04.760]  And sure, there's a lot of wrongs that have gone on, but they teach it to create the future breakup of the country. They'll have a larger multinational sphere than sub-breakups within the countries.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.760]  Just like they played off Catholic against Protestant in Ukraine. Both sides had beefs or Catholic against Orthodox.
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:22.760]  Both sides had beefs, both sides have been killing each other for 500 years, but the point was they came in with anthropology and sociology and psychology to get everybody at each other's throats.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.760]  That's what they're doing. It's like if aliens invaded, they try to get us to fight with each other. It's the same thing. It's the great game the British talked about.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.760]  Our reporters are going to be up in San Francisco tonight to cover the other Trump rally.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:44.760]  So watch that tonight at 7 o'clock central. My point is we are true independent media that wears our bias to tell the truth on our sleeve.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:53.760]  And we need your financial support to send reporters to Bilderberg in Germany, to send myself and others to Cleveland and to Philadelphia to cover the DNC.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:10.760]  When you buy a Hillary for President t-shirt, or when you buy a Make America Free Again hat, or when you buy the great nutraceuticals we have, you are financing an organization that has the best bang for its buck out there to really change the narrative and put out pro-liberty talking points.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:19.760]  Anthroplex is made for men. It works great on women as well. A bunch of known healthy clean herbs that boosts your vitality, your strength, your energy.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:28.760]  Go read the research for yourself. It really is an amazing product at a low price. It's back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.760]  Also, super male vitality is a similar formula, a little bit stronger. It's cold press. It's why it costs a little more. It's going to sell out by tomorrow.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:48.760]  Never fear. We've got plenty of super female vitality. It's almost the same formula, but people want a male and female formula. I think it works on me just as good. It's got a type of root. It's got an obnoxious name.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:57.760]  I forget the scientific one, but it has horny goatweeds, one of the ingredients that's in a female that isn't in the male. But believe me, you get a bottle of this, you'll find out how powerful mother nature is.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:07.760]  infowarslife.com. The mega sale on storeable food will have to end this weekend. 30 to 40% off info wars select storeable foods. That doesn't mean select food.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  It's called info wars select because it's so high quality, very low price, powered by my patriot supply. We can give you the lowest price anywhere because I have a deal where we are beyond the distributor, we private label.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:27.760]  So that's how we get around that and lower the price down so low that special is going to end with all the things happening in the world. I think you're crazy if you don't get prepared.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  And finally, we have a deal with 10% off anybody that signs up for auto ship, whether it be our non GMO, high mountain, Chiapas grown organic coffee, or whether it be the nutraceuticals or whatever the case may be.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:53.760]  We've got colloidal silver toothbrushes, whatever everything I use, everything I love, we sell it. It's a win win. Whatever works for you on auto ship 10% off when you sign up for auto ship, you can choose how often or when and, you know, cancel anytime.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.760]  And we also in closing have free shipping on orders above $50 or more. So thank you for your support. And I want to be clear.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:10.760]  I am a restorationist. I want to restore the Renaissance, restore the enlightenment that was never truly, you know, obviously gained.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:20.760]  But you can call the revolution and most revolutionaries kidnap people or rob banks or, or, or, or, you know, rob shipments of gold bars to fund themselves.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:30.760]  We don't do that. We sell high quality products. But understand there was a revolution, organic food going back a decade ago, 15 years ago, where there wasn't organic food anywhere to be gotten.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:39.760]  People started buying it. The price went down. The variety went up. Now you go to Target or Walmart, it says organic, this organic, that still there's some fraud there half the time, but it doesn't matter.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:51.760]  We're winning the culture war. So just fighting with each other over what color we are. That's an example when you support people like Cynthia McKinney or Mr. Steele or others who are independent voices.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:57.760]  Doesn't mean you totally agree with them, but they see the empire. They see the dehumanizing tyranny. They're speaking out against it.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:15.760]  And when you support them, when you, you know, go get one of Steele's books or go and support one of the projects of Cynthia McKinney or any other guests we have on, it builds an economy of true diversity of ideas, not the one party two headed monster that we're dealing with.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760]  So that said, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:31.760]  Now, Cynthia McKinney again is going to be riding shotgun with us five minutes to the next hour. Mr. Steele will be with us to the bottom of the next hour. And he joins us now to have a triple, triple threat here for folks watching on television with a split screen.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:39.760]  Robert David Steele wants to get into race war. Trump presidency, the destabilization program that he and Dr. McKinney think is going on.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:48.760]  We haven't gotten into Beyonce yet in her music videos. We'll also talk about how Bernie Sanders and George Soros and the riots are supporting elements in the Hillary show.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  How the Secret Service colleagues are planning to release dirt on Hillary after she becomes the nominee. Sanders refusing to introduce the electoral reform act because he's bought and paid for by Hillary.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:13.760]  How Trump can win and why his current staff sucks. How we are all black now and how Trump can win big with both great disruptor and great uniter on the four angry groups, whites, blacks, Latinos and youth and college degrees and no work.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:20.760]  And so he's got seven paths to victory that I can try to get to Donald Trump. I mean, he's very hard to get to and pretty much listens to himself.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:30.760]  And so a lot of exciting things to talk about. Now, going back to Cynthia McKinney to finish her point, she got cut off by the break and to introduce the topic of why you're both here.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  Dr. McKinney, looking at media control, looking at Beyonce, just one example, looking at the NFL and the Pentagon funding, they really got upset when I talked about this last week and had hundreds of publications come out and demonize this broadcast.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.760]  What do you think is behind that?
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:41:13.760]  Well, I have to believe that just as we have these color revolutions that are fabricated around the world, that eventually what the United States does to other countries, those who orchestrate those activities don't hesitate to do it inside the United States as well.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:28.760]  And we saw that with Cointel Pro and the Frank Church Committee report where Senator Church actually asked the question, well, you know, you home this here and did you bring it home?
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  And the answer is yes. Those tactics, illegal and un-American, as they were at the time, were brought home. And so I absolutely see a necessity for those of us who, I mean, you know, it's almost like, I can't say left and right any longer,
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:58.760]  because quite frankly, it's almost like there is no left and right anymore.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:15.760]  It's who has the values and the care and concern about the people of the United States and of course the rest of the world to care enough to come together despite what's supposed to keep us apart.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:32.760]  And that is what I've been committed to and that's what I'm trying to do. Actually, I've been invited to go to the Democrat Convention as well as the Republican Convention, not on the inside, but on the outside.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:47.760]  And trying to talk to people and use those skills that I learned while I was in the Congress and having to reach out to all different kinds of people to reach out Democrat, Republican.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:57.760]  Let's come together, let's work together on one or two projects that will allow us to, in fact, take our country back.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:04.760]  Absolutely. I want to get Mr. Steele introduced here and talk about Beyonce and then introduce that into larger topics.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:15.760]  But so many people said, really, CIA, and my point is that whole platform is government run, government finance. The CIA is just one noticeable name.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.760]  I mean, do I think she's getting marching orders herself? No.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  Our producers are pushing an agenda of rioting and attacking the police and you don't reform the police, you know, shooting them or burning them or going after them.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.760]  You do it taking your government back and then reforming it that way.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:38.760]  So the very globalists that have militarized our police now want the detonator to be the election, the inner city communities, the rest of it.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:40.760]  And you can really see it being set up.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:51.760]  I want to get Mr. Steele's take on this and his expert analysis, formerly with the Central Intelligence Agency, actually in the field, folks, not just sitting behind a desk on whether he agrees with Dr. McKinney.
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.760]  This is part of an attempt at beta testing a color revolution in this country.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:59.760]  Well, I absolutely agree with you, Alex.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.760]  And I love Dr. McKinney and most people don't realize she did a brilliant PhD thesis on Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:16.760]  This is a lady who not only represents the people of color, but she's deeply familiar with Latin America and all the good things that Latinos such as myself represent.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:26.760]  I think Charleston was actually a kid on drugs controlled and they were testing a false flag activity in the United States.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:35.760]  I personally believe that it's no longer CIA, it's contractors paid for by George Soros, among others.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:52.760]  So the cat is out and people are deathly afraid of the angry people represented by Donald Trump and the angry young people represented by Bernie Sanders coming together with veterans, soccer moms, Latinos and people of color.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.760]  Occupy was undermined by George Soros and Michael Bloomberg.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.760]  I believe we are now a hair away.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.760]  And frankly, Donald Trump is his own worst enemy.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.760]  I don't think he was planning to get this far.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.760]  And so he had a very shallow staff.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.760]  He ought to have Russ Bernay, a Poros campaign manager working for him.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.760]  He ought to have Cynthia McKinney at his side every single day.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:24.760]  And of course, I have seven specific things I wrote about in Counterpunch in August of 2015, but there's nobody on Trump's staff that answers the phone.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:33.760]  Well, I'll say this, you were here about on six, seven, eight months ago about Trump and you said he should reach out to the Sanders people then he is now doing that.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760]  So this stuff does trickle through to Trump.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.760]  I personally said a few things to him and then a week later, you know, he's saying, hey, let's all at the private federal reserve.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.760]  I think he's for real, I think he means well, but he is he is a bit old fashioned.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.760]  He's not very tech savvy.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760]  And so there are some issues there.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.760]  I agree with you and I'll tell you something.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]  This is this is Trump's election to lose.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:06.760]  I've just come back from Norway and Denmark and people are starting to realize not only all of the huge negatives on Hillary Clinton, warmonger, who her email scandal is not about a few secret emails.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.760]  Her email scandal is about a private foreign policy.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  Wayne Madsen broke this story and has appeared on your show.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.760]  Hillary Clinton was selling US foreign policy through the Clinton Foundation to the highest bidder.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.760]  And that woman should be under indictment for multiple murders as well as crimes against humanity.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:34.760]  The idea that Donald Trump might be an outrageous president is exceeded only by the atrocity of Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:41.760]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, I saw an RT article where the Russian government says, hey, you think Obama's been bad for Russian relations?
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:42.760]  Wait till Hillary gets in.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.760]  That's absolutely right.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:46.760]  And I agree with Putin.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.760]  I mean, he's pointed out that he's only got three bases overseas.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.760]  Donald Trump has some very good advisors.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:47:03.760]  He also has some crazy people, but he has some very good advisors who are starting to point out that the easiest way to reduce the Pentagon budget and make America strong again is to close all of those overseas bases.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:04.760]  That's step one.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760]  And then have a grand strategy summit.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  Absolutely.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.760]  And then they claim, oh, the Pentagon says we save money being overseas bull.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.760]  We have nuclear weapons.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  If Kim Jong-un tries to invade, he'll be destroyed.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.760]  I mean, it's all just circus behavior.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  It's not just circus behavior.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.760]  Dr. McKinney and I have talked about this a lot and I really respect her leadership.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:34.760]  The bottom line is that General Bob Scales has pointed out that the infantry is 4% of the force takes 80% of the casualties and gets 1% of the budget.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:42.760]  Pentagon waste is documented at between 45% weapons acquisition to 75% in Afghanistan.
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.760]  We need a 450 ship Navy, a long haul air force and an air mobile army.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.760]  But the first thing you look at the F 35, you talk about treason, it's over a billion dollars.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.760]  It isn't as good as an F 15 from 30 years ago.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.760]  Look, the Pentagon is a corrupt cesspool.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:08.760]  And the first thing we have to do is get rid of half of the flag officers, half of the senior executive officers and two thirds of the contractors.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:12.760]  Well, let me then expand on this because people really want to know and it struck a chord.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.760]  The nerve of Esquire and New York Daily News and others to come out and say, I'm insane.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  There's no government involvement in the NFL.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.760]  And in the video, I said the CIA's been involved, showed articles.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760]  I said the Pentagon's been involved, showed articles.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.760]  The ban on domestic propaganda lifted three years ago, including deception against the American people by the CIA.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:36.760]  And then they sat there and told their readers that none of it existed.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.760]  Is that why the media has a 6% trust rate?
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.760]  Don't these people get that they're lying to folks, but it's not working anymore?
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.760]  And then Dr. McKinney pop in any time.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.760]  Well, I want to defer to Dr. McKinney.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.760]  I will just say that Alan Dulles and the people after him are on record as saying they own the media.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.760]  Now, that's not quite true today.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.760]  The media is owned by the same 40 billionaires that own Congress.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.760]  But the bottom line is that the CIA sources and methods have proliferated.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.760]  It's now legal to do propaganda in the United States.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:17.760]  And Matt Tabby's written a great book on Griff Topia, which is essentially the legalization of crimes against humanity.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  The two-party tyranny.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:27.760]  I had to run for president to find out that we have eight parties and that a majority of the Americans no longer consider them part of either of the two-party tyranny.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:39.760]  We're out of control. And Donald Trump is the one guy, if he's not assassinated, who has a prospect for actually restoring Article 1 of the Constitution.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.760]  Let me raise that, Dr. McKinney. That's a really good point, though.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:56.760]  I mean, isn't this the death of the two-party system showing it's a fraud when they just start stealing delegates from Sanders, stealing them from Trump, cancelling primaries altogether, and then looking at us with a straight face going, you don't vote.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:57.760]  I mean, they really are arrogant.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:49:59.760]  Priebus up there smiling, Dr. McKinney.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  Well, I think the fractures that always existed in the U.S. polity have come to the forefront now, so that average ordinary citizens are starting to go, what is this, a super delegate, and why is my vote not counting?
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  So you've got people who now understand that these landmines have been placed inside the system to keep us from having control of the system that we're supposed to control in the first place.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:56.760]  That's right. So I think it's a darn good thing that Bernie Sanders has taken it to Hillary so effectively that the Democratic establishment has had to resort to...
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:09.760]  That's right. Stay there, doctor. You can come right back. Great points.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:36.760]  I think body armor is just for commandos. Think again. In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:48.760]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds, and priced at around $500. It won't break the bank. The whole kit weighs just 10 pounds.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:58.760]  Let it up for your 7-year-old or 70-year-old. Go to infidelbodyarmor.com and get yours today. That's infidelbodyarmor.com. Just won't quit.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:22.760]  So much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:31.760]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:38.760]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling. It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:50.760]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield, nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula, and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:53:08.760]  It is exclusive to InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsLife family of incredible products.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:27.760]  Only for a limited time to GCN listeners. He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:39.760]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you. Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book? The answer is simple.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:50.760]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless. Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:54:11.760]  Go to waronthegrid.com. That's waronthegrid.com. Don't wait. Waronthegrid.com.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:23.760]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:48.760]  What is your gut? You're a smart lady, been in Congress, been around the world. What does your gut tell you about where this world is going?
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  Because when the media has a 6% approval rating and Congress has a 9% approval rating, they've got to know they're not operating with the consent of the governed.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:14.760]  Now, they start openly installing leaders in sham elections. No one really has the responsibility to follow these laws anymore. Are we just waking up and realizing we were kind of in an oligarchy all along? Dr. McKinney?
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:43.760]  Well, you know, former President Jimmy Carter said that we were in an oligarchy at least about two years ago. He made that announcement, and for some of us who have been observing this situation, so now you've got an awakening of people who really now have gotten inside the system with both Trump and Sanders
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:56:03.760]  to learn how rotten to the core the system has become. Now, I have to also say that the system has become so rotten on our watch. So just as we had the power to stop it and fail to do so, we still have the power to stop it.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:26.760]  But this time, I believe the news is so tight around the republic itself that the United States of America, as we have known the United States of America, will cease to exist.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:37.760]  Robert David Steele, I agree with you that we talk about CIA, that's more of a metaphor. It's CIA technologies, mind control, propaganda technologies are the big foundations, and media are using the CIA is involved as well.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  That's just one of the better known groups. So I, you know, use that in the headline to get people's attention. I don't think their propaganda is working.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:48.760]  And when I talk to people that are in the government, even high level, they don't like what's going on.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:59.760]  So I mean, how many controllers are there who are forcing their agenda on humanity? It seems like we should just all stop complying. People inside the government should should should just stop complying.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.760]  And this thing would fall very, very quickly.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:10.760]  I believe Donald Trump is being severely underestimated. I mean, I'm a huge fan of Fox News, mostly because I refuse to watch CNN.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:18.760]  But they, when they talk about Trump versus Hillary, they have no idea what happens if Donald Trump calls for a general strike.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  What happens if Donald Trump named Cynthia McKinney as his vice president? I think she would be an absolutely phenomenal choice.
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  What happens if the people of color and the Latinos actually get outreach?
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:36.760]  Now, in the half hour when I'm on with you, I'll go with the seven things that I that I came on the show to state.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:47.760]  But the bottom line here is that imagine a day, not just without Mexicans, but a day without white people and black people, that will rock the nation.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:51.760]  Well, they're definitely trying to divide everybody.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:59.760]  And I just, in my gut, see the destabilization happening all over the world.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.760]  And it makes me wonder how much crazier can it get?
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  Well, it can get a whole lot crazier.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.760]  It can get a whole lot crazier.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:23.760]  And that's my point, that we don't have much time before the noose is tightened around the neck of the U.S. body politic.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:31.760]  And if we are to save this body and prevent it from becoming a cadaver, we have got to act and act fast.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:37.760]  And I agree with you, Alex, that not only resistance, but failure to comply.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.760]  We've got to stop complying.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:41.760]  Stay there. We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:43.760]  We're already into the third hour, folks.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.760]  Final second was Cynthia McKinney, and then I'm going to be with Robert David Steele, formerly in the CIA, to break down how we take the country back.
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:53.760]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:59:01.760]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:10.760]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:14.760]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:20.760]  Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.760]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:39.760]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:48.760]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at inforwarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:59:48.760 --> 02:00:11.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:19.760]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:24.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:41.760]  Dr. Cynthia McKinney is in Bangladesh, India. Robert David Steele joins us from the United States. I'm coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:54.760]  Look, we're living in a very epic time right now, and all I know is the globalist or anti-human eugenicists, they're creating a science of control in their own words.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:02.760]  They're targeting everybody, and the only way we beat them is coming together. But that means coming together with ideas that are outside their box and outside their system.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:12.760]  And that's what it comes down to. I'll start with this. Big mega banks shouldn't be tax exempt, and we shouldn't have to pay for the derivatives, and they shouldn't be able to hold us hostage, threatening to implode the world economy.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:27.760]  And Dr. McKinney, we saw this in 2007 and 2008. They admit it's much bigger and worse now. They're intending to hold us hostage again and then probably again in another decade to bring in total tyranny and to bring in their corporate world government.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.760]  How do we stop that, or do you agree that that's one of the big threats?
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:44.760]  Oh, I absolutely agree that that's a big threat. And, you know, there are some groups that have organized now that have average ordinary folks running for Congress.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:59.760]  There's a group that's trying to break the hold of the Democratic Party from the black vote and get black voters to think more independently and, of course, more critically.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:13.760]  And that's desperately needed, but I can guarantee you that if we fail to come together, that the situation is dire for the United States and for the future of our country.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:23.760]  Therefore, that is why I've been invited to go to the GOP convention and the Democratic Party convention on the outside, not on the inside.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:32.760]  And the invitation came from people on the left who now get it that we have got to talk to people on the quote, unquote, right.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:39.760]  Because, as I said, the left and the right have come together and need to come together.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.760]  And that's why they're trying to cause a foe fight at the grassroots to get everybody at each other's throats.
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:53.760]  I mean, do you agree with Steel as you're talking about this after you're gone, that they are trying to start a sex war, a race war, light just to create more fear?
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:06.760]  Absolutely. I mean, you know, that I think that's what this this rioting at the Trump campaign events is all about.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:14.760]  And it's not. And as I say, I don't want to marginalize in any way people who have a legitimate grievance.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.760]  But those are not the people who are throwing things and beating and bashing in windows and things like that.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:29.760]  I absolutely see that the possibility of a color revolution coming home in the United States.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:36.760]  Undoubtedly, that's what the globalists are trying when we come back and we'll talk about who the players are, how we stop them with Robert David Steel,
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:40.760]  formerly with the CIA case officer on the ground, so a real former CIA guy.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.760]  It's so giant now, all these agencies and analysts and all the rest of it and every blue blood, you know, their son or daughters has a CIA badge now.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:51.760]  They're just everywhere running around like they're the new royalty, truly sickening.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.760]  So we're going to be breaking all that down with a real former CIA guy, Robert David Steel straight ahead, RobertDavidSteel.com.
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.760]  Cynthia McKinney, All Things Cynthia McKinney.com.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.760]  Dr. McKinney, if you're ever coming through Texas or whatever, we'd love to have you in the studio.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:05.760]  Thank you for your tireless work defending free humanity.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:09.760]  Thank you, Alex. Bye, Robert.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.760]  I love you.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.760]  She's a great lady. We're going to go to break. Dave, we're going to break in 30 seconds. What do you want to hit first when we come back?
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:23.760]  Oh, I want to outline seven past the victory. Trump wasn't expecting to get this far.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:28.760]  So you really think he wasn't expecting to get this far? What was the point of running just to bring these issues up?
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  He's just like Steve Forks. I mean, exactly. He wanted a little status and the Republican Party self-destructed and God bless them because Donald Trump is our last chance.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.760]  It seems like all the insiders and experts are saying that.
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:47.760]  Explain to us why is the last chance we come back in three minutes. Robert David Steele is our guest. Find out about his group of amazing websites.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:05:10.760]  Let's just by going to his main site, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.760]  The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Departments of Defense, Energy, Commerce and Health and Services.
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:31.760]  It also identifies the U.S. embassies in Santiago and Kathmandu as well as the Department of the Navy in Gulfport, Mississippi as targets.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:35.760]  It includes someone who appears to have worked for Australia's Department of Defense as well.
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:41.760]  While the group's intentions are sinister, it's unlikely that the so-called hack and veal is much new or actionable information.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:47.760]  The hackers list phone numbers with each person, many of which are general numbers of institutions or offices.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:54.760]  Though several appear to be correct current office lines, the group also posted zip codes in cities often listed as Washington, D.C.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:58.760]  Allegedly affiliated with their targets but no specific home or work addresses.
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:02.760]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:10.760]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:15.760]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:18.760]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:20.760]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.760]  Brainforce. It's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:07.760]  RobDoo joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:11.760]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.760]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.760]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:21.760]  I got my bottle of brainforce right there. I popped two of them.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:25.760]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.760]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:32.760]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:38.760]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.760]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:48.760]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:08:16.760]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:23.760]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:30.760]  I will be back this Sunday live in studio four to six p.m. Central Standard Time.
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:38.760]  But on air 21 years and syndicated for 19, I started the Sunday show about nine years ago
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  because a lot of stations thought I was too radical. They knew that we got listeners and ratings and the rest of it.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:47.760]  But if they would pick up the Sunday show, they would find out that it wasn't as radical as they thought
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:51.760]  that the listeners would resonate with it and then the pattern almost always went this way.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.760]  Then I'd be put on taped at night and then finally live during the day.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:03.760]  Now as AM and FM declines because of competition with the internet, it's more important than ever that we be on AM and FM affiliates
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.760]  because that's where you can still reach some giant audiences and that we not just be on internet only
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:12.760]  where they can come in and try to censor us. We need to be multi-platformed.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:16.760]  And there's so many ways they're trying to censor us and shut us down.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  I don't sit here and whine about it. I try to get around it. I try to move over it.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.760]  I try to adapt, improvise, whatever. I guess steals the form of a marine. He gets that.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.760]  But this is a time to realize everything you do is counting now.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:33.760]  It's a quickening, an acceleration, a political singularity we're moving towards,
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:37.760]  whether that's going to happen as a complete singularity or approach something similar to it.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.760]  Time is being compacted. The elites know this. Most of them are digging into armored redoubts.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.760]  Most billionaires I've talked to are freaked out and scared, but are bullied by a group above them, the super elite.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:53.760]  And Steele talks a lot about that. Not everybody that's rich is your enemy.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:58.760]  Not everybody that's in a leftist scripture enemy. Not every cop's your enemy.
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:02.760]  Most people just want to live in a free country, in a free world and care about their kids.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:09.760]  The problem is there's some really bad actors that to run the world have to sabotage normal human activity
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.760]  and really create dysfunction to rule chaos.
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  So they want a chaos-based world economy or a true collaborative economy based on Renaissance.
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:23.760]  That's my view. We'll get Steele's overall view on where we are, how we change things, how powerful ideas are.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:31.760]  But listen, realize your ideas have power. Your choices in the marketplace and politically and everything have huge effects.
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:36.760]  And the system wants to try to disenfranchise you because you do have power.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.760]  Because they are stealing elections is why we should be voting.
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  To get in, to be involved, to expose what's happening.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.760]  They told Trump that we're going to our guest.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.760]  Shut up and stop complaining. It's always been this way.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:51.760]  No, they haven't always tried to use their crooked rules unless there's an emergency.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:56.760]  So Trump running forced them to try to steal the election, forced them to try this scam,
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:00.760]  and now it's out in the open blowing up in their face. Resistance is victory.
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:04.760]  Because there's corruption, we don't just roll over in the ditch and give up.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:07.760]  Exposing it is what will bring it down in my historical view.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.760]  That's why it's more important than ever to spread the word about infowars.com, the articles, the videos,
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.760]  to sign up for our free newsletter and email so we can stay in contact with you as censorship intensifies.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.760]  infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.760]  It's why you should value all the different diverse ideas that are out there and promote them on Facebook and Twitter.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.760]  As they try to censor more, that shows we have power.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  You've got to intensify what you're doing.
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.760]  Not go, oh, they're censoring me. I'm going to shut up.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.760]  No, fight that much harder because we're hurting them.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:42.760]  Now, still I'm ranting. I want to just set the table there for taking action against tyranny.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.760]  How do we do that?
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:50.760]  What is your worldview of the competing ideas and what are the seven key points you keep making to Trump?
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:59.760]  Well, I keep trying to get them to Trump, but very candidly, I don't think his campaign staff reads their emails or answers the phone.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.760]  He has a very shallow staff and he deeply desperately needs to fix that.
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.760]  Our first priority should be to keep Trump from being assassinated.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:17.760]  And he does that by weaving a truth and reconciliation theme and a total quick claim for all of the evil that's been done in the past.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.760]  Just get out of our way. Let us restore integrity to our electoral system.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  I've published two white papers on Amazon, Democracy Riots.
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:31.760]  We're all black now. Deal with it and revolution how Trump can win in their 99 cent white papers.
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:33.760]  They're also free online at my website.
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.760]  Now, seven specific things that Trump can do in less than one minute.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:44.760]  One, get Governor Abbott and Mike Levin, the radio show host, to run a virtual constitutional convention in Texas.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:52.760]  Two, run an unemployment workshop in New York City that shames the banks and corporations and makes it clear the real unemployment rate is 23%.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:57.760]  You're right. He should lay out how globalism screws people, not just say China is screwing us.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:10.760]  Well, let me point out that under the Clintons as well as Dick Cheney and now Barack Obama, we have not only put more black people in jail because of Bill Clinton's legislation and the prison act,
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:17.760]  but we have also exported more jobs because of NAFTA and other things that Clinton put in place for Reuben and Wall Street.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.760]  Well, Hillary Clinton called black people basically pharaoh animals that need to be made to heal.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:32.760]  I don't get why if you're known racist and your mentor was a grand dragon, why you get to say black people are animals or whatever.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:34.760]  I don't know why she gets to say that.
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  I'm quite sure she thinks they don't read or watch TV either.
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  Look, that woman is evil and my secret service buddies have so much dirt on her.
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:44.760]  Let's get into that before we get into your seventh plan.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:45.760]  That's important.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:46.760]  Say that again.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  Talk about your secret service news.
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:50.760]  I mean, I know that's in your talking points.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:59.760]  Well, look, Hillary Clinton has had a number of overnight guests and my secret service pals who are very angry at her because she treats people that serve her like dirt.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.760]  I have never heard my buddies talk worse about anyone.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  She is evil and rude and mean and selfish and I think she's a thief.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  So bottom line is I don't think people really understand just how easy it is going to be for Donald Trump to smash Hillary Clinton when he gets to his.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:21.760]  Let's elaborate on that.
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  I mean, you're saying your sources are saying this is going to be leaked once she's the nominee.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.760]  I think so, yes.
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:28.760]  Well, that's bombshell.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:30.760]  Here's the problem.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.760]  Levin has been basically totally pulled over to be totally anti-Trump.
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  But I hear that would be a good idea if I mean, I wish they would listen to you, but nobody's bold.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:41.760]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:44.760]  I mean, Trump Trump is his own best advisor.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:50.760]  Unfortunately, the people around Trump lack imagination and they lack the ability to think outside the box.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:59.760]  So the seven points that I published in Counterpunch in an article on 14 August 2015, it was called countercoup how Donald Trump can win.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  I've updated these points.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:02.760]  Now, here's the bottom line.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.760]  Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:07.760]  Bernie has cut a deal with the devil.
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  He's already conceded to Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  He's already making plans to turn over his mailing list to Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:15.760]  He's bought and paid for.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:30.760]  But Donald Trump has the power to work with the Tea Party representatives in the House and to make the deal with Bernie Sanders and work with Ron Paul and Dennis Kasinich to have an electoral reform summit and introduce the electoral reform act.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:36.760]  And again, you said this, you said this almost a year ago in August, you know, nine months ago, it's all coming true now.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  You said he could win even back then when people thought it was a joke.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:40.760]  Absolutely.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.760]  And I've told him and others have, you need to go reach out to Ron Paul.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:52.760]  You need to get him to come out and just endorse monetary reform on at the Fed, not even your candidacy, but to endorse electoral reform showing the election fraud.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:57.760]  Part of the problem is that Trump has not figured out how to unify everybody.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:05.760]  For example, Ron Paul and Dennis Kasinich are two of my favorite people along with Dr. McKinney, and they have a very special nonpartisan relationship.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  If he were to get them and Jesse Ventura and Jill Stein and a few others into an electoral reform summit, he would not only expose the two party tyranny, and he would also, frankly, shame Bernie Sanders, because 0.12 in the Electoral Reform Act is an end to all superdelegates.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  Sure.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:29.760]  And wouldn't that show that he's a true bona fide populist and that he wants a coalition to bring in all these people and have a big meeting with them on TV?
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  Trump has integrity right now. He lacks imagination among his staff. If he were to force through the Electoral Reform Act, that would allow 20 to 30 seats being vacated on the hill to be occupied by Constitution, libertarian, green, independent, even working families.
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:59.760]  The trade-off for the Republicans is they have to open the tent to the Constitution and libertarians who really feel like the grand old party has been betrayed. I mean, I'm a Reagan Republican.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:10.760]  Exactly. The Republican leadership says we'd rather have Hillary than let the libertarians come in and even have a seat, but doesn't this just herald the end of the one party, two-head monopoly?
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:14.760]  I can sense and smell they're on their last legs. I mean, I really think...
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  It does, but let's not waste this election. Let's not waste this election. What we have to do is we have to reach Trump, get him to expand his staff.
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:31.760]  For instance, Russ Fernay is Ross Perot's campaign manager. Trump should have Russ working on the independence right now as we speak.
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:47.760]  Trump should already be managing, and here are my other three points, a Latino truth and reconciliation event in Florida, a national conversation about a fantasy cabinet, the way we do fantasy football, get the public engaged, a national conversation...
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:57.760]  Make it all about the type of government he's... because he has given some details, but yeah, make it all about a big display, you know, a concept deal about the great city we're going to build.
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:07.760]  Yes, and Ben and Jerry should be recruited by Trump to run a national conversation on creating a balanced budget, and last but not least, we should eliminate all taxes.
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:18.760]  We should have an automated payment transaction tax, which is a tiny little tax on every transaction, especially transactions that are not taxed now, such as currency and stock transactions.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  After Feige is still alive, he should be an advisor to Trump. Well, instead we have the megabanks financing a fake social revolution and more taxes.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:35.760]  We got to explain to the people, the working folks, Kennedy cut taxes by 50% and tax receipts doubled in one year. They just don't get it.
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:42.760]  They just don't understand that the megabanks already ran off with a golden goose. They want to kill the latter into prosperity.
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:49.760]  Look, we're going crazy. We're going insane as a nation. I'm looking at the suicide rates going up. I'm looking at the actual unemployment rate.
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:53.760]  Oh, that's my next question. Why do people seem like they're going so crazy?
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:19:07.760]  I think it's called cognitive dissonance. I wrote my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and the most popular graphic at Phi Beta Iota.net is the graphic that shows all of the preconditions of revolution that exist in the United States today.
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.760]  The two biggest ones are concentration of wealth and the loss of legitimacy of the government.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:21.760]  And every historical graph that you've got on your site, but other ones as well, so we are just right for war, disaster. I'm not trying to be a fair monger, but I mean, are we not entering that area?
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:38.760]  You're absolutely right. And frankly, Donald Trump, if he were to expand his perception, if he were to expand and take these seven ideas for action, he's probably our last chance for a nonviolent revolution that restores integrity to how we govern the United States of America.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:52.760]  Phi Beta Iota.net is one of his websites, RobertDavidSteel.com. It's easy to remember. You can get to Phi Beta Iota.net from there. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com. Wow, we've got to have Mr. Steele back up in the near future.

[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:26.760]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them.

They fold in on themselves and lose their functional value. One World Whey undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe restores these potent proteins back to their original shapes the body can use.
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:29.760]  I chose to try One World Whey first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe drugs to my delight. It worked after stabbing pain for years to have it completely gone as a miracle.
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:47.760]  I'd like to also stress that for me, it took several months of taking One World Whey before I had improvement and then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed. So now I tell my friends, give your body time to make use of the healing power of One World Whey.

[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:34.760]  Rock t-shirt for peace cells with a U.N. building and nuclear war on it with a guy wearing a CIA badge with a skull.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:48.760]  And if you'd told me back then that I'd be with a syndicated radio show on something called the Internet with reporters in San Francisco skyping in worldwide with millions of viewers and listeners, I'd tell you you were crazy.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:54.760]  Now I'm 42. And we're in the year 2016. And Rob Do is in.
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:04.760]  Well, the place that Mark Twain said the coldest winter ever spent was the summer in San Francisco and viral videos.
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:10.760]  I'm up this morning watching Fox News on the elliptical and I see all this footage of people being beaten, cars running over people.
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:19.760]  Now I'm thinking, man, Rob doing them. We're supposed to be out there. Hope they're safe. And then I didn't realize it was our footage because the media cropped it and didn't give us credit, but whatever.
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.760]  He's now in San Francisco. He just got off a plane. He's out there with the demonstrators. I guess they haven't attacked you yet.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  This looks like a more liberal group than the folks with the Mexican flags. What have you witnessed last night and today? Rob Do.
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:42.760]  Rob Do reporting live from San Francisco just outside the Hyatt Regency near the airport. And what we have right now, it seems the demonstrators have segregated themselves.
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  You have the social justice lawyer, Black Lives Matter crowd. And then just beyond over this way, you have the pro Mexican anti United States crowd.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  So they've mixed themselves up. We've got more girls bearing their chests here for equality.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:05.760]  So maybe we'll go over and get a little shot of that. But you can see they blocked Alex, but both sides of the entrance into the Hyatt Regency.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  And this seems to be their modus operandi to stop any bastion of free speech.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:20.760]  And I was just approached by a couple guys wearing green nacre chips that they keep putting over their face and talking about, oh, the juice boxes are going to get us.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:24.760]  Oh, the vaccines are going to get us. Hey, man, I said, take your flu shot.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:30.760]  No, I saw you during the break. Two guys that probably like 22 look like they're about 14 and they walked over. We're laughing.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:37.760]  Yeah, there's no chemicals in the food and the water. The cancer isn't exploding. It's all funny. I'm surprised they didn't call us racists, Rob.
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:43.760]  They did not call us racists. They called us crooks and crazy people. I got a little bit of that yesterday and I love it.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.760]  I've been putting all these videos. We still put up all the videos we tried yesterday, Alex, which hasn't been enough time.
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:57.760]  Well, dude, your Skype was crystal clear before we put you on air and now it's degraded. We might have to reconnect briefly, but we've got Peter Schiff joining us to get into the economy in the next segment.
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:04.760]  But hopefully just upload a video that you walk around and talk to these ding-dongs and then upload that so folks can see the nightly news tonight.
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:06.760]  But what are you expecting this evening?
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:16.760]  Well, I have no idea. I did not expect what happened last night to happen. It started off. We interviewed on the nightly news. We didn't see any protesters after we got done with that.
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:23.760]  It started showing up, but the cops placed a barrier in between the protesters and the Trump supporters.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:29.760]  But then after it got dark, that's when it got crazy. People were trying to leave. There were people spinning out in the road.
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  You can see some of the video. That was probably the most dangerous part right there when people were blocking streets and people were spinning out in the midst of people.
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:43.760]  Very dangerous what was going on. They started spray painting signs. They spray painted a car. We got a guy. It got beat up.
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:48.760]  Josh got that on tape. I got the footage afterwards. The guy had blood all over his face. He was wearing a Donald Trump shirt.
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:56.760]  And he was just trying to leave the event. And I memed that out this morning. I guess this is what they mean by Love Trump's tape.
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:01.760]  Because as far as I know, the guy wasn't doing anything. He was just trying to leave the event after it was over.
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  And so I guess that was the cue for the thugs out there to, you know...
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:10.760]  But imagine if you're in your car and there's hundreds of people trying to drag you out of it.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:14.760]  And there's a guy trying to run people over with a car. I'm surprised nobody got shot.
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:20.760]  I'm just telling you. He's trying to drag me out of my car. You're going to have a little dirty hair experience. I'm just telling you.
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:29.760]  So I got a shot earlier. This guy popped up out of his sunroof, had a Trump shirt on and people were surrounding him screaming at him.
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:35.760]  And then he got back in and then Josh got it later where they were spray painting the car, beating on the car, terrorizing the girl who was driving.
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  Four free speech. Four free speech. Exactly. Exactly. They were like, we're peaceful. We're peaceful as they're beating on cars and spray painting things and vandalizing.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:49.760]  They were vandalizing the signs. They broke out the windows out of a police car. Slash tires of another one.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:56.760]  So I did not expect it to go that far. And it just happened. It seemed to happen magically like it was...
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:02.760]  Listen, I can tell there's going to be some trickly puffs in that crowd. There's some new superstars we need to talk to.
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:06.760]  The ding-dongs that make fun of us about vaccines. We need to go because they just worship the government.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  They worship the state. These are the most gullible dumb... I mean, they hate cops, the lowest level of the government, but they love the big multinationals as their mommy and their daddy. It's crazy.
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:17.760]  Other points, dude.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  Well, I do want to point out on the Facebook group yesterday, they did say they were going to shut down the road and they didn't up doing that.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  I didn't think that was going to happen. Now, I was reading some of the comments on this post. They were talking about tomatoes and they've already shut down the road here.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:41.760]  It seems for at least a time being. But if you turn around, you can see the cops have also blocked off the entrance into this area. They're allowing pedestrian traffic.
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:50.760]  Well, dude, dude, be safe tonight. We're going to be following it at infowars.com. And obviously throughout the weekend, we've got a guest coming up, but continue, my friend.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:57.760]  And come on in the next hour, if you want, when David Knight tells TV, if he likes to have you. Good job. Really great job, guys.
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:31.760]  That is the ultimate concern. The concentration of power, the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:38.760]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution. They believe they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:48.760]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance. People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:57.760]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are. Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:19.760]  For infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:42.760]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:50.760]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:10.760]  Thank you, brother.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.760]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:18.760]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.760]  Welcome to the Info War.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.760]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.760]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacin I-9.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:32.760]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:35.760]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:36.760]  What products are you taking?
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:42.760]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun X2.
[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:48.760]  Even got a little a day and a four, so when I just free up everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:53.760]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:58.760]  That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:16.760]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:22.760]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:28.760]  The first reports to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:32.760]  It is a big idea. A new order.
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:41.760]  It was almost as if you were a planned implosion. It just banked.
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:09.760]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:13.760]  Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be off.
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:18.760]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  Global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge. But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:42.760]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:48.760]  I was thinking about something this morning. I don't think a term I've heard anybody use, but I'm sure it has been used.
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:53.760]  There's not much new under heaven and earth, is there?
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:35:10.760]  But the mainstream media is committing suicide. Two weeks ago, the Associated Press did a national scientific poll and found that 6% of people trust the mainstream media.
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:16.760]  Alternative media has got a trust rate of higher than 70-80%. We have one higher than that.
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  And I'm not even so sure people should trust that. I don't know if people can trust us. We try our best to tell the truth. We're not perfect.
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  But so many other big corporations and establishment groups are now posing as independent groups as well. So it's definitely an information war.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:40.760]  But think about how past say this broadcast has gotten in many ways.
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  World government, megabanks tax exempt, globalism, the pope calling for planetary government. All over the country they're saying women being women is now hurtful to women that don't consider themselves women.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:36:01.760]  University of Washington is trying to ban advertisements saying, you know, join the cheerleaders and here's how we want you to dress and look sexy, you know, look feminine.
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:09.760]  There's an all-out attack on reality and now we learn Obamacare is going to go up again, the Associated Press reports.
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:16.760]  Meanwhile, Bloomberg columnist compares Trump nationalism to Nazi rhetoric.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:27.760]  The EU was coming out, Obama and others saying, you know, it's like Hitler not staying in the EU. The EU was a Nazi scheme. It's just crazy.
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:42.760]  We're going to our guest, Peter Sheff of Europac.com to get into the economy. Boy, I tell you, it is all breaking loose now. So serious. But how serious is it? But I just want to ask him separately is Ron Paul's former top advisor on the economy and things like that.
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  What he thinks of the state of the world politics, 500 people go out and run cars through people and bash people's heads in and attack the police and CNN says it's Trump's fault. I mean, it's getting crazy.
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:06.760]  Just the bizarreness of the mainstream media. I mean, they're out of bullets. Nobody believes them, but they still sit there and try to invert reality.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  We're going to be talking to Peter Sheff here in just a moment. First off, in this uncertain world with the globalist digging in and getting storeable food and armored vehicles and, you know, running around and preparing for collapse.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:29.760]  I hope that doesn't happen. But I know we're sitting on top of the biggest bubble the world's ever seen. Sheff talks about that forever. Ron Paul, you know, now Trump is.
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:38.760]  I personally am getting ready. Now, I don't even have a gold sponsor right now. I think we should get gold and silver. I'm on the end now that it's going to be going up. It's been going up.
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  But I just historically what's coming, paper money is going to be dead. And there's this Psyop out there, you know, the Oh, no, gold and silver are going to go down. They're only going up in my view.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:38:01.760]  But I'm now digressing off another subject, something everybody really, really needs is storeable food. And I've gone out and found the very best company, my Patriots supply. We have their whole spectrum of food updated weekly at infowarstore.com.
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  We're allowed to offer you the lowest price out there without a distributor deal. They're one of the biggest in the country, very respected.
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:19.760]  But I got a special contract by private labeling it where I'm allowed to go 30 to 40% below the regular retail, the still a great deal. But I can only do it a few times a year. This is one of those deals.
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:27.760]  And it's making supplies go so low because people are buying a lot of it that we're going to stop very quickly because we don't want to make people wait weeks to get their food.
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:37.760]  We have delivery within a week right now. It's been freshly produced and made super high quality 30 to 40% off.
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  Super high quality, very, very low prices, infowarstore.com is the umbrella site or call toll free 888-253-3139. If you haven't gotten storeable foods, water filtration, firearms, a survival plan, friends and family you can count on, gold and silver, whatever the case may be, I think you're crazy.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:08.760]  That's me personally because we've been trying to stave off this global collapse for a long time, but you look at it, it is getting more and more evident that it is a probability, not a possibility.
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:13.760]  Now that's my view. Infowarstore.com is also more important than ever to be healthy.
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:30.760]  And infowarstore.com is our line of nutraceuticals, supermail vitality is about to sell out, anthroplex is back in stock, you can get free shipping on orders of $50 or more, antipersent off for auto ship, DNA force is back in stock, and so much more.
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:47.760]  Secret 12 is such a popular product, the highest quality organic sublingual B12 out there that's so absorbable, big studies out about depression, schizophrenia, autism, you name it, from vitamin B12 deficiency because of gut flora problems, not allowing its breakdown and upload.
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:58.760]  That's why it's so important to get it by injection or under the tongue. Well, we don't sell it by the injection, obviously. That's prescription, but this is the same stuff that is in the prescription injections, and it's the organic type.
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:05.760]  It's got a 4.7 stars, infowarstore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  Okay, now shifting gears back into the economy, and our guest who joins us with updates over a few weeks, we appreciate that, uropac.com, Peter Schiff, Europe Pacific Capital, Billions Under Management predicted the 2008 crisis and so much more.
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:33.760]  He's been predicting that QE Unlimited wouldn't work, and he's been predicting much of what's now happened, and I've got a bunch of economic news after he starts breaking it down. I'm going to go over here today, but here are some of the headlines.
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  Simply the worst, Obama is the first president ever to not see a single year of 3% GDP growth. Very, very interesting to see that happening.
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:55.760]  We've got other reports here. White House struggles to explain weak economy as Obama boasts of job growth. U.S. economy expands to 0.5, pays weakest in two years.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  Let me just first ask Peter to shift this. Peter, we know that a lot of experts use old government accounting numbers. It still weren't perfect, but like John Williams and others, and they crunch things.
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:15.760]  And now that you do this yourself, obviously these are cooked numbers. So looking at this, what's the real state of the economy after seven and a half years of Obama? And then obviously they're admitting now the world economy is in deep crisis.
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:17.760]  Where are we going after that?
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  Well, the economy is a complete disaster. It's actually a lot worse than what people think because the only way they're able to manufacture the growth rates that we have is by pretending there's no inflation.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:43.760]  For example, the first quarter where they just told us that we got half a percent, 0.5 GDP growth. And by the way, the Atlanta Fed just forecasted, or not the Atlanta, the New York Fed is now forecasting 0.8% for the second quarter.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:52.760]  So not even a bounce back. But the government told us that inflation in the first quarter was just 0.7% on an annualized basis.
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:42:05.760]  Now, for the fourth quarter of last year, they told us that inflation was 0.9%. So theoretically, they're saying inflation went down. Oil prices were up 3.5% in the first quarter.
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  Rents were way up. In fact, year over year, rents are up 8%. All the prices are going up. And the government is claiming that inflation is practically non-existent.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:25.760]  Yet, even with non-existent inflation, the best they can do is a half a percent GDP growth. We are in a recession. Whether the government wants to acknowledge it or not, this is a recession.
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  Nothing that Obama did work. He inherited a mess. I agree. But he is going to leave his successor with an even bigger mess. The economy is in worse shape. The Fed made it worse.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:45.760]  And I think, yeah, they're going to be doing QE4. They're going to be cutting rates. They might be going negative. The only question is, will they do it before the election or after?
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:53.760]  Because if they go before the election, then they have to acknowledge how weak the economy is. And that undermines the message that Hillary is going to be running on.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:59.760]  And it hurts the credibility of Obama, who's going around the world taking credit for saving everybody.
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:08.760]  Here's my concern, correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't they just accelerated the same policies that Bush had who just continued the Clinton policies that set up this current scam we're under?
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:18.760]  A, and then B, Peter, my concern is, they say massive tax increases on middle class for the next banker bailout. They've only expanded derivatives.
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  So my concern is about what they're going to do to respond to this.
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:34.760]  Now, all Obama did was double down or triple down on the same failed policies that brought us the 08 crisis, which is why this one is better. It's going to be bigger, but nobody has prepared for it.
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:41.760]  Look, gold was at a new high for the year today. It almost hit 1,300. Silver made a new high for the year. Gold stocks were at a new high.
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:47.760]  You know, the average gold stock has doubled in price in the last three months. Some have tripled. Some have quadrupled.
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:53.760]  Sure. What about the lawsuit that zero hedge is reporting on now where they're basically admitting that gold has been manipulated?
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:56.760]  Well, who cares if it's been manipulated? It's going to go up. They can't stop it.
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.760]  No, but that's my point is it proves it's going to go up if they've been naked shorting in all along.
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:05.760]  Oh, yeah. Well, look, but a lot of the shorting has been because they don't understand what's going to happen.
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:11.760]  The typical hedge fund is blowing up right now. All the big money on Wall Street has been betting wrong for years.
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  Those bad bets are blowing up right now. It's like a deer in a headline moment for them. The dollar index just hit a new low for the year.
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:25.760]  We are heading for a dollar crisis. Gold prices are going to explode. I've been telling your audience this for months and months.
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:33.760]  I've been coming on the show. People need to do something. No, no, I told you, I'm not sure, but it just seems like common sense that there's massive inflation and currencies everywhere.
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:42.760]  And then gold's always been pegged as a backup currency. It's going to go up. They're artificially drove it down, but like a beach ball, you can't hold it at the bottom of the pool forever.
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:50.760]  The Chinese Yuan just had its biggest update yesterday since 2005 against the dollar. And the hedge funds are shorting Yuan.
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:58.760]  They are all positioned for the exact wrong outcome. There's still a window of opportunity. I mean, it's getting smaller and smaller.
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:10.760]  Where do you think gold will be on December 15th? It tends to every year have its peak in the fall and winter. How do you think it will get this year?
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:19.760]  I think gold is going a lot higher. Once we get through 1300, we're knocking on the door. I think we can move up to 1500 and get relatively soon.
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:30.760]  And if the Fed acknowledges the weakness in the economy that they're still denying, when the Fed came out with their statement a couple of days ago, they didn't raise rates, but they're still pretending that the economy is strong enough that a rate hike is coming.
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:39.760]  Sure. You and Dent had your friendly debate here, but it got a little bit heated. And I think you're a smart guy, made a lot of predictions like you have. And I guess demographic cliff.
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:50.760]  But I agree with you. The fact that there's limited amounts of gold and that everybody values it around the world, the Chinese and institutions are getting it. That's why it is going to go up. Scarcity means more value.
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:54.760]  And I don't see this as a dead cat bounce now. How long it's been going up.
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  Yeah. Dent is dead wrong on this. I mean, he's basically siding with Goldman Sachs and the mainstream on Wall Street. He believes in the dollar. He believes in the Fed.
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:12.760]  He thinks gold's going down. Put all your money in US dollars by US treasuries. He couldn't be more wrong. Hopefully he will, you know, acknowledge his mistake.
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:18.760]  I remember when he was on the phone on the show with me, I forget what price point he said that he would turn around and get bullish on gold.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:30.760]  If it got above 1400 or 1450, I forget where that was, but we're going to be there soon. So maybe he'll turn around and get on the right side of this trade because I'm afraid too many people are going to follow his advice and lose a lot of money.
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:36.760]  You've got to understand what's really going on. And once you understand this, you know how it's going to play out. You've got to get your money.
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:42.760]  Okay. Talk to me like I'm five years old because I am kind of what comes to this sometimes. I mean, I get it, but I want to hear it, but lay it out.
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:46.760]  In four minutes, Peter Schiff, tell me why gold and silver are going up.
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:54.760]  Well, gold and silver, first of all, the reason that gold went down and silver went down the last few years is because everybody believed that the Fed solved their problems.
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:47:03.760]  Everybody believed we had a healthy economy. The Fed could raise interest rates, shrinkage balance sheet, and that was wrong. The Fed didn't do anything.
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  They just blew a bigger bubble. All of our problems were made worse. And I was saying for years, the Fed couldn't raise interest rates.
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:16.760]  They were bluffing. If they tried, they would prick the bubble and the market would tank. And that's exactly what happened when they raised rates in December.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:17.760]  That exactly happened.
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:27.760]  That's backtracking. But as people figure this out, gold's going to go ballistic because everybody's going to dump the dollar because they only bought dollars because they thought the Fed was finished printing.
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:35.760]  They thought the Fed was going to raise rates when they realized they can never raise rates that they got us so hooked on this monetary heroin that we can never quit the habit.
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:41.760]  Then the dollar has no place to fall. Meanwhile, the Chinese are selling, the Russians are selling, the Saudis are selling.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:45.760]  This is going to be one of the biggest currency collapses we've ever seen.
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  Well, that is true that China, our biggest holder at the private Federal Reserve, is now accelerating the dumping and others are.
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.760]  So what does that signify? I mean, if this is the race of the exits, what's the time frame, Peter?
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:04.760]  You just got to hurry up. I mean, it's a question of when do all the people wake up? It's like Wiley Coyote runs off the cliff.
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:13.760]  When does he look down and realize he's not standing on anything? When the people who hold dollars look down and realize what they own, it's going to drop like a stone.
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:19.760]  It's getting more and more expensive now to get out of the dollar because the dollar keeps going down, but it hasn't collapsed yet.
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  Let me ask you about the Yellen Obama secret treasury meeting. They won't tell us what was about two weeks ago. What was that?
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:33.760]  Well, I'm sure they're panicking. I mean, look, here's the prediction. I mean, the problem for the Fed.
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  They don't want to admit how weak the economy is because Obama is talking about how great it is and Hillary Clinton is running on four more years.
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:49.760]  So how can the Fed do more stimulus without acknowledging that the economy needs the stimulus? So this is the problem.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  And, you know, there is no solution for this, but for the investors, for individuals, you've got to take action.
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.760]  That's what the point I'm trying to make is, you know, I'm working with clients now at your Pacific Capital, Shift Gold.
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:07.760]  People don't have a lot of time to get rid of the dollars because when all the hedge funds that have been loading up on dollars,
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:12.760]  when they figure this out and they go to dump their dollars, there's going to be no buyers.
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:19.760]  So before that happens, people have to get out of their currency, buy your gold, buy your Swiss francs, buy your New Zealand dollars,
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  buy your Singapore dollars, use your U.S. dollars to buy stocks over the years.
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.760]  So you really think a massive dollar correction is coming or the death of the dollar?
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:35.760]  Well, look, eventually we're going to have to back the dollar by gold or it's just going to be monopoly money.
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  But in the interim, the dollar has a long way to drop before it goes into a crisis, but it's a long way down.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.760]  And there's no reason to lose all that purchasing power.
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  I mean, the big people on Wall Street who are so leveraged in favor of the dollar, you know, the loss of the dollar...
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  That's because all their bets are in. They don't have a choice.
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:59.760]  They're going to be, they're still refusing to admit they were wrong, despite all the money they're losing.
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:01.760]  Everybody is blowing up. Everybody is...
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  Let me ask you this. Could the Federal Reserve monetize all of it as it already is monetizing like half of it?
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:09.760]  Could they just keep that fantasy land going forever?
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  They're going to try because as everybody tries to dump the U.S. dollar, they're also dumping U.S. Treasuries.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:21.760]  That would send long-term interest rates up, which would crash the housing market and force the federal government to default.
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:24.760]  The Federal Reserve doesn't want that.
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:29.760]  So as people want to get out of the dollar, now the Fed has to crank up the printing presses even more.
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:31.760]  Peter, just stay there. Stay there, my friend.
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:32.760]  It makes it worse.
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:38.760]  Stay right there. And of course, I didn't intro the piece like this, but so far in this battle between he and, you know, our other friend,
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:45.760]  he's being proven right because the dollar is starting to drop, people are running out of the dollar, gold is going up,
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:49.760]  and I just, no matter what scenario we go into, we're in deep trouble.
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:54.760]  But I mean, man, we are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:56.760]  Get ready, folks. Get prepared. That's all I can tell you.

[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:06.760]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:11.760]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:15.760]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:19.760]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.760]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:26.760]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:29.760]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:36.760]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:42.760]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:44.760]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:50.760]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:09.760]  Don't worry. This show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:11.760]  I fell into a burning river.
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:19.760]  We got Peter Schiff with us five minutes to the next hour, and then we have David Knight taking over with all the latest breaking news,
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:21.760]  and we'll be right back.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  Peter Schiff is our guest. Peter, getting into this, how does Obamacare affect things like a wet blanket?
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:09.760]  They're saying get ready for premiums to go up again on the Associated Press.
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:14.760]  How does all these different cities saying, hey, guess what? We've taken your pension funds from the teacher's fund.
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:21.760]  I mean, you really see signs of things unraveling, and the mainstream media trying to tell people everything's okay, but no one's buying it.
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.760]  I mean, could you argue that the depressions here, it's just not evenly distributed?
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  Well, we've been in a depression ever since Obama stepped into office, but look at the GDP.
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  The GDP, we've now had three consecutive quarters of declining GDP.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:43.760]  The last quarter, first quarter of this year, it was.5. I believe it's lower than that, but whatever the first quarter was,
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  I believe the quarter that we're in now, the second quarter, is going to be lower than the first quarter.
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  So this is a recession, and Obamacare is making it a lot worse because it's layering our businesses that were already uncompetitive with even higher costs.
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:07.760]  But it's ironic that because so many businesses have had to get rid of all their full-time workers because they can't afford to employ them full-time thanks to Obamacare,
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:17.760]  that's how come the president can claim credit for all the job creation because we had to create a lot more part-time jobs than the full-time jobs that we destroyed because of Obamacare.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:27.760]  So there's more jobs than the president can take credit for all these jobs, but the workers who have these jobs actually earn less money because these part-time jobs don't pay as well as the jobs that they lost.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:36.760]  So he just basically threw a drowning economy in anchor when he passed Obamacare because we were in trouble, and this made it worse.
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:47.760]  What do you make of nearly half of millennials in a national survey last week not liking capitalism and wanting socialism? I mean, they just seem to have no sense.
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:54.760]  Well, you know, no wonder they don't like capitalism because, you know, we don't have capitalism. We call what we have capitalism, but it's not.
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:57:02.760]  What we have is a disgrace. It's corporatism, it's cronyism, it's fascism, whatever you want to call it, but don't call it capitalism because that's not what we have.
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:11.760]  But of course, if we actually went full socialism, I mean, it would be even worse. I mean, the problem with our economy is all the socialist policies that have crept into it over the years.
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  That's what's corrupted it. It's whatever remains of capitalism is all we've got going.
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:19.760]  How far is the Dow going to go down before this is over?
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  Well, I don't know. It all depends on the Fed. It all depends on when the Fed comes clean, how much stimulus they do, when they apply it.
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:33.760]  But, you know, the earnings aren't there. The corporate earnings keep falling. U.S. stocks are expensive and we're in recession.
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.760]  There's no real reason for the stock market to go up, but there's a big reason for the dollar to go down.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:45.760]  And if the dollar is collapsing, people are looking for safe havens and some people look at the stock market, but there's better safe havens.
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:50.760]  So is the stock market the final bubble? Is the stock market the final bubble?
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:59.760]  No, I don't think the stock market is the real bubble. I think the big bubble is the dollar, the bond market, which is really an IOU dollars in the future.
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:01.760]  That is the much bigger bubble.
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:03.760]  Sure. What about derivatives?
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:06.760]  Well, I mean, derivatives on what? It depends on what you're talking about.
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:13.760]  But yes, there's all sorts of credit that has been extended. There's all sorts of counterparty risk inherent in those derivatives.
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  But, you know, the real blow up is look at all these bonds that are yielding zero or negative rates all around the world.
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  Everybody believes there's no inflation and everybody thinks inflation is a good thing.
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:26.760]  Meanwhile, we've got inflation. It's a bad thing. It's going to get a lot worse.
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:33.760]  And when the central banks around the world have to slam on the brakes and when the Fed can't slam on the brakes because we have too much debt,
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:35.760]  that's when you're going to see all the air come out of the bubble.
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:38.760]  Back in 70 seconds, Peter. I want to come back and talk about that.
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:40.760]  EuroPak.com. I'm Alex Jones, then FullWars.com.

[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:32.760]  Just the five minutes or four minutes we have left.
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:35.760]  I mean, I understand you don't have a crystal ball. We predict it's pretty darn accurate.
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:40.760]  Now you're saying, yeah, the dollar would start going down. We've got inflation.
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:43.760]  But we have inflation, but we also have deflation in some commodities.
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:49.760]  What do you think the effect will be if so many countries announcing zero interest rates or negative interest rates?
[03:00:49.760 --> 03:00:55.760]  Remember, the reason that so many commodity prices were under pressure was because the dollar was rising,
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:59.760]  because everybody believed the Fed was going to raise rates and shrink its balance sheet,
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:01.760]  and that put downward pressure on commodities.
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:05.760]  Well, as people are figuring out that that's not going to happen, that that was wrong,
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:09.760]  that the Fed is going to be printing more money, that the Fed is not going to be raising rates.
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:13.760]  They're going to cut rates back to zero and maybe negative commodity prices are turning around.
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:15.760]  That's why oil prices hit a new high for the year today.
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:17.760]  We got about 4670.
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  So oil's been going up. And of course, I said gold and silver are going up.
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  Other commodities are turning higher.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:27.760]  And as the dollar really breaks and people understand what's actually going to happen,
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:29.760]  commodity prices are going to take off.
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:34.760]  And all of a sudden, inflation is going to start picking up all around the world.
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  And then central banks won't be able to use low inflation as an excuse to keep interest rates artificially low.
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:42.760]  Interest rates are going to start to go up.
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:46.760]  And the country I think that's going to be most affected by it is the United States,
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  because we've got the most debt and we can at least afford higher interest rates on all the debt that we have.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:01.760]  One area that I know you haven't been that negative on is China.
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:06.760]  But I mean, just for me, looking at it, it seems like that is unraveling very quickly as well.
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:08.760]  What's your view on other parts of the world?
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:12.760]  Well, I think other parts of the world are in much better shape than the United States.
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  Not that there aren't problems in countries like China or like Japan or in the Eurozone.
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:18.760]  But I think our problems are greater.
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:22.760]  But I think part of the solution to problems in China is a dollar collapse.
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:29.760]  Well, I think the U.S. dollar being overvalued is what is responsible for a lot of the malinvestments that are going on in China.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:34.760]  And I think when the U.S. dollar goes down and the Chinese government stops stockpiling U.S. treasuries
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:39.760]  and allows their currency to rise and allows their own people to be richer and have greater purchasing power,
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:42.760]  then I think that's going to solve a lot of the problems over there.
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:43.760]  I mean, it obviously-
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  That's really profound what you just said, because Trump's saying they have a currency tariff on us because there's lower.
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:53.760]  Really, that ours is higher, and so that's the big reason you don't have the investment,
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  is because it's too expensive to actually do stuff here.
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  Well, Trump is wrong to blame our lack of competitiveness or our trade deficits
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:06.760]  on the fact that the Chinese currency is too low.
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:12.760]  It's because we have too many regulations, we have too many taxes, we have too much government spending.
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:19.760]  And right now, Trump is vilifying China, China is basically subsidizing the United States consumer.
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:24.760]  And that's why Trump manufactures his ties in China, because if he manufactured them in America,
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:26.760]  it would be too expensive, nobody could buy it.
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:32.760]  And so all that happens is if you put a bunch of tariffs on China or if the Chinese currency goes up,
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:34.760]  prices go up for Americans and then we just stop buying.
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:41.760]  Sure, what about them holding off the admission that we're collapsing till Trump gets in and then they try to blame Trump?
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:46.760]  Well, look, I don't know that they're going to blame Trump for this.
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:49.760]  I think it's funny, if Hillary Clinton wins and she inherits a recession,
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:52.760]  it's going to be funny watching her blaming it on Bush.
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  She's going to try to say that, well, this is the Bush recession and forget about the eight years of Obama.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  But I don't think anything really can be blamed on Trump.
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  But once Trump gets in there, obviously, if he adopts some of the policies he's talking about
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:12.760]  and everything blows up while he's president, then he might take the blame for that.
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:14.760]  But it's going to be hard to blame him for that.
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:17.760]  Sure, I want to have you on next time to talk some about how you would advise Trump,
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:21.760]  you would advise presidential candidates before and what you think is wrong with some of his plans.
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:23.760]  Thank you, Peter Schiff.
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:26.760]  Well, folks, that is it for this part of my transmission coming up.
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.760]  David Knight in about three minutes.

[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:47.760]  Supermelt Vitality will sell out.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:50.760]  The good news, Superfemale works just as good and Anthroplex.
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  That's basically the dry form of it is back in as well.
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:56.760]  Thank you for all your support, your purchases.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:59.760]  Fund this entire operation. God bless you.
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:03.760]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me and I think it's probably fair to say
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:06.760]  that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[03:05:06.760 --> 03:05:11.760]  That was Bernie Sanders praising the Nicaraguan communists Sandinistas 30 years ago.
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:16.760]  As we see today with a rationing of food, water, medicine and electricity in Venezuela,
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:20.760]  the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money.
[03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:25.760]  Now Bernie Sandinista, the proud socialist, is running out of other people's money.
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:29.760]  And he's having to lay off hundreds of staff from his campaign.
[03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:32.760]  Wait, can't he just create jobs out of thin air?
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:34.760]  Have them dig ditches or something?
[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:38.760]  Bernie's campaign is the closest he's ever come to managing a business.
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:40.760]  And his business is failing.
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:46.760]  Even paying his interns only $12 an hour, not quite up to the socialist mandate of $15 an hour,
[03:05:46.760 --> 03:05:49.760]  he still can't make ends meet.
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:52.760]  I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb duke.
[03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:53.760]  Maybe I am.
[03:05:53.760 --> 03:05:56.760]  You know socialism has duped a lot of people.
[03:05:56.760 --> 03:06:23.760]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[03:07:00.760 --> 03:07:04.760]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:12.760]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:20.760]  The years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:20.760 --> 03:07:25.760]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:30.760]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:34.760]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:43.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[03:07:43.760 --> 03:07:49.760]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:52.760]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:07:52.760 --> 03:08:14.760]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:19.760]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:19.760 --> 03:08:27.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:33.760]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, the fourth hour. I'm David Knight on this Friday, April 29, 2016.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:43.760]  We've got a lot of news here. We're going to take another look at, actually, I want to look at how the media has reported what I would call the dreamer riots.
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:49.760]  You know, they have really soft-pedaled this, and I think we really need to take a look at the reality.
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:54.760]  Of course, you saw some of the B-roll. You can see the video that we've got up at Infowars.com.
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:59.760]  Anti-Trump protesters riot, attack supporters, damaged cop car in Orange County.
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:05.760]  That's an article that is linked to from the Drudge Report. It just says video at the top of the Drudge Report.
[03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:08.760]  I think this was huge what happened yesterday.
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:14.760]  And I think, quite frankly, we haven't seen this reflected in the polls yet because they haven't taken any polls after this.
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:22.760]  But when you look at the juxtaposition of what's going on in these riots that Rob do and Joshua and videotape last night,
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:27.760]  we juxtaposition that to what was going on in the Trump rally,
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:32.760]  where he has people of all different backgrounds, cultural, racial backgrounds,
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:39.760]  talking about how they have been victims, their families have been victims of violent crime by these.
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:44.760]  There's a guy right there wiping the blood off of his face. You're looking at the video feed. Absolutely amazing.
[03:09:44.760 --> 03:09:49.760]  His face is all bloodied. And of course, there's another part of the video where they've surrounded a car,
[03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:53.760]  keep beating it, and just paint on the car as the people are there in the car.
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:56.760]  I mean, this is absolutely amazing. These are the dreamers.
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:01.760]  These are the people who show up at our borders with their little teddy bears, according to Glenn Beck.
[03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:03.760]  Okay? No, it's not. No, it's not.
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:07.760]  Understand, the dreamers include people up to the age of 31 years old.
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:12.760]  These teenagers who are coming in, many of them who are coming in are cartel members already, okay?
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:15.760]  They're gang members already, MS-13 and others.
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:19.760]  So these are the people, the dreamers at the very least coming in here.
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:26.760]  These people beating people who are showing up to this rally, beating people in the street if they think they support Trump,
[03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:31.760]  waving Mexican flags all over the place. You see Mexican flags everywhere.
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:34.760]  And demanding that they get free college education.
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:40.760]  Demanding that they get subsidized more so than people who have lived here all their lives and paid taxes all their life.
[03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:44.760]  No, they need to come in. They need to be given a free education.
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  And if you have a problem with that, you're a racist and they're going to physically and violently attack you.
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:52.760]  But of course, the media will not attack them.
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:56.760]  The media will pull back, there we go, there's a guy with a Miata.
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:00.760]  I gotta say, if you're going to drift through a crowd, that's the car to do it in.
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:05.760]  Anyway, but look at the way that the different media have reported this.
[03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:11.760]  I looked at CNN, chaos at anti-Trump rally, 20 arrests after Trump.
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:14.760]  And then they're underneath it, Indiana Governor Pence endorses Cruz.
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:16.760]  See, there's no sense of who started it.
[03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:22.760]  And immediately, it's like chaos, Trump rally, people are arrested. Who started this?
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:25.760]  This must have been the Trump people like Ted Cruz told us, right?
[03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:28.760]  The Trump people who started all this, the Trump people who provoked all this.
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:31.760]  No, no, actually, there's no sense of it.
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:36.760]  And when they combined that with the fact that, well, more violence to the Trump rally.
[03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:40.760]  And so now we've got the Indiana governor just had to endorse Ted Cruz.
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:44.760]  That's the way this plays out. USA Today, absolutely no coverage.
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:47.760]  They've got the NFL draft picks. They've got the Kardashians.
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:49.760]  Nothing about what happened in California.
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:51.760]  Wall Street Journal, this is their headline.
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:54.760]  Trump rally draws supporters and protesters.
[03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:59.760]  Oh, yeah, they're just standing there just with their signs peacefully.
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:02.760]  That's not at all what happened. Not at all what happened.
[03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:05.760]  Listen the way Fox couches this in their headlines.
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:09.760]  Protests turn violent after Trump rally.
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:13.760]  There you go. Looks like it's Donald Trump again, who's violent.
[03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:17.760]  Trump's protesters are, no, no, it's just the opposite.
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:22.760]  They should have said Trump protesters turn violent, okay?
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:27.760]  And even that anti-Trump protesters turn violence, what they should have said.
[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:29.760]  This is the way they spin it completely.
[03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:32.760]  Look at Reuters. Welcome to California, Mr. Trump.
[03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:34.760]  Oh, that was a nice welcome.
[03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:37.760]  No, actually, it's like welcome to Aslan, okay?
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:39.760]  The Aztec land that they say.
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:41.760]  That's your future in America, folks.
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:44.760]  If you don't control your border, what we see last night,
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:47.760]  these guys destroying private property,
[03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:51.760]  attacking violently attacking people while they fly the Mexican flag,
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:54.760]  screaming in Spanish, I don't know whether they're screaming at them.
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:58.760]  That's your future everywhere in this country
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:00.760]  if you don't stop this open border madness.
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:04.760]  That's precisely what Obama and the globalists want to see happen.
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:08.760]  We look at the map of Aslan, okay? The Aztec land.
[03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:11.760]  It's everything from California to Texas in the Southwest,
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:14.760]  all of California, all of Texas, all of Arizona, all of Nevada,
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:17.760]  all of Utah, all of New Mexico.
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:20.760]  This is where Laraza says, hey, we own this. We're taking it.
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:22.760]  That's what those people in California were doing.
[03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:25.760]  They said, this belongs to us. Get out of here, Americans,
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:29.760]  as they beat people, destroy cars, and wave their Mexican flags.
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:33.760]  And of course, it also includes parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Kansas.
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:36.760]  Why not? You know, just take everything.
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:39.760]  Then we've got this other thing from Reuters.
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:41.760]  This is that they take the cake, I think.
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:45.760]  You see people in riot gear. You see some cops on a horse.
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:51.760]  And the caption from Reuters is, Trump, California rally, unrest, unrest.
[03:13:51.760 --> 03:13:56.760]  No, you know what? Unrest is what you get when your mattress isn't really working out for you, okay?
[03:13:56.760 --> 03:13:58.760]  That was not unrest.
[03:13:58.760 --> 03:14:01.760]  And let me say, when this happened in Chicago,
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:04.760]  it took several days for the truth to come out.
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:08.760]  It took several days for the police to start speaking off the record and saying,
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:10.760]  you know what really happened?
[03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:13.760]  All the violence was on the side of the anti-Trump protesters.
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:15.760]  They were the ones who were attacking us.
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:18.760]  They were the ones destroying private property, attacking cars,
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:20.760]  just as we saw here in California.
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:23.760]  This happened last night and our reporters were there.
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:25.760]  That's why it's important for us to be there.
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:29.760]  There's a great call by Alex and Rob Dew to get out there and get there as that was happening.
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:33.760]  I mean, left here yesterday, got there just in time to see that rally going on.
[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:35.760]  That's why we have to be there.
[03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:37.760]  I just read you the headlines from mainstream media.
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:39.760]  That's the way they're going to spin it.
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:40.760]  They're going to ignore it.
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:43.760]  They're going to spin it like, oh, there's a little bit of unrest.
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:45.760]  Not any big deal, really.
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:46.760]  No, it was a big deal.
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:47.760]  It really was a big deal.
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:52.760]  You need to see the hatred of these teenagers to college age, okay?
[03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:55.760]  The dreamers there who think that they are entitled to everything.
[03:14:55.760 --> 03:14:59.760]  These socialists who come in from other countries demanding everything
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:02.760]  and then attacking anybody that disagrees with them.
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:08.760]  And this time, it didn't take three or four or five days for the truth to gradually come out.
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:12.760]  This time, you didn't have Ted Cruz coming out and blaming it on the Trump people,
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:13.760]  on the Trump protesters.
[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:14.760]  Why?
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:15.760]  Because we were there.
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:17.760]  We showed you the video, okay?
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:21.760]  Now, let's talk about what's going on real quickly in Indiana.
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:26.760]  Because as I mentioned before, that's the common core path to victory for Ted Cruz.
[03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:30.760]  Because that one little state is more important than the six states
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:32.760]  that just voted in the last two weeks.
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:37.760]  The 57 delegates that are available in Indiana are more important, he says,
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:42.760]  than the 267 that he didn't get, I think maybe one or two, if that many,
[03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:44.760]  out of the Northeast.
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:48.760]  He is basically, as they put it on CNN headline,
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:52.760]  Ted Cruz's Indiana plan, throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.
[03:15:52.760 --> 03:15:54.760]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[03:15:54.760 --> 03:15:58.760]  He's gotten the governor, Governor Pence, to endorse him.
[03:15:58.760 --> 03:16:03.760]  But I think the interesting thing about this is that Governor Pence
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:05.760]  can even see the handwriting on the wall.
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:06.760]  He's not that suicidal.
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:10.760]  Headline says, Pence endorses Cruz but praises Trump.
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:12.760]  And he begins the article by saying,
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:14.760]  well, I particularly want to commend Donald Trump.
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:16.760]  This is his endorsement of Ted Cruz, okay?
[03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:17.760]  Backpedaling it.
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:22.760]  Now, this tells you something about how out of touch Ted Cruz and his supporters
[03:16:22.760 --> 03:16:25.760]  who really think that he's got a chance are,
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:28.760]  I particularly want to commend Donald Trump, who I think is given voice
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:32.760]  to the frustration of millions of working Americans with a lack of progress in D.C.,
[03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:33.760]  so forth and so on.
[03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:35.760]  He says, as part of his endorsement of Ted Cruz.
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:38.760]  And he goes, I'm particularly grateful that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:39.760]  for who's your job.
[03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:41.760]  We'll talk about what that means.
[03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:45.760]  He says, I'm not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz
[03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:47.760]  in the upcoming Republican primary.
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.760]  I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative.
[03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:50.760]  You know what?
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:51.760]  I don't see him as a principled conservative.
[03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:54.760]  I don't see Ted Cruz as either principled or conservative.
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:59.760]  I see him as an unprincipled opportunist who is ineligible to run as president
[03:16:59.760 --> 03:17:01.760]  of the United States under the Constitution.
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:03.760]  He claims to be an originalist in the Constitution?
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:04.760]  All right.
[03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:07.760]  He still hasn't told us how he's an actual born citizen, okay?
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:09.760]  And then they go on to say, well, you know,
[03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:12.760]  Governor Pence in this article is a popular first term governor.
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:13.760]  Is he really?
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:14.760]  Is he really?
[03:17:14.760 --> 03:17:16.760]  You know, he has an approval rating of 41%.
[03:17:16.760 --> 03:17:20.760]  There are only 14 governors in the United States that have an approval rating
[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:22.760]  that's less than Governor Pence.
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:24.760]  There's only 14 who are less popular than him.
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:27.760]  Would you rather have a governor like that in Dorshu?
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:32.760]  Or would you rather have the most popular coach of the most popular sport
[03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:35.760]  in that state, Bobby Knight, basketball coach?
[03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:36.760]  Would you rather have his endorsement?
[03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:38.760]  That's what Donald Trump got.
[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:41.760]  It's interesting, you know, when you look at what happened,
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:44.760]  the only thing that happened to Ted Cruz that was good news this week
[03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:46.760]  was when John Boehner attacked him.
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:49.760]  He's wearing that like a badge of honor.
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:50.760]  John Boehner hates me.
[03:17:50.760 --> 03:17:52.760]  That means I must be good.
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:53.760]  No, it doesn't.
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:58.760]  Actually, you know, you can still be an insider and still be a jerk.
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:17:59.760]  Okay?
[03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:00.760]  That's the bottom line.
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:04.760]  It doesn't make him an outsider just because John Boehner hates him.
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:05.760]  Okay?
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:09.760]  And even in his denials, Ted Cruz, lying Ted couldn't even tell the truth.
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:10.760]  He says, I don't know this guy.
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:12.760]  I've never worked with him.
[03:18:12.760 --> 03:18:15.760]  And then the media comes out and they say, well, you know, yeah,
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:18.760]  he represented him as a lawyer back in the 90s.
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:23.760]  He had press conferences where he spoke on behalf of John Boehner as his lawyer.
[03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:27.760]  And I'm assuming, you know, Ted Cruz goes, oh, you mean that John Boehner?
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:31.760]  Oh, I thought it was the guy out in Indiana, the John Boehner out there.
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:33.760]  You mean the John Boehner in Washington, D.C.?
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:34.760]  Oh, yeah, that guy.
[03:18:34.760 --> 03:18:35.760]  Yeah, I know him.
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:36.760]  I used to represent him.
[03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:37.760]  I used to work for him.
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:42.760]  We had conversations, but he pretends he doesn't know him lying Ted.
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:43.760]  Okay?
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:47.760]  But when I talk about the fact that he's not a principled conservative,
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:52.760]  just remember the fact that he has voted for the TPA,
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:55.760]  the Trade Promotion Authority, before he voted against it.
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:18:56.760]  What's the big deal about that?
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:18:58.760]  Well, I mean, he's been on both sides of that issue.
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:19:01.760]  But when he voted against it, when it came up at first,
[03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:03.760]  when it came up second time, they didn't need his vote.
[03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:04.760]  There was only four people who opposed it.
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:05.760]  He was one of the four.
[03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:08.760]  The only one who had consistently opposed it both times.
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:09.760]  There was a couple of senators.
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:12.760]  One of them was Rand Paul.
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:13.760]  What is the TPA?
[03:19:13.760 --> 03:19:17.760]  Well, the TPA says we're going to ditch the constitutional process
[03:19:17.760 --> 03:19:18.760]  to approve treaties.
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:19.760]  Okay?
[03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:22.760]  Now, that means not only the transatlantic and trans-specific partnership,
[03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:26.760]  but these services treaties, even the climate treaty.
[03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:27.760]  Okay?
[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:32.760]  They're going to get rid of the process of ratification that's in the Constitution.
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:35.760]  How is that for a principled constitutional conservative
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:37.760]  to say that you don't really want to do that process?
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:41.760]  And of course, he was for shutting down the Tenth Amendment
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:43.760]  when it came to pot legalization,
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:46.760]  calling Obama somebody who was abusing executive power
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:50.760]  because he wouldn't go down and shut down medical marijuana.
[03:19:50.760 --> 03:19:51.760]  But now he's all for that.
[03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:53.760]  He says, oh, no, that's part of the Tenth Amendment.
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:55.760]  So now he's discovered that's part of the Tenth Amendment.
[03:19:55.760 --> 03:19:56.760]  That's what I mean.
[03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:57.760]  He's unprincipled.
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:58.760]  Stay with us.
[03:19:58.760 --> 03:19:59.760]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.760 --> 03:20:25.760]  We're going to talk about the EU.
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:54.760]  We're going to talk about the EU.
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:20.760]  We're going to talk about the EU.
[03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:23.760]  We're going to talk about the EU.
[03:21:23.760 --> 03:21:25.760]  We're going to talk about the EU.
[03:21:54.760 --> 03:21:56.760]  That's war on the grid dot com.
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:57.760]  Don't wait.

[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:56.760]  That's war on the grid dot com.

[03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:43.080]  not only is Britain talking about exiting the EU but we also have Sweden now talking
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:49.560]  about it and Sweden is real big into the whole globalist idea but they don't like the implementation
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:50.560]  of it.
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:53.840]  It's kind of like that from each according to his ability to each according to his needs
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:57.800]  you know that wonderful phrase that so many when they ask people that in college they
[03:24:57.800 --> 03:25:00.800]  go around the colleges and ask people where they come from most people say oh I think
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:05.320]  that was Jesus that said that or the Bible or whatever no let's call Marx and as nice
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:10.840]  as that sounds folks it doesn't work that way in practice because the guys who are running
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:17.400]  the country aren't Jesus okay they're not even Karl Marx for that matter.

[03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:36.520]  Food at infowarstore.com I was just talking about Ted Cruz and as I say his strategy is
[03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:40.200]  to throw everything against the wall and see what sticks and New York Times says as the
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:45.800]  clock is ticking down it's a hustle for Cruz and Indiana they say he's tried a teamwork
[03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:51.920]  setting off a fragile alliance with Governor Kasich now that didn't work he's also recycled
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:57.760]  his successful strategies from contests past deploying his father Rafael Cruz to come through
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:27:02.160]  and talk about Christianity we'll talk about that in just a moment then he elevated Carly
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:06.960]  Fiorinas as would be running mate and he says at a rally they say so how about Carly he
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:13.320]  asked hundreds of supporters coily coaxing cheers from them you know I watched this when
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:18.040]  he introduced her when he said he was she was going to be his quote unquote running
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:24.160]  mate in his fantasy football league picks and he says she was born in Texas and the
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:31.440]  crowd goes yay and I thought what irony I tweeted that out actually that's my way I just you
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:36.800]  know it's absolutely amazing yeah unlike Ted unlike me she was born in Texas you know it's
[03:27:36.800 --> 03:27:41.920]  good for him to have Carly because maybe it helps him with women I don't know cuz he's
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:50.280]  losing with women even to Donald Trump but it also gets his globalist wife off of the
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:55.600]  stage with him that could be a help and we've got an article here in terms of his dad going
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:28:00.320]  around look at this this is on the drudge report Ted Cruz's dad says my son ran for
[03:28:00.320 --> 03:28:05.760]  president after God sent his wife a sign he said God sent a message to Heidi that essentially
[03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:10.960]  said go for it and I'm thinking you know when all this stuff comes crashing down on him and
[03:28:10.960 --> 03:28:14.240]  this is all over and Ted and Heidi you're sitting around their living room and he's
[03:28:14.240 --> 03:28:19.360]  gone I don't understand Heidi I thought you said God wanted me to run I think Heidi's
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:27.880]  going to say no Ted I said Goldman told you to run I think that's basically from their
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:34.880]  standpoint that that's really kind of the person calling the shots okay now when they
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:40.520]  opened up their campaigns in Indiana take a look at what the two of them did what what
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:47.120]  did Ted Cruz do well he went to the Indianapolis GOP spring dinner where they had $150 plate
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:53.680]  dinners and he met a few people okay Donald Trump went to meet with the people at the
[03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:59.360]  carrier plant he starts talking about the shutting down of the carrier air conditioning
[03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:03.120]  plant and moving that to Mexico and he's talked about that multiple times but that's where
[03:29:03.120 --> 03:29:08.000]  he goes and that's the difference folks one guy goes to the party establishment I talked
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:14.080]  about how that happened here at the Alamo in San Antonio we had a massive protest for
[03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:18.840]  in support of open carry legal open carry had over a thousand people there we had politicians
[03:29:18.840 --> 03:29:24.640]  all over the place there but Ted Cruz was in the Hyatt across the street with a tea party
[03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:29.960]  okay a literal tea party with some Republican women so he could get the money that's what
[03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:34.480]  we see over and over again what's happening in the polls they're collapsing for him the
[03:29:34.480 --> 03:29:39.400]  latest poll shows that he's down eight or nine points nine points and that's the one
[03:29:39.400 --> 03:29:42.840]  that just came out yesterday I think after what we see with this dreamer riot is going
[03:29:42.840 --> 03:29:50.840]  to go even more underwater for Ted Cruz stay with us we'll be right back we're on the March
[03:29:50.840 --> 03:30:01.440]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Joe Bigger with info wars
[03:30:01.440 --> 03:30:06.760]  dot com pro ISIS hackers post kill list of State Department employees hackers with a
[03:30:06.760 --> 03:30:12.040]  pro ISIS group calling themselves United Cyber Caliphate distributed a kill list that appears
[03:30:12.040 --> 03:30:17.600]  to include dozens of U.S. government personnel the list features 43 names of people linked
[03:30:17.600 --> 03:30:21.560]  to the State Department the Department of Homeland Security and the Departments of Defense
[03:30:21.560 --> 03:30:27.200]  Energy Commerce and Health and Services it also identifies U.S. embassies in Santiago
[03:30:27.200 --> 03:30:32.480]  and Kathmandu as well as the Department of the Navy in Gulfport Mississippi as targets
[03:30:32.480 --> 03:30:36.560]  it includes someone who appears to have worked for Australia's Department of Defense as well
[03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:40.600]  while the group's intentions are sinister it's unlikely that the so-called Hackenville's
[03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:45.400]  much new or actionable information the hackers list phone numbers with each person many of
[03:30:45.400 --> 03:30:49.440]  which are general numbers of institutions or offices though several appear to be correct
[03:30:49.440 --> 03:30:54.880]  current office lines the group also posted zip codes in cities often listed as Washington

[03:33:21.640 --> 03:33:28.080]  show and we're going to talk this segment about Obama renewing his smart gun push for
[03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:32.680]  gun control we also want to talk about what's going on in the EU because I think that really
[03:33:32.680 --> 03:33:37.880]  underlies what we see happening not only in Europe but especially with the Donald Trump
[03:33:37.880 --> 03:33:42.640]  phenomenon people are waking up to what's going on with this globalism okay he talked
[03:33:42.640 --> 03:33:48.200]  about when he had his foreign policy speech the false song of globalism it's a great
[03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:52.960]  phrase whoever put that in there and that is precisely what we're talking about we're
[03:33:52.960 --> 03:33:57.400]  talking about international treaties that tie us up and bring us down that was also
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:02.680]  from his speech I think this is one of the reasons why we see him taking off right now
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:08.400]  there's nobody that has opposed this like Donald Trump as a matter of fact Ted Cruz before
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:12.920]  he was against it was for all this stuff okay he was for the trade promotion authority
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:18.400]  before he was against it he was for shutting down the constitutional process for ratifying
[03:34:18.400 --> 03:34:22.560]  treaties before he was against it he wrote op-ed pieces talking about free trade this
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:27.120]  is not free trade this is managed trade and let me give you an example of how this trade
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:33.000]  is being managed okay we come out today we see an EU calculation for handing out free
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:40.280]  carbon permits now this is what how Reuters reports this they say Europe's highest court
[03:34:40.280 --> 03:34:46.040]  on Thursday ruled that the European Commission's calculation for handing out free carbon permits
[03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:52.120]  to industries was flawed and they raised the prospect of higher costs for energy users
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:59.320]  the decision followed the court advisors opinion so here we are we've got economic resources
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:05.920]  being allocated by one bureaucrat or a couple of bureaucrats in the court this is the court
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:10.960]  advisor who told them what to do and then the court Europe's highest court with the
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:14.680]  EU says no you're going to have to pay more you're going to we're going to tax you more
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:19.400]  on that or we're going to shut you down that's the way it's going to happen here folks that's
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:24.360]  what's behind this climate treaty and of course that's what's the TPA is going to allow them
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:32.040]  to ratify that very easily without having to have 67% of the votes two-thirds vote in
[03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:37.760]  the Senate now they just have to have a simple majority you don't get to these treaties that
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:41.240]  are coming up the presidents want to bring in here you don't get to put any amendments
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:44.440]  in these things you don't have any discussion you can't filibuster it you can't keep it
[03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:50.000]  from coming to the floor that's what they did with the TPA they completely greased the
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:56.200]  skids to get this thing in without any opposition and without following the Constitution and
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:00.000]  when you look at the way that they're going to be allocating these resources understand
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:04.800]  that we had communism okay you had central controllers who were telling everybody what
[03:36:04.800 --> 03:36:08.360]  to do and they said we own everything and we're going to tell you what you can and cannot
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:15.080]  do okay now you may find it strange that these multinational corporations are doing the same
[03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:19.920]  thing only if you don't understand the connection between the banks and the communists you don't
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:26.640]  understand that the German central bank president whose brother was working with JP Morgan to
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:31.360]  set up the Federal Reserve at the time the German central bank president sent Vladimir
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:38.400]  Lenin into Russia from Switzerland and they sealed train with ten million dollars a gold
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:41.720]  to start the Russian Revolution because they like that kind of control see in the past
[03:36:41.720 --> 03:36:46.440]  what they've done is they've used Marxism to control the people to control the economy
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:51.960]  to seize control of everything now what they're doing is they're using environmentalism or
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:56.040]  other forms of socialism okay the kind of cultural Marxism that we see going on here
[03:36:56.040 --> 03:37:02.000]  the open borders are part of it as well that's why you know they move from red to green just
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:07.240]  that simple but it's the same game if you understand who's behind these different moves
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:12.480]  you understand that it is the same thing even though they might you know they might be green
[03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:18.160]  now they were in red before they're now watermelon you know they got this thin veneer of green
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:25.280]  but underneath it's still the same old socialism control by the few and it's by the corporate
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:30.160]  few we're looking at what's going on with Venezuela yeah that's communism and it was
[03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:36.800]  Hugo Chavez okay but Bloomberg was bragging about how Hugo Chavez and his successor have
[03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:41.000]  given them 600 to 700% return on the investment because they understand that the banks get
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  paid first you see so the people may have to go to another country to get water and
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:49.880]  food and medicine even power but the bankers are going to get paid and they're going to
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:54.440]  get paid 600 to 700% return on investment I mean that's a great deal for them isn't
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:38:00.200]  it you know the the World Bank comes in and they set up socialism that it's not the Marshall
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:07.960]  plan it's not the Marshall plan when you had McNamara doing this people accused him of
[03:38:07.960 --> 03:38:13.560]  rent seeking because what he was doing was not loaning them money so they could build
[03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:17.200]  the infrastructure so they could build up their production but he was loaning them money
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:21.800]  and then telling them at the same time create these social programs give people free this
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:27.360]  free that maybe free college that wasn't on the menu then it is now in our country give
[03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:31.320]  them all this free stuff and when you do guess what they're not going to be able to pay
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:35.600]  that back you're just getting them further and further in debt they're never going to
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:42.400]  get out of that so what we see here in Europe as we see them putting on these controls these
[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:46.000]  carbon taxes and say well we're going to need to raise these for some of the other people
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:51.840]  but why were they raising them it's because the big guys weren't paying anything they were exempt
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:56.480]  from the carbon taxes so you can't soak the rich you're not going to soak the multinationals
[03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:01.000]  they're not going to pay these taxes they're going to get around them and so they say well
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:04.280]  we're going to we're going to raise that maybe they will for a little while but they'll find
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:09.720]  a way to get around it then we look at what's going on in Holland we got Dutch politicians
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:16.080]  backing a proposal to ban sales of gasoline and diesel cars by 2025 but don't worry they're
[03:39:16.080 --> 03:39:21.880]  going to grandfather you and if you've got a internal combustion engine okay you're
[03:39:21.880 --> 03:39:25.440]  going to still be able to drive your car for a while for a while so what they've done in
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:29.080]  Europe they've tried to drive people out of their cars for the longest time by increasing
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:33.000]  taxes right that's what they're doing with the carbon taxes now what Obama wants to
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:36.720]  do and shutting down the coal industry but eventually they just come to it and say you
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:39.880]  know what we're done we're not going to play the economic game anymore we're just going
[03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:43.120]  to ban them you're not going to be able to buy them anymore we're just going to force
[03:39:43.120 --> 03:39:47.360]  you to buy an electric car yeah that's what we have until we force you to give up your
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:51.240]  electric car until we say we're not going to allow private ownership of any kind of
[03:39:51.240 --> 03:39:55.440]  transportation because we want to control you and that's what's going on right now in
[03:39:55.440 --> 03:40:01.280]  this country we've got a federal government under Obama that is not only subsidizing automated
[03:40:01.280 --> 03:40:05.160]  cars but now we've got a massive lobbyist group like I mentioned yesterday when I was
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:10.600]  talking to Anthony Gucciardi here on the fourth hour we've got a new lobbying group called
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:18.440]  the self-driving coalition for safer streets and it is Google, Ford and Volvo, Uber and
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:23.560]  Lyft and we look at this it's like oh okay that makes sense these guys oh they're trying
[03:40:23.560 --> 03:40:27.060]  to make us safer no what they're doing is they're going to the federal government just
[03:40:27.060 --> 03:40:34.800]  like they did like big agricultural interested with GMO and saying we don't want local regulations
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:38.280]  of what we do and so we're going to come to the federal government and we're going to
[03:40:38.280 --> 03:40:44.480]  say the federal government give us some regulations which are not regulations at all and say that
[03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:48.000]  supersedes any regulations at the state area in other words shutting down the ninth and
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:53.920]  the tenth amendment so it's blatantly unconstitutional it's crony capitalism it is not about safety
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:58.680]  the reason they're going to Washington now is because California has seen the results
[03:40:58.680 --> 03:41:02.560]  of what's happening with these Google cars and they're putting the brakes on and said
[03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:06.240]  hey wait a minute we need a person in the car as a backup because we're not happy with
[03:41:06.240 --> 03:41:10.680]  what you've done they do these they're telling us how advanced these are and how safe they're
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:15.880]  going to be and they show us all these pictures of how they got sensors here and sensors there
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:20.440]  Google just filed a patent to say that they're going to be able to quote unquote predict
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:25.240]  human behavior by looking at brake lights and turn signals that's how ridiculous this
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:30.280]  is that's how ridiculous is but they're selling it in the name of safety but it's really crony
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:35.560]  capitalism for the corporations and its government control and that's what's going on all over
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:39.920]  the EU that's why Britain is having a vote on whether or not they're going to exit as
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:44.920]  the new American points out the Swedes may follow Britain if it exits the EU they say
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:49.800]  Swedes tell Britain if you leave the EU will follow that's the title of a recent article
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:53.960]  out of the spectator a British newspaper and they say well you know Britain may be one
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:59.480]  of the least enthusiastic members of the EU but other even more globally minded countries
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:04.960]  like Sweden are tiring of the protectionism and the insularity and Brussels in other words
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:10.080]  Brussels is telling people what they can and cannot do and it doesn't matter if it's the
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:15.520]  Kremlin or if it's Brussels when you have centralized control of your economy that's
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:22.400]  what's going to happen Denmark shutting down red meat okay again taxing it like they did
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:27.720]  gasoline eventually they'll come to just saying no you can't have red meat and of course it's
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:34.880]  all about ethical concerns of climate change okay that should be red meat to the opposition
[03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:39.600]  and that's why we're seeing that combined with the open borders is why you're seeing
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:44.400]  the rise of Donald Trump it's why you're seeing the rise of people political parties throughout
[03:42:44.400 --> 03:42:48.800]  Europe and why you're seeing the fall of the people who are supporting this kind of stuff
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:52.880]  now coming back to our own country here and as we look at this next election it's going
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:58.480]  to be coming up on Tuesday in Indiana crowd for cruise rally is less than expected this
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:04.840]  has come from W.A.N.E. in Indiana they say a person there Brenda Mossbarger took a break
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:09.240]  from work to snap a few photos of the hoopla outside the Grand Wayne Center she said she
[03:43:09.240 --> 03:43:13.200]  didn't see much that was happening there this is the cruise rally she says well I guess
[03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:17.520]  I was just expecting to see some spillover maybe people waiting to get in but it seems
[03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:22.480]  to be pretty quiet they say yeah it's a pretty big place but inside the center only about
[03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:28.520]  a thousand supporters came to see Ted Cruz it's only about half full one person Joseph
[03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:33.680]  Romary says I was surprised how few people were there he says I mean it's a big room
[03:43:33.680 --> 03:43:39.600]  say the crowds are collapsing Donald Trump is getting tens of thousands and Ted Cruz
[03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:43.720]  can only half fill the rooms that he's got and you see it reflected in the polls as well
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:48.880]  if you look at real clear politics and they take the average of recent polls they range
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:55.880]  from two five eight six Trump ahead that much average of 5.3 actually the one that came out
[03:43:55.880 --> 03:44:03.520]  today which is just taken was 27th through 28th so it's Wednesday and Thursday and that
[03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:10.280]  was before the Dreamer riot we had Ted Cruz we had Donald Trump plus nine over Ted Cruz
[03:44:10.280 --> 03:44:14.480]  and it's not just Ted Cruz who's collapsing I thought it was interesting to see this article
[03:44:14.480 --> 03:44:19.800]  on the Daily Caller about Glenn Beck because Glenn Beck has been his sidekick I guess maybe
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:24.640]  he got kicked to the side a little bit after Carly got on board or maybe he's had to dial
[03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:29.960]  it back because he's had to lay off 40 people from the blaze and he says yeah I've laid
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:34.720]  off 40 people and my media empire is crumbling and part of it is because I'm traveling around
[03:44:34.720 --> 03:44:40.400]  with Ted Cruz well it may also be because he tied himself to that anchor and you know
[03:44:40.400 --> 03:44:48.040]  it's not something that just started when Glenn Beck came out and tagged all the people
[03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:55.320]  at the Bundy standoff as terrorists that's I think he took a big hit for that and I don't
[03:44:55.320 --> 03:45:00.840]  think he's really recovered from that and it's only getting worse when he goes to the
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:06.560]  border with teddy bears to welcome in the people that you saw rioting yesterday in Orange
[03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:13.160]  County that we had video of. Now all this stuff is being sold to us as they are in Europe
[03:45:13.160 --> 03:45:20.400]  they're selling people on the safety of the smart cars they're selling us on smart cities
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:23.880]  they say yeah we have to and of course that's all about Agenda 21 they're gonna have smart
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:28.440]  buses we talked about that yesterday you know the empty buses now won't even have a driver
[03:45:28.440 --> 03:45:33.320]  on them and Elon Musk is saying oh we're gonna come up with some kind of special bus for
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:38.000]  people as well so they're pushing all this stuff because you know they got smart cars
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:44.800]  smart cities and now smart guns okay understand when they start talking to you about smart
[03:45:44.800 --> 03:45:51.120]  cars and smart guns and smart cities they think you're really stupid they think you really
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:55.960]  don't know that this is about crony capitalism and government control and so today we've
[03:45:55.960 --> 03:46:03.800]  got Obama renewing his push for smart guns okay and again he's putting this out what
[03:46:03.800 --> 03:46:07.840]  if we use these common sense steps he says and he says these common sense steps are not
[03:46:07.840 --> 03:46:12.720]  going to prevent every tragedy but what if they prevented just one he puts that out on
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:19.200]  Facebook and he's got a large plan here that I'm looking at I would ask him this well what
[03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:27.440]  if one citizen even one law enforcement officer got killed because their gun wouldn't work
[03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:33.520]  Obama and he's putting this out and the way he's going to push this to people is to say
[03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:38.040]  they're going to fund this they're going to offer some they're gonna throw tens of millions
[03:46:38.040 --> 03:46:43.720]  of dollars at this they're not going to mandate that you have to have this yet they're not
[03:46:43.720 --> 03:46:48.200]  gonna mandate that law enforcement has to have this yet what they're going to do is
[03:46:48.200 --> 03:46:52.600]  with crony capitalism again just like we see with the smart cars with self-driving cars
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:57.320]  they're going to throw some money out there they're going to find some corporations that
[03:46:57.320 --> 03:47:02.840]  they can partner with and then they're going to come up with something maybe they'll have
[03:47:02.840 --> 03:47:07.280]  some tech that works maybe they won't okay and then at that point they'll start coming
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:11.440]  in with the mandates I talked about this a while back I did a report a couple of months
[03:47:11.440 --> 03:47:15.880]  ago smart guns dumb and dumber and I want to play just a little bit of that for you
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:22.640]  to give you an idea of what's wrong with smart guns help push the idea of smart guns mainstream
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:29.520]  media from Fox News to CNN turns to James Bond as an example of the PPKS 9mm short
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:35.800]  there's a micro dermal sensor in the grip it's been coded to your palm print so only
[03:47:35.800 --> 03:47:40.720]  you can fire it while having a gun that only authorized users can fire might sound like
[03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:46.400]  a great idea Bond has lots of gadgets that in the real world would be impractical and
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:52.400]  prohibitively expensive to build but Obama says the tech hurdles can be overcome if you
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.320]  are a gun owner I would think that you would at least want a choice they don't want to
[03:47:57.320 --> 03:48:01.720]  be in a situation where oh no someone's coming through my front door I've got to reboot my
[03:48:01.720 --> 03:48:08.520]  gun it's the reliability stupid adding biometric or RFID sensors to a gun means adding multiple
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:14.880]  layers of new complicated technology that can go wrong the blinking red LED light means
[03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:19.800]  that you have 33% battery life left and you must change the batteries there weren't batteries
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:25.600]  that were small enough there weren't chips that were reliable enough there wasn't biometric
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:30.880]  technology that was good enough to recognize fingerprint IDs guns are finely honed mechanical
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:36.520]  devices they're rugged they can withstand rough use smart guns will add electronics that
[03:48:36.520 --> 03:48:41.920]  can fail can break that will need a charged power source and most importantly they can
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:46.600]  be disabled by criminals or governments this vulnerability and others will come from the
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:51.680]  software which will also have bugs that will get worse with software updates just like
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:57.280]  your phone and there are other concerns any wireless coupling can decouple it can have
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:02.160]  interference or it can be hacked and will you grip a biometric candle in the same way
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:07.240]  when you're under stress or under combat so far there's only been one attempt at a smart
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:12.840]  gun the IP one from the German manufacturer armatics the gun is implanted with an electronic
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:17.880]  chip that allows it to be fired only if the shooter is wearing a companion watch into
[03:49:17.880 --> 03:49:24.680]  which a pin number has been entered it was only offered in a 22 caliber but it cost $1800
[03:49:24.680 --> 03:49:29.840]  five times the cost of other 22s and not offered in a self-defense caliber but it had
[03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:34.560]  other problems it took seven push button commands and 12 seconds before it could be fired and
[03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:41.240]  it had three or four misfires per 11 round magazine repeatedly so it's not good it's
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:46.160]  okay so you can hear that report you can find that at Alex Jones YouTube channel it's smart
[03:49:46.160 --> 03:49:50.400]  guns dumb and dumber that's something you really need to look at because that's something
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:53.400]  you're going to hit us pretty hard with they're going to throw a lot of money at that of course
[03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:58.080]  we're going to borrow money from the Chinese so we can develop this technology that is
[03:49:58.080 --> 03:50:01.880]  going to be less reliable look it's inevitable that when you make something that's a lot
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:06.960]  more complicated it's going to be less reliable and the thing that you need to have the most
[03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:13.840]  reliability for is the thing that you're using in a panic situation to try to save your life
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:17.200]  for the life of other people that's what you've got guns for you're going to be under a lot
[03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:23.520]  of pressure you don't need to have the complications of something that operates with software with
[03:50:23.520 --> 03:50:29.480]  additional electronics and additional any additionally to anything that like mechanical
[03:50:29.480 --> 03:50:34.840]  that could go wrong with a gun you want something that is solid that is reliable now when we
[03:50:34.840 --> 03:50:38.080]  come back I want to take a couple of calls we've only got one segment but if you want
[03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:42.440]  to jump in on anything we've talked about about the guns about EU the number to call

[03:55:38.360 --> 03:55:45.160]  says go ahead yeah hi David yeah you know I want to say this and I'm speaking to a brother
[03:55:45.160 --> 03:55:51.720]  in Christ Ted Cruz is as phony is a $3 bill when it comes to being a Christian for all
[03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:56.360]  the reasons you guys are bringing out you know originally I was supportive of this man along
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:56:01.520]  with Rand Paul for president and ran of course dropped out but you know the thing I want
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:06.400]  to say is that you know I'm getting this from Christians and I'm trying to in the Christian
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:13.680]  community at large this gets to a bigger issue that will support you know Cruz solely because
[03:56:13.680 --> 03:56:18.560]  he's a professing born-again Christian without looking at what he's been involved in the
[03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:24.800]  real issues and you know the thing is I want to say that this is evidence Ted Cruz is the
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:30.160]  symptom of the larger picture which is this you know in the Bible there's a principle
[03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:36.000]  where the spiritual precedes to what goes on in the natural the church is to be the conscience
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:41.600]  of the nation and the reason we've got so many people in America so dumb down and stupefied
[03:56:41.600 --> 03:56:47.120]  and zombified in the natural is because in the spiritual this is taking place where Christians
[03:56:47.120 --> 03:56:52.400]  believe in this pre-trib rapture fantasy because here's what I'm hearing I bring up in church
[03:56:52.400 --> 03:56:57.920]  about voting and a woman says I vote for the rapture oh I can see you know another guy
[03:56:57.920 --> 03:57:03.280]  says in church I can see God's hand in ISIS it's it's evidence that the coming of the
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:08.000]  water is imminent you know well go ahead and put the chip in me I heard a preacher say this
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  last year because you know what that's not the market of the beach now I know it because I'm
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:16.320]  not going to be here when they issue it and so what I'm saying brother is we've got this
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:21.600]  fantasy among Christians in America who ought to be the most aware and awake to what's going on
[03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:26.960]  in the most involved and yet the majority of Christians have this don't bother me with politics
[03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:32.560]  I don't want to get involved and so all I can say is when it comes to you because of big decisions
[03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:38.320]  that are being made it by those in power and in authority and it affects you and they drag you
[03:57:38.320 --> 03:57:42.480]  off to one of the FEMA camps and do horrible things to your family like they're doing in foreign
[03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:47.920]  countries now don't say you weren't warned because it's all in the Bible that you claim to believe
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:53.200]  I couldn't agree with you more Stephen and I have to say to people look if you're a Christian and as
[03:57:53.200 --> 03:57:57.840]  I look at Francis Schaefer and others who said all right so we're safe so so how do we live
[03:57:57.840 --> 03:58:03.120]  aren't you called to protect the innocent how can you turn your back on people say hey I don't care
[03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:07.680]  what happens them raptors coming or whatever okay it looked like the rapture was coming to a lot of
[03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:13.520]  people when Adolf Hitler was going through Europe didn't it you can't predict when it's going to
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:17.760]  happen you don't know when it's going to happen you have some clear moral principles and I think
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:23.840]  the thing that has been the most devastating is that people look to political leaders for spiritual
[03:58:23.840 --> 03:58:38.880]  guidance that's the key thing there join us tonight 7 central apm eastern for the nightly news
