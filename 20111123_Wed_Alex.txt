[00:52.600 --> 00:57.000]  filing many reports from the road as you've heard and seen here on the Alex Jones show
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.720]  and Info Wars nightly news now today we have just an incredible lineup of news including
[01:03.720 --> 01:10.600]  coverage of the debate last night where Ron Paul well they gave him more than 89 seconds for
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.080]  starters can you imagine that and he just blew away the competition with some rational
[01:16.080 --> 01:23.040]  common-sense answers to keep us out of wars to return some fiscal sanity to America and
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.640]  basically do what's right for the future of our nation so we're going to be playing some clips
[01:28.640 --> 01:35.240]  for you from that debate and also bringing you some commentary on that and and covering some
[01:35.240 --> 01:40.880]  of the crazy the crazy answers by Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney and all the other globalists
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.520]  there who are now essentially saying that hey the Bill of Rights shouldn't apply to you if we
[01:46.520 --> 01:52.080]  declare some kind of a war even if it hasn't been legally declared by the Congress imagine that
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.560]  also today coming up we have Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us at the bottom of the hour to
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.840]  talk about tyranny and a concept that we're calling trickle down tyranny and what else
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.720]  is going on with the TSA and the world of security that was also the topic of the debates last night
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.840]  the CNN presidential debates or I'm sorry Republican nominee debates we also have coming up today
[02:16.840 --> 02:22.880]  Dr. Stewart Lonkey who's going to be talking to us about the dangers of environmental toxins
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.920]  that you may not know about in fact he's the author of a book called Invisible Killers and
[02:28.920 --> 02:36.000]  he's here to talk to us about the toxic metals that are found in the environment and in the foods
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.320]  and in industrial processes that we are now taking into our bodies and I am convinced that much of
[02:43.320 --> 02:49.760]  the insanity that we are seeing in the world today especially in America is due to heavy metals
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.640]  poisoning and chemical poisoning I think it's a topic that we haven't covered enough and it could
[02:55.640 --> 03:02.120]  explain why so many voters and so many people so many members of the of the mass public out there
[03:02.120 --> 03:10.440]  they seem to be literally insane I mean insane completely irrational saying things like oh let's
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.920]  see we're 15 trillion dollars in debt let's get out of that debt by spending another five
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.000]  trillion dollars whoo that's brilliant it's right there I think it's heavy metals poisoning or at
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.160]  least that could be part of it it's got to also be the fluoride it's got to be related to the
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.880]  vaccines and the pesticides and you know all the chemicals that are out there in the food supply
[03:29.880 --> 03:35.560]  and in the environment so we're gonna be talking to Dr. Stuart Lonkey to get some answers about that
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.400]  and if you see me looking at all the notes here for those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv it's

[08:14.040 --> 08:20.200]  all right welcome folks this is the alex jones show on wednesday november 23rd 2011
[08:20.200 --> 08:25.720]  i'm the fill-in host today mike adams the health ranger the editor of natural news.com
[08:26.280 --> 08:32.600]  and today we're going to be covering just a number of mind-blowing topics truly fascinating
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.720]  stuff this is this is one of the most info packed shows i've ever hosted here starting off with ron
[08:37.720 --> 08:43.800]  paul in the debate last night where he squared off against newt gingrich and other globalists
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.960]  who were all spouting some very scary information about why you shouldn't have your bill of rights
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.360]  if they think we're in a war and we're going to run a little bit of video from that in a minute
[08:54.360 --> 09:01.240]  but first let me let me set this up and explain the they started off with a question from edwin
[09:01.240 --> 09:09.800]  meese yeah the former u.s attorney general who begins by really spouting what a series of lies
[09:09.800 --> 09:17.880]  he says oh there've been 42 terrorist attacks prevented by the patriot act and he says the
[09:17.880 --> 09:26.040]  patriot act is a is a tool that's fundamental to stopping terrorists and then he asked shouldn't
[09:26.040 --> 09:32.600]  we have a quote long range extension of the patriot act so that these law enforcement officers
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.160]  can continue to use this wonderful wonderful tool to prevent terrorism and of course predictably
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.880]  all the other globalists on the stage other than ron paul they agree with edwin meese now
[09:43.880 --> 09:49.240]  in his question though he didn't tell you the truth of these quote 42 terrorist attacks that
[09:49.240 --> 09:55.320]  have been prevented by the the patriot act uh probably 41 out of 42 were attacks that were
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.880]  set up by the fbi right the fbi goes out there on the record this is now publicly on the record
[10:01.880 --> 10:09.000]  the fbi goes out there creates the plots recruits the so-called terrorists who are actually normally
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.560]  just innocent people who don't really know what they're involved in the fbi provides the money
[10:15.560 --> 10:21.800]  they provide the weapons they provide the planning the motivation the target lists and then after they
[10:21.800 --> 10:27.240]  hand this over to these would-be terrorists magically another branch of the fbi shows up and
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.600]  i guess what oh they catch them they catch them this is like playing cowboys and indians in your
[10:32.600 --> 10:40.040]  own backyard sandbox isn't it kind of like okay you play like the the indians or the terrorists
[10:40.040 --> 10:45.400]  and we'll play like the cowboys and we'll act like we catch you and then we'll report to the media
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.840]  what a great job we're doing stopping terrorism and we'll use that as a justification to continue
[10:50.840 --> 10:59.080]  the completely illegal patriot act which is a violation at so many levels of basic fundamental
[10:59.080 --> 11:04.280]  not just human rights but of course the bill of rights so this was the question that edwin
[11:04.280 --> 11:10.600]  meese let off with it was a loaded question like using loaded dice in a poker game and then of course
[11:10.600 --> 11:16.360]  wolf blitzer add and write only that he said quote gee only this weekend there was an alleged
[11:16.360 --> 11:22.600]  terror plot uncovered in new york city oh my god yeah probably another one set up by the fbi
[11:22.600 --> 11:29.640]  they can see they can do it more than once you see this makes them think they're important so
[11:29.640 --> 11:37.240]  then gingrich replies well uh you have to have two sets of laws really you have the bill of
[11:37.240 --> 11:43.960]  rights only applies to quote criminal investigations you know people who rob others or people who
[11:43.960 --> 11:49.720]  commit acts of violence or common crimes but he says you you should have a totally different set
[11:49.720 --> 11:55.560]  of rules when there's a war when there's national security at risk you shouldn't have the bill of
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.640]  rights at all this is i'm paraphrasing him obviously he says basically the terror threat will be
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.440]  ongoing probably through multiple generations yeah because it's working out really well well
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.200]  for the globalist to have this scary terror threat out there even if they have to invent it
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.720]  and by the way paul craig roberts is coming up at the bottom of this hour to give us more commentary
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.520]  on that he wrote a great article a few weeks ago about the complete fabrication of the entire war
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.880]  on terror that was published at info wars dot com if you want to check that out but newt gingrich
[12:25.880 --> 12:33.480]  goes on to say that you you shouldn't have a bill of rights if if there's a war going on but you
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.800]  see uh who decides if there's a war it certainly wasn't congress they never declared a war they
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.680]  never debated a declaration of a war and ron paul points this out but newt gingrich and the other
[12:44.680 --> 12:52.600]  globalists apparently think that they can just pronounce a war oh there's a war or a war like
[12:53.400 --> 13:02.280]  ambiance in the global sphere and from that we're going to just subjectively decide that you
[13:02.280 --> 13:09.640]  shouldn't have a fourth amendment right anymore or or first amendment as the occupy wall street
[13:09.640 --> 13:16.040]  protesters are finding out or a second amendment or or a due process a fifth amendment or even
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.160]  tenth amendment rights for the states i mean it just goes on and on and it is it is the most obscene
[13:21.960 --> 13:31.480]  example of just runaway runaway freedom grabbing terror minded thinking the philosophy of these
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.840]  people of these globalists who were on the stage last night on the cnn debate i tell you their
[13:36.840 --> 13:43.320]  philosophy every one of them except for ron paul their philosophy is identical to the philosophical
[13:43.320 --> 13:49.560]  foundations of nazi war criminals all right who justify their actions by saying we're at war
[13:50.360 --> 13:57.240]  so therefore we can do anything this is what newt gingrich seems to be proposing it's incredible
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.880]  let's run some of that video footage of ron paul to hear what his answer was to these globalists
[14:03.880 --> 14:09.400]  and their war mongering terror mongering fear mongering efforts to scare everybody and giving
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.520]  up their rights go go ahead with that if you got it ron paul on congressman from texas i am
[14:15.160 --> 14:20.200]  pleased to be here the debate because this is a very important debate i am convinced that needless
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.400]  and unnecessary wars are a great detriment they undermine our prosperity and our liberties they
[14:25.400 --> 14:31.240]  add to our deficits and they consume our welfare we should take a careful look at our foreign policy
[14:31.240 --> 14:39.160]  right to the questions all right let's let's move ahead this is wolf blitzer asking the loaded or
[14:39.160 --> 14:43.240]  handling the loaded question from edwin meese go ahead about a minute and a half on that or so in
[14:43.240 --> 14:50.600]  meantime let me read you a quote that ron paul had that he stated in this debate he says quote i
[14:50.600 --> 14:57.720]  have a personal belief that you never have to give up liberty for security that's hit and there was
[14:57.720 --> 15:03.240]  applause after he said that what an amazing concept huh you never have to give up your liberty for
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.120]  security he says quote you can still provide security without sacrificing our bill of rights
[15:08.120 --> 15:14.120]  let's see what else he's got to say go ahead all rights yeah he just said that right there i want
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.240]  to bring others in but do you want to respond mr speaker yeah timothy being very succeeded
[15:19.240 --> 15:28.680]  there's a whole point if you look at newt's face during this debate he's just it's so arrogant
[15:28.680 --> 15:35.000]  of oh how timothy mcvay succeeded yeah who who set up the oklahoma city bombing really i mean
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.680]  who was involved in 9 11 really i mean come on who's setting up all the fake terra plots across
[15:40.680 --> 15:45.560]  america today it's the fbi it's the insiders we know that's going on who brought that brought down
[15:45.560 --> 15:50.680]  world trade center building seven come on demolition style brought it down it's i mean
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.880]  you know it's it's to the point where if you if you watch that debate they got a room full of people
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.200]  hundreds of people and we'll play more from ron paul if you get that queued up there you've got
[16:00.200 --> 16:03.480]  hundreds of people in there you've got all these people on stage you got wolf blitz are asking
[16:03.480 --> 16:11.240]  the questions the only sane person in the room is ron paul everybody else there is clinically
[16:11.240 --> 16:18.040]  insane in my opinion they they are living in an imaginary world where terror threats exist on
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.520]  every street corner terrorists are in your kitchen terrorists are in your shower terrorists are in
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.080]  your luggage they're hiding in your luggage and they're hiding down your pants that's why the tsa
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.760]  has to reach down your pants to check for terrorism you know and ron paul replies it says there wasn't
[16:32.760 --> 16:37.960]  a war declared on on anybody and terrorism is a concept not a person not a people go ahead and
[16:37.960 --> 16:41.560]  roll some more from ron paul there let's see if we get a good good segment here that's digging
[16:43.480 --> 16:47.560]  that's digging a hole for ourselves what if they look like timothy mcvay you know he was
[16:47.560 --> 16:52.360]  pretty tough criminal he's talking about profiling here too much carelessness in the use of words
[16:52.360 --> 16:58.200]  that were at war i don't remember voting on it on a declared declaration of war all war against
[16:58.200 --> 17:05.880]  terrorism and terrorism is a tactic it isn't a person it isn't a people so this is a fairly
[17:05.880 --> 17:12.120]  careless use of words what about this sacrifice liberties because they're terrorists you're the
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.960]  judge in the jury no they're suspects and they have changed the in the d o d budget they have
[17:17.960 --> 17:23.480]  changed the wording on the different definition of al-qaeda and taliban it's anybody associated
[17:23.480 --> 17:29.160]  with organizations which means almost anybody can be loosely associated so that makes all
[17:29.160 --> 17:35.480]  americans vulnerable and now we know that american citizens are vulnerable to assassination so i would
[17:35.480 --> 17:41.160]  be very cautious about protecting the rule of law it will be a sacrifice that you'll be sorry for
[17:41.160 --> 17:47.080]  herman kane let's bring you into this conversation those words should go down in history as the red
[17:47.080 --> 17:53.480]  alert warning from ron paul to all free minded citizens who want to protect the future of their
[17:53.480 --> 18:00.280]  nation here in the united states he says again so i would be very cautious about protecting
[18:00.280 --> 18:06.280]  the rule of law he says it will be a sacrifice what he means is if you give up the rule of law if
[18:06.280 --> 18:12.440]  you give up law in order to have a little extra security he says that is a sacrifice you will
[18:12.440 --> 18:20.840]  be sorry for and he is absolutely right this is the most crucial issue of our time and ron paul
[18:20.840 --> 18:27.000]  is issuing a red alert warning in this he says we now know that americans are vulnerable to
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.640]  assassination because the white house can come up with an assassination list and just take out an
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.600]  american citizen without any due process whatsoever do you realize the magnitude of this people i'm
[18:38.600 --> 18:44.200]  hoping that you're really tuning in and really listening to this because look before 1776 before
[18:44.200 --> 18:50.280]  america had its independence we had the british occupying forces over here in north america
[18:50.280 --> 18:54.760]  and they were they were speaking the same kind of words that the globalists like newt gingrich
[18:54.760 --> 18:59.560]  are speaking today they said we're in a state of war therefore you have no rights we will interrogate
[18:59.560 --> 19:05.480]  you you have no right to to maintain your your silence you have no right to privacy we will
[19:05.480 --> 19:10.680]  conduct illegal searches and seizures we will force you to quarter and house the soldiers and feed
[19:10.680 --> 19:15.560]  them and pay them money we will force you to do all these things because we are the british empire
[19:15.560 --> 19:21.400]  and because we're in a state of war apparently apparently newt gingrich now thinks that that
[19:21.400 --> 19:26.760]  same kind of thinking should be the rule the rules that are followed here in america today
[19:26.760 --> 19:32.520]  don't you realize people the bill of rights was created to prevent that even the third amendment
[19:32.520 --> 19:39.400]  was about preventing us from having to be forced to quarter british soldiers in our homes okay the
[19:39.400 --> 19:45.480]  fourth amendment the first the second the on down the list the reason they are there is because we
[19:45.480 --> 19:50.520]  do not want to be ruled by tyrants who declare a state of war stay with us here on the alex jones

[24:30.280 --> 24:35.720]  we've got paul craig roberts coming up in just what is that about seven uh what eight minutes nine
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.440]  minutes something like that and we're going to be talking about the tyranny that is taking over
[24:40.920 --> 24:46.840]  america today and the concept of trickle down tyranny which is what happens when all the local
[24:46.840 --> 24:53.160]  little bureaucrats and power people they witness what's happening at the federal level and they
[24:53.160 --> 24:57.720]  think oh it must be socially acceptable now to just act like a thug and act like a tyrant
[24:57.720 --> 25:05.320]  and they they replicate that they mimic that they shape that behavior and and and become their
[25:05.320 --> 25:11.320]  own little local tyrants all right but getting back to ron paul and the debate uh you know i gotta
[25:11.320 --> 25:17.640]  you know i gotta say i i'm trying to say happy thanksgiving but also at the same time warn you
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.640]  this may be your last free thanksgiving in other words your last thanksgiving as a free citizen
[25:24.280 --> 25:30.280]  if if we don't get ron paul and that kind of philosophy into positions of power in this

[25:35.160 --> 25:39.800]  going to be looking back at this thanksgiving and asking yourself what the heck happened
[25:39.800 --> 25:44.200]  what happened to our bill of rights what happened to our freedoms what happened to our bank
[25:44.200 --> 25:50.280]  accounts what happened to our futures because ron paul is right he is he he is the only guy
[25:50.280 --> 25:54.920]  there that makes any sense and i gotta say i am i am honored today to be here hosting the alice
[25:54.920 --> 26:01.160]  jones show and to be part of the info wars effort to enlighten people to awaken people because we
[26:01.160 --> 26:08.680]  want to prevent tyranny and prevent the enslavement of the people we want freedom and we want peace
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.520]  all right ron paul wants to bring those soldiers home and close those bases where we are meddling
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.000]  with the foreign affairs of these other nations bring those soldiers home and have peace and
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.840]  have our family together wouldn't that be nice to have a thanksgiving and a christmas with your
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.360]  family where you don't have tsa search in your your underwear at the airport where you don't
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.840]  have tsa checkpoints on the road as you're traveling from place to place in what's supposed
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.000]  to be a free a free country let me read you a couple more quotes from ron paul
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.720]  in responding to a question about where newt gingrich says that we gotta have more more police
[26:43.720 --> 26:48.440]  and we gotta have more security again i'm paraphrasing but he's saying we gotta have the patriot act
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.640]  even you know give it even more power ron paul says in response to that this is like saying we
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.920]  need a policeman in every house a camera in every house because we want to prevent wife beating
[26:59.720 --> 27:05.640]  if you advocate the police state yes you can have security and you might prevent a crime
[27:05.640 --> 27:12.680]  but the crime will then be against the american people and against our freedoms and he's absolutely
[27:12.680 --> 27:17.560]  right about that you can keep clamping down you can put police on every corner you can have
[27:17.560 --> 27:23.880]  checkpoints on every interstate and every highway you can hire government thugs to feel you up and
[27:23.880 --> 27:28.440]  feel you down and put you down in every airport and every football stadium and every church and
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.120]  every school in the country but you won't stop terrorism and you won't have any freedom left
[27:34.120 --> 27:40.440]  that's the truth of the matter and if you don't get that out there folks if you don't get this point
[27:41.080 --> 27:47.720]  then i'm sorry you are you are going down with the the end of freedom in america today you need
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.680]  to wake up and ron paul says that he's got a quote he says this is a road to disaster when
[27:52.680 --> 27:58.760]  he's talking about military spending he says we'd better we'd better wake up if we don't wake up
[27:58.760 --> 28:04.920]  this is this is all history the bill of rights is about to become history your fourth amendment
[28:04.920 --> 28:13.400]  rights are eroding at an astonishing rate it is very very concerning and i i stand here well i
[28:13.400 --> 28:20.360]  sit here in alex jones chair today but i i stand here firmly on on this principle that we must
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.720]  restore the rights that made this country great that we must get the the government out of our
[28:25.720 --> 28:30.360]  lives out of our pants off of our highways out of our homes stop with the secret surveillance
[28:30.360 --> 28:36.760]  we've got more news about surveillance going on here did you know that that stores now retailers
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.120]  on black friday coming up in just two days they are going to be tracking you by monitoring your
[28:42.120 --> 28:49.800]  cell phone signals as you move from store to store yeah i'm not making this up folks search this
[28:49.800 --> 28:53.560]  online if you don't believe me they're going to be tracking you moving from point to point
[28:53.560 --> 28:59.560]  and they think it's all okay why because again trickle down tyranny if the federal government
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.240]  is monitoring everything that you're doing and reading your emails and monitoring your
[29:03.240 --> 29:09.800]  facebook posts and checking you on the highway why shouldn't the local retailers do it too
[29:09.800 --> 29:15.800]  why shouldn't everybody do it let's all just become a police state of tattletales and janet
[29:15.800 --> 29:24.920]  and apolitano spy masters who spy on each other and i run around paranoid oh my goodness the
[29:24.920 --> 29:30.120]  retailers are tracking us it must be good maybe they're going to give us a coupon for 50 cents off

[33:33.720 --> 33:40.600]  about expanding the patriot act even more you know lock it in long term hey who needs a bill of
[33:40.600 --> 33:45.320]  rights huh when it only it only worked for a couple hundred years let's let's ditch it now
[33:45.320 --> 33:50.280]  i guess is what these people are thinking unbelievable we do have paul craig roberts
[33:50.280 --> 33:53.640]  coming up here in just a couple of minutes but quick uh before then we're going to cover a little
[33:53.640 --> 34:02.440]  bit of news bring that graphic back up bpa spikes 1200 after eating canned soup but those of you
[34:02.440 --> 34:09.080]  watching on on prison planet dot tv you can see the the visuals here a new study shows that people
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.760]  who ate canned soup for five days straight saw their urinary levels of the chemical bisphenol
[34:14.760 --> 34:19.400]  a that's the hormone mimicking chemical that has a lot of people concerned about cancer and
[34:20.280 --> 34:26.760]  ooh a little bit of breast augmentation for males there not not not something that a lot of people
[34:26.760 --> 34:33.480]  want to do understandably uh that spikes 1200 bpa 1200 higher in the blood of those who are eating
[34:33.480 --> 34:39.480]  canned soup for five days straight uh this is the first study to quantify bpa levels in humans
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.680]  after the ingestion of canned foods now here's an interesting fact you may not know about this
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.960]  there is no such thing as a canned food that has a liner in it which is free of bpa to my
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.040]  knowledge i checked we called all the major can manufacturers throughout the industry to ask is
[34:58.040 --> 35:05.320]  there a liner an enamel inside cans that is free of bpa and the answer we were told is no no such
[35:05.320 --> 35:11.000]  thing at the moment but they're working feverishly on it but then the other question is what other
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.720]  chemicals are going to be in there besides the bpa see maybe maybe it's bpa free in the future but
[35:15.720 --> 35:21.640]  it's got some other chemical that we don't even know about yet just make up three random letters
[35:21.640 --> 35:29.320]  c k j that's going to be the next chemical that they find in these cans it all gets back to the
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.440]  basics folks if you eat food out of your own garden uh if you practice some home gardening
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.520]  and a little bit of permaculture and you eat that food you're always going to be better off than
[35:38.520 --> 35:46.040]  eating something out of a can we've got from the american dream 20 signs that america is going crazy
[35:46.680 --> 35:54.040]  is this posted up on info wars guys i i bet it is 20 20 more signs yeah it's up there got a
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.840]  confirmation on that check it out when you know it's going crazy when you see presidential candidates
[35:58.840 --> 36:06.520]  up on stage who are debating and all of them except one say that we don't need a bill of rights as long
[36:06.520 --> 36:13.880]  as some president says we might be in a war doesn't make any sense us and arab states set to impose a
[36:13.880 --> 36:21.240]  no fly zone over syria this is paul joseph watson article now posted on info wars dot com it always
[36:21.240 --> 36:27.880]  starts with the no fly zone doesn't it yep and then it becomes a a no life zone as they start with the
[36:27.880 --> 36:35.160]  depleted uranium bombing another weapon of mass destruction that is being used by the military
[36:35.160 --> 36:41.240]  to make life unlivable in some of these target zones for not just a couple years but a couple of
[36:41.240 --> 36:47.160]  well a couple of tens hundreds of thousands of years in some cases here's another article in
[36:47.160 --> 36:53.240]  russia today with the west's fixation on Assad eclipses bloody chaos in egypt this is all just
[36:53.240 --> 36:59.240]  more beating the war drums getting ready for action in iran and syria and somewhere else
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.320]  hey we saw what was this janet the politano and then the department of homeland security put out
[37:05.320 --> 37:11.400]  a warning about turkey and i don't mean the country turkey i thought it was going to be a terror
[37:11.400 --> 37:16.200]  alert about maybe turkey but you know turkey's not in the news that much in turn not not like
[37:16.200 --> 37:22.200]  iran and syria these days but no it was about the dangers of frying a turkey in your own home
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.560]  oh my goodness so we're going to have a little segment on that near the top of this hour i
[37:27.560 --> 37:33.720]  brought some gear for it i have i have fire gear here yeah because they showed a video of the turkey
[37:33.720 --> 37:42.760]  catching on fire and burning down someone's porch uh deck and full full flames everywhere from
[37:42.760 --> 37:49.560]  roasting not not roasting but deep frying a turkey so i'm going to don a fireman's hat and some nomax
[37:49.560 --> 37:56.520]  gloves and we're going to tackle the subject of cooking a turkey terror style that's right
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.800]  that's all coming up here and we do have paul craig roberts joining us now and he's here to
[38:01.800 --> 38:07.640]  talk about trickle down charity and some of the other topics paul craig roberts is one of the
[38:07.640 --> 38:12.760]  most prolific and in my opinion one of the most brilliant political writers if not the most of
[38:12.760 --> 38:17.000]  all time i'm a great admirer of paul craig roberts and we published many of his stories in fact on
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.240]  natural news paul are you with us can you hear me yes i hear your mic and i want to congratulate
[38:23.240 --> 38:28.280]  you for trickle down turning i will thank you paul that that really means a lot to me coming from
[38:28.280 --> 38:33.960]  you i i've admired your writing and your analysis for many many years what is in your mind of what's
[38:33.960 --> 38:40.120]  going on today especially following the the debates that just happened last night well
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.640]  well you know there's only one candidate for president that's ron paul the rest of them are a
[38:45.640 --> 38:53.000]  bunch of idiots they're all trying to outdo one another in starting world war three i've never
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.120]  seen such a collection of dopes in my life i mean and one of them uh if not obama is going to be
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.880]  president yeah that that's pretty scary actually i i i completely agree with your assessment there
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.480]  it's like they can't read it's like they think that the bill of rights must say at the very top
[39:11.480 --> 39:16.920]  this does not apply if someone mentions the word war you know there's no exception to the
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.600]  bill of rights what do you say no of course there's no exceptions you know it could just be
[39:23.480 --> 39:29.160]  that they're all bought and paid for by the military security complex you know eisenhower
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.320]  was what a half a century ago wasn't it that president eisenhower warned us and it's fair
[39:33.320 --> 39:39.720]  well addressed at the end of his second term that american liberty was in danger from the
[39:39.720 --> 39:46.280]  military security complex and so i believe that is uh could be what we're seeing today
[39:47.320 --> 39:55.240]  the takeover is so total that unless your complete uh shield for the military security
[39:55.240 --> 40:01.640]  complex you can't even run for office i mean look at obama for example you remember how excited
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.320]  everyone was about his election you remember sure the massive numbers of people that went
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.280]  and sat in the cold for his inauguration and many of them were miles away oh he was like
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.640]  the second coming of christ to some people you know it was an amazing week the country has never
[40:17.640 --> 40:25.640]  seen an outpouring of support for a president of that magnitude ever and what did he do he
[40:25.640 --> 40:35.240]  pissed it away well he started another war right away he um he validated all of the bush administration
[40:35.240 --> 40:37.080]  uh
[40:39.960 --> 40:44.120]  uh violations of the constitution well let me let me ask let me ask you paul uh
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.520]  sorry to interrupt there but you you wrote an article that a couple of weeks ago maybe a month
[40:48.520 --> 40:56.200]  ago there was a brilliant article laying out the case for what you say is the utter fabrication of
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.720]  the war on terror and i read your article point by point and i agree with it point by point and yet
[41:01.720 --> 41:09.320]  as we saw in the debates last night the operating illusions the the illusionary platform from which
[41:09.320 --> 41:13.160]  all the other candidates are operating and even wolf blitzer is asking questions and then the
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.640]  people in the crowd are asking questions like edwin meese their illusionary platform is that the
[41:17.640 --> 41:23.400]  war on terror is very very real and very scary and very much in your face and we're having immediate
[41:23.400 --> 41:29.480]  threat to our life and safety because of all these terrorists but you you were able to completely
[41:29.480 --> 41:36.280]  show that to be a total fraud yes we're living in george almost 1984 where we're all
[41:36.840 --> 41:45.720]  where big brothers media tells the people every day about all the wars that they're having to
[41:45.720 --> 41:54.280]  combat and it's all it's all hoax it's all hoax and it's amazing that no more than say what
[41:54.280 --> 42:01.000]  uh for the population sees through it it's an extraordinary thing that is that is astonishing
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.920]  and that it really makes me wonder about some of the reasons behind that later on in this show in
[42:04.920 --> 42:10.200]  fact we're going to be talking about heavy metals poisoning and how that might be impacting cognitive
[42:10.200 --> 42:14.760]  function and clear thinking what i mean what do you think in your analysis might be behind it are
[42:14.760 --> 42:21.800]  people just easily hoodwinked are they brainwashed are they apathetic what what do you think is
[42:21.800 --> 42:28.360]  psychologically behind this mass denial of reality i think a lot of things and one is
[42:28.360 --> 42:34.600]  there's no media you know except for individual programs like uh alex jones there's no reporting
[42:34.600 --> 42:42.520]  because the medium's concentrated uh in the last year's of the clean administration and it's no
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.880]  longer run by journalists it's no longer independent it's no longer diverse and so it serves as a
[42:47.880 --> 42:54.200]  propaganda ministry you know gerald salinti calls the prostitutes yeah which is an apt term so there's
[42:54.200 --> 42:59.720]  no source of information for people unless they work at it full time you know if they're on the
[42:59.720 --> 43:06.680]  internet they read foreign press they read sites that dig up the real news uh you have to in other
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.920]  words it's a huge uh time and energy effort to get any idea of what's really going on most people
[43:12.920 --> 43:19.800]  can't do that the other thing i think which has been controlling was they bought on to 9-11 yeah
[43:19.800 --> 43:25.480]  the minute you buy on a 9-11 you've accepted the premise for the for the police state the warmonger
[43:25.480 --> 43:30.680]  stretch state the threats everywhere and of course this serves the interests of the military
[43:30.680 --> 43:37.480]  security complex and they keep it alive we see this with the fbi organizing fake terror
[43:37.480 --> 43:46.280]  plots so they can arrest some poor dude and scare the people further so it's all a successful
[43:46.280 --> 43:53.400]  propaganda venture but isn't it also it's it's almost comedic it is very clownish it's it's like
[43:53.400 --> 44:00.280]  kindergartners playing with their imaginary friends and enemies this this is what the fbi is doing
[44:00.280 --> 44:06.600]  and then the atf running guns into mexico and and the american people don't see it how can
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.360]  how can they be so blind to it i don't get it i and that's a good question how can they be so
[44:12.360 --> 44:19.160]  blind but they're losing them they're losing the country they're liberated the reputation of the
[44:19.160 --> 44:26.040]  country and i think we're headed toward world three because when you can so delude an entire
[44:26.040 --> 44:33.080]  population supposedly a superpower supposedly the richest country on the world the best educated
[44:33.080 --> 44:40.520]  you know the united states allegedly has 17 of the top universities in the world and yet we have a
[44:40.520 --> 44:47.080]  population that can't perceive fraud right it's practice on them daily well it's amazing thing i
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.200]  don't know the answer but you can see what the consequences are dire we now have a police state
[44:52.920 --> 44:59.560]  and the police state as you point out in your brilliant article it's trickling down now everyone
[44:59.560 --> 45:06.200]  acts like they're running a torture chamber even nursing hall oh yeah yeah just to give people
[45:06.200 --> 45:11.400]  some background about that article which i called trickle down tyranny that was about some
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.560]  waterboarding of a an elderly woman an 89 year old woman in a nursing home was waterboarded by
[45:17.560 --> 45:22.840]  the staff in the nursing home over an argument about an ice cream sandwich i believe it was
[45:22.840 --> 45:30.840]  ice cream yeah so ice cream that's right it's an extraordinary thing we see the police gratuitous
[45:30.840 --> 45:36.840]  violence uh pile on violence over and over and over spraying people in the face who are just
[45:36.840 --> 45:43.880]  sitting quietly with pepper spray beating them with club it's an amazing uh show of brutality
[45:43.880 --> 45:50.840]  and violence warranties police all arrested and on trial the police don't have the right to abuse
[45:50.840 --> 45:57.320]  public this there's no the police have to follow the law like everyone else when they violate the
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.760]  law they should be arrested and held accountable but they're not and it's like you say if you don't
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.800]  hold the president accountable when you violate the law then you can't hold anybody else accountable
[46:07.800 --> 46:12.840]  and everyone's finding that out well that's the thing no one should be above the law the laws
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.480]  must apply equally to all people across the land including the president including the congress
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.560]  him including law enforcement especially law enforcement but the greatest shift that i see
[46:21.560 --> 46:27.720]  here that you've written about extensively paul is that the government quote servants now see
[46:27.720 --> 46:34.200]  themselves as rulers they see themselves as tyrants and so they act out on that self image
[46:34.200 --> 46:41.080]  and then the tyranny just begins to multiply whoa what do you got going on back there uh
[46:41.080 --> 46:50.440]  i you okay two cats and uh the little one thinks she's a leopard and uh if the big one gets out
[46:50.440 --> 46:57.080]  of um line uh she lets them have i think you're having a little trickle down feline tyranny
[46:57.080 --> 47:01.960]  back there in your own house maybe hey maybe janet the politano should put a camera in your
[47:01.960 --> 47:08.840]  living room just to make sure you're safe they probably have one no but but what do you think
[47:08.840 --> 47:15.400]  about this the the acting out of the self image role of being a thuggish tyrant ruler and that's
[47:15.400 --> 47:21.960]  how many many of these so-called servants now see themselves yes it's well uh as as you and i
[47:21.960 --> 47:30.360]  both see the aristocrats you remember the classic uh sort of uh protest of the the uncountability
[47:30.360 --> 47:39.560]  of the aristocrats is the story of the of the dukes or the urls carriage uh being driven at
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.360]  great speed through the village and it runs down the children of the peasants in the streets and
[47:44.360 --> 47:49.960]  goes on off and nobody can do anything about it well that's the kind of country we live in now
[47:49.960 --> 47:59.960]  as long as the people doing the damage are in the uh security complex or or high government
[47:59.960 --> 48:06.280]  leaders they're untouchable and it trickles down i wrote a book i think maybe 12 years ago the
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.920]  oxford university press published called the capitalist revolution in latin america and i
[48:10.920 --> 48:17.080]  quoted one of the ministers of one of the south american governments and he said if the minister
[48:18.280 --> 48:24.680]  lies and steals and by the time it trickles down to the bottom is subordinates or raping and
[48:24.680 --> 48:31.240]  murdering yeah right right it sort of escalates all on the way down it goes down you know the
[48:31.240 --> 48:41.240]  notion of a of a nursing home ward aborting an 89 year old woman before today who would have believed
[48:41.240 --> 48:46.760]  such a thing no exactly this is part of the i'm what i've tried to point out in that article is
[48:46.760 --> 48:53.480]  that it has infected the fabric of american culture and you see this with shows like 24
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.320]  with kiefer southerland who's a great actor but i just don't agree with the message of the show
[48:57.320 --> 49:02.920]  which was torturing everybody even even little children i believe to get answers out because
[49:02.920 --> 49:09.240]  it was all justified under fighting terrorists and and stopping some other violence it's it's the
[49:09.240 --> 49:16.840]  culture now it's the culture of course it's all contrary to everything that experts know about
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.920]  torture it never gets good information it's right the person being tortured simply tries to find out
[49:22.920 --> 49:28.360]  what the people torturing want to know and then he tells them yeah what do you want to hear you
[49:28.360 --> 49:34.280]  what what's it going to take to make the uh the torture stop the torture and in particularly
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.200]  seeing in guantanamo we now know for a fact that almost everyone there was totally honest
[49:40.200 --> 49:48.120]  there were people sold by warlords to the idiot americans who paid a bounty for and and so they
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.560]  they ended up having to release almost all of the people after torturing them for five or six or
[49:53.560 --> 49:59.560]  seven years so they were all totally innocent yet they all were tortured all those years and no
[49:59.560 --> 50:06.040]  information came out none well it's it's it's incredible paul we're we've only got a minute
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.800]  left here but where can you say with us after this break for a few more minutes if you like
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.360]  okay i would i really like to ask you a couple more questions but quickly as we go to break
[50:16.360 --> 50:23.080]  where do you think this is heading has ron paul made his point and and awaken enough people
[50:23.080 --> 50:30.280]  or are we still muddling through la la land of illusions and and terrorism fantasies by the globalist
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.480]  yes i don't think ron paul can awaken more than about 20 the population the rest of them or i think
[50:37.480 --> 50:45.000]  are lost and to answer the earlier question to complete it psychologically many americans
[50:45.000 --> 50:51.240]  uh think of themselves as you know the great people and paul stay stay with us we're gonna
[50:51.240 --> 50:55.000]  go to break right now but we'll be right back with more from paul craig roberts here on the

[56:00.520 --> 56:05.640]  it's burning up the deck units can be overfilled and that happens i've never seen such kitchen
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.520]  terror in my life units to catch on fire it's catching on fire one of our safety concerns
[56:10.520 --> 56:15.720]  with all right now they're giving you the safety rundown watch how easy oh man over are they gonna
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.640]  trip it oh the oil just came out laboratory we use water can you imagine it's a dangerous cooking
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.200]  device all right enough of that enough of that video it's getting hot in here all right gonna
[56:26.200 --> 56:32.360]  take all this gear off look i don't mean to make light of kitchen cooking accidents because you
[56:32.360 --> 56:37.640]  can have fires in the kitchen and you should have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen cook with
[56:37.640 --> 56:45.560]  no max gloves like these huh little no max gloves terror grip gloves but isn't this getting ridiculous
[56:45.560 --> 56:52.280]  where the department of homeland security is now telling us what to cook or how to how to cook things
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.720]  i mean it's crazy all right paul craig roberts thanks for bearing with me on that i'm
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.440]  i'm taking off all the fire gear now what do you think about all that video stuff well it didn't
[57:02.440 --> 57:09.720]  come through but i couldn't hear it that i could hear it and i suspect that very soon the department
[57:09.720 --> 57:15.160]  of homeland security will declare turkey cookers to be terrorist devices and if you have one you'll
[57:15.160 --> 57:22.600]  be arrested it'll be proved that you are planning a terrorist act oh well it's it's hard to say
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.920]  they're gonna come up with all kinds of new things to scare us with it it just seems like the
[57:26.920 --> 57:33.480]  overriding theme of everything they put out there is be afraid spy on your neighbor be paranoid
[57:33.480 --> 57:39.640]  isn't this the opposite of what they should be teaching people really especially when there's no
[57:39.640 --> 57:47.160]  threat you know what terrorist threat have we suffered other than 9-11 and there's a great
[57:47.160 --> 57:55.240]  deal of uh of dissent that this was actually done by um by the saudi arabians from abroad
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.520]  all the others are staged by the fbi there are no other terrorist
[58:00.520 --> 58:09.000]  uh uh examples here and yet we have this huge department that i think consumes 80 billion
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.920]  dollars a year and which is now stopping traffic on the nation's highways right thanksgiving day
[58:14.920 --> 58:23.800]  traffic and they're you know it's so biocracies always grow as rapidly and extend their jurisdiction
[58:23.800 --> 58:29.160]  as far as they can so that's all right paul craig roberts i i'm sorry to wrap i want to thank you
[58:29.160 --> 58:34.920]  for joining us today this has been a great segment with you this is mike adams starting brush fires

[59:07.400 --> 59:14.600]  number two learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends number three take decisive action

[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.400]  roberts who just joined us in the last segment i apologize for cutting him off there sometimes
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.600]  when you're going to break you got to do that but paul craig roberts one of one of personally
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.600]  the people that i admire the most as a writer and a thinker and an analyst
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.280]  every time i read his articles i learned something new and quite profound so be sure to check out
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.440]  his information is there a website guys for paul craig roberts that we should give out let me know
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.920]  moving on turkey frying terror i thought you know in this segment here we'd have a just a bit of a
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:10.440]  a comedic relief what about seven other foods that janet napolitano thinks might be tools of
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:17.320]  terrorism huh hey hey if deep frying a turkey is so dangerous that they have to issue an official
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:24.760]  tweet about it maybe there are some other weapons of mass convection that's your oven convection
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.360]  that we should be concerned about now i have six and i'm challenging the crew back there
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.120]  to come up with the seventh you got it you got to come up with the seventh here we go
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.080]  seven other foods that could be tools of terrorism uh number one of course will be human breast milk
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.840]  they already think that's terrorism that's why they have infiltrator infiltrators yeah that's
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.120]  a good word infiltrators and spies who are going out and trying to arrest people who are buying
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.200]  and selling and transporting raw milk and why is it dangerous oh because it's not pasteurized
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:03.080]  it's alive of course we've got these suggestions by the way we're from the natural news facebook fan
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.960]  page so i want to thank those fans for their little contributions uh they gave me the idea
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.080]  of baked beans because they produce flammable gases which are illegal to carry on an airplane
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:20.840]  by the way so that could be a weapon of terrorism very soon microwavable popcorn because it explodes
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:28.200]  and it sounds like gunfire you microwave popcorn you could get a visit from dhs how about that
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:34.760]  velveta cheese because you can't identify it it has no biometrics nobody knows what's it what
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.480]  it's really made of kind of a mystery we're not even sure if it has a genetic code so we don't
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:46.440]  know if it's gmo or not big mystery uh deviled eggs yep because of course the devil's in them
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:54.680]  um deviled eggs uh green peas that could be another food of of tremendous terror why why
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.880]  you ask well obviously because the department of homeland security doesn't want anything resembling
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:08.120]  world peas bad humor on this thanksgiving holiday thank you guys all right what's your suggestion
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:17.880]  guys you got a food vitamin c that's how could that be a terror weapon vitamin c because it
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:25.320]  lets you see things that you're not supposed to see i got you you're good okay that was from
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:31.240]  the info wars staff behind the curtain right back there yeah i hope i hope you're staying
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.600]  entertained and informed at the same time our focus here is to of course give you a little bit
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:43.960]  of both but this reminds me oh no here here's a quote from someone on the facebook page who
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:49.720]  was reacting to this news that dhs put out this tweet about the dangers of frying turkey
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:56.680]  and i'm i'm bleeping out the profanity here so it's clean okay it's okay for radio this person
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.800]  says quote they're only dangerous talking about the turkey the turkey's being dropped into the
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.920]  fryers they're only dangerous because bleeping idiots think they can throw frozen bleep into
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.240]  a vat of boiling bleep on top of an open flame and that everything will be okay
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.440]  yeah he's got a point right think about the laws of physics when you do this stuff
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:27.080]  there is an open flame it can tip easily there's hot oil and you shouldn't just throw something
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.040]  frozen in there all right but this also brings me to a quote from thomas jefferson which will take
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.800]  us to break quote was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet our bodies would be
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.480]  in such keeping as our souls are now thomas jefferson notes of the state of virginia talking
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:50.920]  about why we shouldn't have the government telling us what to eat get vitamin c something say something
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.360]  that's the winning entry in the terror food alert vitamin c something say something we'll be right
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:04.440]  back on the ellis jones show stay with us a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.640]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years he says it will change

[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.960]  tomorrow or the next day so i can't wait to find out about that i texted alex this morning and
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.640]  and said i'm going to cover ron paul i'm going to be covering some of these things and and i
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.280]  didn't get an answer so he's probably like on the road man just really going going for it
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.080]  trying to get back to austin as soon as possible so good for him and thank you for inviting me on
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.360]  here to host so continuing we've got a lot more news coming up and at the bottom of this hour we
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.440]  have a dr steward launke he's going to be joining us to talk about some of the dangers out there in
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.920]  the environment stuff that we really haven't focused on that much the heavy metals poisoning
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.640]  in our environment the chemical poisoning that we're not aware of and he's really more of a
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:45.640]  conventional doctor but who who has specialized in cancer prevention by telling the truth about
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.480]  the effects of toxic chemicals and heavy metals so he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:55.800]  until then we've got more news all right prozac and fluoride look i just wanted i know alex has
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:02.520]  covered this a lot here on the show but i wanted to reiterate that prozac is 94 percent fluoride
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:12.360]  all right 94 percent fluoride so if prozac makes you chill out and it makes kids feel okay and it
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:18.440]  makes adults feel okay what do you think fluoride's doing you think fluoride is not not psychoactive
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.720]  of course it's psychoactive that goes all the way back to nazi germany oh by the way along
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:30.920]  those lines i've been reading more books by jim mars and i have to say read jim mars read the
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:39.560]  book called rise of the fourth rike it is an amazing tour of the the nazi germany influence on
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:47.800]  nasa on the space program on the politics on banking on pharmaceuticals on agriculture
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.200]  pesticides you name it it's incredible and it's extremely well documented so giving a big shout

[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.440]  info wars dot com website today so if you want to know the latest on that wow what an outrageous
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.920]  example of just complete outright theft just stealing money from people hundreds of millions
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.400]  of dollars i think is what was stolen from people and they don't even care they're like just just take
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:02.040]  it we stole your money deal with it that's the new banking system in america today next item
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:09.320]  we have now confirmed that wall greens is giving out ipad prizes to employees that push the most
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.440]  flu vaccines do you have a wall greens graphic for those of you watching on
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:22.520]  prisonplanet.tv yeah so we we went to wall greens and well i should say we talked to their press
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.640]  department and we said wait a minute we've got employees who are saying that you're giving out
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:35.000]  ipads as prizes when those employees push vaccines onto their customers now we covered this a couple
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.800]  of weeks ago here on the show but now we've confirmed it officially confirmed from the
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.360]  corporate headquarters of wall greens and they actually gave us a statement all right so check
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.400]  out this statement i guess i got to thank them for getting back in touch with us they said quote
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:55.720]  our objective during flu season is to protect as many people as possible through the administration
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:03.000]  of flu shots as an important preventive health measure it's protection now protection the incentive
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.400]  program they say is one of the ways in which we encourage our employees to support this objective
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.720]  objective it's like a military objective and for our pharmacies to continue to play
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:22.520]  a leading role a leading role in helping people stay healthy during the flu season
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:28.760]  they should just say amen at the end of that or something as if they're because it's almost like
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:34.680]  they're trying to invoke that they're following the commandments of god which they are not they add
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.760]  we share the recommendations of the cdc another national health organizations oh really they
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:49.960]  followed the cdc okay that explains it you mean the cdc who had one of their own researchers
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:57.320]  indicted by a federal grand jury in atlanta for allegedly taking grant money and using it to buy
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:05.720]  motorcycles and cars and houses that guy you mean the same cdc that pushed the false fear story
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:12.520]  about the pandemic in order to sell more vaccines oh no wait a minute maybe you mean the cdc that was
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:19.240]  formerly headed by dr julie gerber ding who after the big swine flu scare went on and took a job
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:27.400]  as the president of mercs global vaccine division oh that cdc that's what wall greens follows that
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:36.680]  cdc now i see dc with vitamin c something say something on the side yeah it's all making sense
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:43.240]  now anyway wall greens goes on to say we encourage flu shots for everyone over the age of six months
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.960]  so a seven month old toddler how about a 19 year old pregnant woman you should get a flu shot too
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.400]  and if a wall greens employee encourages you to get that flu shot they might win an ipad
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:04.440]  oh goody more electronics from big brother apple can't wait can't wait to see what now i tell you
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.800]  what next year they're going to just pay you to take a flu shot you want a flu shot buddy here have
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:16.920]  a 20 i mean isn't safe way given out coupons now 10 off your groceries if you get a flu shot
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:24.680]  that's true oh you got the you got the photo right on 10 off your groceries how's that a way to entice
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:31.400]  the poorest of the poor people who can't even afford to eat but if you get a flu shot yeah you'll
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:39.000]  save a few bucks off your macaroni and cheese oh yeah just don't buy frozen turkeys they might

[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.960]  say something and vitamin d population agenda i was thinking what what other vitamins are some of the
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:26:00.600]  some of the presidential candidates on because they're on something like what is newt gingrich
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:08.600]  really taking i think he's taking vitamin b tray the bill of rights yeah he's betraying the bill of
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.960]  rights and betraying the american people with his talk that you shouldn't have any rights if there's
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:20.680]  a war what about herman kane vitamin e z to fool people about the federal reserve right so easy to

[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.600]  air in the next segment i don't know how this got started it was it was just completely impromptu
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:37.800]  totally random all right we uh one other quick thing there i did an article last night that i wanted
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:44.840]  to talk about on the air today but we won't have time so uh is this jaren is it up on info wars the
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:52.360]  scientific medical industry cyborg article you know all right uh i think it's up on info wars i put
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.440]  this together specifically for the show in that article which i encourage you to check out on
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.040]  info wars dot com of course you can also find it on natural news i laid out the top 10 things that
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:09.320]  are coming for you in the future under scientific dictatorship these include things like chip implants
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.680]  it's not it's not a conspiracy theory it's real chip implants that can control your emotions and
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:21.720]  control you so that the police can have a pacification switch that turns off entire crowds of protesters
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:28.520]  for example or having biometrics monitoring devices implanted into your bloodstream or implanted into
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:34.440]  your tissues where they can read your bloodstream so that they can report back your biometrics your
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.560]  nutritional status to the government so the government can actually monitor your nutritional
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:45.160]  levels they can monitor if you have quote too much vitamin d yeah you're taking too much vitamin d
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.560]  they're going to make sure you don't take that they will know anyway there are eight other things
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:55.000]  that you need to know about human cyborg super soldiers other technologies that could be in our
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.120]  future they're not necessarily predictions they're just sort of little sketches let's say of what is
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.840]  possible under scientific dictatorship because we've look we've already seen gmo's we've already
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:13.240]  seen vaccines go way off the charts into the world of insanity with with aluminum and with mercury
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:18.600]  and with live viral material going into the vaccines that's crazy that's that's all quote scientific
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.120]  but we don't have time for that whole discussion so i'm going to go on to the next topic and get
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.320]  ready for our guests at the bottom of the hour by talking to you about the poisoning of our world
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:35.320]  now what really got me interested in this as you know i'm a researcher i'm an investigative
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.000]  journalist most of the time when i'm not here putting on firemen's outfits and burning turkeys
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:48.680]  for fun uh it's not not fun that was just alluding to the last segment i'm i read this article
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.400]  from believe it or not scientific american which scientific american is mostly a very
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:59.720]  conventional closed-minded type of magazine in my opinion they they report just the the official
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.280]  scientific truth uh so it was very surprising to me to find scientific american actually covering
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:13.800]  this topic which is the toxic top 10 what are the top 10 most toxic things in our world that are
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.960]  impacting the greatest number of people in our world scientific american believe it or not and
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:26.200]  and they gave us this list of 10 things mercury lead lead chromium lead lead c leds in here multiple
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:33.480]  times this is my point more mercury arsenic pesticides pesticides more lead yeah we're
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.080]  going to come back to that stay with us here on the alice jones show we're going to talk to you
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.800]  about lead mercury poisoning chemical poisoning and some solutions so we're having a great time
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:52.280]  here stay with us on the alice jones show we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:30:04.200]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network when you're out on the road the last place you want
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:12.760]  to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:19.560]  there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:27.960]  they're so proud in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:37.400]  it put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond gussets got it

[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:04.760]  don't this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.880]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:14.760]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:20.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.480]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:30.920]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:35.400]  a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.920]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.000]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.920]  old sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:56.120]  backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:08.120]  i'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings opportunity and recognize risk
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:13.080]  saving means to make money the cow been pure soap company can save you thousands of dollars
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:17.720]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:24.040]  what you're using now soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.880]  perfumes deodorants or antibacterials your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:35.800]  that give you rashes itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint if you want something better
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.880]  if you want something you've never had before you have to do something you've never done before

[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:26.120]  what is that i don't know they're throwing me crazy stuff today is what they're doing
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.960]  they're trying to throw me off see once you get comfortable in this chair they they play games
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:36.120]  with you try to try to catch you off guard not gonna let him do it hear that jaren all right
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:42.040]  we are back we're going to be interviewing dr lonke here in just a minute who is a toxicologist
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.080]  and an expert in so-called invisible killers in fact he has a book called invisible killers
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.520]  which goes into some of the environmental causes that are preventable the things that
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.840]  cause cancer lots of chemicals in the environment lots of heavy metals things that you may not
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.640]  be aware of and in places that you may not have thought about so we're going to be asking
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:06.520]  dr lonke about those kinds of questions but let me continue with the setup on that getting back
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:14.040]  to what i alluded to before the break a scientific american article talked about the toxic top 10
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:19.320]  things in our world that are impacting the most people and let me just read the list very quickly
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:25.240]  because you'll be surprised i was i was shocked they are and i'm not stuttering this is actually
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:33.480]  the list it repeats number one mercury then lead pesticides lead chromium mercury lead lead arsenic
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.280]  and pesticide manufacturing those are the 10 things and you may have noticed lead is in there a whole
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:45.160]  lot they are lead pollution from industrial industrial processes lead pollution from mining
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:51.160]  lead pollution from improper battery recycling and so on we've got arsenic and ground water
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:58.520]  see this reminds me i love it when all the fluoride proponents say oh we're just going to adjust the
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:03.320]  naturally occurring fluoride levels in your water as if to say because it's natural it
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:09.000]  must be good for you well arsenic is natural i don't want arsenic in my water do you should we
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.360]  add arsenic into the water to make it more natural i mean that's the logic of the fluoride pushers
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.000]  so we add lead lead is natural in that sense look just because it comes out of the ground
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.520]  doesn't mean it's good for you uranium comes out of the ground i don't want to be taking uranium pills
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:32.520]  anyway uh people's you got to think about this stuff all right that's that's crucial anyway
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.640]  that's enough that's enough of an intro diabetes is going to hit one in 10 americans by 2030
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:45.960]  according to the least the most recent news one in four u.s women is now on psychiatric drugs
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.520]  25 percent it's incredible let's get some answers from dr steward launkey he's a board-certified
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:58.280]  expert in internal medicine he's in private practice right now he used to be at uc university
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:05.080]  california san diego he is a postdoctoral fellow at the national institutes of health or he was
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.760]  i mean that was his experience and he joins us now by phone from california to help us get some
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:17.240]  answers on these environmental causes of cancer which are preventable as well dr steward launkey
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.320]  are you with us thank you for joining us i am thank you very much for having me yeah i was
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.720]  listening to your reading off of the list and it's it's kind of uh i chuckle a little bit
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:31.960]  because i think that most people are aware of the fact that there are exposures for example
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:38.280]  let's take lead i think everyone says you know there's not lead in paint anymore and uh you
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.560]  know i understand the industrial exposures to lead but i don't think that most people are aware of
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.120]  the fact that you know those people who live for example in inner cities um where the plumbing is
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.200]  still lead line pipes uh there's a fair amount of lead in in the drinking water i don't think most
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.080]  people are aware of the fact that many of the products that come from abroad are you are still
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:07.560]  painted and finished with lead based paints like the halloween face paints from china those
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:14.200]  had lead in them right absolutely and children's toys um i think that they are most people that
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.080]  live in the suburbs say well i've got copper plumbing i'm not worried about that the solder
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:26.440]  that they used the solder those pipes contain lead uh the water that sits in your house overnight
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.080]  has that lead leach out of that solder into the water that you turn on in the morning
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:39.080]  you see so no one is immune from any of this and of course uh the kinds of exposures that we talk
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.400]  about in invisible killers are the kinds of exposures that aren't related to toxic spills
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:52.840]  everyone's not aware of a toxic spill but the fact that um you eat sushi and the fact that you're
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:59.880]  being exposed to mercury um uh from the fish that you're eating or if you don't eat sushi
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:07.240]  the fact that the foods that you're eating uh are from maybe from uh plants or even animals
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:14.840]  uh that drank water or that were fed on feed that came from fish that were laid with mercury
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:22.360]  the fact is is that almost all of us carry with us a toxic burden and what the book really focuses
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:30.200]  on is the fact that that toxic burden starts in utero and that's something that was very
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:36.200]  important for me to come to a conclusion regarding the fact that the average newborn
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:45.800]  from from umbilical cord blood has over 200 toxins already in their body so if one looks at umbilical
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.200]  cord blood you'll find pesticide you'll find mercury you'll find arsenic you'll find lead
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:58.760]  all of these have been lovingly transmitted across the placenta from mom to newborn and
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:06.440]  the fact is is that there are about 80 000 chemicals that are in commercial use today
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.920]  i won't go into the toxic toxic substance act of 1976 and the fact that those chemicals can be out
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:19.320]  there without any previous testing regarding whether they're safe right all grandfather did
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:25.720]  no testing that's required the fda does not regulate this whatsoever however uh of the uh
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:33.720]  80 000 that are in use today some 10 000 of these chemicals weren't even in existence five years ago
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:41.320]  so we continually put new chemicals into our environment from the deodorizers that you plug
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:47.480]  into the wall in your home to dry cleaning fluid that you bring home your clothes and hang in your
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:56.040]  closet from the uh uh the flame retardants that are required to coat mattresses and maybe close
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.760]  this good idea to retard flames but those flame retardants are polybrominated diphenyl esters
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.080]  but here's a here's a thing dr carcinogens dr lunky start starting up but here's the thing
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.400]  most people out there believe that if all these chemicals are being used in these products if
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.040]  california for example requires these flame retardants to be on these infant mattresses then
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.680]  they must be safe because the government would not allow these chemicals and these metals to
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.160]  be used in products if they weren't proven safe but your position and what's available in your
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.040]  book invisible killers and i think the website for that is invisible killers dot com correct yes
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.480]  that's correct okay but your book and in your position is that these are not they've they've
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:42.360]  never been proven safe they are a very provable threat to health and that we need to be looking
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.880]  at preventing cancer as much as we look at treating it after the fact right absolutely and i think
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.600]  that one of the things that we will be coming out with very shortly and i told you before we went
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:59.880]  on the air is our very next project is is going to be called uh uh uh is going to be uh clear
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:06.280]  beginnings because what we really what we're really talking about here is the fact that the FDA has
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:12.920]  no regulatory authority over the chemicals that are used in the marketplace that's a federal trade
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:20.520]  commission uh regulation and the toxic substance act of 1976 says that's quite all right now some
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.320]  of your listeners may be aware of the fact that there's a large group of people in congress right
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:33.720]  now in a bill uh going through congress that uh will modify uh the toxic substance act of 1976
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:40.760]  and it's about time that happens but the politics of poisoning is really something that's very
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:49.080]  special oh yeah let's let's take for example uh uh uh baby bottles and and and and so on and so forth
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:56.600]  and and we know uh that that there are chemicals and plastics and so on and so forth that reach
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:04.280]  into baby bottles uh into the food and that all of our soup cans and baby food cans are are uh
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  yeah 1200 percent higher bpa levels in the blood of people who eat canned soup that's right and we
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:17.320]  know that that that this venal a that bpa is uh has there are hundreds of articles talking about
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:25.880]  the cellular uh effect the hormone uh emulation effect to carcinic potentially carcinogenic
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:32.200]  effects through modulation of the immune system all of these data are such that canada for example
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:38.200]  very quickly outlawed its use in baby bottles however here in the united states the chemical
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:45.640]  industry has an extraordinarily strong lobby and it's been nearly impossible to get anything done
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:51.720]  i think here in california we finally said that that bpa has to be out of baby bottles and out of
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:59.320]  baby food by 2013 but it's it's extraordinary that that there are very few people such as yourself
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:05.880]  and dr samuel epstein who are raising the alarm about these chemicals the cancer industry the
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:12.360]  conventional cancer industry i'm saying they don't say a word about the the toxic chemicals in
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.320]  cosmetics and personal care products and foods and and medicines and fire retarding chemicals
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.760]  so i mean why are they so silent about all of this in your opinion dr lonke well i think a lot
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:29.880]  of it has to do with uh an insistence on scientific proof and scientific methodology as positions we
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:37.320]  are we are kind of brought up on the drug company regiment that is you do a double blind study and
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:45.160]  you prove uh without a shadow of a doubt uh that that a certain chemical causes a certain effect
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.400]  and you do that over and over again well i don't think we're going to get too many volunteers for
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:56.600]  those studies and when we do it in animal models uh some people scoff at that but i think that there's
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:03.720]  there's a great lack of enthusiasm for it because it doesn't fall into the realm of the kind of thing
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:10.040]  that most doctors know what to do about they just feel really comfortable when they know what to do
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.280]  about something yeah that's a good point but look i think you could get a whole bunch of volunteers
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.200]  in america you just give them 10 off their groceries and they'll inject themselves with anything
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.400]  i'm serious you give them a free ipad drawing and then they'll take some lead they'll take some
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.880]  mercury and they because they don't know anything about this and i think that we we talk about
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:34.600]  let's go back to the lead because you mentioned it so many times uh in in your uh discussion there
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:40.680]  are so many wonderful articles now that make us understand for example doctors will treat toxic
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:47.400]  lead levels we get an alarm when 10 micrograms or greater are in the blood and we say that above
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:53.480]  20 micrograms you need to actually be treating somebody with t-lating agents and removing the
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:59.240]  lead uh there was a study that was done in the University of Cincinnati uh published in 2008
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:07.000]  it's a wonderful study they followed 250 women from their pregnancy and they followed their
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.760]  children for 20 years and they all of these were inner city individuals women they all gave birth
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:22.600]  and obviously they tracked the lead levels uh in uh they tracked bone lead levels uh by uh by the
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:28.360]  x-ray diffraction as well as blood lead levels and they uh followed these kids until they were
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:34.600]  five or six years old and then they followed them till they became 20 and they were able to show that
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:41.240]  with lead levels that no one would treat you follow me yeah right some some clinical lead
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:49.400]  levels if you divide them into quartiles 0 to 5 5 to 10 10 to 15 and 15 to 20 you could draw a
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:56.040]  straight line with the incidence of violent crime have they have there been studies done of
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.920]  lead levels of criminals who are currently being incarcerated and there's correlations with lead
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:07.080]  levels because lead concentrate not only in the bone but in the brain see this gets to my and so
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:14.040]  let me make one point and that is all of what we're saying all of this what does it really mean
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:20.840]  and what it really means is this it's unlikely that we're going to legislate away all of these
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:29.000]  80 000 chemicals it's unlikely that we're going to begin to test all of the 80 000 chemicals in
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.680]  current use we just have to accept the fact that if i took a hundred people and i tested them right
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:40.200]  now measuring bone levels and fat levels because all of these organic chemicals are soluble in
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:46.760]  fat and blood levels everyone is carrying a burden of toxins and it's different from one person to
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:55.480]  the next what we do know is that pregnant moms pass these toxins on to the fetus you can bet
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:04.440]  that my mother 50 years ago plus had a much lower concentration of all of these chemicals
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.240]  that are present in women today right it's just getting it's getting worse in society i went to
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:15.320]  medical school the greatest breakthrough was birth control pills today we have fertility clinics
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:23.320]  i've had that one right medical school we never heard of app and adhd the autism rates are higher
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:30.280]  children with leukemia brain cancer all of these things happening what can we do about it what we
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:36.280]  can do is make an understanding it a complete understanding that we have to give kids a clear
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:43.240]  beginning that is the population that we have to get the message to and we have to bring products
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:51.800]  to to help them detoxify is that group of people who are going to give birth to the next generation
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:58.200]  childbearing age women yeah college kids young adults yeah it's important to take care of people
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.880]  who are older and middle age as well well but that's the that's the thing you you've raised some
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.120]  fantastic points and i want to just remind the listeners that you're listening to an interview
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.920]  with dr steward longi the author of invisible killers his website is invisible killers dot
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.080]  com we're going to continue this interview here on the alex jones show and in fact if you're
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.640]  interested if you'd like to call in and maybe ask a question of dr longi we're going to open up
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:29.480]  the phones at 800 259 9231 so you can call in after this upcoming break but you mentioned dr
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:36.840]  longi the correlation between lead presence in bone and tissues and violent crime or at least
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:43.000]  incarceration for crimes this brings me to the psychological and behavioral component of these
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.080]  of exposure to these heavy metals this is what interests me in particular well it's a very it's
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.560]  a big factor lead and mercury are the two you know the the hatters you ever hear of the mad
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:57.720]  hatter you know i'm sure your listeners are aware of the fact that's because they lined up felt
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:03.800]  hats with mercury in the old days and the hatters used to lick their brushes yeah man is a hatter
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.560]  yeah yeah it'll drive you insane but this is my question do you think that at least some portion
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:16.680]  of the insanity that we see across modern culture today is caused by this exposure to to heavy metals
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:23.240]  undoubtedly i i there is what there is not one ounce of scientific doubt in my mind i think that
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.920]  it is one of the factors what i want the listeners to understand is it's not the only fact sure there
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:35.400]  are many factors that go into it but if you can remove just think about this if we can remove
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:43.320]  this this veil take this veil away from all of what's going on in society today behavioral
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:51.560]  abnormalities medical abnormalities the obesity epidemic obesity in kids now maybe your listeners
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.680]  will understand if you're born with all of these chemicals that are hormone emulators
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:04.120]  and stack the deck against you metabolizing glucose normally but why wouldn't these kids
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:09.480]  get diabetes earlier why wouldn't they have a higher incidence well and why wouldn't our prisons
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.520]  be filled with with criminals and doesn't this call into question the entire so-called criminal
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.560]  justice system if punishing people for their quote behavior by throwing them in prison
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:25.240]  without treating their some of what might might be the causes chemicals or metals poisoning isn't
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:30.600]  that a completely incomplete and in fact an injustice system of justice yes but i think that
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:38.200]  the legal system like the political system are very very difficult places to crack i think we
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:44.280]  have to do this as a grassroots movement of education of young people their parents and
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:48.440]  grandkids we got it we got to go to break i'm sorry to cut you off please stay with us though

[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:33.240]  tripping up my words just a little bit but i hope you're enjoying the show we are interviewing
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:39.240]  dr steward lonkey who is an expert in internal medicine and toxicology and he was mentioning
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:43.640]  some of the food sources uh he mentioned a lot of people eating sushi now i don't know about you
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:49.000]  dr lonkey i don't eat sushi i i only eat fire bombed turkeys air dropped into vats of boiling
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:57.160]  oil that that is my diet uh dhs compliant see i what i think and i think i'm making i should make
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:04.840]  people uh uh be aware of the fact that it you can't get away from this you talked about arsenic
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:09.480]  you talked about arsenic and water but how many people out there listening to your show have wood
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:16.040]  decks have wood swing sets and pressure treated wood yeah all that treated wood is treated with
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:22.280]  an arsenic containing compound now kids will crawl on it and you will handle the wood and then
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:27.880]  you'll make yourself a sandwich won't you yeah but most of these toxins i want the listeners to know
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:37.080]  yes so the women cosmetics is a major source but by and large by far and away the largest source
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:44.920]  mode of exposure to all of these toxins is you eat them yeah they're in the food they're on your
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:50.520]  hands and they some of them you inhale there's no questions some of them get through your skin
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:56.360]  but ingestion the gi tract is the major introduction of most of these talks well let's
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.640]  talk about that when when you ingest these toxins i want to get to what in your research
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.800]  and your experience what kinds of effects do you see are people hallucinating do they hear
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:11.080]  sounds of chirping birds do they think do they make bad decisions about elections i mean what
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:17.640]  what is really the impact well i won't touch that one but i think that you know i think they're so
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:23.960]  subtle like that's the thing that's important for people to understand people get stomach aches
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:32.280]  more frequently they tend to have more constipation and then some diarrhea and they they tend to have
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:40.280]  nausea episodes they tend to get muscle aches and pains they are so nondescript they are so
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:48.200]  nonspecific to a specific to a specific exposure you would think oh arsenic exposure we're talking
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:55.640]  about arsenic toxicity that's easy we're talking about lead toxicity that's easier those people
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:02.280]  become psychotic they you know they become they become problematic but irrational behavior
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:09.640]  unusual behavior increased lethargy all of these people say well he's just run down well
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:15.160]  he's under a lot of stress well he's ingesting arsenic they don't say that what what percentage
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.280]  of the u.s congress do you think is suffering from heavy metals toxicity i gotta ask
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:28.280]  suffering from a significant amount of toxicity but we all are and and the fact is it's happening
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:36.200]  imperceptibly to us it happens generationally it's easy hindsight is really 2020 and that's
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:42.920]  why when we look at the data we look at epidemiologic data and we say it's unreasonable
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:51.880]  that the incidence of autism and behavioral deficit or attention deficit and i call it
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:57.960]  behavioral deficit because it's more than just attention yeah the whole behavior you see these
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:04.120]  hyperactive kids and i watch it all the time it's very interesting my daughter my younger daughter
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:10.520]  detoxed for a year before she even got pregnant all through her pregnancy and i watch my grandson
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.640]  who's three and his behavior contrasted with other three quick quick question because we're
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:20.520]  almost out of time does your book offer people some solutions for detox it does it does and there
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:27.000]  are a handful and a growing number and there are some extraordinarily effective ways that we can
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  begin to detox we need to figure out ways to bring that to right all right we've got to go to break
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.920]  dr lanky thank you thank you so much we'll be right back in one minute i'll give you some more
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:45.080]  solutions on the other side of this break thank you stay with us you are listening to gcn visit
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:55.960]  gcnlive.com today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:01.800]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:06.360]  pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:12.360]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:18.840]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:24.840]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:29.800]  world government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:34.520]  congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:41.480]  now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:32.280]  airport not because there's anything dangerous in there just because they're curious they just want
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:37.560]  to unwrap stuff they just want to destroy stuff they want to get the christmas tree out of your
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:42.680]  house get the turkey out of your kitchen just make you have a really rough and tough holiday
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:47.960]  so you remember who's in charge right that's what they're after anyway we just finished a segment
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:52.920]  with dr stewart lonke the author of invisible killers and that was my first time interviewing
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:58.920]  dr lonke i don't i don't know him personally but he came up as the guy to talk to about that topic
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.120]  and i know we did not get the solutions yet so i want to share some of those with you
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:08.200]  also we did not get to your calls and i apologize the call screen system is not up here right now
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.880]  we're working on that i do intend to take some of your calls in this hour so feel free to call in
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.640]  with with some comments hopefully we get that work and i'm not ignoring your calls that's that's my
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.440]  message to you trying to get that up and running but in the last segment we talked to dr lonke
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:29.160]  who who you know i i think we could talk to him for hours about the real hardcore information
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.160]  about heavy metals poisoning and the toxicity that is infecting the minds of the american people
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:42.120]  and i've got a working theory on this that part of the insanity that has infected america today
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:50.840]  the reason why you have presidential debates where people make no sense why you have leadership
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:56.120]  at the executive level that is saying we need to spend a few trillion more dollars to get us
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:02.200]  out of the trillions in debt we're already in yeah that's that's kind of insane that's pure clinical
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.720]  insanity if you think about it and as jerald salentia i'm sure would have a few comments
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:14.520]  about the insanity going on at mf global today these days it it's pretty much insane but why is
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:19.720]  it so insane so i asked dr lonke do you think members of congress are suffering from heavy
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:25.720]  metals toxicity and he said yes and he thinks everybody is but i bet you if you were to go
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:31.320]  into congress and have them subject themselves to blood tests wouldn't that be interesting
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:37.880]  you might find some non-human dna in the mix there according to david icke right but you would
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:43.800]  definitely find some heavy metals in that mix probably a lot of lead a lot of arsenic a lot
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:48.760]  of mercury everybody who voted for the patriot act is probably suffering from lead poisoning
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.040]  no i don't mean from bullets i know what you're thinking no i mean from their food from the lead
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:59.720]  and their pipes from from that thing other sources of lead or murky mercury poisoning
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.720]  because their moms let's say that yes they do have mothers their moms were eating tuna fish
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:11.560]  when they were pregnant and the mercury went through the blood and got into the developing
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.360]  minds of the little infant fetuses that were going to be born and someday become senators
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:22.920]  so now they're insane but they're in charge that's scary that's kind of disturbing actually
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:27.640]  let's not let's not let that happen let's get healthy let's detox and along those lines
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:33.960]  just from my own experience i'm not i'm oh man i got a break coming up very quickly
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:40.360]  avoid exposure to heavy metals eat lots of fibrous foods apples contain pectin juice a lot of
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:46.040]  vegetables chlorella and cilantro bind to heavy metals and help carry them out of your body
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:53.240]  so does grapefruit pectin and other natural fibers detox yourself get those heavy metals out of your
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:56.280]  body and out of your brain and you will make better decisions as a result we'll talk more
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:01.400]  about that on the other side of this break as we are joined by robert scott bell hey folks this is

[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:33.240]  host here and we've been having a great time with you today talking about all kinds of heavy
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:38.280]  metals poisoning and ways you can avoid that and get that out of your body because it affects
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.960]  the minds of men and women and shortly we're going to be joined by robert scott bell and we're
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:49.160]  going to talk about our list of things that you can be thankful for the things that we're thankful
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:55.800]  for this thanksgiving it is actually a holiday of giving thanks so let's do that let's give
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.840]  some gratitude out there where it is due and we'd like to take your calls during this hour so
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:10.120]  please call us at 800 what is that 259-9231 1-800-259-9231 we'll get you on the board and we'll get
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:15.080]  your calls in and just before we get to robert scott bell here finishing up that last segment i do
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:21.160]  believe i do believe that the insanity that we are witnessing today with the federal reserve with
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.120]  the presidential debates remember when rick perry couldn't remember the third thing the third department
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:30.600]  of government that he was going to cut i think that could be a mercury side effect i mean he was
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:35.880]  the one pushing the vaccines garter seal did he take some garter seal himself i don't know but i
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.000]  bet he took some other vaccines and might be suffering from some metals point it's it's
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.240]  metals poisoning himself it's just uh you know look i don't have his medical records so i don't
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:51.640]  know for sure but it is a possibility that these people who can't think rationally and can't speak
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:56.440]  without a teleprompter that they may be suffering from heavy metals poisoning i can only imagine
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:02.520]  a u.s senator suffering from high levels of lead and cadmium and arsenic and mercury thinking to
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:11.400]  to himself uh let's pass a patriot act version two and let's catch criminals by reaching down
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:17.160]  their pants and then we'll take some time off from the senate uh pickler's fortnight and i'll go take a
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:22.520]  long walk off a short pier and at my feet i will discover patriot act version three will enact that
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:29.880]  that's the level of insanity that i'm talking about just complete cats and dogs living together
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:36.920]  quote bill murray total insanity out there but let's move on to something a little more sane and
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:43.960]  a little more let's say humbling this holiday season things to be thankful for and for that
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:49.640]  segment we are joined by none other than robert scott bell who also is a radio host on the genesis
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:55.000]  communications network and he just did a fantastic interview with governor jesse ventura that aired a
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  couple of days ago robert is joining us by skype robert are you with us are you there hello
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:11.160]  are you on okay robert can you hear me mic you there yes i can hear you good good to hear your
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:17.880]  voicemail how you doing i apologize i'm not hearing any audio okay we'll get that hooked up here i
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.040]  got you mic now i can hear you all right great i i thought maybe i had a little bit of mercury
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.240]  was affecting me there for a moment but now i realize i'm totally sane so go ahead you're
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:30.760]  you're good i'm definitely not bringing any mercury today if anything i'd be bringing some
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.720]  mercury detox with me yeah what do you think by the way on that before we get into the thanksgiving
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.640]  list what you have you have actually studied a lot of detox what are the top detoxification
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:47.160]  techniques in your experience for getting rid of heavy metals well yeah it's a great topic
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:51.240]  uh yeah we covered a lot on the show there's always more questions 10 more every time you
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:56.200]  bring up one of the solutions or 10 of them and of course my background in energetic homeopathic
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.760]  medicine after being raised allopathically or pharmaceutical having to undo so much of the
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.720]  damage of modern medicine i think one of the most important things to understand is that
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:10.440]  there's an energy to every metal and we've we've covered this you and i too and of course the
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.160]  metabolism of the body deals we're dealing with energy and of course identifying these toxic
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.080]  metals is one thing and for many of us who've been exposed for instance to mercury through
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:24.280]  dental fillings or through vaccination or other environmental exposures there's been so much
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.800]  over time albeit a small amount over time that is constantly leaching into the tissue etc that the
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:35.480]  body seems to kind of i would say neutralize it but it can't react vigorously against it anymore
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.280]  because it's it's always present and it would exhaust us to death yeah it's like being slowly
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:46.040]  poisoned by a virus or let's say a bacteria living in your gut that's been genetically modified and
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:52.600]  it's churning out bt toxin in your own digestive tract i mean it's that bad right it yeah it really
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.320]  is like a think of you know walking through life with a big heavy lead mercury anchor you know you
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.120]  wouldn't be moving anywhere very quickly and and pretty soon you're you know you it'd wear you down
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.640]  basically and that's what we're talking about with these heavy metals among many things that
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:11.880]  happened uh so i i obviously go to the ultimate and unconventionality which would be energy medicine
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:17.240]  course homeopathy and a lot of people that are materialists and reductionists are not in favor
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.160]  of it although it's completely harmless somebody would say well there's nothing there we can get
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:26.200]  into discussion of that but i found it to be most profound in terms of assisting all of the other
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:32.200]  botanical and chelating agents from nature so you know the the synthetic nutrients that are used
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:38.280]  in aggressive urgent care in medicine when they do intravenous chelation but right element typically
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.160]  is the homeopathic signatures whether it be homeopathic mercurious which is mercury uh we
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:48.040]  can do it with lead which is plumbum metallica we can do it with arsenic with arsenic amalgam and
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:54.600]  we can literally pick any metal that is toxic and shouldn't be in the body and address it homeopathically
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:59.400]  in conjunction with support for the excretory pathways of the body all right so you're not
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:05.480]  saying if you're suffering a highly toxic level of of acute lead poisoning you're not saying just
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.800]  treat it with homeopathy you're saying do you know in the emergency room they'll do the IV chelation
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:16.520]  they will do maybe some other medicines but then in addition to that you can do some botanical
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.680]  approaches and you can do homeopathic approaches with which have zero negative side effects anyway
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.640]  to to assist in that yeah absolutely i think you only have a plus factor i mean if you if you
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:30.040]  realize the energy it takes to address and mobilize the defenses to bind and get this stuff out of
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.000]  your system you'll want every advantage you have so at the very least homeopathic adjuncts
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.560]  and that would also go with remedies that specifically support liver kidney pathways
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:43.080]  you may have already discussed this but i think one of the other things to reduce the burden on
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:48.120]  the liver and kidneys with these metals is foreign for red healing like type technologies
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:53.400]  oh yeah that's great it helps you sweat out toxins it's really yeah except if you over do the
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:58.680]  sweat lodge situation in which case you pass out and die as happened who is that who is the guru
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:03.720]  guy that had the sweat lodge i remember his name but he just got sentenced to a number of years so
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:09.960]  man and and that's why we have to be diligent and vigilant if you will about even the natural realm
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.520]  that there are people that don't understand you know necessarily how to do these things safely
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:19.080]  i mean obviously you go into far infrared heat you go to excess literally a body temperature
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.240]  issue could put you in a bad way just like in a sweat lodge scenario yeah if you feel yourself
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:30.440]  passing out people you know don't continue i get out of the infrared little closet there and drink
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:36.680]  some water yeah well it's kind of like the the brilliant people that put frozen turkeys in
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:42.520]  in peanut fry hey what'd you think about that did you like the little firebombing demo that we've
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.560]  been warned about well you know it's sort of it's sort of cheating ahead because that was one of
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:52.760]  the things i was going to tell you i was grateful for that the tst the turkey security administration
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:16:00.520]  and uh the dhs department of homeland security turkeys basically uh have warned us and and saved
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.840]  us i mean how many millions of americans are now safe because of their warning i think it's the
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:10.040]  department of home cooking security now exactly uh you know we're talking about taliban turkey
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:16.200]  terrorism now what do you think about vitamin c's see something say something that's that's our favorite
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:22.120]  nutrient now here at the info wars team if you happen to see any vitamin c anywhere you must
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:27.400]  say something you must earn that in a controlled substance more dangerous than anything well actually
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:32.360]  no big farm is the real danger and by the way uh you know covered on the on the show just prior
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:38.600]  to coming on board here today of course you did as well i'm sure the ron paul uh debate and so to
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:42.440]  speak i mean it was him and everybody else and sensational things when he acknowledged the failure
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:47.640]  of the war on drugs and he acknowledged the loan among that crew as the doctor as well the danger
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.320]  of the fda prescription drugs being did yeah yeah he said more people are being killed by
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:58.040]  prescription drugs than in the in was it was it comparing it to the drug war deaths or terrorism
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:03.480]  deaths i don't recall but to the drug war to the illicit drugs as such and you know we we're not
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.240]  endorsing the use of synthetic uh street drugs either uh but the point is the you know the the
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:13.720]  botanicals of creation are certainly not what we need to be concerned with we need to be concerned
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:17.960]  about the growth of government which is you know an artificial creation and our founding fathers
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.440]  certainly warned us against what what we're living through right now well if you think about the big
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.480]  threats that they're trying to scare us about they're all imaginary the the whole war on terror
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:33.720]  completely imaginary where where are the terrorists where walk around where i haven't seen any terrorists
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:39.240]  your your odds of being killed by a terrorist even if you buy the 9 11 story your odds of
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:44.680]  being killed by terrorists are are far lower literally tens of thousands of times lower
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:50.040]  than being killed by an fda approved pharmaceutical so where's the war on pharmaceuticals yeah where
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.680]  is that war on that drugs well you know which we might say it would be a legitimate one to declare
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.560]  and we could actually win and get it done with i would say if we occupy the fda my good friend
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:03.640]  john rappaport had indicated that that might be the next step here because they're looking at pulling
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:09.000]  two-thirds or more of the dietary supplements off the market with these new guidelines i think it'd
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.760]  be great if the people baking the laws in washington would simply occupy their own minds because they're
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:20.200]  they're they're way off world occupying something way out there and robert we are we're going to
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.880]  take calls by the way we've got a couple people on not in this segment but in in the following
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:28.040]  segment but let's get to our list we've got some things to be thankful for this Thanksgiving i
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:32.280]  know you brought five things i brought five things and then maybe the callers have some things what
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:37.000]  what do you want to start off with well yeah some are serious some are funny obviously uh as i mentioned
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.600]  the tsa's announcement about the turkey fryers which i'm so grateful for that but it is an absurdist
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.400]  notion when they do that it wakes more people up so i am genuinely grateful for their absurdity and
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:52.280]  stupidity but you know i think one of the things we have to and we'll probably both agree on this
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:57.320]  that we're very grateful for and haven't been for a long time is is congressman and dr ron paul as
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:02.360]  as a human just as much less as a congressman and all the things that he's doing to wake up the
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.600]  sleeping population here in america and perhaps around the world because of the growth of the of the
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.640]  message by the internet and through info wars alex jones and the great work he's doing as well
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:16.840]  and i'm truly grateful because he's been a catalyst to to bring awareness in ways very few have been
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:22.120]  able to get this kind of information out and although it's taken many decades the fact is it's
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:27.960]  having a major impact now we're seeing him climb to the top of the charts in iowa and his tenacity
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:33.000]  his continued steadfastness and and you know unwillingness to give up or change the message
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.800]  well robert you are pirating my list he was number one on my list of things to be thankful for too
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:43.560]  so i guess i got to come up with more and your calls are coming up richard frank janice judy and

[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:38.360]  on to a list of the top things that we are thankful for on this thanksgiving your calls
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:42.840]  are coming up and we've got robert scott bell joining us by skype and i am powered by chocolate
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:49.480]  superfood smoothie here it is in a canning jar that's what i bring here every time
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:54.920]  i know this is not a substance enhanced performance unless you consider cacao that's
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:25:00.280]  cocoa for those of you uh it's cacao from south america that is the only substance
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:05.960]  that i take before i do my shows here just good nutrition good alkaloids in there helps
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:11.080]  protect brain function and neurological function and just makes you feel good about
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.720]  being alive what do you say robert you happy to be alive today oh yeah i'm grateful absolutely
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.720]  i was buzzing on cacao the other day when i was interviewing uh the old governor jesse
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:26.600]  ventura on the air that was a great interview he really unloaded and and just did not censor
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:31.640]  himself at all he had a story about fox news and all kinds of stuff yeah he had a blast he really
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:35.560]  enjoyed it i think you know that leads me to my second level of gratitude and not that we're
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.120]  going to say one's more than another but the second one here for me is the new media and that
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:45.160]  it includes you mike it includes alex jones natural news etc and all of the people out there
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.240]  that have become the media through social networks through blog sites through everything
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:53.480]  because it is really a part of the next revolution the awakening if you will and and you know the
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:59.400]  things that jesse ventura is doing and he was so giddy because you know we actually get to discuss
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:04.920]  things and not do sound bites talk go in depth on issues that you know i think there's a hunger
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:08.600]  for that that's why the new media is growing that's why alex is growing so much that you know
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:13.560]  despite a bad economy out there the thing is the hunger for this information and you know there
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  are a few people out there like yourself and alex that are providing it and we're doing our level
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.440]  best to get this information out there so i'm very grateful that we're all doing this and that
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:25.880]  includes all the people that think they're just listeners they're more than that they're taking
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:30.840]  this information they're doing things with it that are extraordinary they are absolutely the new
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:36.200]  media is going to be the future media because the old media is the dead media they're irrelevant
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:42.120]  when people wake up as they are doing now they realize that the old medias is lying to them or
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.920]  distracting them or refusing to report the stories that they should be hearing about like
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.960]  all the heavy metals in your copper pipes and your lead pipes in your food in your children's
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:56.680]  toys for example where's the reporting on that story you won't see that in the mainstream media
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:01.640]  typically you'll only get it in places like this yeah and much less the the willingness to discuss
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:06.600]  natural options that are not approved of by the government you know that that we would ever think
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:10.360]  that the government would have it you know the ability to arbitrate make a decision about what
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.320]  we put into our bodies or how we take things out of our bodies i mean it's a it's a sorry state that
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:20.040]  we are in i mean these are the things i'm not really grateful for but i acknowledge in my own
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.360]  life mike and you know my story having suffered through 24 years of chronic illness brought about
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.720]  by government medicine monopoly medicine if i had not suffered the way i did i would not know a
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:35.000]  fraction of the things i know today to be able to communicate regularly through and being a part of
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.200]  the new media so suffering is not all bad i don't wish it upon anybody but at the same time i learned
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:45.480]  a great deal because of the suffering i went through yeah me too i i used to be borderline
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:53.160]  obese diabetic chronic pain extremely difficult mental state i went through a lot and yeah i
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:57.160]  got healed just like you got healed and i'm thankful for that as well let me get to the
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:02.680]  second one on my list sure this is an unusual choice perhaps and people might not be expecting this
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:08.520]  and i do want to take your calls later on here shortly but i want to thank my wife i want to
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:14.360]  thank my wife and all the wives out there who your wife robert and alex's wife and jesse
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.640]  ventura's wife and all the wives out there who understand the the importance of what we do and
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:25.880]  support us in our efforts to be on the front lines and to to tell the truth sometimes even at risk
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:32.680]  to our own safety yeah uh because it we cannot do what we do without the support of the women in
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:37.880]  our households and the women in our communities and i want to give a big shout out to all the all
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:43.800]  the women out there who are also patriots who also support freedom who who who support your
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:50.600]  husband's fights for freedom and and for the future generations of america yeah i will obviously
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:56.520]  second that are also being big trouble i set you up for that robert oh but she you know
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.320]  honestly it is that they they realize what we're doing and they stand behind us and give us a
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:06.200]  strength and sustenance in so many ways and and i'll bless and love them dearly and and even you
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:12.040]  know carol paul who i've met ron paul's wife of what 50 years or so now uh amazing woman standing
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:15.800]  about you know beside her husband and you know literally he's putting his life at risk by doing
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:22.200]  what he is doing the more he gains traction uh so uh yes uh uh a debt of gratitude that we owe to
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:27.240]  those women and you know if i add something along that vein i i think one of the the things more
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:32.120]  recently that i'm very grateful for the the raw milk freedom riders these are also in the mom

[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.000]  how about we take a call right now sure yeah absolutely do we love love it all right let's
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.960]  go to richard in washington richard you're on the air with mike adams and robert scott bell how you
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:43.960]  doing real good great show uh you guys kind of touched on the thing i find it highly ironic that
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:50.360]  an md an allopathic practitioner who uh both doctors and dentists plug the body full of toxicity
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:56.600]  uh is worried about the the environmental sources of this this toxicity uh you know i i find that
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:02.920]  really uh totally ironic but the point i majorly wanted to make was and robert can touch on this
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:08.760]  also the energetic aspect is uh if you study our anthropology when we were hunter-gatherers
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:14.120]  we didn't cook our proteins and fats above uh body temperature you know we may have put them
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:18.280]  over an open fire or whatever but essentially our our proteins and fats were in a raw form
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:25.400]  and putting each of us has a choice putting cooked proteins and fats into our system
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:31.720]  is what causes our our health situation you can study the Kellogg report or the works of price
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:37.800]  or pottinger but you're not saying to eat raw meat though are you or yes i am you are wow no no
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:43.320]  organism on in the world cooks their food other than the humans and which is the sickest uh species
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.400]  on the world yeah i've heard i've heard talk you know a lot of a lot of people talking about that
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:51.640]  and i appreciate your comments and it is first about you mentioned about the doctor we had on
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:57.800]  earlier yeah it's interesting but we got to give credit to those mds who do veer off the the path
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:02.920]  of just poisoning people and who start to look at the causes of disease and work on preventing it
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:07.400]  and and you know that doctor dr lanky is willing to put his book out there invisible killers a
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.120]  book that is not going to be well liked by the cancer industry uh but you know a good point on
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:17.640]  that now tell us more about the the the raw meat thing so you don't think we should cook our turkeys
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:23.640]  like firebombs and vats of oil is that what you're saying no no what everybody's worried about is
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:29.160]  bacteria moles and funguses but if you actually are in the parasympathetic state and you
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:33.960]  secrete hydrochloric acid that's nothing more than food it's only because we eat so many
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.240]  carbohydrates and have destroyed the parasympathetic state and our our secretion of hydrochloric
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:44.840]  acid that we are no longer able to digest the raw proteins and fats and utilize those for foods
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:50.920]  there's a whole modern perspective that is that is challenging our system and instead of addressing
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.760]  what we should be doing naturally in our eating habits we essentially deal with the unnatural
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:02.360]  situation we've developed and and claim that's the problem uh all you have to do is look at the
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.480]  those are really good out that we're being miseducated very good points richard robert
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.280]  what's what's your take on that i mean personally i'm not going to eat raw meat but i do eat mostly
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:17.640]  really i don't know 50 raw diet let's say but as plants not not meat what's your take on a robert
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:22.120]  it is fascinating the caller does bring up a good point and that is that we have such uh
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:29.640]  gastrointestinal uh insufficiencies inflammation dysfunction enzymatics of insufficiencies that
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:34.280]  you know if a person were to go on a raw diet as he describes they would end up very ill because
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:39.160]  they have no way to interact with the microbial world appropriately and we have become over the
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:45.320]  last few centuries a species afraid of the germ so to speak the microbe louis pastore
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.960]  pasteurization you know we cover and talk about that extensively and we've got a ways to go back
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:54.200]  to where we have the strength or what i call the scent the scenic condition you know as we talk
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:58.760]  as a homeopath here uh to be able to withstand interact with the microbial world without you
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.080]  know it's like the the superman concept of being able to walk through walls of microbes
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:08.120]  and basically be untouched by it because we are so strong and healthy very few people now in the
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:13.240]  west have that level of strength you know funny as mentioned the raw milk freedom ride i was there
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:17.560]  max kane who you know we talked about is a big proponent they're wanting to do another one from
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:23.640]  wisconsin to chicago and he he literally had uh you know basically a bunch of ground i don't know
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:27.800]  if it was beef buffalo or sheep and he was eating it raw i watched i witnessed this
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:34.440]  had no problem uh he was not contaminated he didn't fall dead of an infection a sepsis or
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:39.240]  whatever but he had worked his way back into that level of strength and vitality to be able to eat
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:45.000]  raw as we did once in the wild uh but to do so as a typical american now could be very dangerous
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.520]  and deadly all right work our way back into that yeah i'm i am not doing the raw meat thing folks
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:56.440]  i'm going to cook it even if i have to set the turkey on fire but i'm going to have a free range
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.160]  turkey some free range turkey meat this this holiday season but good points on both sides
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.360]  thanks for your call richard much appreciated let's go to ralph in texas ralph you're on the air
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:11.960]  with mike adams and robert scott bell how you doing i'm doing great yeah how can we help you
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:19.240]  what's on your mind hi uh i just read a report um with some statistics saying that one in five
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:25.080]  americans are on anti-psychotic drugs yeah one in four women and one in five overall
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:33.320]  uh and i find it's concerning uh but i wanted to get your take on the role uh the pharmaceutical
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:41.720]  industry is playing in this new world order plan and uh yeah well i think if you suffer
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:47.000]  from concern that is a psychiatric condition requiring pharmaceutical treatment isn't that
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  right robert this caller needs some treatment we should send him to a pharmacy put some through
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.960]  the phone lines for him immediately because we can't have him raising such questions i mean
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.440]  in fact the answer to question is it's essential without the pharmaceutical industrial complex the
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:05.880]  new world order is not possible because their ability to dampen the consciousness weaken the will
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:11.000]  is is essential for the takeover for the people to be sheeple as many of the americans have become
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.880]  an old people around the world in europe and we've seen it recently as well uh with the attack on
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:22.920]  supplements and other things now that water can't hydrate you in europe as a species if this is the
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:27.000]  case oh yeah for out to even cover the water story what about the woman who had her buttocks
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.440]  injected with fix a flat tire inflator that's a good one too but more to your your point caller
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:39.080]  look don't forget that the psychiatric industry has defined another disease as oppositional defiance
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:44.440]  disorder odd so if you disagree with the globalist agenda you now have a disease what do you think
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:50.680]  about that i think you might be diagnosed with that what's your take ralph well i think there's
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:58.360]  a concerted effort to really ruin the psyche of all americans um and to whose benefit you know
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:04.600]  i think there's a lack of uh awareness but you guys are doing a great job maybe you guys could
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:15.000]  recommend some books uh on holistic uh health um sure yeah well um i like elson haas as an author
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:21.640]  he's got some great books out there haas you could also study the dsm for the psychiatric
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:25.880]  bible that would give you more i i i say that ingest robert what do you recommend as a good
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.280]  overall book that's a horrific read i i think from a wake-up call perspective i always come
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:35.320]  back to our good friend dr caroline dean in her books particularly the one death by modern medicine
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:40.040]  because when you realize the holocaust that is in place due to fda sanctioned government
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:45.080]  sanctioned licensed and monopolized drugs uh that's a you know a big step to say all right
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.640]  instead of reaching for the medicine cabinet instead of going to the doctor uh including
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.280]  the pediatricians the children's doctors uh you know it's a horrific thing uh you know if you
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:59.800]  think about it these doctors all they do are drug and and and and inject children i mean it should
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:03.640]  i'm not into banning professions but the way they behave i i would almost say we could get rid of
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.880]  pediatricians and we'd have much healthier children at this point oh yeah it's totally true
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.320]  yeah the last thing you want to do is take your child to a conventional pediatrician
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:16.120]  because if they diagnose your child with cancer which a lot of times is a false positive and if
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:21.000]  you don't subject your child to that chemotherapy they will have you arrested and your child taken
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.240]  away by cps i we've we've reported on it multiple times that's right okay uh thank you caller for
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.480]  your call very very good points robert let's let's get the third item on your list otherwise we're
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.800]  never going to finish our list here today what do you got number three well i mean i mentioned
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:39.400]  that the raw milk freedom riders i i just want to say you know that the farmers and the fellow
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.920]  healers out there that are standing uh basically up for their right to bring the healing that's
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:49.960]  necessary even if even though it's not approved by government uh those that are you know basically
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:54.760]  saying here i am come and get me i'm not uh you know encouraging people to go get arrested but
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:59.480]  at the same point in time they can't arrest everybody so i'm i'm still waiting to where i
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:03.880]  could say i'm grateful for the dietary supplement industry because until they stand up all of them
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.800]  in mass together and say here we are we're doing what is right we are not harming anybody
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.560]  you have no authority to come and make us do the things you're trying to make us do to destroy
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:18.120]  our industry and the and the good products that we're providing uh so but you know having said
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:22.520]  that it's the you know the farmers out there that are going to be teaching all of us that have not
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:27.880]  been in that farm community to grow our own food again i mean that's the gratitude coming out that's
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:32.840]  the thanksgiving i have and i have the message for them to please be vocal outspoken stand up
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:37.640]  and begin to offer your you know your your skills to others because we desperately need that out
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.680]  there well said robert you must be reading my mind yet again i have a related item the third
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:49.960]  item on my list to be thankful for this Thanksgiving day is none other than dirt yes dirt and soil
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:55.880]  without which we would have no civilization on our planet soils are eroding and disappearing
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:44:01.000]  at a record pace the food supply is going to be threatened and i am currently on a ranch
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:06.200]  near austin that has dirt in fact before coming on the show today i was on a john deere tractor
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:11.080]  and sometimes after the show people say hey mike how do you make your skin look so good on camera
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:17.160]  you have a makeup artist no it's a thin layer of grime and clay from the dirt on the ranch
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:22.520]  makeup by john deere that's what i got going on here but truly without dirt we wouldn't have
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:27.640]  anything in our and where does dirt come from where does dirt come from we you know ultimately
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:31.560]  we got to thank the creator we got to thank mother nature we got to thank god we got to
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.040]  thank the higher powers as well but i know our list is is focused on more of the mundane things
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:40.200]  robert you okay let's if we take another call absolutely having a good time with you as always
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:44.520]  all right janice from texas thank you for holding and you are on the air go ahead please
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:52.120]  hi mike hi robert um things to be thankful for i'm thankful for guys like you who teach
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:59.720]  self-empowerment and not dependence a big pharma i mean because they that's all they do is teach
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:04.280]  dependence but i'm calling about another issue and i wanted i tried to call you another time
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:13.400]  about it it ties into the farm tractor regulations yeah um i just wanted to concur with alex and
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:19.240]  jessie ventura when they keep saying this is like the east german stausing model and i will say
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:25.960]  i have seen that up close and personal and i'll make this quick in 1982 i took a 21 years old by
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:31.160]  myself took a night train from one end of berlin to west berlin to do a show i had missed the flight
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:38.520]  whatever so i had to go by train and as soon as we crossed over into east berlin to get to west
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:46.120]  berlin i was not else in the carriage by myself and two armed stausi officers come in and demand my
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:51.320]  ticket and i said who are you where's the train conductor and they got mad and started yelling
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:54.520]  and i handed in my ticket and they wanted my passport and i said i've already been cleared
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:58.920]  the german customs or whatever they grabbed my passport they saw it was an american passport
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:05.000]  and went crazy just crazy yelling at me and they went got uh four other guards so i was surrounded
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.520]  by six guards at that time who questioned me where are you going what are you doing bowl i said i'm
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:15.320]  in a band all i do is play music i'm not you know i'm really nobody don't even you know whatever
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:23.080]  maybe you have illegal wood in your guitar even this is pre-1982 yeah right when i ever thought
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:28.760]  things that i would see that my country know but anyway i said look i'm just you know the beetles
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:33.560]  play hamburg that's you know the germans love them rock and roll whatever yeah well that was
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:39.960]  the wrong thing to say because the one who spoke english drew on me and said stand up i could feel
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:45.880]  the gunmetal drew you drew drew his firearm on you yeah wow and my head point blank range i mean i
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:53.000]  could feel the barrel of the rifle and he marched me down to the livestock carriage which also had
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.720]  people let me ask you janice though i mean a very frightening story but has anything like this
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:04.360]  happened to you in the united states it recently then well my point about that is that i would like
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:11.640]  to just shout out to all the oh i want to see arm guards on all public transport to keep us safe
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:17.320]  well when they've got a rifle at their head how safe are they going to feel you know does it have
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:22.120]  to get to that level that you know when they see the tyranny when they see when they feel the rifle
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:26.040]  then they go all right i get it maybe just isn't a good idea thank you janice for your call but
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:30.920]  look we do not we do not espouse violence here as a way to resolve these issues i know i i sense
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:36.200]  your anger janice in your description there the fear the terror that they they tried to instill
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:43.160]  in you at that moment and we just got to be real careful we don't we do not uh shooting back is not
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:47.560]  the way for us to solve this is not the revolution that we want we want a peaceful revolution we
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.240]  want the ron paul revolution what do you say robert to that well you know janice's story is very
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:57.160]  profound and i hear this from those that have immigrated to the united states from eastern
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:01.160]  europe we have a lot of listeners that that have and they uh when i talk to them about
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:04.920]  what's happened here in america and they're just so sad and sometimes they're angry but more often
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:08.680]  they're sad they just don't understand it's like what happened you americans you you were the land
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:13.800]  of liberty you love liberty and now you're going the way of where we came from why we wanted to
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:19.000]  come to america and so i am grateful for those immigrants because oftentimes we have basically
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.480]  been so indoctrinated over generations now that we can't see what has happened in the context of
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:28.840]  the boiling of the frog slowly enough that we don't jump out so to have those those warning
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:33.640]  signs as harvest people with experience like janice actually say hey that does not make you safe
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:38.040]  uh of course you know that these are the things where we talked earlier about the suffering
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:43.400]  does america need to suffer a total economic collapse in order for us to embrace liberty again
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:49.000]  instead of totalitarianism attarianism and dictatorship and tyranny sometimes it takes
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.640]  that brutality people with cancer or aids are very serious issues before they come to someone
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:57.400]  like me as a homeopath they'll often have gone through so much before they're willing to change
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.640]  their diet or lifestyle some some of them will choose to die rather than change and that's part
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:05.400]  of the equation well we find out who's ready but that's what's interesting it's also true about
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.880]  nations just as people have to suffer through a health crisis before they awaken to the reality
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:14.760]  that they got to take care of their bodies and they got to follow rules you know and protect their
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:19.720]  their the rights the safety of their own internal organs nations do the same thing don't they where
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.200]  nations sometimes they become complacent and apathetic and then they lose their freedoms and
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:29.320]  then the tyranny comes in and then they awaken and realize oh my goodness maybe we should not have
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:35.000]  let go of that fourth amendment right or that first or second amendment right is it seems like
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  america is in that patient crisis to use the medical metaphor right now yeah and that was the
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.320]  the brilliance of ron paul in a debate yesterday where he said don't be so callously you know
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:50.680]  unwilling to give up like newt gingrich is to say what you want a camera and a cop in every
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.400]  house so we can prevent wife beating or whatever oh yeah we don't want another timothy mcvay who
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:50:00.120]  does but at the same point do you sacrifice everything that we fought the revolution for
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:04.680]  in america for it to say that we can be safe i mean this is where gingrich is amazing to me
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.840]  and everybody says he's so intelligent i mean how intelligent you have to be to forget history so
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:15.160]  efficiently as he has forgotten history well you can have a high IQ and be completely unwise i've
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:21.400]  seen that in academic circles these people are experts in one area but they're total morons when
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:28.440]  it comes to reality and and street wise just knowing how to survive in the world and knowing
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:33.560]  basic fundamental laws and basic rights that's where it seems like newt gingrich just falls flat
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:39.080]  on his face which is very very disturbing to see that he's he could be so intelligent and yet he has
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:45.800]  no wisdom all right well robert scott is still with us there sorry uh we will be right back after
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:49.400]  this break we're going to take another call we're going to continue with our list of things to be

[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:34.440]  thankful for on this thanksgiving i wanted to mention the next item on my list i'm thankful for
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:42.920]  the spirit of 1776 yeah that spirit that is part of the american fabric the culture of questioning
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:49.320]  government of asking these questions and then taking action as necessary to put government in
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:55.160]  its place to protect our freedoms rather than dominating over us as tyrants i think that i
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:01.800]  think the spirit of 1776 is very strong in this country and then we will prevail peacefully yes
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:07.160]  that's the key question any comments on that robert before we go to our caller it's in our dna
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:11.960]  absolutely as americans and i found that to be you know not no slight to anybody else around
[02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:16.840]  the around the world you know i don't come from ego when i say that but there is something unique
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:21.720]  and special about the american republic and it's all and its foundation in origin and it's still
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:27.320]  alive but then many people are afraid of it even within america because they have been you know
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:33.000]  wussified we've talked about the wussification of america i'm not all that grateful for the wussies
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.800]  but they're to help them when they get you know the courage back maybe they'll they'll get some
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:42.760]  courage from you and others that are standing up as we bring out that you know second american
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.160]  revolution here that we're in the midst of a peaceful one as we say well as dr lonke said
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:51.160]  we're here to wake up their parasympathetic nervous systems and for the tsa officers
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:57.160]  we're here to wake up your unsympathetic nervous systems all right let's go to a caller john in
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:02.440]  ohio you're on the air with mike adams and robert scott bell how you doing today well pretty good
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.640]  i didn't call it my primary dimension this but i want to start out with it now after the last
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:13.080]  call i happened to take a bus trip with the middle americans through uh... western europe
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:19.960]  it included a western belin berlin and uh... you have a a one day pass to go into east berlin
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:24.840]  i went there i had absolutely no trouble the people were well dressed i spent the entire
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:30.280]  day there eating sausages and seeing a fashion show downtown i was even an hour late in getting
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:37.080]  out they gave me no problem they just made a call and i went off across the to the west berlin side
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:42.120]  so i think people are out of the check out some of the lies were told about history
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:47.480]  i'd recommend just looking up on the search on a computer lies concerning the soviet union
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:55.080]  okay because and i also i i i did want to mention that uh... i i have a feeling that if we don't
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:01.880]  question these big live premises and just say uh... well uh... even though it's a lie that uh...
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:06.200]  the american government is uh... saintly and benevolently trying to protect us from terrorist
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:11.640]  when we know it's inside jobs if we say uh... yes we know these countries that the united
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:17.080]  states is devastating attacking and slaughtering are really bad uh... countries that are doing
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:22.440]  all the all the things that the uh... c i media tells us they're doing we lose the argument and i
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:27.800]  i have that difference with uh... ron paul that's why i respect uh... paul crick roberts he doesn't
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:32.920]  censor himself on that and uh... a webster tarply does not he's been in these countries and he
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:38.120]  tells us all that the uh... things were being told about uh... iran and syria right now are
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:43.400]  out but you know why is that you're absolutely right and i greatly admire paul craig robert roberts
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:49.880]  as well but you know just about ron paul he knows much more than what he talks about but think about
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.000]  it you can't go up on stage in front of the american people and tell them the whole truth when you're
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:00.120]  running for president they're not ready for that yet maybe you can on info wars you can tell people
