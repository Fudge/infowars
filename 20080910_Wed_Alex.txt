[01:07.980 --> 01:16.260]  on Russian television Iranian television it's just amazing and frankly I don't
[01:16.260 --> 01:19.180]  like doing it I don't like how it's misconstrued
[01:19.180 --> 01:26.020]  construed construed it is construed I am construed by doing it by people out
[01:26.020 --> 01:31.620]  there but I will tell the truth anywhere anytime anyplace to get the
[01:31.620 --> 01:37.700]  information out to the people whatever the cost maybe we shall go on to the end
[01:37.700 --> 01:44.820]  and tomorrow morning I'm on with Dudley and Bob in studio here in Austin Texas
[01:44.820 --> 01:55.380]  on KLBJ 93.7 I will not be in New York I've got to go down to East Texas to see
[01:55.380 --> 01:59.260]  family and then to South Texas to Houston to see my great-uncle who's got
[01:59.260 --> 02:03.620]  pancreatic cancer and he's had it for months and I haven't visited him yet and
[02:03.620 --> 02:07.740]  I need to get down there and see him because that is a very serious fast
[02:07.740 --> 02:14.220]  acting cancer I'm not gonna say any more I family listening but now a hurricane
[02:14.220 --> 02:17.060]  set to be hitting Houston right when I'm supposed to be down there so I don't
[02:17.060 --> 02:21.020]  know should I go jump on a plane at the end of the show and go to New York and
[02:21.020 --> 02:28.140]  then miss some of the show next week to go see family anyways that's the type of
[02:28.140 --> 02:33.780]  stuff going on in my mind that distracts me from all the news and information
[02:33.780 --> 02:38.380]  that we have here today very important radio show today very important
[02:38.380 --> 02:44.500]  information I want to do this I want to just go over the headlines from today
[02:44.500 --> 02:50.820]  yesterday and Monday because I really have covered that maybe 20 30% of the
[02:50.820 --> 02:54.700]  news I had my stacks and it's all important so I just want to at least
[02:54.700 --> 03:01.300]  briefly get into a huge jumbo serving of news and I have a whole bunch of
[03:01.300 --> 03:09.380]  audio clips I want to play on a host of issues turns out we have found and Paul
[03:09.380 --> 03:15.180]  Watson posted some clips from press conferences where Donald Rumsfeld and
[03:15.180 --> 03:21.340]  then General Myers who was chairman John Jesus staff a few years ago Mr. 911 you
[03:21.340 --> 03:26.220]  can call him running the war games targeting the exact same locations at
[03:26.220 --> 03:33.300]  the exact same time put two and two together not a very nice person but I
[03:33.300 --> 03:38.180]  guess it's just a military pawn sacrifice for the greater good that's the
[03:38.180 --> 03:45.740]  higher-level military mind but talking about directed energy weapons high
[03:45.740 --> 03:53.700]  powered microwaves that literally fry people that make it's like when you put
[03:53.700 --> 03:56.740]  a hot dog in the microwave for 30 minutes it'll shrink down to the size
[03:56.740 --> 04:04.780]  of a breakfast sausage or a beanie weenie that's what it does they just fry
[04:04.780 --> 04:09.340]  everybody it's a terror weapon though it doesn't really have a classical
[04:09.340 --> 04:15.380]  military application for destroying armor or killing infantry it's just meant
[04:15.380 --> 04:20.500]  to fry whole villages of people and it does quite nicely so they they get into
[04:20.500 --> 04:24.780]  that and they also have some type of particle beams that slice people up
[04:24.780 --> 04:30.700]  quite nicely you don't hear anything you don't even see anything just suddenly
[04:30.700 --> 04:35.900]  everybody sliced up in little pieces they've got other beams that fry folks
[04:35.900 --> 04:41.220]  kind of pop when they get hit with them imagine these psychopaths that run
[04:41.220 --> 04:45.740]  things they just love it they love fried a bunch of Iraqis in a square more than
[04:45.740 --> 04:50.900]  they love Dinecore delivering kidnapped children to them so they can rip their
[04:50.900 --> 04:55.340]  teeth out with pliers like they do yep that's your government absolute
[04:55.340 --> 04:59.180]  psychopathic killers will be right back
[04:59.180 --> 05:11.020]  you like being a puppet sir you like being a puppy from the new world order

[06:02.940 --> 06:06.260]  opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here recently
[06:06.260 --> 06:09.140]  and she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the
[06:09.140 --> 06:13.180]  gas prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these you know
[06:13.180 --> 06:16.100]  really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're headed or where we
[06:16.100 --> 06:19.340]  might end up she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days
[06:19.340 --> 06:22.820]  folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and
[06:22.820 --> 06:25.660]  they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people
[06:25.660 --> 06:28.500]  who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the
[06:28.500 --> 06:31.500]  landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the chickens in the
[06:31.500 --> 06:34.980]  livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain
[06:34.980 --> 06:38.460]  right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global
[06:38.460 --> 06:42.340]  food shortage now what can you do to prepare do what I did sell some toys off

[08:02.060 --> 08:09.180]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:11.620 --> 08:17.260]  well the big political diversion of the day is McCain camp Obama's lipstick
[08:17.260 --> 08:21.740]  remark is disgraceful
[08:21.740 --> 08:31.540]  see this is the way our society's being turned into a bunch of the nineties oh
[08:31.540 --> 08:41.620]  don't state the obvious don't say that McCain is like a eight-year-old dead
[08:41.620 --> 08:48.300]  fish wrapped in a piece of newspaper stinking don't say that you can put
[08:48.300 --> 08:53.620]  perfume on a pig lipstick on a pig I mean that's saying that they're trying to
[08:53.620 --> 08:57.980]  put a pretty face on an agenda that is bad now of course that's within the
[08:57.980 --> 09:06.700]  controlled paradigm we know that when it comes down to actual policies there's
[09:06.700 --> 09:10.980]  almost no difference in presidents or puppets to begin with North com working
[09:10.980 --> 09:15.260]  directly for the private banks completely runs the United States and much
[09:15.260 --> 09:22.100]  of the world well let's go ahead and play that clever Obama with a lipstick
[09:22.100 --> 09:27.020]  comment well let's just list this for a second John McCain says he's about
[09:27.020 --> 09:32.780]  change too except and so I guess his whole angle is watch out George Bush
[09:32.780 --> 09:39.580]  except for economic policy health care policy tax policy education policy
[09:39.580 --> 09:46.380]  foreign policy and car world-style politics we're really gonna shake things
[09:46.380 --> 09:52.820]  up in Washington that's not change that's that's just calling some the same
[09:52.820 --> 10:00.020]  thing something different but you know you can't you know you can put lipstick
[10:00.020 --> 10:06.060]  on a pig it's still a pig
[10:06.060 --> 10:13.260]  now clearly they're saying that she is the lipstick it's not even an insult to
[10:13.260 --> 10:17.900]  Sarah Palin and by the way ladies and gentlemen Sarah Palin will run
[10:17.900 --> 10:22.340]  absolutely nothing it doesn't matter on the surface that she claims she's pro
[10:22.340 --> 10:26.940]  life both the political parties are bought and paid for by the same interest
[10:26.940 --> 10:32.540]  and I know that our listeners understand that understand that we're in a
[10:32.540 --> 10:38.820]  national security state dictatorship but until the general public is educated
[10:38.820 --> 10:42.540]  that we have no hope of ever getting control of our government
[10:42.540 --> 10:48.460]  Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and and Joe Biden and the rest of them are Taylor
[10:48.460 --> 10:52.820]  made to get people back to the table back into the soap opera of he said
[10:52.820 --> 10:59.020]  seashed meanwhile there's other little dramas going on oh Gordon Brown has
[10:59.020 --> 11:04.020]  triggered a big fight with John McCain by backing Barack Obama is the headline
[11:04.020 --> 11:10.220]  the London Telegraph today oh it's it's you again always propping up the image
[11:10.220 --> 11:13.980]  that Gordon Brown actually runs something or that his endorsement matters
[11:13.980 --> 11:18.100]  where these people run something it's all about the public never looking at the
[11:18.100 --> 11:23.500]  shadow government and it goes on with Washington Post basically the official
[11:23.500 --> 11:31.340]  CIA newspaper Palin energizing women from around the world energizing women
[11:31.340 --> 11:36.540]  from all walks of life oh it's so wonderful let's all get suckered back in
[11:36.540 --> 11:39.740]  just like they've written all these headlines about Obama energizing people
[11:39.740 --> 11:44.460]  that were never involved oh bring them back into the scam bring them back into
[11:44.460 --> 11:49.140]  the fraud bring them back into the delusion
[11:49.140 --> 11:55.780]  meanwhile you don't hear John McCain and Sarah Palin talking about the fact
[11:55.780 --> 11:59.180]  that Bush signed back on the UNESCO that runs our educational systems our
[11:59.180 --> 12:05.660]  environmental systems that openly says eradicate the family it's a disease in
[12:05.660 --> 12:12.460]  fact we saw George Bush double the health and human services planning which
[12:12.460 --> 12:18.740]  funds the bounties on grabbing a million four hundred thousand children most of
[12:18.740 --> 12:23.500]  them from good families and doing medical experiments on them selling them
[12:23.500 --> 12:26.660]  off to people that don't know they're getting kidnapped children when they
[12:26.660 --> 12:32.060]  adopt warehousing them in foster care where they're tortured and killed and
[12:32.060 --> 12:37.580]  I mean that's just a fact folks do you understand the carnage because there's
[12:37.580 --> 12:43.900]  oversights in the prisons there's a no oversight they can literally beat and
[12:43.900 --> 12:47.540]  stab and shoot foster children and nothing happens to them and they do
[12:47.540 --> 12:51.100]  every day I read about them finding another one strapped down on the cage
[12:51.100 --> 12:55.220]  for months without food rats all over them eating their bodies roaches eating
[12:55.220 --> 13:03.380]  their bodies type foster child eaten by roaches hundreds of cases you know I
[13:03.380 --> 13:07.860]  talk about how there have been cases all over the country of troops tied down
[13:07.860 --> 13:12.780]  being euthanized and how maggots eat their brains and then idiots send me
[13:12.780 --> 13:20.380]  emails or post articles saying I'm a liar that maggots only eat dead flesh the
[13:20.380 --> 13:30.020]  most common species of fly larvae but there are scores of species of fly
[13:30.020 --> 13:38.540]  larvae that eat living flesh so shut up how dare you say I'm a liar when
[13:38.540 --> 13:42.620]  everything I just said was right out of mainstream newspapers but you're a lazy
[13:42.620 --> 13:49.420]  jackass you're not gonna go find out if veterans are being eaten by maggots
[13:49.420 --> 13:55.860]  you're just gonna fly a flag out front your house and say I'm a liar you're
[13:55.860 --> 14:00.460]  gonna say I'm a liar when I told you years ago that Fannie Mae and Freddie
[14:00.460 --> 14:07.340]  Mack we're gonna collapse in a scam Ponzi scheme and even as it happens you're
[14:07.340 --> 14:13.460]  gonna call it conservative you're gonna call a tripling of the government a
[14:13.460 --> 14:19.700]  tripling of the BATF conservative you're gonna listen to Rush Limbaugh and be
[14:19.700 --> 14:23.540]  pacified just like the liberals are gonna listen to Barack Obama and be
[14:23.540 --> 14:27.580]  pacified I said I was in the cover news and I'm going into a rant I gotta stop
[14:27.580 --> 14:35.980]  but this is important news almost 1,000 deaths this year in Mexico border city in
[14:35.980 --> 14:47.260]  one town one town this is out of
[14:49.420 --> 14:55.980]  world news agency French press it's big news in Europe the rocket attacks the
[14:55.980 --> 15:03.220]  car bombs the cops getting killed all over Texas the gang riots it's on
[15:03.220 --> 15:08.100]  European TV when somebody tries to take a Mexican flag down at a post office the
[15:08.100 --> 15:14.580]  person being drug off and beat up it is never on our news because the cattle
[15:14.580 --> 15:19.220]  aren't to be told about that they're meant to debate all days Barack Obama
[15:19.220 --> 15:26.140]  talking about putting lipstick on a pig Mexicans plan mass protest against
[15:26.140 --> 15:30.100]  insecurity on Saturday but not in the city with the highest murder rate this
[15:30.100 --> 15:35.460]  year where many are focused on the more immediate safety concerns see government
[15:35.460 --> 15:45.660]  corruption leads to total collapse of societies like Haiti or Guatemala or
[15:45.660 --> 15:59.540]  Russia for that matter or Rome 1600 years ago we're just a few years away
[15:59.540 --> 16:09.700]  from the anniversary of the fall of Rome 410 a bunch of hubris filled arrogant
[16:09.700 --> 16:13.540]  corrupt government individuals violence has escalated throughout Mexico since
[16:13.540 --> 16:17.420]  president Felipe Calderon who took office at the end of 2006 launched a
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.820]  military crackdown on drug grabbing him but nowhere more than the city of
[16:21.820 --> 16:30.820]  Juarez 2,700 murders on the border alone 1,000 have been in the city across the
[16:30.820 --> 16:35.860]  Rio Grande from El Paso Texas including three in the most recent attacks
[16:35.860 --> 16:43.300]  Friday and what's their answer harassing citizens guns sweeps all over the
[16:43.300 --> 16:48.100]  country but when the cops pull over an illegal alien with weapons drugs they're
[16:48.100 --> 16:57.740]  just released because you get silica still I want about this sniper veteran
[16:57.740 --> 17:06.900]  Vietnam police officer then DEA agent head of operations in all of Central and
[17:06.900 --> 17:12.980]  South America and they just said yeah that's the way we do it you're only
[17:12.980 --> 17:17.860]  here to bust our competition some of these smaller cartels and outfits
[17:17.860 --> 17:24.340]  we go in and spray the cocoa fields and aren't owned by US banks that aren't
[17:24.340 --> 17:29.780]  tended by our people and our airports are here at El Pongo and other places to
[17:29.780 --> 17:34.940]  load the cocaine and heroin we ship in from Asia to be flown into the US he
[17:34.940 --> 17:43.940]  said what and they said yeah and if you don't like it we'll just kill you official
[17:43.940 --> 17:50.380]  US government continues today and now society is imploding and just falling
[17:50.380 --> 17:55.580]  apart don't you worry that black and white's gonna give you ticket for going
[17:55.580 --> 17:59.580]  five miles over the speed limit and if your child falls off a jungle gem and
[17:59.580 --> 18:03.300]  breaks a finger they're gonna try to take them or if you tell that nurse you're
[18:03.300 --> 18:10.780]  poor they're gonna try to take your kids at the hospital the book is to be
[18:10.780 --> 18:18.020]  thrown at you the dumb sappy cattle but we told you five years ago the CIA was
[18:18.020 --> 18:24.660]  opening up an official war against drug cartels that were vying for control
[18:24.660 --> 18:31.060]  against them and US special forces private contractors Los Zetas and the
[18:31.060 --> 18:35.100]  Mexican government with the US with Bush trying to fund them over a hundred
[18:35.100 --> 18:39.140]  billion remember that they're finding about 10 billion a year but he wants a
[18:39.140 --> 18:42.940]  hundred plus a billion what a hundred and sixty seven billion and that's to
[18:42.940 --> 18:50.660]  try to win the drug war but it's to secure that they make the entire profit
[18:50.660 --> 18:54.500]  including putting you in their private jails when they catch you using their
[18:54.500 --> 18:59.300]  product young people I'm not knocking you if you got tattoos and long hair but
[18:59.300 --> 19:03.980]  you're wearing a uniform the police have been trained to alert on I don't care
[19:03.980 --> 19:14.540]  what you look like didn't mean anything to me okay I mean I'm to the point where

[36:46.820 --> 36:49.700]  you know in decades back in the fifties and sixties
[36:49.700 --> 36:53.780]  we are just absolutely got the golden touch right now
[36:53.780 --> 36:59.060]  we're knocking out of the park home runs every time we get up to bat
[36:59.060 --> 37:02.820]  and the enemy saying oh my gosh you're losing
[37:02.820 --> 37:07.380]  you know you're down you're down five home runs in the ninth inning
[37:07.380 --> 37:11.860]  we're ahead don't listen to the enemy chatter
[37:11.860 --> 37:15.620]  look at what's happening for yourself and again this country's been bit by a
[37:15.620 --> 37:18.660]  giant cobra and they're telling you don't be
[37:18.660 --> 37:22.660]  negative just believe that a cobra bite is good for you and i'm saying no
[37:22.660 --> 37:27.300]  jab a knife in both those holes bleed it out bleed it out and then put a tourniquet
[37:27.300 --> 37:30.020]  on it and then get to the hospital and get some
[37:30.020 --> 37:34.500]  antivenom and they're going no cobras don't exist
[37:34.500 --> 37:39.060]  what was that big black snake that just bit me snakes don't exist
[37:39.060 --> 37:42.580]  but that snake keeps calling for the new world order it does exist
[37:42.580 --> 37:45.620]  no it i was on this radio show yesterday and they said new order doesn't exist and
[37:45.620 --> 37:47.700]  i said but your own gordon brown's calling for it
[37:47.700 --> 37:51.460]  your own prime minister and they said well he's calling for one to exist
[37:51.460 --> 37:54.820]  oh i see
[37:55.060 --> 37:58.580]  yeah i mean it's a cancer that's spread all over our body if we have emergency
[37:58.580 --> 38:02.900]  surgery we can probably get it removed but if we wait much longer it will
[38:02.900 --> 38:06.980]  metastasize into the brain it'll be too late
[38:06.980 --> 38:10.340]  it'll metastasize into the bone and then be exported all over the body
[38:10.340 --> 38:14.020]  and they're saying it's not cancer it's not cancer everything's fine
[38:14.020 --> 38:17.140]  everything's okay everything's good don't be negative
[38:17.140 --> 38:23.700]  don't be negative don't listen to crazy people
[38:23.700 --> 38:28.340]  to the police and the military you can find out in five minutes what sodium
[38:28.340 --> 38:30.900]  fluoride is it is the sodium fluoride itself is deadly and
[38:30.900 --> 38:34.580]  attacks all the organs and glands and massively increases bone cancer just
[38:34.580 --> 38:39.220]  type in fluoride bone cancer fluoride brain cancer fluoride
[38:39.220 --> 38:43.940]  leukemia fluoride diabetes just fries you but that's
[38:43.940 --> 38:47.300]  but when you hear sodium fluoride that's a catch all term
[38:47.300 --> 38:52.180]  for hundreds of grignard reagents toxic compounds and heavy metals
[38:52.180 --> 38:56.340]  they legally put it in the water supply
[38:56.340 --> 39:00.180]  and you know how they got them to do it in the 40s they told racist white
[39:00.180 --> 39:04.660]  army people and and and government tacticians look these blacks are going
[39:04.660 --> 39:07.780]  to riot we got to pump this into their neighborhoods
[39:07.780 --> 39:13.220]  and so it began and they have you heard dr monty federal studies
[39:13.220 --> 39:19.060]  five times the fluoride in major cities has pumped into the poor areas
[39:19.060 --> 39:22.020]  that means five times the lead the mercury the arsenic let me give you a
[39:22.020 --> 39:27.380]  newsflash i'm gonna tell you again cops do not suck your thumb
[39:27.380 --> 39:32.900]  you cannot avoid this you will go to google tonight
[39:32.900 --> 39:36.900]  i am begging you to stop being cowards and to go to google
[39:36.900 --> 39:40.020]  and go to mainstream government sites they will admit
[39:40.020 --> 39:44.340]  what sodium fluoride is here's another example
[39:44.500 --> 39:48.500]  and i knew this years ago but my father reminded me
[39:48.500 --> 39:52.580]  a few months ago i was having dinner over at their house
[39:54.100 --> 39:59.140]  and i was talking about how in the 40s they had all the by-product
[39:59.140 --> 40:04.260]  sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride and other types
[40:04.260 --> 40:07.860]  from the cracking of the oil when that's how the first chemical they break it
[40:07.860 --> 40:13.700]  down with for refining and they had it from the by-products of
[40:13.700 --> 40:17.140]  chemical fertilizer production which is also with petrochemicals
[40:17.140 --> 40:23.140]  oil and they had it with the aluminum by-product of refining aluminum
[40:23.140 --> 40:27.540]  and they had giant warehouses everywhere and and i mean one canister would
[40:27.540 --> 40:30.580]  roll off a truck and get in a river in tennessee and
[40:30.580 --> 40:34.500]  or in texas there were a bunch of famous cases or in ohio and it would
[40:34.500 --> 40:38.340]  kill all the fish and kill any cows that drank it and
[40:38.340 --> 40:41.620]  people that drank the water and the water supplies it got into
[40:41.620 --> 40:45.220]  you know there would just be massive retardation of children
[40:45.220 --> 40:48.260]  and they said you know what we'll do we will diffuse this into the general
[40:48.260 --> 40:52.900]  water supply and it will brain damage them and it will sterilize people and
[40:52.900 --> 40:57.860]  hurt them that's eugenics and they did it
[40:57.860 --> 41:02.900]  and then if people complain they said oh that's crazy mccarthy people
[41:02.900 --> 41:06.900]  that's when they finally shut mccarthy down they liked using mccarthy when he
[41:06.900 --> 41:09.620]  was just shutting down free speech and going after it left us
[41:09.620 --> 41:13.220]  but as soon as he went i just discovered it's a new world order and the army
[41:13.220 --> 41:17.300]  runs it and they're poisoning the water i have documents
[41:17.300 --> 41:22.100]  that was it for him they dropped the hammer on him real fast
[41:22.100 --> 41:26.180]  you see he broke into the other side went whoa
[41:26.180 --> 41:30.980]  they run it all this kami thing's just a front
[41:32.820 --> 41:35.940]  so you go find out
[41:36.260 --> 41:39.540]  but but so i'm talking to my dad about it and i go yeah they just take the toxic
[41:39.540 --> 41:46.740]  waste like du the spent fuel rods and the byproducts of uranium enrichment
[41:46.740 --> 41:50.500]  and they take the isotope and they make it into weapon systems and armor and
[41:50.500 --> 41:54.660]  they've now been caught putting it in special steel for construction
[41:54.660 --> 41:59.060]  and he goes oh it's just like fertilizer son in which he'd been told this by his
[41:59.060 --> 42:02.180]  uncle the one that's got pancreatic cancer who
[42:02.180 --> 42:06.980]  ran one of the biggest refineries in houston years ago and i went back to
[42:06.980 --> 42:09.460]  the deer camp back to being a little kid back to that
[42:09.460 --> 42:15.060]  discussion of the toxic fertilizer and back to my uncle great uncle saying
[42:15.060 --> 42:22.020]  man don't use that yard fertilizer that stuff they say put on your yard
[42:22.020 --> 42:26.500]  and my dad going why and going will david
[42:26.500 --> 42:31.380]  you see we've got to get rid of all these to all this toxic waste
[42:31.380 --> 42:34.900]  and so what we do is we sell it to the fertilizer companies but
[42:34.900 --> 42:37.860]  congress got involved back in the 70s and said well
[42:37.860 --> 42:40.660]  you can't
[42:41.540 --> 42:46.900]  put it in farm fertilizer that goes right on the food
[42:46.900 --> 42:52.260]  put it on yard fertilizer and that's why grass fertilizer says don't use in gardening
[42:52.260 --> 42:56.180]  don't use in farming but of course and i was telling the british media about
[42:56.180 --> 42:58.980]  the thing and the british talk show host goes yeah i know about that we do that
[42:58.980 --> 43:02.100]  here too that way it doesn't run in the ocean
[43:02.100 --> 43:05.460]  like we used to dump it he said that real proud well we used to just dump it
[43:05.460 --> 43:08.660]  in the ocean and i said what are you talking about
[43:08.660 --> 43:12.660]  now you localize it into your yard if your dog lays in it
[43:12.660 --> 43:17.060]  remember one time they just fertilized in my dog laid in a little bit of it all
[43:17.060 --> 43:20.580]  his hair fell off and he got a big rash
[43:20.580 --> 43:23.620]  we took him to the vet and they said did you just fertilize yes
[43:23.620 --> 43:29.300]  oh that stuff's deadly poison and there's no reason to mix lead and mercury
[43:29.300 --> 43:32.980]  and arsenic and all of these other what they call
[43:32.980 --> 43:42.500]  grignard reagents from the chemical separations in the cyanide
[43:42.500 --> 43:46.660]  now now now don't laugh cops your kids are playing in that yard
[43:46.660 --> 43:49.060]  don't laugh because you're invested in the lies
[43:49.060 --> 43:54.020]  bureaucrats government people do not laugh at me
[43:54.020 --> 44:05.860]  this is real this is serious
[44:05.860 --> 44:09.860]  this is not a joke or a game
[44:10.100 --> 44:14.420]  and that is the secret to everything they do
[44:15.300 --> 44:18.180]  and then i've been thinking about this a lot the last few days and my wife off
[44:18.180 --> 44:25.940]  ebay bought those 1950s picture encyclopedias
[44:25.940 --> 44:30.580]  and there's got to be 30 of them some are giant some are medium size and i
[44:30.580 --> 44:34.420]  just pulled one out of the middle of the stack
[44:34.420 --> 44:37.860]  talk about fate i mean i'm not into mumbo jumbo but i just said
[44:37.860 --> 44:41.380]  i need to look at this and i just grabbed one while i was thinking about the
[44:41.380 --> 44:46.900]  oil i pull it out i open it this is on the weekend
[44:46.900 --> 44:49.620]  this is sunday morning
[44:51.060 --> 44:55.860]  with a cup of black stigian coffee in my hand
[44:57.540 --> 45:03.300]  and i open it and it's a whole chapter on oil refining
[45:03.940 --> 45:08.340]  and it's and then there they admitted in the 50s they were doing and all but
[45:08.340 --> 45:10.980]  said it was good
[45:11.780 --> 45:15.780]  so you better believe i want to get off of oil but they're not going to let us
[45:15.780 --> 45:18.740]  they're going to give you a carbon tax on oil and control it
[45:18.740 --> 45:22.420]  oil isn't bad for the reason they tell you though they can never tell the truth
[45:22.420 --> 45:27.860]  oil is not bad for greenhouse gases and heating the earth
[45:28.420 --> 45:36.180]  oil is bad because of the byproducts of it that's why it's bad
[45:36.180 --> 45:40.980]  25 million barrels a day is what we use my god
[45:40.980 --> 45:48.420]  let's see in this super hyper environmental age all over the country
[45:48.420 --> 45:52.820]  the restrictions on burning dirty coal full of mercury
[45:52.820 --> 45:55.620]  have been taken off
[45:56.420 --> 45:59.700]  i mean you could see the mercury and dirty coal that's why it's shiny and
[45:59.700 --> 46:03.700]  has that glistening glass look on the black surface that's pure mercury
[46:03.700 --> 46:06.340]  they just burn that stuff and shoot it up in the sky
[46:06.340 --> 46:11.460]  texas supplies more coal power than any other state to
[46:11.460 --> 46:14.500]  you know period and it's just surrounding states and i got to breathe
[46:14.500 --> 46:17.380]  this my children have got to breathe it
[46:17.380 --> 46:20.740]  do the environmentalist care absolutely not they don't know anything about it
[46:20.740 --> 46:24.660]  they're running around with carbon pass stickers on their car
[46:24.660 --> 46:31.220]  voluntarily paying world taxes already like complete morons
[46:31.220 --> 46:34.820]  all right i said i'd cover stacks of news and i'm just not doing it
[46:34.820 --> 46:38.100]  because i just start thinking about this and i
[46:38.100 --> 46:41.940]  i meant to bring that the last three days i'm going to bring that almanac in
[46:41.940 --> 46:47.620]  and on the document cam in the fourth hour show it to everybody
[46:51.460 --> 46:54.580]  and show everybody
[46:56.260 --> 46:59.540]  what is inside of it
[46:59.540 --> 47:04.580]  and it just it just like like go over oil and how it all
[47:04.580 --> 47:09.380]  works but they're not stopping or taking the uranium
[47:09.380 --> 47:14.580]  and using it all over the u.s all over the world they are taking
[47:14.580 --> 47:17.220]  and all their official studies said it'll kill you dead in the hammer it's
[47:17.220 --> 47:20.820]  deadly and it's horrible and just in the mid 90s they said which no longer bad
[47:20.820 --> 47:23.780]  we just say so
[47:23.780 --> 47:31.380]  i mean that's what i'm saying the elite have gone crazy
[47:32.100 --> 47:38.020]  almost 1000 deaths this year in one border town on texas and
[47:38.020 --> 47:41.860]  last time i checked it's more than 10 cities fly mexican flags and no american
[47:41.860 --> 47:47.380]  flags at the courthouses at the city buildings
[47:47.380 --> 47:52.820]  and their signs posted basically green goes not allowed
[47:52.820 --> 47:57.460]  and it's been on cnn one time and cnn basically said it was good
[47:57.460 --> 48:03.620]  they talked about el cenizo and i'm not against these mexicans
[48:03.620 --> 48:06.740]  they don't like me
[48:07.620 --> 48:11.060]  i'm not talking about mexicans that are americans i'm talking about
[48:11.060 --> 48:14.020]  and that's why a lot of my mexican friends and mexicans come up on the
[48:14.020 --> 48:17.460]  street and shake my hand and go yeah i speak spanish i listen to radio you're
[48:17.460 --> 48:20.020]  telling the truth
[48:20.020 --> 48:23.700]  and what does it even matter they're poisoning everything
[48:23.700 --> 48:27.220]  they're hurting everybody no matter what color you are and we've got this war
[48:27.220 --> 48:32.420]  going on over drugs and it's not even in the mainstream media
[48:32.420 --> 48:40.740]  us cancels russian nuclear deal that was the store us

[54:38.020 --> 54:40.980]  and it's got the official iraqi hospital heads
[54:40.980 --> 54:45.220]  talking about you know these tanks with these weapons arrays on top firing out
[54:45.220 --> 54:49.540]  these bolts of lightning that fry and melt everything it's terror weapons
[54:49.540 --> 54:53.700]  it's not precision it's not what uh real infantry needs
[54:53.700 --> 54:58.100]  it's all part of terror freaking people out uh but here's a little club of a
[54:58.100 --> 55:02.100]  newscast going back uh about four and a half years ago with
[55:02.100 --> 55:06.180]  general mires and rumsfeld where they're talking about it and they
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.820]  look you ought to see the video it's in the story that
[55:08.820 --> 55:14.020]  paul watson wrote about the headline what is the pentagon's new secret weapon
[55:14.020 --> 55:18.340]  here it is fry weapons that have never been used before
[55:18.340 --> 55:22.740]  and the questions from the press about direct energy and microwave weapons
[55:22.740 --> 55:26.900]  made them visibly uncomfortable can i ask you a question about some of the
[55:26.900 --> 55:30.100]  technology that you're developing to fight the war on terror specifically
[55:30.100 --> 55:34.980]  directed energy and high-powered microwave technology
[55:34.980 --> 55:38.420]  do you uh when do you envision that you can weaponize
[55:38.420 --> 55:42.100]  that type of technology
[55:42.100 --> 55:46.580]  goodness um it is it is in for the most part the kinds of things you're talking
[55:46.580 --> 55:50.260]  about are in varying early stages head pause
[55:50.260 --> 55:54.180]  for the most part i mean they are just lying the whole time and then they
[55:54.180 --> 55:59.540]  admit at the end oh actually um general francis is right when he was
[55:59.540 --> 56:02.420]  again still in there in the first year of the invasion i guess it's almost almost
[56:02.420 --> 56:05.620]  five years ago uh he says he is you know using these
[56:05.620 --> 56:09.860]  things we are testing them before they're ready you know they're there it's
[56:09.860 --> 56:13.460]  a laboratory here it is do you want to give anything you
[56:13.460 --> 56:18.260]  would add i don't think i would add much i i
[56:18.260 --> 56:22.500]  i think they are in early stages and and and probably not ready
[56:22.500 --> 56:27.780]  for employment at this point in the normal order of things when you invest
[56:27.780 --> 56:31.860]  in research and development and begin a developmental project
[56:31.860 --> 56:36.580]  you don't have any intention or expectations that one would use it
[56:36.580 --> 56:39.860]  on the other hand the real world intervenes from time to time and you
[56:39.860 --> 56:44.180]  reach in there and take something out that is still in a developmental stage
[56:44.180 --> 56:48.900]  and you might use it so it the answer your question is not answerable
[56:48.900 --> 56:52.580]  it is it is uh it depends on what happens in the future and how
[56:52.580 --> 56:55.700]  well things move along the track and whether or not someone
[56:55.700 --> 56:59.300]  feels it's appropriate to reach into a development stage and see if something
[56:59.300 --> 57:02.260]  might be useful as was the case with the unmanned aerial
[57:02.260 --> 57:04.900]  vehicles what you thought you're willing to experiment
[57:04.900 --> 57:08.260]  i think that's the point and i think and it's we have i think from the beginning
[57:08.260 --> 57:11.380]  of this conflict i think general frank has been very open to
[57:11.380 --> 57:15.140]  looking at new things if there are new things available and
[57:15.140 --> 57:19.620]  has been been willing to put him into the fight even though i'm going to play
[57:19.620 --> 57:24.020]  like 20 minutes of this coming up on an hour and a half from now
[57:24.020 --> 57:27.940]  i'm going to analyze it and also take calls specifically
[57:27.940 --> 57:31.620]  if you're in the military and you can specifically say what this manhattan
[57:31.620 --> 57:35.460]  project level new development is we know it's the
[57:35.460 --> 57:39.460]  microwave guns and the particle beams and that's described on italian tv i mean
[57:39.460 --> 57:42.340]  they just cut crowds in half women and children
[57:42.340 --> 57:46.500]  and we notice they keep using these on crowds this is to terrorize
[57:46.500 --> 57:49.940]  this is a terror weapon for psychological you know to
[57:49.940 --> 57:53.860]  demoralize people they can do the same thing with one cluster bomb
[57:53.860 --> 57:57.780]  uh it's it's a terror weapon that's why they have our military set off the road
[57:57.780 --> 58:04.500]  and just mow women and children down driving uh in their cars on video
[58:04.500 --> 58:08.260]  because it's about letting them know your scum your slaves we're going to kill
[58:08.260 --> 58:11.940]  you just like uh private gruckheimer came back
[58:11.940 --> 58:15.060]  and said yeah we go into villages and kill even the newborn babies
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.420]  and the pentagon came out and said well we want to clarify only in certain
[58:18.420 --> 58:22.020]  villages do we kill the babies too they walk right up
[58:22.020 --> 58:25.780]  stick a gun to the babies head and blow it off now a lot of those guys
[58:25.780 --> 58:30.980]  have come back in their cops right now and you want me to respect them and
[58:30.980 --> 58:34.500]  love them no i don't respect the government the tortures children i don't

[59:51.300 --> 1:00:00.740]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network

[1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:25.860]  live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:29.460]  daughter stan monty coming up after the break
[1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:35.380]  national iranian television their english service international
[1:00:35.380 --> 1:00:41.060]  press tv has been going on there and uh t minus three hours
[1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:46.740]  so erin dykes first to go last to know erin you're going to be sitting in
[1:00:46.740 --> 1:00:50.660]  with my guest in the fourth hour today erin dykes come on in here
[1:00:50.660 --> 1:00:53.540]  he doesn't even hear me as headphones on now he's coming
[1:00:53.540 --> 1:00:58.820]  uh erin will hear after you heard hey uh are you game to host the show the last
[1:00:58.820 --> 1:01:03.060]  30 minutes today you'll do a great job just relax it's
[1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:06.660]  no big deal uh because i've got richard c cook that
[1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:10.820]  historian and economist on for an hour and press tv is putting me live on
[1:01:10.820 --> 1:01:16.660]  international iranian television at uh 307
[1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:21.060]  and so i need you to come in here and do this for us
[1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:24.420]  and they now are telling me they want me to be
[1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:27.540]  i've really got to gauge this and think about this because
[1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:33.540]  i can easily be cast as a tokyo rose or something doing this
[1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:36.100]  but you see the people that run our government they're the ones that are
[1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:38.660]  anti-american they're the ones overthrowing our bill of rights
[1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:44.020]  our constitution our way of life our republic our bill our constitution
[1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:49.140]  everything else uh and uh so they have to be resisted i want
[1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.380]  our country back and that's what i said on russian tv
[1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:55.380]  that's what i'm gonna say on iranian tv and explain that
[1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:58.500]  uh we basically have hijackers in this country
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:02.660]  and we need to have those hijackers removed and uh i'm doing the world and
[1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:05.860]  the american people favor going on shows like this because we don't want a war
[1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:10.980]  that will jack up the prices of oil and everything else
[1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:17.540]  just to say the least so uh we will be doing that today
[1:02:17.540 --> 1:02:21.780]  that should be interesting when they say they want me on their routinely i don't
[1:02:21.780 --> 1:02:24.980]  know i'm going to do it this once and i'm going to think about it
[1:02:24.980 --> 1:02:28.820]  because uh the public is just too stupid
[1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:31.220]  too
[1:02:32.180 --> 1:02:39.380]  by stupid too uninformed too and not nuanced enough to even understand that
[1:02:39.380 --> 1:02:44.900]  but uh the thing about press tv is it's on a bunch of cable systems worldwide
[1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:50.500]  it's it's it's the iranian propaganda channel it's not even for the iranians
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:54.180]  and that's why it's so effective to go on there because in the u.s it's on a lot
[1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:59.940]  of cable systems british tv german dutch japanese i mean it's worldwide
[1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:03.780]  and so by going on there i can put out an anti-new world order message
[1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:07.220]  and a message of solidarity and and let them know the american people do not
[1:03:07.220 --> 1:03:12.900]  want to attack them and i'll ask the iranians to please just
[1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:16.420]  i'm gonna say on iranian tv that they should allow israel in the u.s to just
[1:03:16.420 --> 1:03:21.140]  go ahead and attack them imagine if they didn't fight back
[1:03:21.140 --> 1:03:25.300]  that would truly discredit the new world order the people that have hijacked the
[1:03:25.300 --> 1:03:28.340]  united states and that will launch an attack if they just
[1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:31.860]  the problem is the globalists that have hijacked our country will probably just
[1:03:31.860 --> 1:03:35.460]  stage terror attacks and say i ran to it
[1:03:35.460 --> 1:03:38.420]  oh god there's there's no way to win with these people they just they've got
[1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:41.780]  every angle covered the only way to win is for the cattle to stop being
[1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:48.500]  cattle and to see how they're being played manipulated
[1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:52.500]  i mean we know what we're talking about on this show folks
[1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:58.660]  on this radio program we broke down the fact
[1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:01.540]  that fanny man freddy mack would be going under
[1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:06.660]  years ago i mean i was talking about that
[1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:12.500]  i had guessed on about that eight nine years ago before 9 11
[1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:16.980]  because it was designed to be a Ponzi scheme we had people on
[1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:22.740]  like katherine austin fits who was one of the top people in the clinton
[1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:26.580]  administration in hud saying that was the plan
[1:04:26.580 --> 1:04:30.020]  i want to get her back on by the way
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:33.700]  i mean we really know what we're talking about
[1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:38.100]  this isn't our opinion you know and everybody's got one
[1:04:38.100 --> 1:04:41.540]  we know what's going on in the world we know who the power players are
[1:04:41.540 --> 1:04:45.060]  by the way it's not hard to know they state in real government documents and
[1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:48.100]  think that documents are really happening they just tell the public a
[1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.220]  fantasy land oh uh bill george bush runs something
[1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:55.780]  uh john mccain uh he'll save us uh barack obama will save us
[1:04:55.780 --> 1:05:01.220]  total theater we'll be right back with dr stan monty

[1:05:08.660 --> 1:05:12.500]  difficult or even impossible to avoid even trace amounts of these heavy
[1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:16.100]  metals over time can impact your health many health problems have been
[1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:19.940]  suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure including memory loss

[1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:34.820]  potentially deadly toxins that's why there's pura clear from ripple

[1:06:10.740 --> 1:06:15.460]  but who is the enemy bin laden this is his m o we have to look to the middle east
[1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:19.300]  we have to look to the psalm of bin laden fabled enemies is the first 9 11
[1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:22.820]  filmed to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[1:06:22.820 --> 1:06:26.500]  inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are
[1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:31.380]  israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s
[1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:35.300]  i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained

[1:08:23.460 --> 1:08:28.740]  we had him on last week for about 50 minutes but that was
[1:08:28.740 --> 1:08:32.660]  on enough time to go over all the evidence
[1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:38.100]  he has been fighting the new world order for many decades
[1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:42.740]  he is a surgeon a medical doctor
[1:08:42.740 --> 1:08:48.500]  he is uh an icon in the movement for liberty and freedom he's also a

[1:08:56.260 --> 1:09:01.300]  states and global shortwave and he's a talk show host
[1:09:01.300 --> 1:09:04.820]  right here on the gc n radio network so we're very honored
[1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:08.340]  to have him with us for the next hour and a half or
[1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:15.220]  so and i'm really going to try to control myself and not back him up see
[1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:18.980]  it sounds like i'm showing off when he says something and i
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:21.940]  interrupt and throw out five or six facts backing him up
[1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:26.500]  it's that i want people listening i want to second him you're like amen brother
[1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:30.180]  i want to back up what he's saying i want to add evidence
[1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:35.460]  uh but i'm i'm getting better non perfect at letting folks just run themselves
[1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:38.900]  but from time to time i will stop him and add points or take him in different
[1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:42.260]  directions but i want to get into the mindset of
[1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:45.780]  the new world order i want to get into what we know of as eugenics from my
[1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:49.620]  findings it's now the overarching directive of everything in society it's
[1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:54.500]  where social workers came from it's it's it's how the society is run
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:58.420]  the un's biological diversity assessments say they want to kill
[1:09:58.420 --> 1:10:02.100]  80 percent of us i want to get into the population reduction
[1:10:02.100 --> 1:10:07.700]  because that's the end game and all of this pun intended my film in game
[1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:11.060]  and then i want him to really get into see what's mentioned in congressional
[1:10:11.060 --> 1:10:14.900]  hearings and government studies we kind of spat over that about they'll just put
[1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:18.260]  fluoride in the water they put heavy metals
[1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:23.380]  they put it on our lawns they uh you know with yard fertilizer all of it and
[1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:26.580]  they know what it's doing and we have government documents where they
[1:10:26.580 --> 1:10:29.620]  wanted to put it in the water to dumb us down we know
[1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:33.380]  that they're mass medicating the new freedom initiative this taking control
[1:10:33.380 --> 1:10:37.140]  of the human development dumbing us down this playing god
[1:10:37.140 --> 1:10:40.180]  and so that's what i want dr monty because he's an expert on so many fields
[1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:44.580]  but particularly this one and soft kill weapons like hiv and
[1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:48.740]  government programs and he's one of the guys going back 20 plus years ago really
[1:10:48.740 --> 1:10:51.940]  exposed that aids was a government operation he has the declassified
[1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:55.780]  government documents he has the proof
[1:10:55.780 --> 1:11:00.100]  and we'll talk about that in a host of other issues chromes disease tied in
[1:11:00.100 --> 1:11:04.260]  with the vaccines all of it and he is a medical doctor
[1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:07.540]  so dr stan monty thank you so much for coming on with us
[1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:12.580]  it's always a pleasure and i don't mind when you interrupt no i know but i want
[1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:16.180]  you to be able to go over your evidence and documentation i i know but i'm
[1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:20.420]  just explaining why i jump in because everything you're saying is so true
[1:11:20.420 --> 1:11:24.020]  and then there's a whole depth of knowledge on each little point you
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:27.060]  get to which i know you have the knowledge others have it but
[1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:30.420]  i don't think they're listeners realize we're not joking this is a fact
[1:11:30.420 --> 1:11:34.020]  so dr monty wherever you want to start you've heard some of the basic issues i
[1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:37.940]  want to talk about well if we were going to do in the
[1:11:37.940 --> 1:11:42.100]  population control i would say i think is a common denominator
[1:11:42.100 --> 1:11:45.860]  behind so much of what's going on today and there are all
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:50.340]  other explanations that are given all day uh... they are selling vaccines because
[1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:54.340]  they want to make money and that's true but there was a small component
[1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:58.660]  working within organized medicine working within the cdc
[1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:03.380]  working within the fda where dedicated to population control and they know that
[1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:06.660]  deadly influence of the vaccines and the
[1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:10.580]  thimerosal in the vaccines uh... for instance we're giving to children in
[1:12:10.580 --> 1:12:14.020]  third world countries isn't it interesting that uh...
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:17.620]  we took the vaccine out of the childhood vaccines
[1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:20.660]  that took the thimerosal or mercury out of the
[1:12:20.660 --> 1:12:23.380]  childhood vaccines we give here in the united states
[1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:27.300]  but we left the thimerosal in the vaccines we're giving
[1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:31.300]  to the little black and of brown children in third world nations of
[1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:35.140]  course we give it to them free because we want to help them we want to prevent
[1:12:35.140 --> 1:12:39.060]  them from dying of of these childhood diseases the
[1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:42.980]  problem is that thimerosal influences fertility
[1:12:42.980 --> 1:12:47.220]  and in animal studies it shows it will influence fertility not only in this
[1:12:47.220 --> 1:12:51.220]  generation but in subsequent generations and we have a wonderful
[1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:55.700]  interview with dr david aub whose research this we have a
[1:12:55.700 --> 1:12:59.780]  the dvd but we also get a free cd rom with literally
[1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:04.980]  thousands of pages showing that the government knows there is toxicity
[1:13:04.980 --> 1:13:08.100]  in the mercury that they're putting in the childhood vaccines
[1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:12.660]  given in third world countries and how it impacts on fertility now doctor
[1:13:12.660 --> 1:13:16.340]  isn't mercury one of the first really studied heavy metals
[1:13:16.340 --> 1:13:18.900]  and they knew all this over a hundred years ago
[1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:23.140]  of course it is in fact when i first went into medicine why we used to you
[1:13:23.140 --> 1:13:26.340]  know paint the skin with methylate or macurochrome
[1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:30.900]  it was an orange colored substance and then one day why we we couldn't buy it
[1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:34.260]  anymore of course i didn't know why we couldn't buy it i was in practice
[1:13:34.260 --> 1:13:38.020]  didn't have time to read all the literature but the federal drug
[1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:41.060]  administration did it determine that but the
[1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:44.660]  the methylate and macurochrome you put on the skin could be absorbed into the
[1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:49.540]  body and would it was toxic so it was too toxic to
[1:13:49.540 --> 1:13:53.940]  paint on the skin but it was perfectly all right to inject into our children
[1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:57.780]  and we're still of course injecting it into the children in third world
[1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:01.380]  countries but of course the great game that they play here in the united
[1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:05.060]  states is they tell parents why we've removed
[1:14:05.060 --> 1:14:08.420]  the thimerosa we've removed the the mercury from
[1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:12.260]  childhood vaccines but what they don't mention
[1:14:12.260 --> 1:14:16.500]  is that is from the childhood vaccines given for childhood diseases
[1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:20.420]  but they left it in the vaccines that are given to children
[1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:24.420]  as they play on words of course immediately when they
[1:14:24.420 --> 1:14:30.420]  outlawed it in childhood vaccines they introduced it in the influenza vaccine
[1:14:30.420 --> 1:14:35.220]  and they mandated that this be given to pregnant women in the first trimester
[1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:38.740]  of pregnancy when it would do the maximum amount of damage
[1:14:38.740 --> 1:14:43.060]  and they sold the outnutrition on that and then they mandated it be given to
[1:14:43.060 --> 1:14:46.340]  children at six months of age and one month of age
[1:14:46.340 --> 1:14:49.140]  and up to the time that they're five years of age
[1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:53.540]  where they fold dose of mercury in it and they knew what they were doing
[1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:57.220]  and i believe that they did this because they knew that the incidence of autism
[1:14:57.220 --> 1:14:59.940]  would start to fall in this country when they took the
[1:14:59.940 --> 1:15:04.100]  mercury out of the childhood vaccines so they introduced it to other vaccines
[1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:07.620]  they give into children and the parents don't know and the doctors
[1:15:07.620 --> 1:15:11.300]  don't know and they're destroying the lives and minds of our children
[1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:15.140]  well doctor that's a perfect example a perfect example of compartmentalization
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:19.460]  i've been at the hospital you know having children my wife having children
[1:15:19.460 --> 1:15:24.500]  um i've talked to countless others and they'll say i'm not taking that shot
[1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:26.980]  it's got mercury and they'll say that was taken out
[1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:30.660]  and then they'll demand the nursery doctor bring the little insert over and
[1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:35.140]  it says the marisol and the nursery doctor will say i'll be
[1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:39.780]  so i mean the doctors themselves and the nurses they're not infallible
[1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:45.300]  and they just don't know these alex you know i practice medicine for you over
[1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:49.300]  40 years and i know you don't have time to read those labels
[1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:52.660]  the insert you don't have time to read the medical
[1:15:52.660 --> 1:15:56.580]  journals but so much of this is covered but the information is there
[1:15:56.580 --> 1:16:01.220]  and that we're gonna have to educate the people so they can educate the doctors
[1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:04.820]  and they can realize that they can't believe their leaders they can't believe
[1:16:04.820 --> 1:16:08.500]  the public health service they can't believe the cdc because there are people
[1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:12.420]  there who have a different agenda some of them are bought off by the
[1:16:12.420 --> 1:16:16.660]  vaccine manufacturers i'm sure that most of them are just compartmentalized
[1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:20.900]  right and this is the problem we face and we are under attack from so many
[1:16:20.900 --> 1:16:26.100]  points of view in fact just recently here in the in the moderate bay area in
[1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.660]  the san Francisco bay area close to where i live
[1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:33.060]  the the public health services now is said that the major source of
[1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:36.900]  of mercury in the san Francisco bay that's getting into the fish there
[1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:40.660]  is coming from the dental offices where they're taking out cavities
[1:16:40.660 --> 1:16:44.100]  and where they're either putting in fillings pardon me they're putting in
[1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:48.100]  fillings or they're taking out fillings and they're going to demand that all
[1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:51.860]  that of the dark of death is there actually have a special filter to take
[1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:55.300]  the mercury out of the water before it's dumped into the bay
[1:16:55.300 --> 1:17:00.660]  and the dentist rub an arm saying why you know there's no harm for tall from
[1:17:00.660 --> 1:17:05.220]  fillings and of course there's harm from fillings it all from in most of the
[1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:08.260]  countries in the rest of the world in sweden for instance
[1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:12.020]  the government which provides free dental care will not pay for a mercury
[1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:14.980]  filling because they know how toxic they are
[1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:18.980]  and almost half the dentist in the united states are quit using mercury in
[1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:22.580]  the fillings because they know but they can't come forward and tell the
[1:17:22.580 --> 1:17:25.060]  american people that they've been poisoning us
[1:17:25.060 --> 1:17:29.060]  and when they put that filling in it does not it is not inert
[1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:32.980]  it actually every time you chew or every time you
[1:17:32.980 --> 1:17:36.340]  actually drink something hot it'll vent the mercury
[1:17:36.340 --> 1:17:40.500]  the studies have been done in animals that mercury tag mercury goes right into
[1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:43.860]  the brain and what we're doing is poisoning the
[1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:46.500]  american people they've been doing it for 60 years
[1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:51.220]  100 years ago american dentists would not use mercury in their fillings
[1:17:51.220 --> 1:17:54.500]  and they organized the american dental association
[1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:58.180]  so that the doctors who were committing this this terrible crime against the
[1:17:58.180 --> 1:18:01.140]  public oh would have an organization and then
[1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:04.740]  eventually of course they simply got into the
[1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:08.260]  dental schools they convinced everybody that the mercury fillings were
[1:18:08.260 --> 1:18:11.620]  perfectly safe and they're not and you can go up
[1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:15.380]  certainly under the internet and and just uh
[1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:21.140]  oh google and things like toxic teeth and or you can contact us we've got
[1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:25.940]  videos that you will show you oh that if they take a tooth out that has a
[1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:29.620]  filling in it uh and they heat that tooth up to the point
[1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:32.980]  you would have it you know if somebody was drinking coffee
[1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:36.980]  and you would actually see the mercury films venting off of that
[1:18:36.980 --> 1:18:40.900]  now dr monty's mercury fillings out and everybody should have their fillings
[1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:43.060]  out but they shouldn't go to a regular dentist
[1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:46.500]  because most of the dentists don't understand it bill i have talked to
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:50.820]  people who've been permanently damaged from getting their mercury fillings out
[1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:54.340]  because they got mercury toxic to the yeah that's when you really get it is
[1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:57.220]  when they take it out because then a large amount of
[1:18:57.220 --> 1:19:00.420]  events we've got a break when we come back let's continue walking through
[1:19:00.420 --> 1:19:04.740]  these different areas but studying the history of eugenics
[1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:09.300]  by the 1850s they took over the burgeoning health service they founded
[1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:12.980]  the social workers uh and as you said they put key people in
[1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:16.500]  positions of power everywhere to carry this out
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:20.100]  then they produce false literature and propaganda

[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:28.980]  below them uh that everything is fine and dandy so that's the
[1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:32.020]  that's the important thing to mention here but when you read eugenics's
[1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:35.460]  documents not just the positive and negative
[1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:39.140]  side of eugenics to use their terms but the hidden side of eugenics
[1:19:39.140 --> 1:19:45.300]  they say that uh they are going to alter the dna alter the genetics
[1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:51.940]  basically sterilize the suboid mass uh down to a quote new species and and

[1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:03.700]  brother hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the
[1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:06.980]  federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[1:21:06.980 --> 1:21:10.820]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:14.100]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[1:21:14.100 --> 1:21:16.340]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[1:21:16.340 --> 1:21:20.020]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:23.220]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the
[1:21:23.220 --> 1:21:26.740]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a
[1:21:26.740 --> 1:21:30.420]  depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with
[1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:33.460]  other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:37.220]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[1:21:37.220 --> 1:21:41.540]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a
[1:21:41.540 --> 1:21:44.500]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:48.420]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been
[1:21:48.420 --> 1:21:51.780]  driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:32.420]  fired from the political coverage
[1:24:32.420 --> 1:24:39.380]  in the game they played this disgusting tribute going i ran a
[1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:45.620]  cactus on 9 11 i'm showing iranian flags they hit us they think they're
[1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:50.580]  going to win the war but we are basically a big sell for world war three
[1:24:50.580 --> 1:24:56.260]  and oberman just came back and said if any other party or anybody else use
[1:24:56.260 --> 1:24:59.860]  that propaganda that way they would be in big trouble
[1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:02.580]  he said i want to distance myself from that there's no doubt
[1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:05.380]  he's a 9 11 truth or in fact i've talked to people
[1:25:05.380 --> 1:25:09.380]  close to his staff but i'm just going to leave it at that
[1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:13.380]  that's coming up later dr monteef continuing i want to get into aids i
[1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:17.380]  want to get into sodium fluoride you went over the fact that it's come out
[1:25:17.380 --> 1:25:21.140]  that there's five times the mercury and lead and things in blacks and inner
[1:25:21.140 --> 1:25:24.100]  cities uh they put it in the water supply that's
[1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:27.540]  even come out and been admitted i mean people don't don't don't realize the
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:31.060]  magnitude but but should we first get into
[1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:34.180]  the un's agenda the stated documents about
[1:25:34.180 --> 1:25:37.860]  well i've got a un biological diversity assessment where they talk about
[1:25:37.860 --> 1:25:41.700]  how they need to use humans sacrifice to keep our numbers down
[1:25:41.700 --> 1:25:45.220]  folks you can't make this type stuff up i mean i know it sounds crazy
[1:25:45.220 --> 1:25:49.140]  it is crazy i mean who could make up dr peonka
[1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:53.300]  ut saying kill 90 of the people and getting standing ovations and then
[1:25:53.300 --> 1:25:57.700]  he's on the ut website dressed in druid robes
[1:25:57.700 --> 1:26:01.380]  saying you know i love lucifer i mean you can't
[1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:07.300]  make this up go ahead well the whole story is just so
[1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:10.740]  incredible what do we where should we start would you like to start with
[1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:13.780]  fluoride because water fluoridation is one of the most
[1:26:13.780 --> 1:26:17.620]  topical things that they've ever come up yeah let's spend a lot of time on that
[1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:21.540]  then get into uh you source documents you know
[1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:25.860]  information quotes uh you know about the population reduction
[1:26:25.860 --> 1:26:28.900]  they're open statements not just where they're doing it but they're open
[1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:32.740]  statements but go ahead well i mean one of one of the favorite ones
[1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:38.740]  i certainly was a doctor sam keen and then at the uterus they get conference
[1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:42.740]  a gorbachev state of the world conference in 1995 held up the
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:47.380]  sonic ferre area and that sam keen got up and and talked about that
[1:26:47.380 --> 1:26:50.420]  well here's what he said we have the exact quotation because
[1:26:50.420 --> 1:26:53.940]  they were good enough to actually be courted by friend barrett shows us the
[1:26:53.940 --> 1:26:57.620]  tapes we must be far more clearly about sexuality
[1:26:57.620 --> 1:27:02.340]  contraception about abortion about values that control the population
[1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:08.180]  because the ecological crisis in short is the population crisis cut the
[1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:13.300]  population by 90 percent and there are enough people left to do a
[1:27:13.300 --> 1:27:17.220]  great deal of ecological damage and of course his remarks were met for the
[1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:21.620]  applause from the audience i mean it's incredible there are people who feel
[1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:24.820]  this way dr sam keeney subsequently died
[1:27:24.820 --> 1:27:28.980]  and of course it's corroborates exactly what your professor there from the
[1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:32.660]  university of texas said there really are people who want to
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:36.100]  eliminate most of the world's population i know you
[1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:39.860]  use the quotation uh from mizak who stole
[1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:46.900]  about the necessity of eliminating 350 000 people a day and we actually
[1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.660]  have copies of the unesco courier in 1991 where
[1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:53.860]  is that quote comes from we make that available to
[1:27:53.860 --> 1:27:57.300]  anybody who wants to contact us people have to actually
[1:27:57.300 --> 1:28:01.140]  get this material and hold it their hands to realize
[1:28:01.140 --> 1:28:05.060]  what we're really up against well let's get on to the water fluoridation
[1:28:05.060 --> 1:28:08.580]  because it's certainly one of the most diabolical things ever conceived
[1:28:08.580 --> 1:28:12.980]  sure and dr you're very very soft spoken speak up a bit for us but go ahead
[1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:19.220]  all right well i was just i was talking about water fluoridation
[1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:22.660]  because water fluoridation is one of the most diabolical things they
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:26.580]  ever come up with and the idea that if you look at the
[1:28:26.580 --> 1:28:32.260]  statistics that this actually helps children's teeth is a frank lie in fact
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:37.060]  after 50 years and this was basically introduced back about 1950
[1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:42.100]  after almost 50 years the american dental association came out and admitted
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:44.980]  that there really wasn't an awful lot of difference between
[1:28:44.980 --> 1:28:49.620]  communities where the children had you know water fluoridation where they
[1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:52.580]  didn't have water stop right there we're about to break we're gonna have time to
[1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:55.540]  get into that but i want to stop you my dad is a dentist
[1:28:55.540 --> 1:28:59.220]  he wasn't convinced of this a decade ago he actually looked at it was shocked
[1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:03.300]  just like the head dentist in canada who got the country to fluoridate
[1:29:03.300 --> 1:29:06.660]  now admits that he didn't know that it was fluoride with toxic
[1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:09.860]  waste mix in but but but there was one difference
[1:29:09.860 --> 1:29:12.660]  it actually was worse for the teeth in the federal studies
[1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:15.700]  which you're about to cover i just want to back you up because it gives them
[1:29:15.700 --> 1:29:20.100]  dental fluorosis and causes the teeth to be brittle go ahead
[1:29:20.100 --> 1:29:22.980]  well that's exactly what it's all about all about and
[1:29:22.980 --> 1:29:26.660]  actually we have a a syllabus it's called the hidden
[1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:30.740]  agenda where we actually show you the the government
[1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:35.860]  studies on this and the tdc you know has actually come out and said that
[1:29:35.860 --> 1:29:39.860]  ingestion of the fluoride fluoridated water does do any good
[1:29:39.860 --> 1:29:44.740]  the fluoride acts locally and first what it does it kills the bacteria stay
[1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:47.780]  there stay there doctor we'll be back long segment coming up we'll detail it
[1:29:47.780 --> 1:29:51.620]  all
[1:29:51.620 --> 1:29:55.460]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:55.460 --> 1:30:00.260]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.460 --> 1:30:05.700]  a day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist
[1:30:05.700 --> 1:30:10.900]  act of war against this country the enemy struck america on september 11th
[1:30:10.900 --> 1:30:14.340]  but who is the enemy bin laden this is his ammo
[1:30:14.340 --> 1:30:17.620]  we have to look to the middle east we have to look to his home of bin laden
[1:30:17.620 --> 1:30:21.380]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:24.740]  ties to intelligence networks inside the united states
[1:30:24.740 --> 1:30:28.740]  some u.s investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged
[1:30:28.740 --> 1:30:33.460]  in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli
[1:30:33.460 --> 1:30:37.140]  citizens have been detained and laden's connections to the cia

[1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:51.940]  order of death dvd combo two films on one dvd
[1:35:51.940 --> 1:35:55.780]  you can get my films as low as 595 a piece i just want to move them out the
[1:35:55.780 --> 1:36:00.020]  door check out the specials our goal is simply to educate
[1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:02.820]  people and wake them up because we have no future
[1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:06.180]  if we don't turn things around and face the full heart
[1:36:06.180 --> 1:36:09.380]  and that's one thing the new order has going for it is the sheer
[1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:15.060]  scientifically coordinated magnitude and the dedication of the enemy
[1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:18.340]  and the fact that it's so horrible the average person
[1:36:18.340 --> 1:36:23.380]  comes into contact with something as jager hoover said a conspiracy so
[1:36:23.380 --> 1:36:27.780]  monstrous that they just can't comprehend it
[1:36:27.780 --> 1:36:32.340]  well dr monteev is telling you is not his opinion in fact he's very
[1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:36.580]  the word is a neurotic but i'm pretty neurotic about documenting he's even
[1:36:36.580 --> 1:36:40.660]  more stringent in fact when i'm on his show he has the same thing i do he'll
[1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:42.980]  go let me just stop you and read that document
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:45.860]  and i don't know how he ever has it all his fingertips
[1:36:45.860 --> 1:36:48.980]  but the bottom line is you to get our books get our videos get our films get
[1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:52.900]  them at info wars dot com or prism planet dot tv membership burn copies of
[1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:57.140]  films to desk at prism planet dot tv that's having an effect that's turning
[1:36:57.140 --> 1:36:59.860]  the tide we're not going to win this thing
[1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:03.700]  a if we don't ask god for guidance but b the other half the equation
[1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:07.220]  is trust in god but tie up your camel the old better one saying
[1:37:07.220 --> 1:37:12.500]  it is up to you to take action and we are having an effect people are
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:15.220]  awakening like never before dr monteev want to get into
[1:37:15.220 --> 1:37:19.300]  fluoride into tail now but first a have you ever seen such an awakening
[1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:24.900]  happening so fast b b um
[1:37:24.900 --> 1:37:28.100]  you know comment on the fact that it's so monstrous
[1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:32.260]  the average person has trouble getting their mind around it go ahead
[1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:35.060]  well i've been at this for forty six years now
[1:37:35.060 --> 1:37:37.860]  and i'm more encouraged than i've ever been before because
[1:37:37.860 --> 1:37:42.580]  there really is an awakening and then the process the economy contracts as the
[1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:46.820]  expand the police pay state powers here in the united states as we
[1:37:46.820 --> 1:37:49.940]  i get into a war over the middle east and i don't know
[1:37:49.940 --> 1:37:53.220]  uh... what is going to come but there's no question at all
[1:37:53.220 --> 1:37:56.660]  other planning on getting into a war with the boss the world because we've
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.420]  been actually sending the technology to pakistan so they could
[1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:03.540]  develop the nuclear weapons and give it to them all of them
[1:38:03.540 --> 1:38:08.180]  allies and we're looking at a nuclear war when these things begin to come to
[1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:10.500]  pass people going to say how did it happen
[1:38:10.500 --> 1:38:14.100]  and they're going to remember what they heard you say and
[1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:17.300]  and what they heard the other people in alternative media say
[1:38:17.300 --> 1:38:21.060]  and they got to begin to realize the true nature of the evil
[1:38:21.060 --> 1:38:23.460]  that is seized control of our government so
[1:38:23.460 --> 1:38:27.140]  don't despair out there in the listing audience be encouraged
[1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:29.860]  things are going to get a lot worse before they get better
[1:38:29.860 --> 1:38:33.460]  but when things get worse people are going to begin asking why
[1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:36.580]  and here i hope alex is going to be there to give you the answer
[1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:40.820]  well i forget who said it uh... but adversity i think was a roman
[1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:45.940]  philosopher was it sissera uh... adversity
[1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:50.820]  and tribulation makes men plenty makes monsters
[1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:56.420]  and that's just a fact i had no question at all i think it's absolutely true
[1:38:56.420 --> 1:38:59.300]  affluence is a great curse of this nation
[1:38:59.300 --> 1:39:02.660]  we have it's a good we don't think we could ever have it bad and
[1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:06.260]  uh... only one thing to get bad are people going to be able to look for the
[1:39:06.260 --> 1:39:11.940]  cause absolutely okay uh...
[1:39:11.940 --> 1:39:16.420]  getting into fluoride continuum well fluoride basically
[1:39:16.420 --> 1:39:19.540]  uh... was sold to the american people because we're going to
[1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:23.460]  help children from getting cavities in their teeth and who could be in favor of
[1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:27.140]  that and they sold this line of the dentist they sold this
[1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:30.740]  to the american people they've sold it to communities across the country
[1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:34.660]  right now about sixty eight percent of our communities are fluoridated
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:39.060]  and ninety five percent ninety percent of those ninety ninety five percent
[1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.900]  of the communities that fluoridate their water don't simply put in sodium
[1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:47.460]  fluoride they had that had hydrofluosalic acid which contains
[1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:51.380]  fluoride and lead and arsenic and polonium
[1:39:51.380 --> 1:39:55.300]  220 why would you put that into the water
[1:39:55.300 --> 1:39:58.340]  it is so well the reason is of course it's so toxic
[1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:03.700]  you can't put it into the river is it to be illegally you can't dump it in the ocean
[1:40:03.700 --> 1:40:07.300]  so what they're doing is they're putting it on drinking water now this is i want
[1:40:07.300 --> 1:40:09.860]  to stop you i want to stop you the magnitude
[1:40:09.860 --> 1:40:12.500]  and for those that don't believe me there's cops laughing right now they
[1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:15.540]  think it's because of their minds they got rod holes in it
[1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:20.260]  there's yuppie's laughing ha ha ha you know this guy in the medical doctor
[1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:23.620]  yes he is this isn't true i've had former epa
[1:40:23.620 --> 1:40:28.180]  had poison you know experts doctors on you know top
[1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:31.380]  you know on saying yes it's true they even though they worked there they
[1:40:31.380 --> 1:40:34.820]  never believed it till they looked they would put someone in prison for putting
[1:40:34.820 --> 1:40:37.620]  this in the same amount in a river but the government
[1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:41.140]  does it in the drinking supplies tell them the names again
[1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:44.740]  so they can write them down your lives depend on this
[1:40:44.740 --> 1:40:49.060]  take the smile off your face write it down check it out go ahead
[1:40:49.060 --> 1:40:53.700]  well it's called hydrofluosalistic acid and it has chloride about 50 percent
[1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:57.860]  chloride it has lead arsenic and polonium 220 in it
[1:40:57.860 --> 1:41:02.500]  and for those who really want to get the information you go to the website of the
[1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.580]  the doctors who work for the epa this scientist the
[1:41:06.580 --> 1:41:10.740]  of the engineers who work for the epa they have a website it
[1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:16.740]  n t e u 280 dot org that's national transportation
[1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:22.180]  uh employees union n t e u 280 dot org go to their website
[1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:26.260]  they're trying to get the information out that the government is
[1:41:26.260 --> 1:41:29.540]  poisoning the american people that's right let me stop you again we always
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:33.460]  hear that if it was true the government did this or that people blow
[1:41:33.460 --> 1:41:37.060]  the whistle you couldn't hide it the majority of epa
[1:41:37.060 --> 1:41:40.980]  scientists and doctors have been screaming bloody murder for decades
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:44.820]  but the directive from the top says no so their own union
[1:41:44.820 --> 1:41:48.420]  we've had the head on here as a toxicologist
[1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:51.780]  this is all a fact you don't think they're not freaked out
[1:41:51.780 --> 1:41:56.180]  they got children too go ahead doctor well it's n t
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:42:01.220]  e u 280 dot org go to that website and then occurs there's chloride alert dot
[1:42:01.220 --> 1:42:05.060]  org that's chloride alert dot org i'll put up by a
[1:42:05.060 --> 1:42:09.700]  a professor of chemistry paul connet we've had on many times and
[1:42:09.700 --> 1:42:13.460]  yeah all you need to do is read the scientific studies they're readily
[1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:17.540]  available we have them in a syllabus we put out called the hidden agenda
[1:42:17.540 --> 1:42:21.140]  from the journal for it they gave us permission just to go ahead and print
[1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:24.420]  the abstract and we wonder why so many men have a
[1:42:24.420 --> 1:42:29.300]  rectile dysfunction why because of course the fluoride in the water decreases
[1:42:29.300 --> 1:42:33.140]  of the the um uh the the testosterone levels
[1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:37.060]  and it decreases the sperm count and it makes women
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:41.940]  have difficulty getting pregnant and the pregnancy rates are down considerably
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:46.020]  in areas and when the female hormones go down then they're not
[1:42:46.020 --> 1:42:50.980]  sexually energized then the the man and the woman
[1:42:50.980 --> 1:42:54.900]  the marriage has failed i mean we're not we're supposed to be filled with
[1:42:54.900 --> 1:42:58.980]  energy folks not just the the zombieing around
[1:42:58.980 --> 1:43:02.900]  and the information is there i mean certainly if we give you the
[1:43:02.900 --> 1:43:06.900]  all the abstracts from the journal fluoride in our syllabus called
[1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:10.980]  hidden agenda people must understand they're poisoning us so let's start at
[1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:15.220]  the very beginning of water fluoridation decreases
[1:43:15.220 --> 1:43:19.460]  fertility by attacking the woman's hormonal status
[1:43:19.460 --> 1:43:23.300]  by lowering the testosterone in the man by
[1:43:23.300 --> 1:43:28.020]  actually lowering the the sperm count it meant that they know these things these
[1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:32.100]  are scientifically determined from the journal fluoride and first all the
[1:43:32.100 --> 1:43:36.660]  references are in my syllabus and then of course it lowers
[1:43:36.660 --> 1:43:41.780]  intelligence it lowers intelligence somewhere between five and ten
[1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:46.260]  degrees on the IQ and of course if you've got a child with an IQ of 170
[1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:49.220]  and you're lower to 160 nobody's ever know
[1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:53.620]  what happened if you have a child with an IQ of 80 and you're lower to 70
[1:43:53.620 --> 1:43:56.820]  and of course there's been extensive studies on this in china and other
[1:43:56.820 --> 1:44:01.700]  countries fluoride lowers intelligence and of course that's one reason
[1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:09.460]  why the nazis put this into the into the water supply in the occupied areas of
[1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:13.380]  during the second world war and why the communists added fluoride to the water
[1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:17.220]  in the gulag because of course they wanted to lower the intelligence
[1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:21.140]  and lower the aggressiveness of people and their their willingness to respond
[1:44:21.140 --> 1:44:24.340]  and they so it became so like zombies they were
[1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:28.900]  unconcerned about what's going on and then of course fluoride increases the
[1:44:28.900 --> 1:44:32.900]  incidence of cancer studies that definitely show
[1:44:32.900 --> 1:44:36.100]  that it increases the incidence of osteogenics
[1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:41.140]  sarcoma especially in boys isn't it the right the bone cancer why
[1:44:41.140 --> 1:44:44.900]  why do so many things like mercury and fluoride and things attack men
[1:44:44.900 --> 1:44:48.340]  worse than women other medical doctors have told me it's just the bottom line
[1:44:48.340 --> 1:44:52.180]  thing they've known for thousands of years women are more hardy on average and
[1:44:52.180 --> 1:44:55.540]  have stronger toxicity load capacities blood
[1:44:55.540 --> 1:45:00.180]  brain barriers associated with our engineering
[1:45:00.180 --> 1:45:03.780]  by the creator because women have to go through childbirth
[1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:06.820]  i think that's it i think god designed women
[1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:11.380]  actually to be able to resist disease longer than men you know they
[1:45:11.380 --> 1:45:15.380]  live five or six years on average it's longer than men do
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:19.300]  and part of it is because of course they lose iron every month they're much
[1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:22.820]  healthier because they lose iron when you have too much iron in your system
[1:45:22.820 --> 1:45:26.980]  while you become more susceptible to both cancer and infections and
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:30.660]  i god designed it protects women but because they have a monthly period
[1:45:30.660 --> 1:45:34.180]  and they lose iron and other toxins at that time
[1:45:34.180 --> 1:45:38.820]  so and this is why of course many you know two or three centuries ago
[1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.700]  men used to get blood because pardon me they were
[1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:45.540]  bled uh they would actually go to the barber shop remember those barber
[1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:48.900]  poles with the red and white on them because the barbers were the bleeders
[1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:52.260]  and by the way they're bringing leeches and bleeding back
[1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:56.340]  yeah in in in uh of course your medical doctor but that's in the major journals
[1:45:56.340 --> 1:45:58.980]  they're now finding there's something to being bled
[1:45:58.980 --> 1:46:03.700]  there absolutely is the iron is what gets us into all sorts of problems and we
[1:46:03.700 --> 1:46:08.580]  got too much iron and predisposes both diseases infections
[1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:12.820]  and of course the cancer but let's get back to the fluoride of course
[1:46:12.820 --> 1:46:16.980]  uh... in in uh... there was dr deenberg i talked to him before he died he was
[1:46:16.980 --> 1:46:21.460]  chief of of the chemotherapy at the national cancer institute
[1:46:21.460 --> 1:46:24.580]  he was there for thirty years during research
[1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:28.580]  and in the studies they did comparing communities with fluoridated water and
[1:46:28.580 --> 1:46:32.660]  those with non fluoridated water while there is about 40 percent more
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:35.300]  cancer in the areas where they had fluoridated water
[1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:38.580]  than the areas we had un fluoridated water and
[1:46:38.580 --> 1:46:42.260]  you know because if you look at what's happened to the incident of cancer
[1:46:42.260 --> 1:46:46.180]  back at the beginning of the last century in the early 1900
[1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:50.260]  why of course the one in 33 people got cancer
[1:46:50.260 --> 1:46:53.780]  today one in two men one in three women get cancer
[1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:57.620]  then of course it's much more than water fluoridation the vaccines is the
[1:46:57.620 --> 1:47:02.820]  fluoride it's the it is the mercury is the aspartame it's so many of the
[1:47:02.820 --> 1:47:06.340]  other products that we are given that they know are
[1:47:06.340 --> 1:47:10.900]  are decreased immunity and because when they lower our immune response we
[1:47:10.900 --> 1:47:14.180]  become much more susceptible to cancer and let's be clear though going back to
[1:47:14.180 --> 1:47:18.260]  fluoride before we move on it is in one famous
[1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:21.060]  pulled surprise winning book on world war two the soviets
[1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:26.180]  and the germans did it they knew of course with mercury with fluoride
[1:47:26.180 --> 1:47:30.020]  because they had so many spills of it in the industrial revolution
[1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:34.020]  it had been heavily studied and these are in all the documents so they knew
[1:47:34.020 --> 1:47:37.060]  what these were doing they knew that even if you don't drink water with
[1:47:37.060 --> 1:47:40.500]  fluoride if it's sprayed on crops it goes through the skin
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:44.580]  gets into the cell walls of the plant
[1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:48.660]  they know that when you wash in it it absorbs to the skin
[1:47:48.660 --> 1:47:52.020]  and they brag this is the ultimate chemical weapon
[1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:57.780]  because the particles are so small that most filters most systems cannot stop
[1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:00.260]  it so even if you're drinking filtered water
[1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:04.660]  that doesn't have it in it you are still getting it it is just so
[1:48:04.660 --> 1:48:09.140]  diabolical and understand it is a fact they put it in there
[1:48:09.140 --> 1:48:13.540]  that's why iqs have dropped in the us that's why all these diseases have gone
[1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:17.060]  up as dr monty was saying i just don't want to
[1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:23.300]  glaze over earth shaking information he is giving you and look you can hate me
[1:48:23.300 --> 1:48:26.420]  police you can hate me military and most military actually loves me
[1:48:26.420 --> 1:48:30.340]  you can hate me but i love you even though i get mad at you i'm telling you
[1:48:30.340 --> 1:48:33.700]  this is real you owe it to yourself and your family
[1:48:33.700 --> 1:48:37.860]  to not believe me but to check it out and you're going to find out
[1:48:37.860 --> 1:48:41.860]  it's all true and worse than we could even describe i mean dr monty we have so
[1:48:41.860 --> 1:48:44.420]  much knowledge on this subject because we eat drink and sleep this
[1:48:44.420 --> 1:48:48.100]  you for 40 something years made for 15 on air 13
[1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:52.260]  that that the frustration they hear in the energy is
[1:48:52.260 --> 1:48:55.700]  because we're not giving them one tenth we can't there's too much do you agree
[1:48:55.700 --> 1:48:58.980]  with that statement i agree with you totally mean that the
[1:48:58.980 --> 1:49:03.700]  story is so fantastic you know i sometimes i find it hard to
[1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:07.780]  believe in you i know it's true because you know we have a scientific study to
[1:49:07.780 --> 1:49:11.060]  go into the background certainly what they've done
[1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:15.940]  with iodine i mean we used to have all of our salt was iodized to protect us
[1:49:15.940 --> 1:49:19.140]  and protect our thyroid well they've taken the iodine about
[1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:23.060]  out of about half the salt they used to be in our breath used to be
[1:49:23.060 --> 1:49:27.700]  in our mouth they've taken it out there and so if you and most people are the
[1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:31.780]  patient in iodine now why is what does that have to do with the fluoride well
[1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:35.700]  very simply because when you fluoridate the water and we should
[1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:38.900]  never be taking fluoride there's no safe level of fluoride
[1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:43.700]  now the fluoride competes with the iodine to get it into the um into the
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:47.700]  thyroid gland and this is one reason why many people are having thyroid
[1:49:47.700 --> 1:49:50.900]  problems calcification it attacks all the glands
[1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:54.740]  right and then specifically the thyroid and because most people are
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:58.340]  deficient in iodine then the the fluoride gets in there and of course
[1:49:58.340 --> 1:50:03.060]  destroys the function of thyroid and we have literally tens of millions of
[1:50:03.060 --> 1:50:07.460]  americans who are hypothyroid here in the united states now let's be clear
[1:50:07.460 --> 1:50:11.540]  the iodine was in your medical doctor correct me wrong resides in high
[1:50:11.540 --> 1:50:14.900]  concentrations naturally in the thyroid involved in its
[1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:19.620]  in its metabolic relay and system and then regulating the rest of the
[1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:24.420]  hormones or large sections of the different
[1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:28.260]  endocrine system if that's correct and so then what happens is
[1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:33.220]  they on purpose take the iodine out knowing it was blocking
[1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:38.500]  their movement to insert the fluoride so there you have them caught red-handed
[1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:42.820]  again is that correct absolutely and the thing is most people don't understand
[1:50:42.820 --> 1:50:46.340]  that most americans are deficient in iodine
[1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:49.940]  here's the fluoride they're putting into our water more abilities to attack
[1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:54.820]  us as a thyroid gland and produce illness and hypothyroidism
[1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:57.540]  all right stay there sir stay there we're going to come back and more into this

[1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:40.020]  i didn't have any inside sources i just knew what would be
[1:54:40.020 --> 1:54:44.660]  a press conference with other third party candidates
[1:54:44.660 --> 1:54:47.620]  saying he wants to throw the ron paul revolution
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.780]  behind the libertarian party behind the constitution party
[1:54:51.780 --> 1:54:55.300]  and bob bar snubbed him and didn't show up
[1:54:55.300 --> 1:54:59.140]  bob bar man a lot of you are getting sucker punched by him that guy is not
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:02.500]  trustworthy nra board member gun grabber
[1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:05.700]  people want to wait i thought he's pro in our pro gun
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:09.380]  nra is a gun control group meant to pacify gun owners
[1:55:09.380 --> 1:55:15.060]  i've just had it with bar mr cia so uh we told you here first what the big
[1:55:15.060 --> 1:55:19.620]  announcement was there it was uh going back to dr stan monteef radio liberty
[1:55:19.620 --> 1:55:22.500]  dot com great radio broadcaster in his own right
[1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:26.260]  documentary filmmaker author will tell you how to get his book the brotherhood
[1:55:26.260 --> 1:55:30.100]  of darkness before he leaves us today okay continuing
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:34.340]  uh with the discussion i want to just throw a preemption out here
[1:55:34.340 --> 1:55:38.820]  because folks i know how you've been precondition
[1:55:39.780 --> 1:55:44.180]  when we talk about going from one in 33 with cancer to one in two
[1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:47.540]  that's official government numbers or we talk about
[1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:52.420]  uh how they're poisoning us and killing us by design for population control and
[1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:56.100]  so they don't have to pay out social security people say but we live longer
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:56:00.180]  we live longer women live to 77 and women and men live to
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:04.660]  75 you've ever been to an old cemetery but i pulled the actual numbers and
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:07.300]  seen the statistics on this you've ever been to an old cemetery
[1:56:07.300 --> 1:56:10.900]  we got a family cemetery in east texas about half of them in there under the
[1:56:10.900 --> 1:56:15.860]  age of five half the graves in there are children
[1:56:15.860 --> 1:56:19.220]  because if you made it past 10 had your immune system
[1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:23.780]  uh beat all those bugs you were tough stuff and then you'd see everybody living
[1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:27.860]  to 75 80 90 100
[1:56:27.860 --> 1:56:31.700]  i had a great grandmother lived to be a 103
[1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:35.140]  my wife's great grandfather was the guy on johnny karson
[1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:40.020]  the kansas farmer uh he lived i think 109
[1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:43.700]  the point is there were lots of 100 year olds just everywhere
[1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:46.900]  now dr vonteve of course knows those statistics as well so see
[1:56:46.900 --> 1:56:51.060]  they average the fact that there was high infant mortality
[1:56:51.060 --> 1:56:55.060]  and high levels of children dying into the larger number
[1:56:55.060 --> 1:56:58.500]  to claim people only live to be you know 65 or 60
[1:56:58.500 --> 1:57:02.100]  or in the time of the founding fathers infant mortality was more like 50
[1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:04.980]  percent you know by the time they hit three so they say oh people only live
[1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:09.940]  to be 40 well no the average was about 81
[1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:14.420]  and i've seen the studies on this in the 1770 1780s and 90s
[1:57:14.420 --> 1:57:18.580]  if you made it past 10 correct dr monteef
[1:57:18.580 --> 1:57:23.060]  well certainly we've uh uh you absolutely we have a much lower
[1:57:23.060 --> 1:57:26.020]  infant mortality now our children are living
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:29.140]  and christ now we have antibiotics and certainly
[1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:33.620]  many many things have done it along the longevity of our people
[1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:36.820]  about of course if you look at the world statistics
[1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:40.580]  america is about 40th as far as longevity is concerned
[1:57:40.580 --> 1:57:44.100]  and the average america has never heard that people in other countries like
[1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:47.060]  japan live a lot i shouldn't say a lot longer but
[1:57:47.060 --> 1:57:50.100]  70 years longer than they live here in the united states
[1:57:50.100 --> 1:57:55.220]  and many other countries have a higher longevity than we do in the united
[1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:58.340]  states and it partly is because we have so many people
[1:57:58.340 --> 1:58:01.780]  dying of cancer and they're dying unnecessarily because of the
[1:58:01.780 --> 1:58:06.340]  things that they're doing to us but it's all about population control in fact
[1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:10.020]  we have a wonderful four tape set it's an interview
[1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:13.540]  over the doctor dunnigan who back in 1969
[1:58:13.540 --> 1:58:17.300]  heard doctor richard dame who's subsequently gone to
[1:58:17.300 --> 1:58:22.660]  his unjust reward but at that time he was a medical director of plan parenthood
[1:58:22.660 --> 1:58:26.500]  who talked to a group of doctors in 1969 saying look
[1:58:26.500 --> 1:58:29.540]  there's too many people in the world they're going to have to die of something
[1:58:29.540 --> 1:58:32.980]  or kind of withhold the treatments for cancer we're going to create new diseases
[1:58:32.980 --> 1:58:36.900]  stay there i want to talk about holding back treatments for cancer
[1:58:36.900 --> 1:58:46.980]  with doctor stan monty thank you for listening to gcn

[2:00:19.620 --> 2:00:23.940]  austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.940 --> 2:00:28.500]  dr monty was working up the global population reduction agenda
[2:00:28.500 --> 2:00:31.220]  you had any major scientific conference were at least
[2:00:31.220 --> 2:00:35.700]  Peter Singer Bianca others are speaking they'll say we need to exterminate 90
[2:00:35.700 --> 2:00:42.020]  percent and then get standing ovations that is the majority
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:47.460]  view that is what the elite believes that is it is common sense to them
[2:00:47.460 --> 2:00:50.420]  and you'll have people on the street you know the company and go yeah i've heard
[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:53.860]  you talk about reducing the numbers but we have to for the earth
[2:00:53.860 --> 2:00:57.460]  and i'm like okay well you go jump off a cliff first and they're also suppressing
[2:00:57.460 --> 2:01:01.220]  a lot of treatments that you could call cures
[2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:04.980]  but certainly they are suppressing a lot of things that they know really work
[2:01:04.980 --> 2:01:06.420]  dr monty
[2:01:06.420 --> 2:01:10.580]  absolutely and they they have treatments for cancer they have many other
[2:01:10.580 --> 2:01:13.700]  countries you can go you can't get them here in this country
[2:01:13.700 --> 2:01:18.180]  but they're doing so many things to listen the way of poisoning is them
[2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:22.740]  decreasing our immune response and that's why the cancer is exploding in this
[2:01:22.740 --> 2:01:26.660]  country and they know exactly what they're doing but they cannot let the
[2:01:26.660 --> 2:01:30.980]  american people know and the average person says nothing could be that evil
[2:01:30.980 --> 2:01:36.020]  again unfortunately it is anybody can get our poor tape set on the new order
[2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:39.540]  the barbarians and it will simply blow your mind
[2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:43.780]  it's one of the most powerful us poor tape sets we have so vitally
[2:01:43.780 --> 2:01:46.420]  important people understand that they this
[2:01:46.420 --> 2:01:49.780]  dr davis talked about how they're going to create new diseases
[2:01:49.780 --> 2:01:53.620]  and with whole treatments for cancer because people are going to have to die
[2:01:53.620 --> 2:01:58.660]  of something and there really are people out there who feel exactly that way
[2:01:58.660 --> 2:02:03.060]  they are just totally evil
[2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:06.820]  please continue dr monty for the overarching plan
[2:02:06.820 --> 2:02:10.420]  of population reduction well we were we were talking about
[2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:13.380]  water fluoridation let's just finish that up because i think it's so vitally
[2:02:13.380 --> 2:02:17.540]  important first of all scientific studies show that in areas where
[2:02:17.540 --> 2:02:21.460]  where you fluoridate the water at the incidence of hip fractures
[2:02:21.460 --> 2:02:25.700]  in and post-menopausal women almost doubled in other words
[2:02:25.700 --> 2:02:30.580]  there's twice as many women who you know are post-menopausal or fracture the
[2:02:30.580 --> 2:02:34.020]  hips is in comparable areas where they don't chlorinate the water
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:38.020]  and of course many times after women have fractured hips they'll die
[2:02:38.020 --> 2:02:42.180]  but if you believe in population control how can you object to that
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:45.380]  they know these things and they're allowing them to happen
[2:02:45.380 --> 2:02:49.700]  in the original studies that we've done on the on them
[2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:53.460]  comparing two communities one with fluoridated water and the other without
[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:57.860]  fluoridated water that the one thing they did notice at that time
[2:02:57.860 --> 2:03:02.340]  was the girl started menstruating about six months earlier now this was only a
[2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:06.260]  five-year study of course this time has gone by i'm sure that we
[2:03:06.260 --> 2:03:10.740]  know today that girls are getting their secondary sexual
[2:03:10.740 --> 2:03:13.540]  characteristics and they're getting them you know as
[2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:18.180]  ever younger ages now you've got girls six and seven years of age
[2:03:18.180 --> 2:03:22.260]  getting developed breast and and to menstruate
[2:03:22.260 --> 2:03:25.940]  and this is because the disruption of their endocrine function
[2:03:25.940 --> 2:03:29.860]  and much of this is related to water fluoridation and then you slap on top
[2:03:29.860 --> 2:03:33.860]  of that all of the hormones and the chicken the pork the beef
[2:03:33.860 --> 2:03:36.660]  and one of the doctors say when they bring three-year-olds now about the
[2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:39.940]  thousands in the u.s. coming who are menstruating going into
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:43.460]  puberty at three years of age now wonder they get breast cancer when
[2:03:43.460 --> 2:03:46.020]  they're 20 and everything's been accelerated they're basically on
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:49.700]  steroids they then come in and say oh we want to give you
[2:03:49.700 --> 2:03:53.620]  hormone injections to suppress that then they basically burn out their entire
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:56.660]  endocrine system and get like cushing's disorder
[2:03:56.660 --> 2:04:00.900]  well we've got so many problems that are actually created in this country another
[2:04:00.900 --> 2:04:05.380]  another thing that's related to the water fluoridation is heart disease and
[2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:08.900]  we we have a book that deals with water
[2:04:08.900 --> 2:04:11.540]  fluoridation that we carry through radio liberty
[2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:14.980]  and they noticed in the original studies that there was almost
[2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:19.140]  twice as much heart disease in the areas where they flooded the waters where they
[2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:22.260]  didn't and you can't help but ask yourself
[2:04:22.260 --> 2:04:25.460]  why is it there was a recent study that was done comparing
[2:04:25.460 --> 2:04:29.620]  heart disease and in englishmen and americans comparable ages
[2:04:29.620 --> 2:04:35.220]  i think 50 to 55 or 50 to 60 and they had twice as much heart disease in the
[2:04:35.220 --> 2:04:40.100]  united states as they had over in england and that had nothing to do with
[2:04:40.100 --> 2:04:44.340]  drinking or diet or anything else just much more heart disease in this country
[2:04:44.340 --> 2:04:48.500]  stay there stay there with with antibiotics with with drugs
[2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:52.900]  with surgery we would have all be living to 150 folks but they bring in
[2:04:52.900 --> 2:04:57.220]  all this other garbage to poison us totally fries our entire system
[2:04:57.220 --> 2:05:01.300]  we'll be right back with Dr. Stan Monti

[2:08:46.340 --> 2:08:49.380]  millions of people the amount of folks that i'm
[2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:52.900]  reaching and my guests are reaching and because of you the listeners spreading
[2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:55.140]  the word on the internet name and fm dial
[2:08:55.140 --> 2:09:00.260]  and by passing my films along is exponential and i'm not afraid to die
[2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:03.540]  i'm not afraid to be set up i'm not afraid to be killed i've been physically
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:06.020]  attacked before i've had all sorts of dirty tricks
[2:09:06.020 --> 2:09:08.420]  played on me we've been getting death threats again
[2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:11.300]  since bilderberg
[2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:17.620]  but i'm also seeing national media attack me and demonize me and go after me
[2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:20.900]  but i'm also seeing massive attacks on the web
[2:09:20.900 --> 2:09:25.860]  by individuals whose youtube accounts myspace accounts other accounts they
[2:09:25.860 --> 2:09:28.580]  don't even hide that they work for army intelligence
[2:09:28.580 --> 2:09:32.180]  psychological warfare sent com private corporations
[2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:35.940]  homeland security sponsored blogs this is right out in the open they think you're
[2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:38.580]  too stupid to see that there's but their sites have
[2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:44.340]  homeland security banners on them and that they're actually paid
[2:09:44.340 --> 2:09:47.620]  but i see things like this youtube video somebody sent it to me and says
[2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:51.940]  why are you attacking sarah palin for saying that dinosaurs are the lizards of
[2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:55.300]  satan i never said that i never said she said the
[2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:59.540]  world was 4 000 years old i'm not attacking christians
[2:09:59.540 --> 2:10:03.700]  that's made up and so they put out these videos you know alex
[2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:07.220]  jones lies about sarah palin and then you go to the video and it's a
[2:10:07.220 --> 2:10:11.380]  CNN piece i'm not in it my websites aren't in it
[2:10:11.380 --> 2:10:14.740]  and they've got people on there saying it was just a joke that i said
[2:10:14.740 --> 2:10:19.780]  she thought lizards were satanic and it's not even me his name's not alex
[2:10:19.780 --> 2:10:25.620]  jones but see they count on you in propaganda
[2:10:25.620 --> 2:10:30.900]  on it being very low level we give you names documents prove
[2:10:30.900 --> 2:10:33.700]  you know scientific reports government reports
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:37.700]  we ask you to write it down and check what we're saying do not believe us
[2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:40.900]  and then meanwhile i'm just telling you this is how it starts
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:43.700]  um
[2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:47.780]  there'll be an evangelical you can call it that but that's what he's known as
[2:10:47.780 --> 2:10:52.180]  black catholic he goes out in evangelizes but he's
[2:10:52.180 --> 2:10:55.860]  former evangelist so it's that style for catholics
[2:10:55.860 --> 2:10:58.900]  and then they start saying on the web that i'm this catholic i'm not even
[2:10:58.900 --> 2:11:01.300]  bashing catholics are saying catholics are bad my point is
[2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:04.900]  and i get threatening emails five years ago saying how dare you you know give
[2:11:04.900 --> 2:11:08.900]  this speech and they have the text of it calling people to be catholics and i'm
[2:11:08.900 --> 2:11:11.860]  i don't email them back so i don't have time to email people back and i was
[2:11:11.860 --> 2:11:15.540]  getting hundreds of emails at probably thousands then i was about five years
[2:11:15.540 --> 2:11:18.180]  ago i get tens of thousands a day now we try to read it all
[2:11:18.180 --> 2:11:23.780]  that's a job in of itself and so i um i don't respond then it's you will now
[2:11:23.780 --> 2:11:27.780]  be exposed or there's sites exposing me for
[2:11:27.780 --> 2:11:32.580]  being an mpr reporter leading a double life running a
[2:11:32.580 --> 2:11:36.820]  Rockefeller funded a shorin scene center he the guy's almost 70 years old
[2:11:36.820 --> 2:11:40.340]  alex s jones that ain't me i mean it's like i got a name
[2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:44.420]  like david jones or john smith not my fault
[2:11:44.420 --> 2:11:48.740]  let's see the people putting that out know that i've now discovered
[2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:52.660]  they know that and they cynically
[2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:56.500]  there is a pr director for Scientology called alex jones
[2:11:56.500 --> 2:12:01.780]  and it's all over the web that i am a pr director for Scientology
[2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:07.540]  uh... that couple with the fact that i have a website called prisonplanet.com
[2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:10.580]  total proof because l ron hubbard talked about a prison planet
[2:12:10.580 --> 2:12:14.340]  he actually ripped it off from frank herbert that's where i got it i
[2:12:14.340 --> 2:12:16.660]  did not read any of l ron hubbard's books but
[2:12:16.660 --> 2:12:21.540]  you know the point is is that uh... and i guess that people written about prison
[2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:24.580]  planets before that but i got it from from uh...
[2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:28.340]  frank herbert writings he wrote a bunch of books like the dosati experiment
[2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:32.820]  about a prison planet dune prison planet but i'm so i'm digressing we have
[2:12:32.820 --> 2:12:35.940]  dr monty from the line the point is
[2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:39.540]  he just ignores it and moves forward and monty is an icon in this move and has
[2:12:39.540 --> 2:12:42.660]  reached tens of millions of people probably one of the second or third
[2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:45.700]  largest shows out there probably the second he probably got the next biggest
[2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:48.660]  show and i just really respect him and i had to bring up
[2:12:48.660 --> 2:12:51.860]  things like that and get back into eugenics and what's happening
[2:12:51.860 --> 2:12:55.300]  but at the same time i have to tell my listeners
[2:12:55.300 --> 2:12:58.820]  you know you're hurting them you're spreading the word
[2:12:58.820 --> 2:13:01.780]  i am in great danger i'll just tell you that point blank
[2:13:01.780 --> 2:13:08.740]  but i stand with god in god's hands it's you know i'm in my destiny is
[2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:12.420]  whatever god's gonna happen you know have happened to me is gonna happen
[2:13:12.420 --> 2:13:16.820]  i'm just saying you also should appreciate dr monty myself and others
[2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:19.700]  and understand well i haven't asked him but i would imagine he's under an
[2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:23.140]  intense attack everybody else i know is who's really doing good
[2:13:23.140 --> 2:13:25.940]  uh... kind of a three or four minute rant there dr monty if you have any
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:28.980]  comments on it well you're being attacked because you're
[2:13:28.980 --> 2:13:32.100]  being effective and god bless you for what you're doing
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:36.100]  and you know if you were not being effective they wouldn't attack you
[2:13:36.100 --> 2:13:39.780]  so just be proud of what you're doing and and as you said
[2:13:39.780 --> 2:13:43.140]  we have to leave it up to god there's no way you can protect yourself
[2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:45.860]  there's no way i can protect myself and my family
[2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:50.180]  i've put my life in god's hands long ago and said it's up to you if you want me
[2:13:50.180 --> 2:13:53.940]  to do it protect me and i'm still here you're still here
[2:13:53.940 --> 2:13:57.860]  and with god's help we're going to continue doing what we're doing
[2:13:57.860 --> 2:14:01.540]  absolutely and you know i'm around globalist they're horrified of us they
[2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:04.900]  don't even laugh at us anymore they're horrified i mean if you notice they've
[2:14:04.900 --> 2:14:07.780]  gone from arrogance to now starting to realize
[2:14:07.780 --> 2:14:10.180]  that uh... there's an end to the road for them
[2:14:10.180 --> 2:14:13.860]  i think that all of them realize of course that this is a spiritual battle
[2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:16.740]  many of them know the god they serve it
[2:14:16.740 --> 2:14:20.020]  and they're wondering what's going to happen when they die
[2:14:20.020 --> 2:14:24.580]  and you know some of them you know actually have actually defected from the
[2:14:24.580 --> 2:14:27.060]  other side and and tried to tell the people what
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:30.660]  happened and usually they they're finished off in short order
[2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:34.100]  now you are bringing up a doctor on record saying we can't get people
[2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:37.060]  treatment they've got to die all these other eugenicists that
[2:14:37.060 --> 2:14:42.260]  i mean that the head of the ibm human genome project we'd already exposed this
[2:14:42.260 --> 2:14:45.140]  in endgame and then it came out like a month after
[2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:49.140]  endgame came out when he said blacks basically weren't humans dr
[2:14:49.140 --> 2:14:52.820]  watson not related to the founder of ibm dr watson but
[2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:56.500]  uh... he was the head geneticist there even when it was still
[2:14:56.500 --> 2:15:00.020]  the eugenics records office it's cold springs harbour
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:03.220]  and uh... i mean that's who they are that's what they're doing
[2:15:03.220 --> 2:15:06.740]  they have an intense hatred of blacks and of browns and
[2:15:06.740 --> 2:15:11.700]  you know they they they they want a white world population what happened to be
[2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:13.940]  white but i think what they're doing is criminal
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:18.100]  i believe every person black brown red yellow
[2:15:18.100 --> 2:15:20.740]  they're all made of the image and like this of god and
[2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:24.820]  and these people have to be exposed for what they really are there the
[2:15:24.820 --> 2:15:28.260]  ultimate in races and they've designed many of these
[2:15:28.260 --> 2:15:31.300]  disease specifically aids because it is
[2:15:31.300 --> 2:15:36.980]  genome specific it is for certain specific races this is why we have such
[2:15:36.980 --> 2:15:41.380]  a low incidence of of hiv in the general heterosexual
[2:15:41.380 --> 2:15:44.420]  population of the united states of the white population
[2:15:44.420 --> 2:15:49.060]  and such a high incidence in the black and the brown population here in the
[2:15:49.060 --> 2:15:51.460]  united states and what only has to go to the
[2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:54.980]  reports that come out from the centers of disease control you can call them
[2:15:54.980 --> 2:15:59.780]  those things are the the hiv report i get every year and of course
[2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:05.620]  almost not quite but almost half of the hiv cases in the united states are in
[2:16:05.620 --> 2:16:08.340]  blacks and certainly when you take the blacks and the
[2:16:08.340 --> 2:16:12.580]  Hispanics why it is the vast majority the whites are in a minority
[2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:16.180]  because this disease has the specific predilection for blacks
[2:16:16.180 --> 2:16:19.060]  this is why you can go into box one of the day
[2:16:19.060 --> 2:16:24.660]  and 46 percent of the pregnant women and they're all tested believe me
[2:16:24.660 --> 2:16:28.980]  the u.s public health service is working with the world health organization
[2:16:28.980 --> 2:16:31.940]  they're testing those women to see what a great job they're doing
[2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:37.300]  under the pregnant women in box one of 46 percent of hiv impact that they're
[2:16:37.300 --> 2:16:40.260]  all going to die anybody who wants the report we
[2:16:40.260 --> 2:16:43.780]  we get these reports from the u.s commerce department
[2:16:43.780 --> 2:16:48.660]  and your tax money is being used to determine what a great job we're doing
[2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:52.180]  with genuside in africa and we're doing a great job over there
[2:16:52.180 --> 2:16:55.860]  don't think for a minute we're not we're very accomplished in this sort of thing
[2:16:55.860 --> 2:17:01.460]  and it's being done with our tax money but the average american is never allowed
[2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:06.660]  to realize that in box one of the day 46 percent of the pregnant women
[2:17:06.660 --> 2:17:12.740]  and they test them all 46 percent of hiv infected
[2:17:12.740 --> 2:17:18.580]  amazing uh just in upon info wars dot net top story info wars dot net
[2:17:18.580 --> 2:17:22.740]  nadir calls for new 911 investigation independent presidential candidate says
[2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:26.340]  he supports 911 truth movement that it may be an inside job
[2:17:26.340 --> 2:17:30.260]  the reason that's so important is i talked to nadir a week and a half ago in
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:34.020]  denver on video that's up on prison planet dot tv
[2:17:34.020 --> 2:17:37.140]  and we also heard it here live the interview the audio
[2:17:37.140 --> 2:17:41.380]  that uh he did know about cheney planning to have us
[2:17:41.380 --> 2:17:44.580]  navy seals dressed up like iranians in fake blue
[2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:49.540]  patrol boats painted up like iranian boats and have them attack us ships
[2:17:49.540 --> 2:17:53.780]  and have a quote shootout people keep saying kill navy seals actually read
[2:17:53.780 --> 2:17:57.780]  what cheney was saying it's have them attack the ships
[2:17:57.780 --> 2:18:00.420]  uh but then they said well then the ships will kill the seals and they said
[2:18:00.420 --> 2:18:04.900]  well that's fine the point is this is big news not because
[2:18:04.900 --> 2:18:09.460]  we agree with all the things nadir does or any of that
[2:18:09.460 --> 2:18:15.540]  he is an icon i mean i was out there and there was um
[2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:21.140]  there was uh josh brolin you know the star of w no country for whole men
[2:18:21.140 --> 2:18:24.900]  and there was uh all the other hollywood people that were there
[2:18:24.900 --> 2:18:28.340]  uh at the event nadir was at that i was backstage on interviewing people
[2:18:28.340 --> 2:18:30.820]  and and there was you know eight thousand people there to see him
[2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:36.100]  point is this is a big move for 911 truth uh dr monteef shifting years
[2:18:36.100 --> 2:18:40.740]  briefly what do you say to that i think it's great i don't care whether
[2:18:40.740 --> 2:18:44.660]  nadir has a point ahead if he wants to get to the bottom of what happened on
[2:18:44.660 --> 2:18:48.820]  september 11th we need to support him and support everybody
[2:18:48.820 --> 2:18:52.100]  because once we could convince the american people that
[2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:56.020]  what happened on 911 was not what we saw that this
[2:18:56.020 --> 2:19:00.500]  this was obviously a controlled demolition of building number seven
[2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:03.940]  and a building seven came down was a controlled demolition
[2:19:03.940 --> 2:19:07.220]  that everything else is alive
[2:19:07.540 --> 2:19:10.980]  absolutely we've just got two segments left with our guests and i'm going to
[2:19:10.980 --> 2:19:14.340]  get into the directed energy weapon news we're
[2:19:14.340 --> 2:19:17.780]  honing down exactly what these super weapons bob woodward
[2:19:17.780 --> 2:19:21.220]  is talking about uh that are as big as the manhattan project
[2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:25.300]  other directed energy weapons uh again they admit they don't have a lot of
[2:19:25.300 --> 2:19:29.300]  military use other than terror it terrorizes the public to watch
[2:19:29.300 --> 2:19:33.460]  people's flesh melting off their skin dr monteef comments on that
[2:19:33.460 --> 2:19:36.820]  well i think we're in for some terrible terrible times i think that they are
[2:19:36.820 --> 2:19:38.980]  trying to demoralize this they're trying to
[2:19:38.980 --> 2:19:42.260]  create a situation that is so horrible uh that we
[2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:46.900]  we just want to watch television we want to watch football we want to watch
[2:19:46.900 --> 2:19:52.180]  the the world series the baseball game what we've got to do is get people to
[2:19:52.180 --> 2:19:56.500]  understand that they are involved and we can still turn this thing around
[2:19:56.500 --> 2:20:00.660]  all we need is the people who care and love that's right stay there stay there

[2:24:42.340 --> 2:24:48.500]  great guy but the moral of the story is you're not going to live forever
[2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:54.820]  and this wife is about standing up for what's good and honorable and helping others
[2:24:56.660 --> 2:25:01.540]  and that really is the greatest reward in life the world the flesh tells you it's
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:05.940]  about piling up treasures and rewards and i'm not saying that that's a bad thing
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:09.700]  but that's on your hierarchy of needs that's down lower and anybody who's
[2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:13.060]  been successful will tell you that people who've never been successful will
[2:25:13.060 --> 2:25:16.180]  always lust after things they've never had once they have them
[2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:19.700]  they realize that that's not what life was really all about
[2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:26.580]  unless they're turned completely over to evil and the greatest expression of evil is playing god
[2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:33.300]  thinking your god and and and trying to play god and i think that's the greatest you know
[2:25:35.300 --> 2:25:44.740]  main theme or or or or or main rail that the new order glides on is playing god being god
[2:25:44.740 --> 2:25:50.580]  engineering controlling dumbing down lying creating these complex systems of control
[2:25:50.580 --> 2:25:55.620]  they're very obsessive compulsive individuals the highest levels and they've built this
[2:25:55.620 --> 2:26:00.340]  multi-generational control grid now people say what do we do about it well they haven't
[2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:04.980]  completed their new world order they haven't fully absorbed all of humanity yet they haven't
[2:26:04.980 --> 2:26:08.580]  fully gotten their grid in place they haven't fully gotten their new world order in place yet
[2:26:08.580 --> 2:26:15.220]  they are always speaking about wanting their new world order and saying that that it's here but
[2:26:15.700 --> 2:26:20.420]  being constructed dr. monteev can you speak to that and defeating these people
[2:26:21.540 --> 2:26:27.380]  well all we can do of course is educate and educate people but the most important thing
[2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:33.780]  i think is for people to understand this is a spiritual battle and behind all of these people
[2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:39.380]  moving is towards the new world order our powerful spirits of forces we're really fighting fighting
[2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:45.220]  a spiritual battle on the political ideological and cultural battlefield but until we understand
[2:26:45.220 --> 2:26:51.140]  that we're not going to be able to be effective these people are out to create a one world government
[2:26:51.140 --> 2:26:57.220]  and they want to control everything they want to destroy the world population and first your
[2:26:57.220 --> 2:27:03.620]  ultimate goal is a one world government a one world religion and a new world leader
[2:27:03.620 --> 2:27:08.820]  that has been the goal of the secret societies down to the ages it's coming to its culmination
[2:27:08.820 --> 2:27:14.420]  we live in the most exciting time in history as we watch this thing unfold and by the way even
[2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:19.220]  if you're an atheist don't believe in god and the devil revelations the globalists do i mean the
[2:27:19.220 --> 2:27:25.540]  club of rome and the un even calls it the ten kingdoms the ten regions they use all that nomenclature
[2:27:25.540 --> 2:27:31.300]  when they have big god rfid summits they had one chicago they were calling it devilish in their
[2:27:31.300 --> 2:27:37.300]  beast system and laughing i mean they are really into this but they think that they basically
[2:27:37.300 --> 2:27:43.940]  they're going to win and then they fool worldly people by showing them the phony mainline christians
[2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:50.340]  well all we need to do is look the logo for the trilateral commission you'll find it at their
[2:27:50.340 --> 2:27:57.460]  website trilateral.org and it's a circle with three arrows in it but they're they're curved in such a
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:03.620]  way that if you look right closely you realize they are replications of a sixth and they're joined
[2:28:03.620 --> 2:28:11.620]  together in the center by an upside down broken cross six six six joined together by an upside
[2:28:11.620 --> 2:28:17.220]  down broken cross they understand exactly what they're doing and of course this is the organization
[2:28:17.220 --> 2:28:23.460]  created by Zignuba Zinski who's the foreign policy advisor for Barack Obama and of course this whole
[2:28:23.460 --> 2:28:29.060]  thing was funded by David Rockefeller who also funded the builder burgers was the honorary chairman
[2:28:29.060 --> 2:28:35.140]  of the council on foreign relations and who in his own biography on page and his memoirs which
[2:28:35.140 --> 2:28:41.860]  we incidentally carry memoirs by David Rockefeller on page 405 says you know that some people who
[2:28:41.860 --> 2:28:48.180]  accuse my family and myself of of being part of a secret cabal that is working against the best
[2:28:48.180 --> 2:28:53.220]  interest of the united states and working to route bring about a new international order
[2:28:53.220 --> 2:29:00.020]  and if that is the charge guilty i stand guilty i am a proud internationalist those are his words
[2:29:00.020 --> 2:29:05.620]  not mine and under internationalism it's not all this flowery stuff that brainwashed zombie
[2:29:05.620 --> 2:29:12.980]  cult followers believe in new agers it is a new world order of total dictatorial control
[2:29:13.540 --> 2:29:18.500]  the world government is a means to an end and the end is extermination the majority of the
[2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:23.140]  population these are conquerors who don't just want to dominate the world they want to take
[2:29:23.140 --> 2:29:28.420]  control of human evolution in their words they want to kill the majority of us it is genocide
[2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:36.100]  it is the ultimate form of domination dr monty as incredible as the team is absolutely right
[2:29:38.340 --> 2:29:42.580]  and they believe they have great strength because of a final segment with dr stan monty
[2:29:42.580 --> 2:29:47.940]  but we'll talk about the heart of hearts what makes the new world order tick when we get back stay with
[2:29:47.940 --> 2:29:58.660]  me we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:34:17.540 --> 2:34:23.780]  alpha pay the bottom line is we're having a big effect i've gotten burned over sherald tees thanks
[2:34:23.780 --> 2:34:31.940]  to you when i wind up in the hay we are having a big effect against a new world order crime syndicate
[2:34:34.260 --> 2:34:39.860]  and people are listening now more than ever because dr monteef said earlier so much
[2:34:42.340 --> 2:34:48.180]  of what we talked about many years ago has come true and now people are ready to be awakened
[2:34:48.180 --> 2:34:53.380]  they're ready to listen to us dr monteef i want to get to what makes the new older tick what their
[2:34:53.380 --> 2:34:59.220]  master plan is who they really are at the uh you know bottom line but before we do that tell folks
[2:34:59.220 --> 2:35:03.700]  about your book the brotherhood of darkness and the toll free number and website to get that
[2:35:04.500 --> 2:35:10.980]  well brotherhood of darkness simply traces the origin of all of the movements basically what
[2:35:10.980 --> 2:35:15.940]  what they've done is they've tried to confuse it and people will say it's the communists are behind
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:22.020]  what's going on people will say it's the council on foreign relations or but what we do is simply
[2:35:22.020 --> 2:35:28.340]  point out there are many organizations out there have a common denominator and that is to create a
[2:35:28.340 --> 2:35:34.020]  one world government a one world with it and bring about a one world leader and then of course the
[2:35:34.020 --> 2:35:38.580]  brotherhood of darkness tells you who's really behind the whole thing and i don't want to give away
[2:35:38.580 --> 2:35:45.060]  the punchline but it's an easy book to read and i hope it is transform the lives of many people
[2:35:45.060 --> 2:35:51.300]  our telephone number one eight hundred five four four eight nine two seven that's one eight hundred
[2:35:51.300 --> 2:35:59.220]  five four four eight nine two seven or five hiv war if you like to remember that it's the number
[2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:05.380]  of we got when we were fighting the eight battle but i hope people will get the book you know
[2:36:05.380 --> 2:36:11.780]  read it and then they'll explain to others what's really going on because there are powerful spirits
[2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:17.860]  of forces behind the people who are moving us towards world government and until people understand
[2:36:17.860 --> 2:36:25.380]  that nothing going on makes today really makes sense well you're absolutely right you're absolutely
[2:36:25.380 --> 2:36:35.940]  right and again i don't come at this from my own perspective and then try to make the world fit into
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:41.860]  my previously held world view i just covered the facts when i first was waking up 15 years ago
[2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:46.660]  we got on air 13 years ago i was a lot more main line i didn't get into the fact that
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:52.740]  other world leaders are devil worshipers but it's their own writings it's official un policy i mean
[2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:58.500]  it's it's there's so much of it where do you even start this is really not hidden at all
[2:36:59.300 --> 2:37:05.060]  it's just not on the nightly news they are very obvious about what they're doing and to find out
[2:37:05.060 --> 2:37:15.060]  that a weird sex cult that worships lucifer that is completely materialistic and but at the same
[2:37:15.060 --> 2:37:21.620]  time you know very nihilistic is in control of nuclear weapons and bio weapons and chemical
[2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:29.540]  weapons and social engineering and really have got their selves together i mean it's it's hard
[2:37:29.540 --> 2:37:35.780]  to deal with but they're the one saying it aren't they certainly among themselves are really
[2:37:36.500 --> 2:37:40.900]  admit what they're up to in fact they even publish things we we carry something called
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:45.860]  the work of the spiritual hierarchy that's the work of the spiritual hierarchy will set a free
[2:37:45.860 --> 2:37:52.420]  copy anybody wanted it's put out by the lucius trust used to be the lucifer publishing house
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:57.700]  or the lucifer organization but they changed the name to lucius because lucifer is it well some
[2:37:57.700 --> 2:38:02.580]  people can get a little upset when they realize they're really are luciferians out here at the
[2:38:02.580 --> 2:38:06.980]  highest levels of our government but in their publication they ready admit they have their
[2:38:06.980 --> 2:38:13.300]  people planted certainly in in the financial organizations throughout the world and governments
[2:38:13.300 --> 2:38:21.060]  throughout the world education and this is something this working the spiritual hierarchy
[2:38:21.060 --> 2:38:26.740]  distributed by the lucius trust organization go to their website lucius trust dot org
[2:38:26.740 --> 2:38:33.540]  they're financed by some of the wealthiest people in the world but you'll never hear this discuss
[2:38:34.500 --> 2:38:41.860]  is any on mainline abc cbs nbc or time newsweek or us news world report this clip we're about to
[2:38:41.860 --> 2:38:46.340]  play i played twice the last two days is a well-known little christian ministry that goes around
[2:38:46.340 --> 2:38:52.020]  preaching to masons and others and that there they are the big shiner shiner group going into a
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:57.620]  hospital and the guy comes over and says i am lucifer and so we say that again yes i'm lucifer
[2:38:57.620 --> 2:39:04.660]  and they believe that lucifer basically is the twin or one side of jesus and then you even tell
[2:39:04.660 --> 2:39:09.620]  low level masons and they just go oh no that's not the case because they don't know that even in
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:14.740]  the most prophetic official books of masonry but low level masons aren't supposed to read that
[2:39:15.300 --> 2:39:20.260]  that uh they are possessed by lucifer so let's go ahead and play that clip here it is
[2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:27.780]  lucifer what is your problem just that sir i'm a christian sir i'm pure and virtuous and
[2:39:27.780 --> 2:39:34.260]  wholesome and innocent how can you say anything about me sir you need to be born again i am born
[2:39:34.260 --> 2:39:39.700]  again now did you just say that you were lucifer i am lucifer can you find lucifer for me pure
[2:39:39.700 --> 2:39:46.420]  virtuous wholesome innocent individual that's out to help people lucifer is lucifer say that again
[2:39:46.420 --> 2:39:53.620]  lucifer is a pure holy virtuous virtuous now see the lucifer that god created that's the same one
[2:39:53.620 --> 2:39:58.740]  oh man this is great i'm gonna put this on the internet oh god bless you brother because that's
[2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:04.580]  exactly what the shriners and masons teaches that lucifer lucifer is like no and you're what are
[2:40:04.580 --> 2:40:10.260]  your confirm hospitals they know what sir jesus said many will say to me on that day lord lord
[2:40:10.260 --> 2:40:14.260]  did not we do not do these good deeds in your name and you'll say away from me you work us
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:24.420]  of iniquity i never knew you jesus said in matthew chapter five mercy no that's hard to believe so
[2:40:24.420 --> 2:40:30.740]  you're christian and you don't know that actually i really am you are because i'm pure and virtuous
[2:40:30.740 --> 2:40:36.660]  you're pure and virtuous okay in other words you're perfect without jesus right no no no
[2:40:36.660 --> 2:40:43.620]  okay tell me about jesus who is jesus but he's he's my linger is he the son of god is he the only
[2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:50.100]  worshipful master yes have you ever been called worshipful master no because i've just been too
[2:40:50.100 --> 2:40:58.340]  busy i've been working working working to help people what kind of work see this is what a
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:08.500]  mason confesses is it lucifer is light and the guy walks off with the rest of the masons
[2:41:08.500 --> 2:41:12.420]  and again i've had a lot of family there are masons i'm not bashing him the founding fathers
[2:41:12.420 --> 2:41:18.020]  most of them were they're not bad people but the people at the top of the group try to get
[2:41:18.020 --> 2:41:23.700]  the best in society to join them so they're in control of the good active people and that's
[2:41:23.700 --> 2:41:27.300]  just a fact and that's certainly part of the brotherhood of darkness isn't it dr montee
[2:41:27.300 --> 2:41:32.020]  it's serious in fact somebody sent me that clip this morning and i watched it on youtube and
[2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:35.540]  we're going to post that i'm sure you have it as well i don't know what the deal is actually
[2:41:35.540 --> 2:41:39.620]  or maybe i'm missing it i've been asking my guys to post it for three days john send that to paul
[2:41:39.620 --> 2:41:44.340]  watson at prisonplanet.com and to kurt and everybody else i really want to get that
[2:41:44.340 --> 2:41:50.100]  send that clip that youtube link to them please that is so important but people have to really
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:55.620]  understand alex that this is part of the gnostic religion and you can go up you can read this in
[2:41:55.620 --> 2:42:00.020]  the encyclopedia or i'll send it to any of your listeners who want to get it and give us a call
[2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:06.740]  we'll send them pages from the encyclopedia america would explain that the gnostics believe
[2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:14.980]  that there are two gods one is jesus christ and the other is lucifer and lucifer is the real god
[2:42:14.980 --> 2:42:19.860]  that's the one that they worship and well that's the one that'll that's the one that'll give them
[2:42:19.860 --> 2:42:25.140]  power yeah that's the one will give them power that's one will give them fame that's one that will
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:30.740]  give them wealth and this is what it's all about and you can actually tap into that source
[2:42:31.300 --> 2:42:35.060]  but you don't want to do it because it'll cost you your eternal soul people
[2:42:35.060 --> 2:42:41.540]  do not really understand that there are people out here in our country today who say they worship
[2:42:41.540 --> 2:42:46.580]  god but they worship a different god and some of them are the highest levels of our government
[2:42:46.580 --> 2:42:52.100]  the gnostic religion is simply a continuation of the ancient kabbalah which is a continuation of
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:57.300]  the egyptian of the ancient mystery religions and that's what masonry and rose accrued listen i grew
[2:42:57.300 --> 2:43:02.340]  up in a rich bedroom community of dallas rockwall texas you know where where we were poor compared
[2:43:02.340 --> 2:43:09.460]  to everybody and we were upper middle class and i mean it was just a cult everywhere i mean you'd
[2:43:09.460 --> 2:43:13.140]  be at somebody's mansion some girl you're dating and they're into the occult you'd be taken to a
[2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:18.100]  party and it'd be an occult and i'd be like i'm getting out of here i mean and it would be this
[2:43:18.100 --> 2:43:22.980]  group of friends that group of friends it didn't matter now austin isn't that bad though it's
[2:43:22.980 --> 2:43:27.780]  supposedly an occult center it's mainly a white magic center which is just as bad but they're just
[2:43:27.780 --> 2:43:32.900]  not sickos and trying to have power and mess with you but i mean i don't think people realize that
[2:43:33.940 --> 2:43:37.780]  that i mean we watch the senators do the hand signs on tv they're all out there
[2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:44.180]  in the open ladies and gentlemen uh in your face and then the public jokes around you know there's
[2:43:44.180 --> 2:43:50.180]  so much occultism the public picks it up and just thinks it's a joke uh but it's a not a joke is it
[2:43:50.180 --> 2:43:56.340]  dr montee it's really not and so much of what we see on television today is a manifestation of that
[2:43:56.340 --> 2:44:02.740]  this program the medium where this woman contacts the other dimension where does she get her power
[2:44:02.740 --> 2:44:08.420]  it comes from the devil but that's never brought out the hero is the um a very very popular program
[2:44:08.420 --> 2:44:14.660]  the battle between good and evil the only question is who's good and who's evil in this people must
[2:44:14.660 --> 2:44:21.620]  understand that it is a spiritual battle these people own the wealth of the world but of course
[2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:26.500]  what would we expect after all who's the prince of this world and by the way folks i don't want to
[2:44:26.500 --> 2:44:32.180]  hear that there's not something spiritual going on mathematicians came up in the 40s with with
[2:44:32.180 --> 2:44:38.180]  equations i even saw this on pbs i'd read about it before it's even on mainline tv where when the
[2:44:38.180 --> 2:44:43.380]  satellite in the 70s flew over saturn if their mathematical calculations were correct there
[2:44:43.380 --> 2:44:50.580]  would be a hexagon expressed by an interdimensional field uh on its poles and sure enough it was
[2:44:50.580 --> 2:44:55.940]  there i mean there is just so much we don't know about we're a little blue green jewel in the middle
[2:44:55.940 --> 2:45:02.580]  of the cosmos but we're but the but the tv and media has a so busy looking down at the ground
[2:45:02.580 --> 2:45:07.220]  not seeing the big picture around us and i find that all these so-called atheist organizations
[2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:13.140]  are really run by these rosa crucians by these luciferians by these satanists and they just want
[2:45:13.140 --> 2:45:18.340]  the public not looking into any of it or thinking christians are stupid but the secret is they're
[2:45:18.340 --> 2:45:24.580]  really into it and people go up on the internet and look up the website for the rosa crucians and
[2:45:24.580 --> 2:45:31.460]  the theosophists and the and the and the lucas trust their their but the average individual
[2:45:31.460 --> 2:45:36.740]  has never even heard of them understand that these are the people who are directing the course of
[2:45:36.740 --> 2:45:40.740]  world events today and are moving us rapidly towards a world war three

[2:56:26.900 --> 2:56:32.340]  and then it's just there's nothing you can do you've got to accept it i never use the Austin
[2:56:32.340 --> 2:56:37.300]  toll roads and by never they've been in a couple years and i've used them i think twice but coming
[2:56:37.300 --> 2:56:46.340]  back in on that saturday in the rv from Denver a few weekends ago we couldn't take the toll road
[2:56:46.340 --> 2:56:53.140]  did you know that we wanted to take it and it's a ripoff it lets you pay cash and then 300 yards
[2:56:53.140 --> 2:57:00.180]  later it says everyone without a control tag a text tag oh it's texas then it must be okay
[2:57:00.180 --> 2:57:03.380]  it's cowboy see everything's propaganda
[2:57:07.140 --> 2:57:13.220]  they um make you get off the road you can't use the toll road so it's also a scam
[2:57:15.460 --> 2:57:20.980]  you've got to get that tracker tag and of course it came out nine years ago or more in san francisco
[2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:25.620]  they were using the toll road cards to track everybody who had them in real time in federal
[2:57:25.620 --> 2:57:31.460]  studies so just all part of the deception i mean we've got a government that puts poison in our

[3:06:50.580 --> 3:06:54.660]  conscience history and the bible proved to them that these two systems church and state
[3:06:54.660 --> 3:07:00.100]  must be kept separate it must be our love of god and of country that prompts or constrains us this
[3:07:00.100 --> 3:07:04.420]  will change the character not civil enforcement from history we saw that when church and state
[3:07:04.420 --> 3:07:09.540]  united known as papal roam religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly contrary

[3:08:26.820 --> 3:08:33.380]  and want to record them put it up on youtube so erin dykes is going to be sitting in coming up a
[3:08:33.380 --> 3:08:37.860]  little bit later in the show with richard c cook he's written for the washington post other
[3:08:37.860 --> 3:08:44.340]  major publications been a consultant for nasa been a white house analyst historian and we really
[3:08:44.340 --> 3:08:48.820]  enjoy having him on i wanted to briefly tell you why keith oberman was kicked off it was because of
[3:08:48.820 --> 3:08:53.140]  statements like the one we're about to play that's about a minute long if you want to watch the full
[3:08:53.140 --> 3:08:58.980]  video there's like an eight minute video saying basically i ran attacked us on 9 11 the terrorists
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:05.140]  thought they'd win but we're going to get al qaeda and i ran and and and and basically it's like this
[3:09:05.140 --> 3:09:13.940]  warmongering propaganda that is so ham-fisted it sounds like something out of the running
[3:09:13.940 --> 3:09:20.500]  man or some dystopic 1984 novel or movie uh and then tom brokaw's talking about how great you know
[3:09:20.500 --> 3:09:24.660]  the you know the attack on al qaeda is and how the endless wars we're going to win the fight
[3:09:24.660 --> 3:09:27.700]  against al qaeda and they cut to oberman and he says this
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:35.940]  it's not great thanks tom brokaw and chuck todd will be back with you later on in the broadcast
[3:09:37.860 --> 3:09:42.100]  i'm sorry it's necessary to say this and i wanted to separate myself from the others on the air
[3:09:42.100 --> 3:09:47.620]  about this if at this late date any television network had of its own accord showed that much
[3:09:47.620 --> 3:09:52.660]  videotape and that much graphic videotape of 9 11 i speak of somebody who lost a few friends
[3:09:52.660 --> 3:10:00.100]  there it we would be rightly eviscerated at all quarters perhaps by the republican party itself
[3:10:00.660 --> 3:10:05.620]  for exploiting the memories of the dead and perhaps even for trying to evoke that pain again
[3:10:07.300 --> 3:10:14.740]  if you reacted to that videotape the way i did i apologize it is a subject of great pain
[3:10:14.740 --> 3:10:19.780]  for many of us still and was probably not appropriate to be shown we'll continue in a moment
[3:10:19.780 --> 3:10:26.260]  and you can go watch the video that was inappropriate they played scary music under it and said
[3:10:26.260 --> 3:10:32.900]  and it kept showing iranians and iranian flags and basically saying they did 9 11 just incredible
[3:10:32.900 --> 3:10:38.980]  propaganda now this is up on info wars dot net i want to ask richard c cook about this first
[3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:43.300]  before we get into freddy mack and fanny may and fanny may freddy mack before we do that
[3:10:43.300 --> 3:10:49.940]  but uh... now uh... ralph natives come out he has a huge following that's what's important and
[3:10:49.940 --> 3:10:54.100]  said that 9 11 can be an inside job there should be an official investigation he said that in
[3:10:54.100 --> 3:10:59.620]  the press conference so things are getting big here the 9 11 truth movement is just exploding
[3:11:00.180 --> 3:11:06.100]  a what do you think this means to the new world order crew and be uh... extrapolating out how do
[3:11:06.100 --> 3:11:13.460]  you see this developing uh... in the future richard c cook well i think it's really interesting
[3:11:13.460 --> 3:11:19.220]  and uh... very very good thing to see ralph nader uh... finally talking about real issues
[3:11:20.020 --> 3:11:25.060]  uh... you know he's been going on about the same things he's been talking about for years with
[3:11:25.060 --> 3:11:30.900]  this latest presidential bid corporate corruption and all the stuff we know all about but now if
[3:11:30.900 --> 3:11:38.020]  he's coming out uh... for uh... 9 11 truth also saw that there was a uh... a press conference
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:41.940]  was either today or yesterday at the national press club in washington
[3:11:42.660 --> 3:11:48.980]  where ron paul uh... synthia mckinney uh... ralph nader and uh... one or two other people
[3:11:48.980 --> 3:11:54.500]  were coming up for a full-scale investigation of the federal reserve so here again uh...
[3:11:54.500 --> 3:11:58.900]  ralph nader i know people who worked with him were very well has been very reluctant
[3:11:58.900 --> 3:12:05.380]  to take on the real big ones and the federal reserve is a big one clearly 9 11 is a big one
[3:12:05.940 --> 3:12:10.980]  so i think this uh... really points to some very important progress being made in the
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:17.460]  in our country and uh... in addition there is an interview published today on global research
[3:12:18.260 --> 3:12:22.500]  where uh... a good friend of mine mike whitney who's a writer out of washington state has an
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:27.700]  interview there with dr michael hudson who's talking about a new political party that will
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:34.260]  kind of consolidate all of the uh... uh... a fragmented third parties in this country and try
[3:12:34.260 --> 3:12:40.660]  to put together a real movement to begin to address the real issues and taking our country back
[3:12:40.660 --> 3:12:46.900]  now you notice that barbara exactly of that was this morning you notice bob bar snub that meeting
[3:12:46.900 --> 3:12:51.140]  and i have to say we've had him on the show before but i don't really trust bob bar
[3:12:52.020 --> 3:12:57.140]  well i think the libertarians to my mind are playing a little bit of a role like ross perot
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:13:04.020]  played back in ninety two kind of a teaser you know to pull away attention from what's going on
[3:13:04.580 --> 3:13:09.060]  i know i had a lot of uh... respect for perot and i hope that he would have followed through
[3:13:09.780 --> 3:13:14.580]  and uh... done what he had set out to do but the bush is in the clinton happening with bar
[3:13:14.580 --> 3:13:17.300]  yeah well they did threaten to kill his family so that's why he backed off
[3:13:18.580 --> 3:13:23.060]  and and and that was almost a non-event after they threatened to go after uh... ross perot's
[3:13:23.060 --> 3:13:26.900]  daughter and wife uh... he just came out and said yeah they threatened to kill my family and the
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:32.340]  menuse said all whatever he's just crazy and the rush limbaugh played uh... you know they're coming
[3:13:32.340 --> 3:13:39.780]  to take me away haha holy he's like jfk so it's uh... to the funny farm you know that rush limbaugh
[3:13:39.780 --> 3:13:45.620]  song right well i think right now enough people are starting to come together that maybe we will
[3:13:45.620 --> 3:13:51.460]  see a real political movement coming out of all of this well there's no doubt that congress has a
[3:13:51.460 --> 3:13:56.820]  nine percent approval rating the system can't sell its lies anymore and it is that crisis of
[3:13:56.820 --> 3:14:03.380]  confidence and they can have their spooks on radio tv and the web say nine eleven truths dead uh...
[3:14:03.380 --> 3:14:07.940]  that's like saying iPods are dead we know when they're at their absolute hottest
[3:14:07.940 --> 3:14:12.580]  that's like saying electricity is dead when there's more electricity being generated than ever it's
[3:14:12.580 --> 3:14:18.900]  like saying the sun is dead uh... i mean it but it works on some people oh i guess our movement's over
[3:14:18.900 --> 3:14:26.260]  over it is only getting bigger and skepticism is only increasing exponentially what do you
[3:14:26.260 --> 3:14:30.900]  see the establishment doing to try to counter that just more iron fisted uh... tactics
[3:14:31.780 --> 3:14:38.020]  well right now uh... let me just mention i have a new uh... analysis uh... coming out
[3:14:38.740 --> 3:14:45.460]  on the o eight election it's called uh... election oh eight crime family food fight
[3:14:45.460 --> 3:14:53.380]  or threat to mankind uh... this is out uh... will be out in a few days it's a special report that
[3:14:53.380 --> 3:14:59.540]  i'm uh... putting out in cooperation with my partner susan boski and if i could alex let me
[3:14:59.540 --> 3:15:05.140]  give you the way people can can uh... contact us for this it's um... uh... an email address
[3:15:05.140 --> 3:15:12.660]  it's the one we've used before on your show economic sanity at gmail dot org and it looks
[3:15:12.660 --> 3:15:20.100]  to me as though uh... they're staging this uh... almost tragic comedy of the o eight election
[3:15:20.100 --> 3:15:28.100]  between two parties who uh... really uh... uh... are the ones who control public opinion for so
[3:15:28.100 --> 3:15:33.860]  long but there's a there's a divergence i think between the traditional establishment elite
[3:15:33.860 --> 3:15:40.580]  which has come out of the banking systems for so which is trying to keep things afloat it's the
[3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:46.740]  soft landing that we've heard about uh... this whole fat uh... uh... fanny may freddy mac thing is
[3:15:46.740 --> 3:15:54.340]  to try soft landing where we just kind of slide into a very long-term economic decline
[3:15:54.340 --> 3:16:00.020]  recession depression uh... kind of the way we've gone with a little bit of tinkering around the
[3:16:00.020 --> 3:16:06.020]  edges of the democrats want to do to prop up what is left to the welfare state without really ever
[3:16:06.020 --> 3:16:12.580]  changing anything just kind of uh... a decline and fading away of of the united states of our
[3:16:12.580 --> 3:16:19.060]  dream democracy and all that goes with it versus these really radical uh... neocons
[3:16:19.620 --> 3:16:25.860]  who have captured the republican party and are running their candidate john mccain and now
[3:16:25.860 --> 3:16:33.220]  sarah palin is kind of a front person for all of this who seem to want to take us into a world war
[3:16:33.220 --> 3:16:39.140]  war against russia that's our choice as i see it and i go into detail on this
[3:16:39.700 --> 3:16:44.660]  in the special report that i'm uh... uh... just getting ready to release folks can also visit
[3:16:44.660 --> 3:16:52.260]  your website give that up you know the website is w w w dot richard c cook dot com and people
[3:16:52.260 --> 3:16:57.540]  can write to me through that the special report is coming out and it's available by writing to
[3:16:57.540 --> 3:17:04.580]  economic sanity at gmail dot com now that's why i wanted to get you on later in the second part
[3:17:04.580 --> 3:17:11.940]  when erin's here with you uh... mister cook but right now i want to get into uh... the two big
[3:17:11.940 --> 3:17:17.460]  mortgage giants because i had dr robertson and some others yesterday and they were getting into the
[3:17:17.460 --> 3:17:23.940]  fact that this could make the entire treasury and solvent taking on trillions and trillions of
[3:17:23.940 --> 3:17:28.740]  dollars and we're talking about hundreds of trillions uh... with what uh... fanny man
[3:17:28.740 --> 3:17:33.700]  freddy mac had actually leveraged bundling these debts and then selling them as securities and then
[3:17:33.700 --> 3:17:39.620]  using fractional reserve banking to loan them out ten times ten times ten and dr roberts agreed
[3:17:39.620 --> 3:17:44.900]  that it's in the hundreds of trillions we're talking about total exposure and that this black hole is
[3:17:44.900 --> 3:17:52.340]  so big uh... i mean he was saying his prognosis is even worse than it had been uh... but but then
[3:17:52.340 --> 3:17:57.220]  if they wouldn't have done what they did it would have caused insolvency
[3:17:57.220 --> 3:18:02.820]  in u.s treasury notes uh... and bonds because the u.s treasury had already guaranteed
[3:18:03.780 --> 3:18:08.580]  fanny man freddy mac previously uh... so your take on that well
[3:18:08.580 --> 3:18:14.980]  this is certainly true but uh... i try to look at it uh... a little bit differently from that
[3:18:14.980 --> 3:18:21.300]  because you know when you read the financial news now you are reading commentators who are
[3:18:21.300 --> 3:18:25.300]  you know with all due respect they're they're good commentators good analyst but
[3:18:25.300 --> 3:18:31.060]  uh... it doesn't give me a whole lot of heartburn to think that this latest huge uh... scam
[3:18:31.700 --> 3:18:38.900]  is going to take down the already existing scams you know of treasury debt of a ten trillion
[3:18:38.900 --> 3:18:44.180]  dollar national debt of uh... you know hundreds of trillion dollars in in derivatives it doesn't
[3:18:44.180 --> 3:18:51.860]  bother me that these that the the viability of all of these other uh... disasters may be
[3:18:51.860 --> 3:18:56.660]  threatened by this latest disaster i mean it is supposed to hold financial system
[3:18:56.660 --> 3:19:02.660]  just collapses uh... uh... you bet you go into bankruptcy reorganization you rebuild it but
[3:19:02.660 --> 3:19:08.180]  that's not the real problem if i could i'd like to just stay there i want to talk about what the
[3:19:08.180 --> 3:19:14.820]  real problem is with richard c cook art guest uh... top analyst economist dealing with this
[3:19:14.820 --> 3:19:18.340]  we're gonna skip this break for info wars dot com audio listeners
[3:19:18.340 --> 3:19:21.780]  and present planet dot tv viewers people keep saying well how do i listen to them
[3:19:21.780 --> 3:19:26.500]  you go to info wars dot com you click on those streams the those are special streams
[3:19:27.140 --> 3:19:32.180]  all right we'll be right back okay continue i don't want to waste any time with you go ahead
[3:19:32.180 --> 3:19:38.580]  okay we've got a financial system that's built on debt uh...
[3:19:38.580 --> 3:19:41.700]  the financial system is just pieces of paper
[3:19:41.700 --> 3:19:45.860]  that represent uh... promises that somebody's making to pay and we've got
[3:19:45.860 --> 3:19:48.100]  trillions of these pieces of paper
[3:19:48.100 --> 3:19:53.140]  we've got debt upon debt upon debt uh... gigantic pyramid of debt that's now falling down
[3:19:53.700 --> 3:19:57.300]  but on the other hand we have a producing economy
[3:19:57.300 --> 3:20:04.100]  where people make real things uh... exxon mobile produces gasoline microsoft produces
[3:20:04.100 --> 3:20:10.420]  computers general modus produces cars and so on and so forth the producing economy is where the
[3:20:10.420 --> 3:20:17.380]  real wealth of the nation uh... should come from but let me stop you instead of this fiat
[3:20:17.380 --> 3:20:21.700]  currency and fiat liquidity that gives the bankers kingship and i'm gonna let you get to your
[3:20:21.700 --> 3:20:25.380]  economic solution point here but i just want to have the caveat
[3:20:25.380 --> 3:20:29.060]  they're not accidentally letting this ponzi scheme get out of control
[3:20:29.060 --> 3:20:36.740]  they want to fully take over and bankrupt the real physical economy so they get ownership
[3:20:36.740 --> 3:20:43.140]  and the implosion is their economic weapon of warfare to get the scraps of the real economy
[3:20:43.140 --> 3:20:44.820]  they don't already control
[3:20:44.820 --> 3:20:48.420]  well yes and and that's exactly exactly what's what this
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:53.380]  bankruptcy is going on uh... you know is doing so we may
[3:20:53.380 --> 3:20:57.860]  plus infume about how it's threatening the treasury securities and all that
[3:20:57.860 --> 3:21:00.740]  you're right they don't care now the problem is
[3:21:01.460 --> 3:21:06.260]  for the last decade at least and it goes back further but particularly in the last decade
[3:21:06.900 --> 3:21:15.140]  the united states economy has been built on the foundation of housing debt as its final
[3:21:15.140 --> 3:21:21.460]  as its financial engine now the reason they've done that is that decades ago
[3:21:21.460 --> 3:21:26.900]  the international financial elite that runs the western world
[3:21:27.540 --> 3:21:33.780]  decided that the united states would no longer be allowed to maintain its status
[3:21:34.500 --> 3:21:37.460]  at the world's great industrial democracy
[3:21:38.100 --> 3:21:42.100]  the takeout publicly stated that let me stop you let me stop you again just back you up
[3:21:42.100 --> 3:21:46.340]  they've that's been stated over and over again we're too greedy we've got too much
[3:21:46.340 --> 3:21:50.660]  we've got to have the center of power taken from us and brought into this global corporate
[3:21:50.660 --> 3:21:57.060]  structure go ahead well that's been kind of the cover story but the problem was that the united
[3:21:57.060 --> 3:22:04.020]  states as an industrial democracy based upon the principles in the declaration of independence
[3:22:04.660 --> 3:22:11.300]  and the united states constitution had built a system where people were free where people
[3:22:11.300 --> 3:22:18.420]  had opportunity where people could fulfill themselves this was contrary to the concept
[3:22:18.420 --> 3:22:24.660]  of the one world collectivist empire that the financiers have been planning for decades and
[3:22:24.660 --> 3:22:29.860]  the imperialists actually back in the 1780s said this american system's horrible and it'll
[3:22:29.860 --> 3:22:34.900]  be the ruination of all of us if we don't end it as well that's right and that was said again
[3:22:34.900 --> 3:22:42.580]  during the civil war by the london financiers because linkin financed the civil war with green
[3:22:42.580 --> 3:22:49.620]  backs and war bonds sold to the population the london times printed an editorial saying if the
[3:22:49.620 --> 3:22:55.460]  united states was not stopped it would become the most powerful nation on earth and it would
[3:22:55.460 --> 3:23:00.900]  undermine all the monarchies of the world and so they've been trying to take down our system
[3:23:00.900 --> 3:23:06.820]  ever since and now this is the final phase of that it's the final phase of a very old plan
[3:23:06.820 --> 3:23:14.900]  to create the collectivist one world socialist communist state that they began to do when they
[3:23:14.900 --> 3:23:19.300]  financed the bolshevik revolution let me stop you there let me stop you there let me stop you
[3:23:19.300 --> 3:23:23.540]  there i want you to go back 30 seconds and i'm and you're gonna have five minutes and when
[3:23:23.540 --> 3:23:27.140]  and when we come back it'll be erin here alone with you i'm going to give you the floor when
[3:23:27.140 --> 3:23:32.340]  we come back right now explain go back to that editorial in the london paper and then start
[3:23:32.340 --> 3:23:41.140]  over right now here we go all right richard c cook economist analyst written for major
[3:23:41.140 --> 3:23:46.820]  publications like the washington post historian i'm going to you've got the floor for the next
[3:23:46.820 --> 3:23:52.180]  five minutes and i'm going to leave erin's going to come in here break down who's behind it what
[3:23:52.180 --> 3:23:57.460]  the master plan is the economic system what they're setting up why they want to bring down the us
[3:23:57.460 --> 3:24:02.900]  how they've puffed us up with this imperial attitude given us this domestic haughty propaganda
[3:24:02.900 --> 3:24:07.380]  about how we're the boss how they're setting us up to pull the carpet out from under us
[3:24:07.380 --> 3:24:11.540]  how the war has been meant to demonize us internationally you were talking about that
[3:24:11.540 --> 3:24:18.580]  during the last segment please uh wrap it up for us well as i was saying decades ago
[3:24:19.300 --> 3:24:25.220]  the international financial elite that runs the western world decided that the u.s would no longer
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:31.700]  be allowed to maintain its status as the world's greatest industrial democracy this goes all the
[3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:38.660]  way back to the civil war and even before when the nation was founded but we have been under attack
[3:24:38.660 --> 3:24:44.980]  ever since then and what we're seeing today through the deindustrialization of the united states
[3:24:45.540 --> 3:24:51.540]  were the only way to float the u.s economy has been through debt through bubbles and the latest
[3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:57.460]  and the last one really being a housing bubble this has all been part of that process of taken
[3:24:57.460 --> 3:25:04.660]  down the united states as the world's greatest industrial democracy now to prepare the mind
[3:25:04.660 --> 3:25:10.020]  of people there have been nonprofit groups that have been working for decades to give us an
[3:25:10.020 --> 3:25:16.020]  educational system where everybody is dumbed down and everybody is fed the kind of collectivist
[3:25:16.020 --> 3:25:22.420]  propaganda that is contrary to the principles that were used when this country was founded you've
[3:25:22.420 --> 3:25:27.700]  got foundations like the Carnegie Institute the Rockefeller Foundation the Ford Foundation the
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:33.700]  Guggenheim Foundation because what they were planning to do was to create an environment
[3:25:33.700 --> 3:25:41.300]  a perpetual warfare where the only way people would accept a constant atmosphere of state
[3:25:41.300 --> 3:25:47.540]  terrorism as normal was by having an enemy to frighten people into voluntarily giving up their
[3:25:47.540 --> 3:25:55.140]  rights and accepting the legitimacy of a slave society and a key to this slavery was a financial
[3:25:55.140 --> 3:26:02.500]  system based upon debt because it was the financiers who were the architects and the expected
[3:26:02.500 --> 3:26:08.500]  beneficiaries of the planned system and it's the same people who created the federal reserve system
[3:26:08.500 --> 3:26:16.500]  in 1913 now the 1970s was the critical decade in all this because it was then that the financial
[3:26:16.500 --> 3:26:23.620]  elite working through the OPEC nations as their instruments of change wildly inflated the worldwide
[3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:31.380]  price of oil and it drove the US economy into stagflation and to combat that the financial
[3:26:31.380 --> 3:26:37.620]  elite working through the federal reserve and its chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates
[3:26:37.620 --> 3:26:44.900]  through the roof and this caused the economy to crash in the recession of 1979 to 1983
[3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:52.740]  since then our economy has run solely on financial bubbles we had the merger acquisition bubble of
[3:26:52.740 --> 3:26:59.700]  the 80s we had the dot-com bubble of the 90s and then when that collapsed we have Alan Greenspan's
[3:26:59.700 --> 3:27:07.300]  housing bubble of the 2000s the purpose of the housing bubble was to allow George W. Bush to
[3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:13.540]  fight his wars of conquest in the Middle East the bubble resulted in a tremendous inflation
[3:27:14.420 --> 3:27:20.500]  of housing and real estate prices that is unraveling today but even though housing is still
[3:27:21.940 --> 3:27:28.740]  coming down it's still so overpriced that many people who once could afford to buy a home no
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:35.140]  longer can do that and can't even get credit because financial institutions have been so reluctant
[3:27:35.140 --> 3:27:41.380]  lately to lend it's this housing inflation that has powered the US economy for the last decade
[3:27:42.340 --> 3:27:49.780]  the bailouts and the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are simply to keep the economy afloat
[3:27:49.780 --> 3:27:55.860]  until the next election that's what the whole thing in my mind is all about unfortunately
[3:27:55.860 --> 3:28:01.300]  there are no further bubbles waiting in the wings because when the american people gave up their
[3:28:01.300 --> 3:28:06.580]  homes to debt they gave up the last real asset they owned of value because they don't save anything
[3:28:06.580 --> 3:28:13.700]  anymore the savings is gone and even the savings has gone into 401ks for retirement is now being
[3:28:13.700 --> 3:28:19.460]  sold off because people need that money to live but the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae is
[3:28:19.460 --> 3:28:26.180]  simply a stopgap the problem is not that it's devaluing the rest of the government's debt
[3:28:26.180 --> 3:28:32.980]  of course that may happen but the problem is that after the housing bubble there is no more
[3:28:33.540 --> 3:28:38.020]  uh there are no more bubbles left because there's nothing left of value that we own
[3:28:38.580 --> 3:28:44.180]  uh that we can sell or mortgage to get money to live on that's the real problem as i see it
[3:28:44.180 --> 3:28:48.420]  yeah this is Aaron filling in for alex jones and that's what i was going to add is that
[3:28:49.140 --> 3:28:53.940]  the US public is so disconnected from reality i don't think they have any idea what's going on
[3:28:53.940 --> 3:28:57.940]  uh we'll talk about that on the other side of the break in just a few moments
[3:28:59.220 --> 3:29:01.940]  this is the alex jones show with richard c cook

[3:33:15.300 --> 3:33:22.020]  i've written about in in a couple of recent articles uh it's the same thing that we saw in
[3:33:22.020 --> 3:33:30.180]  the 1970s where we have prices going up and employment and economic growth going down so
[3:33:30.180 --> 3:33:36.100]  where people are seeing this they're seeing this in the tremendous run up in the price of gasoline
[3:33:36.740 --> 3:33:44.340]  this is not an accident it's not being called caused by supply and demand it is not being
[3:33:44.340 --> 3:33:49.860]  caused by speculation in the markets which is the cover story that's being put out the rising
[3:33:49.860 --> 3:33:56.820]  cost of gasoline is a policy of the western governments of the u.s. government to raise
[3:33:56.820 --> 3:34:04.020]  the price of petroleum as a kind of a tax on the entire world population in order
[3:34:04.660 --> 3:34:11.540]  to bail us out of the economic and financial collapse and also to slow down the growth of
[3:34:11.540 --> 3:34:17.140]  the third world the developing world economies like china and like india so that's one place we're
[3:34:17.140 --> 3:34:24.980]  seeing at the gas pump these prices are rippling out into all other elements of the economy it's
[3:34:25.620 --> 3:34:29.460]  being passed on primarily in rising food prices so that's you know every day
[3:34:30.100 --> 3:34:33.940]  i hear someone's come back from the grocery store and can't believe how much a gallon of
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:40.180]  milk costs so this is another area where it's coming home to people the third area it's coming
[3:34:40.180 --> 3:34:49.300]  home to people is in job loss the economy lost 60 000 jobs last month the economy is shedding
[3:34:49.300 --> 3:34:57.780]  jobs in the thousands per day people are out of work jobs are hard to find there's no new
[3:34:57.780 --> 3:35:03.780]  source of jobs coming into play because the last economic engine of the economy the housing
[3:35:03.780 --> 3:35:10.020]  bubble has burst and so you know people aren't building homes the financial industry is shedding
[3:35:10.020 --> 3:35:15.700]  jobs people are having to cut their expenditures they're having to you know live with their parents
[3:35:15.700 --> 3:35:22.420]  or rent group houses these are all ways that this collapse of our economy is showing up
[3:35:22.980 --> 3:35:27.940]  in everyday life now the united states has a certain amount of fat if you will in the economy
[3:35:28.500 --> 3:35:33.700]  people still have 401ks which they're now cashing in they still have big houses which
[3:35:33.700 --> 3:35:40.340]  they're now doubling up in and taking in our rumors or families living together so you know
[3:35:40.340 --> 3:35:45.540]  there's a certain amount that can be absorbed but the point is approaching very rapidly where
[3:35:45.540 --> 3:35:51.300]  that can't happen anymore uh homelessness is going up the number of people who can't afford to eat
[3:35:51.300 --> 3:35:57.220]  decent food is going up now none of this the mainstream media is reporting on you know the
[3:35:57.220 --> 3:36:02.820]  nfl season has started and we're seeing lots of good football games on television but it's all
[3:36:02.820 --> 3:36:08.900]  simply to cover up what's going on within the economy and of course the election is just a
[3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:14.820]  big distraction from that but we're going to see no major change to the economic situation
[3:36:14.820 --> 3:36:21.300]  other than greater takeover and greater crises no there's nothing there's nothing they can do
[3:36:21.940 --> 3:36:28.980]  now to give the democrats some credit they do have a platform where you have certain features
[3:36:28.980 --> 3:36:34.660]  that could make a difference for example uh in the democratic platform you have a feature of a
[3:36:34.660 --> 3:36:41.220]  national infrastructure bank uh this is the kind of bank that was used during the great depression
[3:36:41.220 --> 3:36:49.700]  to capitalize economic recovery during the 30s 40s and even into the early 1950s it's really
[3:36:49.700 --> 3:36:55.300]  what built the modern u.s infrastructure nobody's ever heard of it because the financiers don't
[3:36:55.300 --> 3:37:00.740]  want you to know how easy it is for the government to capitalize the infrastructure development and
[3:37:00.740 --> 3:37:06.740]  create jobs there's legislation before congress to do that because then it's introduced legislation
[3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:13.140]  for it in the senate uh senator dodd introduced legislation for it and it's in the democratic
[3:37:13.140 --> 3:37:19.780]  party platform but they're nowhere near doing it because the current uh economic for the current
[3:37:19.780 --> 3:37:26.500]  political environment will not allow something as simple and as basic as an infrastructure bank
[3:37:26.500 --> 3:37:34.500]  even though we see the growth of infrastructure programs uh that are uh now being used to at
[3:37:34.500 --> 3:37:39.700]  least uh address some of the problems we have with roads and highways and bridges and this
[3:37:39.700 --> 3:37:47.540]  sort of thing but it's not nearly enough the republicans in uh mccain's stance against
[3:37:47.540 --> 3:37:54.820]  earmarks uh that's really uh earmarks are really a surrogate for his opposition and the republicans
[3:37:54.820 --> 3:38:00.660]  opposition to infrastructure spending the reason they're opposed to infrastructure spending is
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:08.820]  that when the government spends money on infrastructure uh you are uh using public
[3:38:09.620 --> 3:38:16.260]  funds to do what is needed to be done to create jobs and to shore up the physical economy they
[3:38:16.260 --> 3:38:20.740]  want everything to go through the banking system they want people to have to borrow money from the
[3:38:20.740 --> 3:38:28.900]  banks in order to do things like this they want to use private credit to privatize the economy
[3:38:28.900 --> 3:38:34.180]  or private companies and corporations come in and buy water systems and even buy roads like they did
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:40.980]  with uh the indiana turnpike uh this is what the republicans want they want to drive the economy
[3:38:40.980 --> 3:38:47.060]  totally into the hands of the financiers the banking system the big international financial
[3:38:47.860 --> 3:38:53.780]  conglomerates uh the equity funds they couldn't care less about public support of the economy
[3:38:53.780 --> 3:39:00.660]  about public financing of the economy and if uh uh the republicans are collected or are elected
[3:39:01.220 --> 3:39:05.620]  uh it will be the worst possible thing that could happen for the economy of this country
[3:39:05.620 --> 3:39:10.820]  but are you saying it's actually going to make a difference if obama is elected will
[3:39:10.820 --> 3:39:16.500]  he put in any of these backbone infrastructures in my opinion uh we're going to see a little bit
[3:39:16.500 --> 3:39:22.820]  of tinkering around the edges the way clinton did a little bit more of certain aspects of the
[3:39:22.820 --> 3:39:28.820]  welfare state which are oriented primarily to the lower economic rungs to the to the poverty
[3:39:28.820 --> 3:39:34.740]  level people you know we might see some more food stamps out there uh we might see the earned income
[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:41.380]  tax credit being expanded a little bit i can't see right now the democrats doing anything
[3:39:41.380 --> 3:39:48.340]  significant to increase the job base in this country that does not go through private enterprise
[3:39:48.340 --> 3:39:53.860]  but we won't see anything really major because i don't think the democrats have the power to
[3:39:54.740 --> 3:40:01.140]  go up against the financial elite that runs the system uh at least that's the way it looks
[3:40:01.140 --> 3:40:06.900]  right now i think that the only way to do it is to attack the federal reserve system at its root
[3:40:07.460 --> 3:40:13.780]  the way ron paul has advocated uh the way uh this group that met in washington today uh it
[3:40:13.780 --> 3:40:18.500]  was talking about the one that included nator included synthi mckinney we need a complete
[3:40:18.500 --> 3:40:23.860]  overhaul of the financial system in addition to that what i think we need to put into place
[3:40:23.860 --> 3:40:30.660]  immediately is a national dividend that would involve direct payment to individuals of the
[3:40:30.660 --> 3:40:35.860]  kind of resource revenues that they do through the alaska permanent fund where this year they've
[3:40:35.860 --> 3:40:41.540]  raised the alaska permanent fund to a thirty two hundred dollars stipend to each resident of alaska
[3:40:41.540 --> 3:40:48.580]  that includes a fuel subsidy and includes a resource revenue uh royalty we need to do something
[3:40:48.580 --> 3:40:55.460]  like this nationwide to attack the oncoming depression at its very roots and uh it's very
[3:40:55.460 --> 3:41:03.220]  difficult i can't see the democrats doing this uh without just throwing out everything that they
[3:41:03.220 --> 3:41:09.940]  have been doing the last twenty years under the centrist regime that clinton and the democratic
[3:41:10.500 --> 3:41:14.580]  leadership council put in place which is really what you might call republican light
[3:41:15.300 --> 3:41:21.140]  i think we need a complete revolution in public finance in this country but instead it'll just
[3:41:21.140 --> 3:41:26.100]  be continue to leverage out to the global banking system and the larger beast will continue to die
[3:41:26.740 --> 3:41:34.340]  i think so i think that what the democrats are are really uh doing is to support the so-called
[3:41:34.340 --> 3:41:42.740]  soft landing where we just kind of continue to slide into a prolonged depression and when
[3:41:42.740 --> 3:41:46.660]  do you think americans will actually start to feel it when will be obvious on the streets
[3:41:46.660 --> 3:41:53.060]  well i you know people i know what's all right uh well i guess i don't know maybe
[3:41:53.060 --> 3:41:58.980]  hot and different but you know where i am in virginia and maryland uh it's it's an area that
[3:41:58.980 --> 3:42:04.420]  gets a lot of federal money uh to support it because there's so much government around here
[3:42:04.420 --> 3:42:10.180]  and so much military but uh you know my sister my mother go to the grocery store and they're
[3:42:10.180 --> 3:42:15.860]  flabbergasted of what they have to pay or and what she has to pay for medication well i guess
[3:42:15.860 --> 3:42:22.020]  at a base level i just see the dull optimism in people's eyes um hoping that a new president
[3:42:22.020 --> 3:42:26.660]  will actually run things and change things i don't know exactly i just have the feeling
[3:42:26.660 --> 3:42:32.580]  that at a gut level we have no idea what's going on on the on the on the ground floor well uh that's
[3:42:32.580 --> 3:42:37.700]  true and that's why one of the things that i'm constantly saying to people is that you have
[3:42:37.700 --> 3:42:43.620]  to get informed about the issues and you have to understand that the root of the problem is the
[3:42:43.620 --> 3:42:52.020]  debt-based usury oriented monetary system that we have had in this country from the very beginning
[3:42:52.020 --> 3:42:58.340]  and it's really the fact that the only way money is introduced into circulation in our economy
[3:42:58.900 --> 3:43:06.500]  is through a bank loan at interest that is along with the export of our manufacturing jobs to third
[3:43:06.500 --> 3:43:13.380]  world countries it's bankrupted the united states and until the american people understand that
[3:43:13.380 --> 3:43:20.500]  and get educated on that and demand that we have a political leaders who can take back the control
[3:43:20.500 --> 3:43:26.820]  of the financial system or the monetary system from the international financiers who have run this
[3:43:26.820 --> 3:43:31.940]  thing in this country for decades nothing will change it will only get worse and it could get
[3:43:31.940 --> 3:43:38.740]  so bad that we have a complete loss of our democratic system or democratic values i mean
[3:43:38.740 --> 3:43:45.460]  it's getting to be that critical yeah shifting gears but probably a parallel with what's going on
[3:43:45.460 --> 3:43:52.580]  i've got a register article here nasa chief blast u.s space policy and leaked a email mike griffin
[3:43:52.580 --> 3:43:58.260]  says the white house is waging jihad against the space shuttle and offers a gloomy view of the future
[3:43:59.140 --> 3:44:04.580]  basically it's everything to do with our russian relations and uh basically we're giving up our spot
[3:44:04.580 --> 3:44:10.980]  on the international um space station system what do you know about this and uh what does this mean
[3:44:10.980 --> 3:44:17.460]  economically and in terms of our future in space yes we have given up on the space station uh once
[3:44:17.460 --> 3:44:24.660]  the shuttle is retired uh in 2010 we will not have a vehicle any longer that can take astronauts
[3:44:24.660 --> 3:44:30.260]  to the space station now the space station was supposed to be a vehicle of international cooperation
[3:44:30.260 --> 3:44:35.780]  where the u.s russia the european space agency japan and other nations would work together
[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:41.540]  for the economic development of space resources the united states has given that up we've walked
[3:44:41.540 --> 3:44:49.700]  away from the space station and we've put all of the money that we have into uh this program of
[3:44:49.700 --> 3:44:55.540]  establishing a base on the moon but the problem is that all the other countries that are now in
[3:44:55.540 --> 3:45:00.500]  space are going to do the same thing we thought we were going to control the avenue from the earth
[3:45:00.500 --> 3:45:06.900]  to the moon through this latest venture which is really the apollo program uh rolled out again
[3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:15.380]  but now russia china the european space agency japan and even india if you can imagine that
[3:45:16.100 --> 3:45:23.300]  are all announcing the fact that they're going to set up moon bases in the next 20 30 years that
[3:45:23.300 --> 3:45:29.300]  will compete with the united states we're even losing our ability to uh have leadership in space
[3:45:30.500 --> 3:45:36.180]  and how does that relate to our game of balderdash with russia on the ground uh basically stepping
[3:45:36.180 --> 3:45:42.660]  up tensions at every level uh defense missile shield uh the georgia conflict uh the central
[3:45:42.660 --> 3:45:48.660]  caucus region and now in space we're giving it all up to uh what's going on with russia well it
[3:45:48.660 --> 3:45:56.980]  depends on uh who controls the uh government coming out of the next election uh right now
[3:45:56.980 --> 3:46:02.260]  we're playing a game of chicken with russia that could lead to a world war three the united states
[3:46:02.260 --> 3:46:11.220]  instigated the attack on uh uh south ocecia that led to the recent uh conflict over georgia and
[3:46:11.220 --> 3:46:18.820]  uh we did that in order to escalate tensions with russia because it's all a way to run away from
[3:46:18.820 --> 3:46:26.020]  our own economic collapse that's it's called a flight forward uh syndrome uh bush has this
[3:46:26.020 --> 3:46:32.020]  great scheme of world conquest that he's been carrying out and russia's the next target uh
[3:46:32.020 --> 3:46:38.260]  for this because russia is the one nation in the world uh that has the ability to separate itself
[3:46:38.260 --> 3:46:45.140]  completely from the financial system of the western uh financial powers and they're doing this
[3:46:45.140 --> 3:46:51.380]  they're taking a stand and they may be taking china uh central asia and possibly even india
[3:46:51.380 --> 3:46:57.220]  with them into a coalition that will draw the line in the sand where the western financiers who
[3:46:57.220 --> 3:47:03.300]  control the western nations including the united states cannot pass now at that point they either
[3:47:03.300 --> 3:47:09.700]  have a choice of trying to go to war against russia which uh a lot of them want to do or
[3:47:09.700 --> 3:47:15.780]  of recognizing that our system is a parasitic system that's totally bankrupt and that has to
[3:47:15.780 --> 3:47:22.100]  be changed the system can be changed that's something that monetary reformers including
[3:47:22.100 --> 3:47:26.420]  myself have tried to get across to people the system can be changed the american system
[3:47:27.060 --> 3:47:32.340]  as it was founded as a republic under the declaration of independence in our constitution
[3:47:32.340 --> 3:47:38.180]  give us the ability to change the system to control our own destiny we gave that power up
[3:47:38.180 --> 3:47:42.900]  when we allowed the financiers to come in and take over our country and our economy
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:48.420]  when the federal reserve system was set up in 1913 everything that's happened since then with one
[3:47:48.420 --> 3:47:54.100]  war after another and the military industrial state that we have now is all a consequence
[3:47:54.100 --> 3:48:02.420]  of losing our financial and our monetary freedom we need to recapture that freedom it can be done
[3:48:02.420 --> 3:48:07.540]  what is it going to take to accomplish that i mean i don't see it happening i see it's just
[3:48:07.540 --> 3:48:13.460]  moving more towards that world war three scenario in my opinion what it takes is the creation of a
[3:48:13.460 --> 3:48:20.260]  new political party we've seen things like the reform party uh the libertarian party
[3:48:20.260 --> 3:48:27.380]  uh the green party but none of them has really stepped up to the necessity of recreating our
[3:48:27.380 --> 3:48:33.220]  constitutional system and by starting with control of our financial and monetary system
[3:48:33.620 --> 3:48:40.500]  now there is one party that recognizes this uh and i don't know if uh they've been on alexis
[3:48:40.500 --> 3:48:47.940]  uh show it's the constitution party uh i have met with officials and candidates of the constitution
[3:48:47.940 --> 3:48:55.700]  party who recognize what the problem really is and who see the monetary system as being the
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:49:01.460]  core issue that needs to be addressed of going back and looking at what the constitution says
[3:49:01.460 --> 3:49:08.180]  about the monetary system where it gives authority over the monetary system to congress now uh i've
[3:49:08.180 --> 3:49:13.460]  met with daryl castle for instance and daryl is the vice presidential candidate uh for the
[3:49:13.460 --> 3:49:21.060]  constitution party he understands this daryl spoke in denver at a rally uh during the democratic
[3:49:21.060 --> 3:49:27.060]  national convention uh and you know brought this to people's attention he's been going all over
[3:49:27.060 --> 3:49:32.580]  the country talking about this now not very many people know about the constitution party
[3:49:32.580 --> 3:49:39.380]  not very many people are going to vote for it but they have an answer to the problem and it's
[3:49:39.380 --> 3:49:44.580]  people like them that need to get into the forefront and that all of us who are writing in
[3:49:44.580 --> 3:49:50.260]  this area need to call attention to if they don't if the american people are too blind
[3:49:50.980 --> 3:49:57.220]  too asleep to begin to think for themselves about these things then no there's no hope for them
[3:49:58.180 --> 3:50:02.340]  sure we need to return to the constitution but first we have to defeat the strange loves
[3:50:02.900 --> 3:50:08.500]  uh a few more minutes with richard c cook i'm erin dykes and for alex jones we will be back
