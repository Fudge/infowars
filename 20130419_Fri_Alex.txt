[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.280 --> 00:21.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.040 --> 00:43.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we are seeing right now is just unprecedented here in the United
[00:43.560 --> 00:52.080]  States. Again, my friends, it is Friday, April 19th, 2013. I just talked to our reporter
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.240]  Dan Badandi that is at Lexington Green. We're oath keepers. We're trying to get through
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.180]  to Stuart Rhodes right now. We're oath keepers. Go ahead and get Dan Badandi on if we can't
[01:01.180 --> 01:03.360]  get ahold of Stuart Rhodes.
[01:03.360 --> 01:10.480]  Where they're being told the police have revoked the permit for them to have a oath taking
[01:10.480 --> 01:16.240]  ceremony to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution because that is the enemy now
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.860]  that the occupiers hate. And of course, they revoked their permit to demonstrate, but the
[01:20.860 --> 01:25.560]  anti-gun group that got their permit revoked, they are allowed to take Lexington Green and
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.420]  make all sorts of red coat Bloombergian announcements.
[01:30.420 --> 01:36.440]  That's happening while Boston and surrounding cities in Massachusetts into Connecticut have
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.560]  martial law declared. They're calling it a civil emergency where they're going to people's
[01:40.560 --> 01:43.600]  houses with machine guns. I was watching the news and you've seen it, they're sitting there
[01:43.600 --> 01:46.680]  aiming guns at people as they drive down city streets.
[01:46.680 --> 01:52.260]  The police are acting like the killer is under every table. And again, people die every day
[01:52.260 --> 01:56.120]  of automobile accidents, you name it. It's just okay, somebody died. But when somebody
[01:56.120 --> 02:03.640]  shot, my gosh, it's over dramatized. And obviously, we feel bad for those that have been killed.
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.880]  It's just that when they kill a whole bunch of people in a drone strike who were innocent,
[02:08.880 --> 02:11.920]  they're like, that's collateral damage, no big deal because it's our loving government
[02:11.920 --> 02:12.920]  doing it.
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.960]  And AP reporters reported that if they try to go out anywhere on the streets basically
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.560]  in a multi-state area, in large areas of Massachusetts and Connecticut, the police come over and
[02:21.560 --> 02:29.280]  aim guns at them and say, you wanna die? Don't you film us, you go back inside. So we don't
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.920]  know if any of what we're being told is true, not by the uncle, not by the media, none of
[02:34.920 --> 02:36.240]  it.
[02:36.240 --> 02:43.840]  Because we have footage of Navy SEALs and other special ops just everywhere around the
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.520]  bombing right before it happens and right after in control of the situation. And they've
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.840]  lied about the drill they clearly had. Witnesses said that they heard announcements of be calm,
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.620]  it's a drill. We know they're lying about that.
[02:56.620 --> 03:07.000]  And here's the New York Times, what does an inside job mean? It runs a spectrum from knowing
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.560]  something's gonna happen and letting it happen, to provocateuring it and arming and aiding
[03:12.560 --> 03:19.360]  the people, to having globalist crime commanders who were over actual terrorists who think
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.000]  they're fighting a jihad, to an absolutely staged event.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.100]  And that's the continuum it runs. And standard procedure to have Arabs, to have Muslims,
[03:30.100 --> 03:33.840]  to have right wingers, to have everybody in a false flag. Same thing with Oklahoma City,
[03:33.840 --> 03:40.680]  I said this on Monday. Minutes into this happening, I said, you'll probably end up having Muslims
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.680]  there.
[03:41.680 --> 03:45.640]  You'll have right winger, rednecks there, and you'll have military there. And you'll
[03:45.640 --> 03:51.560]  have intelligence agencies there, if it's a false flag. And then we will basically not
[03:51.560 --> 04:00.000]  know ever really what happens. It's the signs of the drill and the cover up of the drill.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.400]  And now they could tell us whatever they want. But remember, the CIA for the last decade
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.320]  or more has been funding radical Chechens, Al Qaeda affiliated groups all over Chechen
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.640]  and surrounding areas.
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.200]  These guys were getting scholarships and stuff. It's always the same MO of double agents,
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.160]  triple agents we don't know. And I mean, there is a 1% chance, maybe a 3% chance, maybe even
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.080]  a 5% chance that they're real organic Muslim terrorists who kind of pick up on the hype
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.240]  of all of this war on terror and go out and basically copycat.
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.320]  So that is a factor. This could be a real terror attack, as I've said from day one.
[04:38.320 --> 04:43.220]  It's a very low probability. But then why do you have the big drill with guys with backpacks
[04:43.220 --> 04:48.020]  everywhere right around where it happens staring? And then you had another patsy they said they
[04:48.020 --> 04:51.400]  arrested and it was going to be the redneck. And then they had to abandon that and go with
[04:51.400 --> 04:57.280]  Plan B. And you've got meeting with a shoddy ambassador or foreign minister. And oh, I
[04:57.280 --> 05:00.840]  thought it was the right wingers, the media said.
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.320]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial

[07:59.280 --> 08:11.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[08:11.640 --> 08:22.200]  If you go back to Monday afternoon when I went into overdrive on air to break down what
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.320]  I thought was going to end up happening at the Boston Marathon, you'll find that as usual,
[08:27.320 --> 08:33.140]  we were on target with a spectrum of analysis because I've seen this over and over again.
[08:33.140 --> 08:37.080]  I said if there was a drill and if there's a bunch of federal agents around where the
[08:37.080 --> 08:45.320]  bombing happens, I pulled this article up and I read it on air. Terrorist plots, FBI
[08:45.320 --> 08:51.280]  hatched by the FBI. Terrorist plots that were hatched by the FBI, New York Times, April
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.040]  28th, 2012, which we've reported at on Nauseam.
[08:55.040 --> 08:58.360]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, gave him the detonator with the first World
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.720]  Trade Center attack. Did it mean that the guys that did it weren't radical Islamicist
[09:02.720 --> 09:09.400]  nut jobs? No, no, they were, and they had like 75 IQs. And instead of just stinging
[09:09.400 --> 09:14.600]  them and setting them up, they gave them real weapons and let them go ahead with it so the
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.960]  government could get more funding and take more of our liberties.
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.240]  Our government on record has been funding for 20 years the Chechen rebels to bomb the
[09:23.240 --> 09:28.360]  Russians. That's declassified, just like they created Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and they're
[09:28.360 --> 09:34.200]  putting Al-Qaeda and Taliban in charge in Libya and Syria. I have predicted, and it's
[09:34.200 --> 09:39.200]  actually happened over in the Middle East now, shooting and firing missiles and high
[09:39.200 --> 09:41.960]  caliber rifles at passenger aircraft.
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.040]  I predicted the 10,000 heat seeking missiles that Obama helped give Al-Qaeda in Benghazi
[09:47.040 --> 09:52.120]  and their takeover of Libya. I am predicting that you will see in the next few years they
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.600]  will shoot down Western aircraft with those. Real nut job groups will, and the government
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.800]  will grandstand during it. And I will come out with the articles from 2011, 12, and 13,
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.800]  mainly 2012, 13.
[10:04.800 --> 10:09.000]  I'll say, look, here's where our government helped them get the missiles. This was wrong.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.100]  Don't take my rights. And there will be articles like there are in the LA Times calling me
[10:13.100 --> 10:19.160]  an anti-American dirtbag. Now remember, we got Stuart Rhodes on the line. We're about
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.500]  to go to him from Lexington Green, and he's there with Larry Pratt. Larry's gonna pop
[10:22.500 --> 10:24.340]  in in the next hour.
[10:24.340 --> 10:31.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, they were gonna go with the right wing tea party. Axelrod on Tuesday
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.720]  night said, it's gonna be right wing, it's lone wolf, it's one guy. That's on record.
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.840]  We're gonna play those clips later, in case you missed them. Then they had all the Democratic
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.840]  operatives on Wednesday come out on MSNBC, CNN, you name it.
[10:45.840 --> 10:52.200]  And they said, ladies and gentlemen, it is the right wingers. We're not liberty to say
[10:52.200 --> 10:58.200]  exactly yet, but yes, it's a right wing, probably a soldier. I watched CNN and MSNBC last night
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.220]  before I went on air live on the Nightly News at 7. And I saw CNN with three different hosts
[11:03.220 --> 11:07.680]  and guests all say, it's gonna be a veteran, it's gonna be a Navy SEAL.
[11:07.680 --> 11:14.760]  Now, do you understand that? Where did you hear Navy SEAL first? You heard it here, you
[11:14.760 --> 11:21.120]  heard it here, you heard it here, you heard it here, you heard it here. And then you saw
[11:21.120 --> 11:25.720]  it on Drudge. We didn't say the Navy SEALs did it. The Navy SEALs were called out there
[11:25.720 --> 11:31.720]  in case they wanted to set them up to be standing out in plain view in their unofficial uniforms,
[11:31.720 --> 11:35.500]  which looks like Kraft International, a sheep dip group just like McVeigh.
[11:35.500 --> 11:40.120]  And they were looking at setting up veterans in this country. And that's what all the scum,
[11:40.120 --> 11:45.060]  you saw it on CNN and everywhere else. They were all saying, by Tuesday night, they were
[11:45.060 --> 11:51.200]  saying, we've confirmed and found the quotes. They were saying it might be Navy SEALs, wow,
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.200]  whoa.
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.120]  So they were looking at setting up the rednecks in the audience with the big backpacks. They
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.440]  were looking at the hillbilly types, the achy breaky heart lookalike guys. They were looking
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.960]  at setting up the military. This is how they always run this. I've learned this from the
[12:05.960 --> 12:08.280]  First World Trade Center, had multiple groups there.
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.640]  I've learned this from Oklahoma City, where I've interviewed the police, the detectives,
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.720]  all of them. They had four different groups there. They had Iraqis, they had Iranians,
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.320]  they had CIA, they had German intelligence. I guess there's more than that. They had El
[12:22.320 --> 12:29.440]  Ahim City white supremacists. They had Army Special Forces. I guess that's six groups.
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.080]  And we know their names. We know who was there. The FBI, good guys went public and said, we've
[12:33.080 --> 12:35.240]  seen the footage of McVeigh with all these guys.
[12:35.240 --> 12:42.000]  So I'm gonna go to Stuart Rhodes to get his take on this as a constitutional lawyer. And
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.440]  because I'm gonna get more into this and walk through it all today, but we're being censored
[12:45.440 --> 12:53.000]  all over the place. Officially, this is pouring in and we've tried to post our articles on
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.080]  Facebook and they're being blocked.
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.540]  People are getting errors posting our stuff to Facebook. You cannot publish this link
[12:58.540 --> 13:03.320]  because it contains a dangerous link. They're not saying we're dangerous. Users tried to
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.800]  publish our article Navy Seals Spotted at Boston Marathon, we're getting all the screenshots
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.080]  of this, wearing suspicious backpacks.
[13:10.080 --> 13:15.920]  We're showing this so they don't set up the Navy Seals. And I said that day one when we
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.520]  discovered this. What was it, Wednesday? Went up on Drudge. Drudge was like, hey, look at
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.520]  this, this is important. And the LA Times is out saying there are no Navy Seals and
[13:25.520 --> 13:32.000]  they have a graphic of me as a giant rat with my listeners as rats coming out of a sewer.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.320]  Okay, listen, there are dozens of videos and dozens of photos now of people with Navy Seal
[13:38.320 --> 13:46.480]  insignias that look like Navy Seals. Look like the high school star football players.
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.400]  It looks like any star football team, they're all out there, out there.
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.440]  They were told be there for a drill, we know went on from the eyewitnesses. We know that
[13:56.440 --> 13:59.620]  and we have the police scanners and all of it, the drill happened. They were put out
[13:59.620 --> 14:04.640]  there as cannon fodder, as a smokescreen. And there might have even been explosives
[14:04.640 --> 14:07.600]  in those backpacks, here, hold this.
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.560]  We don't know, but we've seen this before, that's how they set McVeigh up. And again,
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.780]  they tell you play the part of a drill, a drill to find bombs, they set you up. Again,
[14:17.780 --> 14:22.520]  this is done over and over again. But then they weren't able, they said, make sure Stuart
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.300]  Rhodes is there, I'm going to him right now.
[14:25.300 --> 14:30.360]  They've done this over and over again, where they'll have multiple fallbacks. So we released
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.200]  these photos when they didn't think anybody noticed them. Right as they're announcing,
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.400]  we've got our person, CNN's like, we're told it's a right wing lone wolf, one man. We've
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.920]  got the right winger, it's gonna come out, he's arrested, he's at the courthouse.
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.000]  Then they panic and go, no, no, forget that, there's no arrest, forget it. And let's all
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.920]  go to sleep, and let's evacuate the courthouse and forget you ever saw that. And I said,
[14:52.920 --> 14:57.000]  they're going from the right wingers probably, to now they're gonna go with a Muslim. And
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.120]  I said that, because why they have all these Muslims clearly crawling around there, obviously
[15:01.120 --> 15:03.520]  part of it with their body language and everything.
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.160]  Probably thinking they're patriots, who've been recruited out of colleges. And these
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.060]  guys were clearly recruited out of colleges. Now, could they be double agents for some
[15:11.060 --> 15:18.280]  Muslim group? Yes, they could be real. The point is, over 100 cases the last 16, 17 years,
[15:18.280 --> 15:23.560]  I guess longer since 1993, that's 20 years, that are on record where the FBI finds mentally
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.720]  ill people, gives them the weapons, and then orders them to carry out the attack as their
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.560]  imam.
[15:29.560 --> 15:37.260]  As their imam, they have FBI agents and officers and minions that are fake imams that command
[15:37.260 --> 15:42.920]  these guys to do this stuff. So they can take our liberty and set up martial law all over
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.040]  Boston, all the way into Connecticut, aiming guns at people at checkpoints, threatening
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.160]  to kill AP reporters, APs reporting, going in houses, house to house, a giant martial
[15:52.160 --> 15:53.160]  law exercise.
[15:53.160 --> 15:56.200]  And now there was a shootout, they're gonna blame the Second Amendment. Now, he's leaving
[15:56.200 --> 16:02.320]  Lexington Green, the police were going to block them. But I mean, Larry Pratt and Stewart
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.960]  said, you're violating our rights, and so they backed off. But I wanna get as a constitutional
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.720]  lawyer, the head of Oath Keepers, and of course, worked for Ron Paul in Congress as well.
[16:11.720 --> 16:16.640]  I wanna get your take on, is it not martial law when Fourth Amendment's suspended, and
[16:16.640 --> 16:21.800]  they're pointing guns at everybody in a multi-state area and going in houses. Stewart Rhodes,
[16:21.800 --> 16:23.360]  what are we seeing happen here, sir?
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.360]  Well, it is actually the exact upside down of how it's supposed to be. In the Founders
[16:28.360 --> 16:33.200]  era, there was someone like that running around killing people. It would have been a hue and
[16:33.200 --> 16:39.760]  a cry gone up, and the entire community would have turned out and hunted them down.
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.960]  If that guy was outside my house shooting at cops, I'd have flied my M4 out and kill
[16:43.960 --> 16:44.960]  him, exactly.
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.160]  Right, exactly, that's what should happen. As I said in an alert I sent around a little
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.320]  while ago, we hope he shows up at Lexington Green cuz we'll either kill or capture him.
[16:52.320 --> 16:56.680]  So this is what we're supposed to be doing, it's really sad. So in response to this, it
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.160]  should be, we all turn out and we hunt him down. You know who your neighbors are, you
[17:01.160 --> 17:04.880]  know who belongs and who don't, in pretty short order you could have found him. But
[17:04.880 --> 17:09.840]  instead the message is, let the wolf around. Now all you sheep must stay in your pens,
[17:09.840 --> 17:14.200]  stay in your barns, and let us professional sheep herders and sheep dogs hunt down the
[17:14.200 --> 17:18.480]  wolf. You stay in your house, we'll come into your house one by one and search it to make
[17:18.480 --> 17:22.080]  sure us authorized professionals will do it.
[17:22.080 --> 17:23.080]  That's exactly-
[17:23.080 --> 17:29.640]  And make a giant scene out of it. I predict that if he was in an area of Texas, he'd already
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.640]  be dead.
[17:30.640 --> 17:36.240]  He'd be dead, that's exactly right. What you do, the answer is, let us have guns so we
[17:36.240 --> 17:39.960]  can turn out and go hunting down. And the thing goes for our gathering at Lexington
[17:39.960 --> 17:45.800]  Green, it was absurd to have the town selectmen arguing about it. They can't provide protection
[17:45.800 --> 17:50.440]  to a bunch of current serving and retired military employees, a bunch of combat veterans
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.280]  standing on the green as though we need their protection. It's absolutely absurd.
[17:54.280 --> 18:02.040]  You're not even allowed to be on the green as if one guy is omnipresent and multiple
[18:02.040 --> 18:04.720]  states have to fall to their knees and you're-
[18:04.720 --> 18:09.320]  Alex, this morning we were at Concord Bridge and there was a reenactment there. A large
[18:09.320 --> 18:13.320]  crowd of folks watched the reenactment. We were able to walk all over the place and do
[18:13.320 --> 18:17.760]  whatever we want. Apparently, there wasn't the same emergency at Concord, but there was
[18:17.760 --> 18:19.680]  at Lexington just down the street.
[18:19.680 --> 18:25.160]  So it's absolute pretext. This is the same argument that was used by Bull Connor, got
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.320]  in Birmingham, to stop the civil rights marchers. They said, I can't protect you against the
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.080]  Klan, so therefore you can't march. And if you march, I'm going to sit my attack dogs
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.400]  on you and spray you with water hoses. So it was a nonsense argument that shut down
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.280]  their free speech. This was the same. The town selectmen used the exact same argument.
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.680]  We petitioned Blake Felipe and the 10th Amendment Center, followed emergency petition yesterday
[18:49.680 --> 18:54.560]  for injunction with the court. The court ruled this morning against us, saying that because
[18:54.560 --> 18:59.840]  of the emergency situation, that we had no merit in our claim. Total nonsense. We will
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.400]  take care of ourselves. And when we went to Lexington, there's nothing going on in Lexington,
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.600]  except we're standing there to do an oath ceremony. And luckily, the captain in charge,
[19:09.600 --> 19:16.240]  Captain Thoreau, was sympathetic and respectful of our rights, and let us stand in front of
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.240]  the tavern there on the green and do our oath.
[19:18.240 --> 19:22.240]  Despite the fact he'd been told not to let you.
[19:22.240 --> 19:28.080]  Well, we were not allowed to do the rally, but he let us do the, we said this morning,
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.520]  we're going to go and do this. We're going to go on Lexington Green. I went there prepared
[19:31.520 --> 19:36.560]  to be arrested, as did a bunch of other veterans. And our message to the police was, look, you
[19:36.560 --> 19:41.280]  can either let us take five minutes to do our oath ceremony on the green, or you can
[19:41.280 --> 19:45.440]  process, you know, arrest and process all of these veterans and retired cops.
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.280]  I mean, is this a free country? Is this a free country? Stay there.
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.200]  You could say they blinked, but I think the way I can file cops, I think in fairness to
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.280]  them, they are respectful of our rights. In fact, one of the-
[19:57.280 --> 19:59.280]  All right, Stuart, stay there. Gotta go to break. Stay there.
[19:59.280 --> 20:06.960]  Ceramic body armor is rated to stop six hits, but what about the seventh? Unlike
[20:06.960 --> 20:12.480]  ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel body armor is proven to take hit after hit, and it just won't quit.
[20:12.480 --> 20:16.720]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prepper, Infidel stops hundreds of
[20:16.720 --> 20:21.920]  hits from small arms to high powered rifles. That means safety and peace of mind. Buy yours
[20:21.920 --> 20:29.840]  at infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor.com. Infidel body armor just won't
[20:29.840 --> 20:34.000]  quit. We the people grow cotton and wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest,
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.400]  forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.840]  bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[20:45.840 --> 20:49.600]  standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains
[20:49.600 --> 20:54.960]  our monetary system. Call for your copy of 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the

[21:02.800 --> 21:08.560]  huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us
[21:08.560 --> 21:13.360]  $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than
[21:13.360 --> 21:18.160]  50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[21:18.160 --> 21:23.920]  The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be

[23:59.840 --> 24:19.360]  Well,
[24:19.360 --> 24:26.800]  the father of Zarnave says that if anything happens to his son, ABC News is reporting,
[24:26.800 --> 24:32.880]  all hell will break loose. He says that from the country that's right next door to
[24:34.160 --> 24:40.720]  Chechnya. I mean, this is ridiculous. America shakes in its boots over one guy running around
[24:40.720 --> 24:48.880]  and multi states, multi states basically have martial law in place. Can you imagine if a real
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.840]  civil war actually broke out in this country and they try to take our guns?
[24:53.840 --> 25:03.520]  I mean, you had just police everywhere in groups trying to engage us. That's why 100,000
[25:03.520 --> 25:09.040]  US troops couldn't keep and hold Baghdad. That's why they had to stir up sea ites and Sunnis to
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.520]  kill each other to control the area. And ladies and gentlemen, again, they bring in these foreigners
[25:13.520 --> 25:18.800]  at record numbers, give them scholarships, wind them up, allow them to attack, and that's a type
[25:18.800 --> 25:24.560]  of false flag. You have this full spectrum from where they know something's gonna happen and let
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.440]  it happen, that's a false flag to get what you want. To they provocateur it and nudge you and
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.160]  fund you, to where they purely provocateur where they command you and give you the bomb,
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.840]  give you the detonators, FBI's done that over 100 times on record.
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.600]  To the government does it all itself or uses contractors and then blames the patsy.
[25:43.600 --> 25:48.720]  And most of them are where they provocateur and wind the person up. But the big spectacular ones,
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.800]  like 9-11, that's a manufactured deal where they had some double agent cutouts. And that came out
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.960]  that Mohammed Atta and all those guys worked for the CIA. And that came out in Newsweek,
[26:00.080 --> 26:03.600]  that people are ignorant and go, all right, conspiracy theorists, these are facts.
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.000]  Let me ask you this question, Stuart Rhodes, you clearly got what looks like Craft International.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.880]  It's their skull with the red craft on it. And it looks like Craft International is
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.040]  and it looks like trucks they use. And they're trying to keep this off the web everywhere.
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.880]  The FBI said in this press conference, do not look at anything else but this.
[26:22.880 --> 26:30.400]  And you've got the Navy SEALs all standing, I mean, 20, 30 feet from where the bomb goes off.
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.720]  We've confirmed there was a drill, witnesses, the police scanners. So they use the drill.
[26:38.480 --> 26:41.760]  One could argue they're trying to stop the bombing, but why would they then lie about
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.720]  that? They would say we tried to stop it. Plus they weren't in the bearing of searching people.
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.320]  They said never mind the backpacks, this is a drill. So do they use a drill to make the
[26:50.320 --> 26:56.560]  cops stand down so the backpacks could get in? Again, whoever made that order, police,
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.440]  that's who is in control of this. Stuart Rhodes, what do you say about the false flag angle of
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.440]  this? Because they don't want us to look at these Navy SEALs and what looks like special
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.280]  forces of other branches crawling all over right before the bomb happened.
[27:09.280 --> 27:13.280]  What do you say from your research? Well, I mean, I can't, like I said to you,
[27:13.280 --> 27:19.680]  Dan, when I was talking to you, I can't tell by someone's clothing who they are. But as you said,
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.320]  this has been the pattern. This has been a well-established pattern of our government to
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.800]  set up people that they fund to go do something and then they want to stop them before they
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.240]  commit the act. Sometimes they get through. That's happened before.
[27:34.240 --> 27:36.560]  And so that's all I would want to say about that though.
[27:36.560 --> 27:40.400]  Exactly. I'm sure there have been relevance. I mean, you gotta say to the FBI, it's immoral
[27:40.400 --> 27:44.800]  that they go find mentally ill people and try to train them to blow stuff up. And 99% of the time,
[27:44.800 --> 27:51.040]  they stop them before they do it. But Oklahoma City, there was a drill and a bomb sting they
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.360]  claimed went bad. And of course, we know that's not what really happened. So that's why I'm
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.840]  saying we need to look at this as the number one. Who stands to gain from this? We know we're gonna
[28:01.840 --> 28:06.720]  lose liberties because of this, Stuart. Well, that's the thing. Like I said the other day,
[28:06.720 --> 28:12.320]  whether it turned out to be foreign or domestic, they're still going to use the, you know,
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.960]  it's a pretext to clamp down more on our freedom. That's what we just saw. Like I said, it's exactly
[28:16.960 --> 28:21.920]  upside down how it's supposed to be. Constitutional Homeland Security is you and me with our guns in
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.560]  our hands and our eyes and our ears open wide open and go on and find out who the guy is. That
[28:26.560 --> 28:30.560]  was the whole point of a militia. That's the whole point of a posse. That's the whole point
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.120]  of a hue and a cry. Not to go close your doors and stay inside your house with professionals
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.720]  handling. That's fast backwards. All right, finishing your story. So the police,
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.840]  we call it a victory in America that you can go to a public green. I mean, what is this,
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.200]  Tiananmen Square? But the police were not completely tyrannical, so that's good.
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.920]  Well, they were, you know, because of them, the captain in charge was very sympathetic
[28:55.920 --> 29:02.560]  and on our side. And he let us stand in front of what's known as the tavern? Buckman Tavern,
[29:02.560 --> 29:06.560]  which is part of the green. We stood in front of Buckman's Tavern and renewed our oaths there.
[29:06.560 --> 29:10.720]  And we held a nice oath ceremony with a prayer. We had a Vietnam combat vet Marine
[29:11.440 --> 29:16.080]  do the oath ceremony. And I, you know, told we're here to follow the footsteps of the
[29:16.080 --> 29:21.360]  founding generation. We had a motion company in 1798 stand on the green and renew their oaths.
[29:21.360 --> 29:24.720]  That's why we're there to do the same thing. And so the police were respectful. The town
[29:24.720 --> 29:28.240]  councilmen were not. And so our fight is with them, not with the rank and file.
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.640]  No, exactly. We always experience the politicians are corrupt while the rank and file police
[29:32.640 --> 29:35.760]  officers are not. They're good to go. Oathkeepers.org. I know you're going to go
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.880]  speak with Larry. We're going to get him to talk in about, go ahead.
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.840]  We also have the, we have the crew here from gray state and they're filming everything that's going
[29:43.840 --> 29:49.440]  on. We'll share the food and they're doing it for the Oathkeeper movie project. Good job. Good job,
[29:49.440 --> 29:56.480]  Stuart. We're on the March, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.040 --> 30:06.640]  In the last two years alone, the U S has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms
[30:06.640 --> 30:11.840]  and floods raged across the U S costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone in 2012.
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.240]  We saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[30:16.240 --> 30:21.600]  out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are, we all are food
[30:21.600 --> 30:26.000]  shortages, drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.440]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with

[33:34.000 --> 33:38.560]  at men and women in their cars jerking people out going in houses they're about to have a
[33:38.560 --> 33:45.520]  press conference i was just watching it out there with just incredible off the chart unbelievable
[33:47.120 --> 33:58.720]  grandstanding grandstanding going on with just u.s army troops police everything an orgy of
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.480]  martial law and now they're saying we're going to have tsa on every street corner we're going to
[34:04.480 --> 34:12.240]  search the malls none of you have due process none of you have any rights none of you have any future

[34:18.720 --> 34:22.960]  the free home of the brave but the border's wide open i've been down to the texas border shot video
[34:22.960 --> 34:27.440]  of it where illegal aliens just come back and forth ride their horses across and the border
[34:27.440 --> 34:34.720]  patrols down there harassing university of texas alumni who had a couple kurz lights in their
[34:34.720 --> 34:39.040]  cooler they were down there searching them and giving them tickets and taking them to jail while
[34:39.040 --> 34:44.720]  illegal aliens just walked past gotten cars on our side and drove by the illegal aliens build the
[34:44.720 --> 34:49.520]  fake border fences the illegal aliens get get to have their babies free they get to get out of jail

[34:56.160 --> 35:03.360]  more men playing army punch up info wars.com for me i want to show people this i mean just just
[35:03.360 --> 35:10.240]  just look at this right here men playing army uh we're all festooned in their gear treating us like
[35:10.240 --> 35:16.240]  garbage saying they don't care what the law is because they're going to keep us safe from the
[35:16.240 --> 35:22.560]  terrorist and then the media is is is is so incredibly servile let's let's show some of the
[35:22.560 --> 35:29.680]  navy's uh let's let let's show some of the navy seal what's not working right now
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.240]  hey well that's okay it's okay it doesn't matter let's show everybody
[35:36.240 --> 35:43.520]  the navy seals they don't want people to see let's let's go to that oh by the way i've said
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.840]  there's been a mainstream media dinosaur media blackout on this because the la times uh document
[35:49.840 --> 36:00.000]  cam please gentlemen the la times uh is reporting uh that i am basically a big fat giant demonic
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.600]  rat that says internet sewer and shows a manhole sewer cover and it says right on schedule the
[36:05.600 --> 36:11.280]  vermin surface the u.s government orchestrated the boston marathon bombing obama did it so he
[36:11.280 --> 36:20.720]  can take our guns he used navy seals backed up by flying monkeys from oz that's the la times oh
[36:21.360 --> 36:28.480]  oh la times alex jones has a sick theory about the boston marathon bombings la times david
[36:29.840 --> 36:36.320]  horsey now oh wait but i have a problem here for him what does this say for for
[36:36.320 --> 36:43.920]  radio listeners you can go to the washington post this is the washington times
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.640]  there's also a blurb in the washington post men with backpacks at boston marathon private
[36:50.640 --> 36:59.840]  contractors and it goes on to say that they've denied that or won't comment but that sure enough
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.280]  these look like people wearing craft international uniforms that is a sheep dip group
[37:05.280 --> 37:11.920]  for navy seals and they look like navy seals okay the point is they're crawling all over right where
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.640]  the bombing goes off and we know there was a drill but they say there wasn't a drill
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.400]  and they're desperate that no one see this and you have the fbi spokesman saying do not look at
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.000]  anything else from in and around the bomb but these two men we're going to show you this is it
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  this is what you look at whatever you do don't look at other stuff and i have all the evil
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.760]  photos and videos they say you're not supposed to look at up at infowars.com and as soon as christie
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.280]  has those screenshots because she said before the show she was getting them so let's see if she's
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.520]  already probably emailed those over to us don't worry about the cnn feed not working guys let's
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.960]  just shut that down and not worry about it okay i want to get the feed of this to show everybody
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.080]  this people are getting errors posting our stuff to facebook you cannot publish this link because
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.920]  it contains a dangerous link and i've seen this all over youtube people are commenting
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.800]  that user tried to publish our article navy still spotted at boston marathon wearing suspicious
[38:10.800 --> 38:15.360]  backpacks and it goes on to say customer service here at our office is being flooded with calls
[38:15.360 --> 38:22.000]  saying and emails saying the exact same thing so so they don't want this discussed okay because
[38:22.000 --> 38:30.560]  it fits the mo of drills being run to protect the crazy patsies or the crazy wound up goons
[38:30.560 --> 38:37.760]  uh the the the the the provocateur and lunatics just like the feds protected the two guys that
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.440]  drove the bomb that the feds had cooked and and give them real detonators to bomb the world trade
[38:43.440 --> 38:51.440]  center in 1993 and and again uh there it is uh in the washington times infowars.com reports
[38:51.440 --> 38:56.160]  the photographs were sent to them by anonymous along with photos of possible suspects the fbi
[38:56.160 --> 39:01.680]  asked media not to distribute now of course we put this out almost two days before they said
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.800]  don't distribute them and by the way we did google searches on these images you can do that function
[39:06.800 --> 39:12.000]  these are on real facebook real news sites so at first they said help us look at all the photos
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.480]  we're like okay well here are these oh no don't look at those whatever you do because you've got
[39:16.480 --> 39:21.360]  these navy seals or what looks like navy seals with the police and the photos and videos pretty
[39:21.360 --> 39:27.280]  much in charge and it's clearly some type of drill going on 20 30 feet from where the bombs go off
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.480]  and then you've got all the high def photos of what looks like people that you know look like
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.200]  they've got the shape of the pressure cookers in in the bags you can see the bulges you've got
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.200]  all these different patsy groups and i immediately identified that tuesday
[39:43.920 --> 39:47.760]  when watson discovered all this i said look at how they got the redneck patsies
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.280]  look in the different direction the body language look at how they've got the arab patsies
[39:51.280 --> 39:54.640]  look at how they've got and the seals are all standing around like what are we doing
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.280]  and they just get a bunch of people in there and then who knows who really planted the bombs
[39:59.920 --> 40:08.000]  it might have been uh zar nav is this zardoz or something i mean uh science fiction names
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.480]  i mean uh yeah jokar jokar is the one living uh and uh zar nav is the last name and tamarlin
[40:16.480 --> 40:22.560]  tamarlin is the supposed larger boxer brother uh who's dead i mean who knows if any of it's true
[40:22.560 --> 40:30.080]  maybe it's all true maybe none of it's true all i know is you acted guilty as sin when drills and
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.280]  stand downs were brought up at those three press conferences i mean ladies and gentlemen when we
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.480]  plugged infowars.com whenever dan bedondi our reporter in the third press conference
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.400]  after they canceled the others and by the way the police and fbi came over and said
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.240]  you're gonna you and infowars are gonna be good now right you're not gonna cause a problem and
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.440]  why didn't they arrest them or throw them out they didn't want to make a scene in front of all the
[40:51.440 --> 40:57.280]  reporters they knew to just act like it's nothing and just talk over him he'd say hey i have photos
[40:57.280 --> 41:02.320]  here of all these others what may be suspects and why were their navy seals there they're like
[41:02.320 --> 41:09.120]  talking over him he goes it's on infowars.com that was on every channel in the western world
[41:09.120 --> 41:14.320]  yesterday and we were we were it's a testament to our it people on our caching servers we were
[41:14.320 --> 41:22.720]  getting 100,000 new visitors every 60 seconds not hits visitors for about an hour and the site
[41:22.720 --> 41:35.280]  stayed up 100,000 visitors a minute i haven't had time to even look at all the analytics on this
[41:35.280 --> 41:41.040]  and the point is if the system didn't want this to get out it did okay and it's it's been mentioned
[41:41.040 --> 41:46.240]  in the washington post as a tiny footnote and the washington times that oh who are these people they
[41:46.240 --> 41:51.200]  look like contractors gee you see them telling cops what to do with big black backpacks on
[41:51.920 --> 41:56.480]  staring in the direction of where the bomb goes off and then right around it right after it happens
[41:56.480 --> 42:04.720]  right after it happens and again i have a limited crew and i have a limited staff
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.280]  and i already had interviews for upcoming films my a lot of my crews out in california right now
[42:10.240 --> 42:16.080]  but i need listeners to do this we need to get and we have a bunch of these clips coming up we
[42:16.080 --> 42:22.080]  have we probably have i don't know let's not exaggerate 15 clips of chris matthews on msnbc
[42:22.080 --> 42:30.640]  and cnn and and and guest of our favorite red coat piers morgan and everybody everybody
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.200]  on cnn msnbc cnbc even fox saying this will probably end up being military vets that are
[42:39.200 --> 42:47.760]  disgruntled maybe even navy seals i saw cnn and msnbc four times and i'm believing i'm not
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.840]  watching the news it's kind of on during breaks and on while i'm doing research or i'll see it
[42:51.840 --> 42:58.160]  on youtube four times say navy seals in fact before we saw these photos of navy seals
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.640]  i guess it was wednesday yeah so so we we found out about this wednesday
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.800]  tuesday i saw cnn and then i saw text of other shows saying and people sent me transcripts
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.240]  of them going yeah it could be like disgruntled navy seals so now that tells me and these were
[43:16.240 --> 43:22.560]  like globalist operatives on tv you know top fbi analyst you know could be navy seals what
[43:23.200 --> 43:25.520]  so we've got to go dig all that creepiness up
[43:27.040 --> 43:30.000]  they they were actually thinking about framing navy seals
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.360]  because i mean who would come up with navy seals
[43:38.240 --> 43:42.000]  it's like all this stuff about the the the patriot groups are going to work with al-qaeda
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.720]  to attack america and all these tv shows not based in reality but creating this narrative
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.480]  and you get the internal homeland security training manuals this is why i say all this
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.680]  and it's like yes yes the army war college is training that we're going to have to engage
[43:55.680 --> 43:59.840]  christians working with al-qaeda to bomb the police stations and they teach the state police
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.720]  this the state police go the christians are with al-qaeda and are gonna bomb us we need
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.880]  to confiscate their guns what fox news reported this two weeks ago and we've got it on screen
[44:10.880 --> 44:18.400]  of your tv viewer so i'm up here going g if something happens and they try to blame patriots
[44:18.400 --> 44:22.640]  and then it happened and with no evidence they start saying it's going to be a lone wolf white
[44:22.640 --> 44:30.640]  person media matters is directly white house run on record salon heavily connected slate
[44:30.640 --> 44:38.320]  heavily connected time magazine newsweek cnn msnbc msnbc half their host or obama former
[44:38.320 --> 44:47.680]  white house operatives but gala on cnn and i mean every time i turn it on or walk by to get coffee
[44:47.680 --> 44:53.920]  in the break we got tvs all over the office with different channels on it is just 24 you saw it
[44:53.920 --> 45:00.400]  you saw it you saw it and i surmise that because we showed the patsies and the navy seals by them
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.040]  because we don't know what the truth is now that they might shift on to another patsy and they'd
[45:05.040 --> 45:09.440]  already said oh we made an arrest it's who we believe did it hey pop the champagne remember
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.720]  that wednesday and then suddenly oh my gosh no forget it evacuate the courthouse never mind get
[45:14.720 --> 45:20.320]  the media out here don't let people see who the guy is oh my gosh uh shift to another plan and now
[45:20.320 --> 45:26.160]  the plan is full martial law rollout were these operatives they tried to set up or did they have
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.760]  other special forces attacked the police and they've already killed these brothers you don't
[45:29.760 --> 45:36.960]  know what happened or maybe they really were wind-up toy muslim extremist in this country for
[45:37.840 --> 45:44.720]  over a decade all of this going on i want to get former nsa analyst wayne madsen on guys let's
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.600]  call him today i want to get him to pop in i want to get joel scowlson i want to get him on i want
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.840]  joel scowlson on we got larry pratt to give us his take already coming up i want everybody uh i want
[45:55.840 --> 46:01.600]  to get um i want to get all the different views on this scowlson agrees false flag day one because
[46:01.600 --> 46:11.840]  the scripting but the whole thing unraveled and they are in mega mega panic mode right now to to
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.800]  to say do not look at these photos and again i i don't know everything when i was first looking
[46:16.800 --> 46:23.600]  at it nobody does i was like navy seals how dare you try to imply a disgruntled navy seal would
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.320]  go blow up the boston marathon and now i get it they're probably telling these navy seals you keep
[46:28.320 --> 46:34.800]  your mouth shut or you're going to go to jail that's exactly how they work see that see they
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.160]  weren't sure they'd get away with it with mcveigh at oklahoma city uh special forces sheep-dipped
[46:40.160 --> 46:46.960]  on record highly decorated from the gulf war that came out he was you know sheep-dipped means put
[46:46.960 --> 46:54.400]  into black ops for those that don't know they had the arab contingency both iraqi and iranian
[46:54.400 --> 47:00.160]  actually in the city checked in part of it we know the names it was on local newscast as another
[47:00.160 --> 47:06.560]  backup plan and but because it went so well they pinned it on patriots and the word had been given
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.840]  wednesday morning msnbc cnn all of it i cannot stress the magnitude of this they're like yep
[47:11.840 --> 47:18.080]  okay axlrod and others say it's lone wolf right wing we told you it's a white guy get ready it's
[47:18.080 --> 47:24.560]  going to be the announcement's coming and then yep we've got them arrested you right wingers are in
[47:24.560 --> 47:32.400]  trouble and then it shifts to muslims who they might have wound up to do it and then they were
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.480]  going to have some navy seals and rednecks there and maybe blame all them because they've shared
[47:36.480 --> 47:42.960]  the number one enemies now returning veterans maybe chris kyle got word of this that that whole
[47:42.960 --> 47:48.080]  chris kyle killing stinks to high heaven the guy that ran craft international and then his people
[47:48.080 --> 47:52.960]  because they're wearing craft uniforms it's none of you know it's black black shirt the tan pants
[47:52.960 --> 47:59.200]  tan boots the craft hat with the punisher skull that's really a vietnam symbol but adopted by
[47:59.200 --> 48:06.720]  the seals a long time ago that says craft on it i mean or they're framing craft and by the way we
[48:06.720 --> 48:13.040]  tried to put calls into craft um i'm gonna put more calls into them by the way i should open
[48:13.040 --> 48:19.520]  the phones up specifically for people uh i mean here i bet craft's listening right now you're
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.760]  welcome to call in you're absolutely welcome in fact i want to tell my reporters david knight
[48:23.760 --> 48:30.720]  uh and jakari jackson and and uh uh everybody else that's here i want you to all call craft
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.400]  right now officially and get statements uh we need to be doing all this work right now
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.680]  we're gonna get joel scowls in to pop back in we're gonna everybody to pop back in
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.240]  but i want to specifically open the phones up
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.080]  there are a lot of lieutenant colonels and people going public saying this is black ops they saw
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.760]  used to overthrow third world countries i mean this is classic what you're seeing
[48:51.760 --> 48:57.280]  and and as and as former black op commander one of the founders of delta force botanic said
[48:57.280 --> 49:04.560]  definitely a staged event to smoke screen the congressional committee bipartisan saying yes
[49:04.560 --> 49:10.240]  organized torture including of children serious war crime there needs to be indictments made of
[49:10.240 --> 49:16.640]  george w bush and barack obama and you notice the next day all this happens uh and the new
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.920]  york times wouldn't have published that unless there it was bipartisan saying obama's a war
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.840]  criminal as well that wouldn't be done unless there was a huge fight going on inside the system
[49:27.840 --> 49:34.000]  the magnitude of which we we we may have never seen and again i cannot stress to you how big
[49:34.000 --> 49:46.560]  this is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 imagine if dallas texas had one lone gunman on the loose
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.920]  and they locked the entire city down and in the suburbs that are a total of like six seven million
[49:51.920 --> 49:59.840]  people in the dfw area and imagine you're driving and police are aiming m16s at you and bugging
[49:59.840 --> 50:05.360]  their eyes out and just drama queening everywhere i mean is this what america's become i mean in the
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.080]  old days there was a lone gunman somewhere if they didn't know exactly sure he locked down the area
[50:10.080 --> 50:18.400]  you thought he was in but there's no point in saying we paralyze everything uh i mean and you
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.880]  know it's dorner a crazy cop and they burn him down in front of everybody and say we're gonna
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.640]  burn him down okay get the fire we're burning them down and then say you didn't hear that
[50:26.640 --> 50:33.280]  and now they're they've got guys that look like green berets 50 something you know like
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.760]  super high level above delta force running around out there i mean i know the look of
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.520]  those real operators folks you've got younger seals all over the place iraq vets you got black
[50:43.520 --> 50:46.640]  backpacks you've got a drill you've got them tell people be calm don't worry about all these
[50:46.640 --> 50:51.920]  backpacks then it all blows up and i'm not supposed to discuss that and facebook's trying
[50:51.920 --> 50:57.520]  to block us putting this out right now because the key to what obama and his controllers were trying
[50:57.520 --> 51:07.680]  is is is is in that event around the bomb curious about what comes next next is the feeling of
[51:07.680 --> 51:13.200]  vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars

[53:39.760 --> 53:46.320]  monopoly the video at exposed 123.com has already been banned by google and the liberal media is
[53:46.320 --> 53:51.200]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep america in the dark so watch it now
[53:51.200 --> 53:57.440]  at exposed 123.com before it's too late again that's exposed 123.com
[53:57.440 --> 54:04.880]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[54:04.880 --> 54:11.840]  it's alex jones only on the gcn radio network waging war on corruption i want to open the

[54:22.960 --> 54:27.840]  amendment perspective i want to hear from police in massachusetts or connecticut with this martial
[54:27.840 --> 54:33.280]  law going on i want to hear from navy fields or special ops people about the photos we've posted
[54:33.280 --> 54:40.080]  that are confirmed from the local news i mean these photos have been in data caches and they
[54:40.080 --> 54:45.680]  do not want them seen why is that well because it shows there was a drill going on at the very time
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.320]  and they were clearly not trying to stop a bombing they did a drill so the police wouldn't think
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.600]  backpacks were an issue and they flooded it with a bunch of different patsies so that they would
[54:55.600 --> 55:01.680]  have confusion now that's my view on this that's the history and now you've got out of the stands
[55:01.680 --> 55:07.840]  out of the cia-run chechen area these new patsies uh and now the boston police are saying get ready
[55:07.840 --> 55:13.200]  for a controlled demolition or a controlled detonation today just like in madrid they blew
[55:13.200 --> 55:18.640]  up the patsies that time it came out the government did do that on 333 back in 2003 that was in the
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.000]  spanish papers it came out that was staged see they have a history of this now these may be real
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.320]  terrorists who they wound up and allowed to do this though that's why they had the big drill
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.080]  going so they could walk right into the finish line and everybody would just think it was part
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.720]  of the drill you understand that folks and then all it takes is people in homeland security to
[55:40.720 --> 55:46.400]  say do a drill and no one else knows but them so if their people get caught oh it's just a drill
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.680]  do you understand that's why they do the drill the drill is the tell and then now they don't
[55:51.680 --> 55:56.240]  want these photos out i mean that's the bigger tell it was crawling with operatives every five

[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:20.560]  are in boston and surrounding areas what are you seeing 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 larry pratt who
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:26.560]  is in massachusetts there for patriot day celebrations patriot day there is the 15th but
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.560]  patriots day nationwide is the 19th. he's going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour briefly
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.840]  and we've got other folks that are saying this is clearly a false flag like joel scowlson of world
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.480]  affairs brief we're lining him up as well now when i say false flag that can mean there's simply a
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.920]  stand down they allow people to get through criminal elements to or it can mean government
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:54.240]  funds them or it can mean private groups fund them and then it's used to be blamed on another group
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.480]  whenever the white house chief of staff said we'll use crises to take your liberties don't let a
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.840]  good crisis go to waste that's a false flag if something real happens and you use it to take
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:14.000]  somebody else's freedom that's a frame up that's a false flag that's a self-inflicted staged event
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.040]  now here is the new york times from last april that i'm going to your calls terrorist plots
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.960]  hatched by the fbi and the article goes on april 28th to admit they would go out and find mentally
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.760]  ill people left wing right wing muslim you name it and give them bombs tell them that they're
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.880]  their imam order them in the name of islam to go do this and then let them go do it
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.480]  i mean i could go out and find schizophrenics on the street and convince them to do stuff too
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:47.680]  i that makes you culpable that's not a sting that is that is beyond that that is leading criminal
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:53.200]  actions to justify your existence so when i say false flag i've explained this it doesn't mean
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.640]  the government's there you know obama with a plunger pushing it down it means criminal
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.640]  elements in there allow this to happen now what's the big telltale side of me just joined us
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.520]  you saw them on tuesday and wednesday say oh axelrod says it's got it is a lone wolf
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.320]  right winger it'll be coming out soon then they go we have an arrest we have them it's he's at
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.960]  the courthouse then no we don't evacuate the courthouse clearly to get the media out army
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.400]  truck pulls in with guys hanging off with guns they go screeching off with whoever that patsy
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:32.000]  was you have navy seals or what looks like navy seals with craft international all over the area
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.360]  where the bombing happens along with what looked like older green berets uh and and others i just
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.680]  want to these people look being around them at events over the years and even the washington
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.080]  times runs the headline scroll back to the headline i want to show tv viewers this and
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.840]  give it to the radio listeners thank you guys men with backpacks at boston marathon private
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:58.880]  contractors now it gets worse now facebook will not let us share our original article picked up
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:05.760]  by drudge wednesday night showing public photos and public news videos that show all the black
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.200]  ops and the drill because they've denied there's a drill and there's a cover-up now again why do
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:19.520]  you do a drill why do you do a drill because because then if if police actually catch these
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:25.760]  the psychos that you've wound up who you're gonna let bomb probably it could be these guys from
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.680]  chechnya you're gonna let them go do it and then you're gonna blame it on the militia on the
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.120]  patriots which the white house run msnbc and others were saying we've got them it's right
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.320]  wingers remember wednesday it is the white right wingers the tea partiers you murderers
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.080]  we got the photos of the arabs and all the different groups and the muslims and the and
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.680]  the seals all in together they had to get rid of that now i had a click happen last hour then i'm
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.880]  going to your calls that is so horrible that it gave me the beginnings of a migraine headache
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.680]  which you only get about once or twice a year which is setting in right now it made me so
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:13.760]  physically sick when it all clicked that since tuesday i have seen cnn msnbc and cnbc and
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.880]  newspapers and i need all you to pull this up and help us i just mentioned 6 15 6 30 something like
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:26.880]  that last night cnn uh what's her name aaron something what's her name the former cnbc host
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:34.480]  is on there with her expert aaron burnett thank you saying it might be navy seals and this is the
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:42.640]  expert on there it could be navy seals it could be veterans they would just like mcveigh was ordered
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.520]  as a green beret special forces affidavits have been signed government documents came out he never
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.640]  left the army he was there to infiltrate militias they set him up we know the names of the feds that
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:58.320]  were inside with the bombs he was the lee harvey oswald my god they've said veterans are the number
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.360]  one terror group we've got to take their guns and like the veterans have done nothing why are you
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.840]  saying this and it all just clicked target number one was the military target number two was tea
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:16.320]  party patsies that were there and then muslims were fallback and they probably used real muslim
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.800]  terrorists who they greased up to go to do the bombing i mean this is unbelievable and that's
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.520]  how they always run these ops to a person that hasn't studied this that sounds complex it's like
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.400]  why are there all these groups that way that way you can go with whatever story you want because
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.640]  they know these things always go crazy and there's always witnesses stuff like this would quote get
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.640]  found out it always does it's just so confusing to the untrained mind and then the answer is roll
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.760]  the tsa out roll the checkpoints out roll the fear out uh get everybody used to troops going
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:52.000]  door to door it's all happening i'm going to shut up now 800-25-99231 larry pratt at the bottom of
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.680]  the hour guys we did have him at the 20 after i'll give him a bottom of the hour let's go to eric
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.080]  and tennessee a police officer he says he has intelligence on the bombing photos you've seen
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.320]  these of what looks like navy seals and others why are they so scared of these being out what
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.440]  do you think's happening uh basically alex great to talk to you by the way sorry about your sick
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:17.680]  kids uh it looks to me as if the gunfight that they had going on supposedly uh they wouldn't
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.520]  let the press in you know they were threatening the press they were telling them you know turn
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.000]  off the camera lose your life yeah that's associated press reporting that yeah they're
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.720]  telling them even worse stuff we're now finding now but go ahead yeah i mean you do not say that
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:37.040]  to the press i mean you know even even as corrupt as things are and they want you to know that
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:43.760]  they've captured these guys they would want press coverage of this you know what i'm saying well
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.240]  running reportedly if you're anywhere in multi-city areas they're coming up i see on the news with
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:55.040]  guns at families and cars just bizarre crazy grandstanding yeah yeah but in this case it
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.840]  would be an absolute must they would want coverage of this they would want people to see this on
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.920]  every newspaper everywhere you know we got them we got them here's proof to me it just seems like
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.640]  it's staged it seems like these guys are probably on their way out of the country at this point
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.920]  under new visas you know new lives with a new bank account at least until the currency falls out
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.120]  i mean it just seems to me like they absolutely do not want anybody to know what's going on at
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.200]  this point because basically you broke the story yesterday shattered the thing wide open they
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.160]  couldn't do anything else you left them back on their heels man well i'll tell you i've never been
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.600]  more creeped out and felt the danger right now we're being blocked all over the internet they
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:42.320]  are scared to death of it i'm sure you've seen the photos they want censored that facebook and
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.960]  others are blocking that unfortunately several newspapers have mentioned so it's not like it's
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.880]  not credible let me ask you this question as somebody you know that obviously thinks about
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.520]  this a lot what do you see in the photos that they are telling people not to look at me the one thing
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.600]  that actually stands up the guy in the blue jacket with the red shirt the the poor poor looking guy
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.800]  that the uh the bag actually matches his straps that he's got over his arms do you know what i'm
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.680]  talking about yes the fbi released the exploded bag remnants and it looks identical a black
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:20.800]  backpack with a silver stripe on the uh on the on the strap right right now if you if you actually
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.680]  had a bag that you brought with you okay and you're in a big crowded area you're going to
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.720]  carry your bag over your back you're going to carry it over your back you're not going to have
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.720]  it right there like you're about to drop it exactly and he looks suspicious i mean if i was
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.680]  a cop at the end of the marathon that's the guy i'd be searching exactly he's the one that you
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.040]  would you would single out you would pull him out of the crowd you would try to figure out what's
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.400]  going on there but in his case he is holding that bag like he is holding every bit of the shame and
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.680]  guilt that he's ever had in his life exactly his body language is he feels like a total piece of
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.400]  crap and how did he get talked into this exactly exactly and if you look at the way other people
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.960]  are dressed around them i mean you know you've got nicely dressed people there i mean you know
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.240]  he looks like the poor kind of mental patients they always set up yep they pulled him out he's
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:12.240]  a patsy he just looks completely and totally the part it just it really jumps out of me that this
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.760]  was the guy let me ask you a question why do you think they're saying i've seen at least four times
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.040]  myself where they've been saying maybe navy seals did the bombing and then you've got what's clearly
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.600]  navy seals there standing around just to be implicated obviously ordered to be there these
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.560]  guys were most likely weren't navy seals they were most likely one of these security firms
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:40.240]  but sure craft international is sheet dipped uh uh navy seals yeah right that they brought these
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.320]  guys in as either additional security or as backup to make sure everything goes off without a hitch
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.800]  to keep obama from hitting the you know the mainstream for everybody knowing that he's a crook
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.480]  uh it just it basically looks like everything was set in place you know with the backup of a
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.360]  backup of a backup i mean in government work you don't do anything relying on one source i mean you
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:07.920]  gotta have three or four backups falling at the same time these guys they're on pictures everywhere
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.320]  so for them to come out and say you know maybe a navy seal did it they're saying that just in case
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.920]  pictures get credibility and somebody somewhere in a position to make a difference actually speaks
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.240]  out and says look at all these navy seals everywhere you know i mean they're just that's
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.480]  another way for you know mainstream media to cover their butt no i agree and they're probably
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.880]  telling them right now you keep your mouth shut you're gonna go to jail for this yeah yeah
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.560]  absolutely and i mean those guys that you know those guys that were there if you look at the
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.400]  expression on their faces after the explosion they do run to hell they do oh no they look no i've
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.240]  said that they look freaked out like what the hell no exactly exactly they did not see this coming i
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:57.840]  don't think wow i'm getting chills man i and i'm in the middle of this oh man careful what you ask

[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.720]  talk about this with us as well i know rd savannah as a person he's he's a likable guy i disagree
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.200]  with him on the guns but we'll have a nice talk on that subject and all the things that are
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.800]  happening it'll be good to have a major police chief in here to give us his take on the situation
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:45.360]  in boston um we've got ex-special ops special forces citizen in boston army with intel on
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.600]  blue shirt suspect let's try to go quick to people and i'll try to shut up and get their quick take
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.000]  on things chris what's your info on what you see happening and why they don't want these photos
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.600]  out of the of what looks like navy seals uh well my perspective is a former u.s army spec ops is
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:09.040]  that the uh seal prior seals and these groups working for craft uh probably were very surprised
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.880]  what it looks like to me they might have been given a sitrep that hey guys there's a very strong
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:21.360]  possibility of dirty bomb it looks like they were probably in an active mode of doing a radiation
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.440]  detection thinking that they were you know actually working something that could be that's
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.080]  right we've confirmed the what looked the oldest one what looks like the guy in charge uh he's not
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:34.240]  wearing a backpack or anything the other guys that they're kind of taking orders from so the police
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.920]  he's got a radiation detector in his hand we've confirmed it right and looking at all the photos
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:45.920]  i'm familiar with uh those type of operations and nuclear weapons convoys i've been involved with
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.880]  uh prior but uh also i do think that in their packs they're probably very heavily armed
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.880]  so they the confusion to add they were told you know to you know bring heavy heavily armaments
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.320]  you know small caliber weapons or machine guns that they typically carry in the backpacks
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.200]  uh so they thought they were doing you know normal activities they don't want them out
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.360]  wearing them on their person to you know scare people uh so i do think they were very surprised
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.280]  now could there have been one or two factions or elements within the group that was actually
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:30.240]  a part of the op the bottom line is is the spec op troops seals rangers green break
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:37.840]  all of us guys we need to stop being involved with unconstitutional activities we need to do
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.320]  better due diligence on what are we being tasked to do we need to really wake up because i'm sorry
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.400]  i get very kicked when i see spec op troops you know involved in involved in activities well look
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.240]  look at how we're seeing martial law demonstrated right now all the places if it's going to keep
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.200]  anybody safe and i look at these photos of right before the bomb goes off you can just see all
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:06.400]  these groups of patsies and fbi watching people and you i mean it just looks like an intelligence
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.760]  uh banquet or something i mean you've just got all these groups there the classic four or five
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  operations running at once so that nobody knows what's going on when the real bomb walks in
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:25.520]  if you've looked at these photos uh the the redneck ne'er-do-well guy his backpack matches
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.840]  the shattered remains and he's being looked at by a lot of people uh and i think they had to
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.720]  abandon that plan why do you think they're floating navy seals here in the news saying
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:44.640]  maybe they did it what is that well i definitely think that's one of the avenues of the asymmetrical
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:52.160]  story potentials because on every op they want to have multiple exit points to take the story
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.760]  and push it so that was definitely probably one of the story points they wanted or agendas they
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.920]  wanted to push was demonizing uh rogue you know ex-military people and they didn't like chris
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.560]  kyle because he's pro second amendment and stuff so you know why not get the new mercs on the block
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:14.720]  why not have craft come out and it could be part of a backdoor way of starting to taint the
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:24.400]  reputation of craft but in the in the end the bottom line is the the removal of posse comitatus
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.960]  the blending of military operations into civilian police operations it's all wrong that's not you
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.520]  know supposed to that's not how our country let me ask you this what does your gut tell you uh
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.440]  about what you've seen with this whole thing because it looks to me like they've been changing
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.720]  stories going through different things and that this is basically unraveled for them oh i
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.200]  definitely think that the work that you guys did and the information came out completely has taken
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:57.920]  them off their original kind of train of approach with the media you know all the instruments they
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.800]  had working to start presenting their story they were going to sell i definitely think you guys
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:08.160]  have taken them off guard but you can see on this asymmetrical capabilities they have in their very
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.360]  dynamic ability to change the story they are very quick and very good at already having additional
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.520]  avenues of exit you know when you go into the building you don't want to only have one way to
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.520]  come out you want to have two or three if possible sure it's the same build oklahoma they had like
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:30.000]  six different groups there but they went with their yeah now the real hero the real hero would
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.880]  be and and and i appeal to all spec ops troops and somebody that general patton would be proud of a
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:44.080]  true american you guys that know what happened have the guts to come out now and tell us what
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:48.880]  were you doing there you know that's to me who's going to be the real hero god bless you sir god

[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.840]  to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good sized meal that i was still starving

[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.720]  in the united states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all

[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.840]  restoration of our republic with oath keepers with a local gun group anti-gun group tried to
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:10.240]  block them from speaking even though they had a permit they had it revoked what a free country
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.320]  and now they're going to speak somewhere else but the police did not follow their orders to arrest
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:20.160]  them and keep them from doing that so the whole state has been turned into a martial law zone
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:27.680]  they've spilled into connecticut this is just unprecedented and who knows what even the truth
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.680]  is there have been so many patsies you know larry pratt head of governors of america joining us
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:37.200]  via cell phone as you drive through through massachusetts that's going through semi-lockdown

[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.520]  axelrod and others said it's a lone guy by himself a right-winger we'll have more tomorrow and then
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.720]  they announced the arrest and they all licked their chops on cnn msnbc saying it's a right
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:02.960]  winger we got you people and now it's reportedly jihadis out of you know out of the the steps of
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:10.560]  russia uh out of uh out of areas where we've seen where we've seen uh you know these attacks on
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:16.400]  russia and things uh they're in the caucuses they're from they're from chechnya uh larry
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.040]  pratt of gunners of america great to have you able to give us your take on this sir alex good
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.960]  to be with you yeah i got thrown off of lectington green i was standing under the statue of john
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:34.880]  parker the uh the uh minute man in charge that day when the battle took place on uh
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.480]  lexington green and uh the cop came up and said you have to move on
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:48.560]  isn't that incredible what a free country uh happily the green also extends across the street
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:54.720]  it's private and it belongs to whoever now has that uh building there was a tavern at one time
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:04.160]  and so we had our ceremony anyway and actually we were on lexington green in spite of them
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.800]  yeah stewart said he had to get to the point though even though you were there the cops
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.200]  were still going to try to stop you because they're so afraid of assembly now in this
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:20.000]  police state because the local commissars said you couldn't what is your breakdown on the spectacle
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.720]  uh of martial law over much of the state you're in right now looking for one guy
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:32.960]  um it's pretty extraordinary and as you were saying that when you let in uh surprise it was
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:42.080]  a muslim or two muslims um that's what muslims do uh it's the last person that they would ever
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.680]  conclude might have been involved in a terroristic act they're you know janet
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.280]  depolitano mindset uh where she was telling local police departments watch out for those
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.360]  constitutionals those pro-lifers those second amendment guys uh those property rights guys
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.720]  in other words the conservative base of the republican party watch out those are potential
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:12.480]  terrorists we got to watch out for them and that apparently is what was going on in massachusetts
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:19.760]  and invariably it turns out no it's not somebody who believes in freedom it's somebody who believes
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.240]  anything but freedom that's what muslims do well certainly the the parts you know the groups that
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.080]  have been radicalized undoubtedly larry pratt head of gunners of america i want to briefly get your
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.120]  take on the the uh the defeat of the gun grabbers they promised to come back obama says executive
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.080]  orders we're going to get to that in a moment but uh you know i came out tuesday i was still
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.200]  on the air when this happened i went into overdrive and i said watch they're gonna
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.400]  blame tea party libertarian constitutionalist and people are like how dare you newspapers that night
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:54.640]  said how dare you say we're gonna blame you but they'd already begun within an hour doing it and
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.240]  i have seen at least four times and i'm being sent transcription videos now where for since
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:06.560]  tuesday they went further they said we bet it's a navy seal or a disgruntled vet what is this
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.360]  they're not just demonizing the tea party now what is this saying vets are going to blow stuff up
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.880]  with absolutely no evidence of that i mean why are they trying to go after the military now this is
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:23.600]  really bizarre that's on the janet nepalitano's list of people that are suspected terrorists
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:31.360]  in fact that veterans may have been actually toward the very top of her list there is a hatred
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:38.000]  of what made this country great what makes this country still the best country in the world they
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.360]  do not like people who understand freedom and who have fought for freedom that's just not
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:51.600]  in their playbook and they take every opportunity and it's really embarrassing to them i would think
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.720]  except they're not going to report on their own embarrassment but you're right that was their call
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:05.120]  that's where they were heading and oops turns out it was one of those muslim guys let's talk about
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.640]  the uh defeat of harry reid and him saying he doesn't like our black helicopter conspiracies
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:17.040]  obama said that that the pro-gun people are liars when when they're the liars they said they want
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.040]  to ban our guns once they're registered they're all on record now they deny that they promised
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.720]  to not come after our guns in the campaign five years ago they've been caught lying about that
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.280]  lying about that four and a half years ago uh and then and i mean they are really hopping mad and
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.840]  here's the weekly standard biden the president is already lining up some additional executive
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.320]  actions for guns uh pelosi says tougher gun control is inevitable they're going to do it
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:45.440]  whether we like it or not uh that's the hill uh and and so they're i mean i guess what what's
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:51.600]  their plan ship more guns to mexico to blame us for that or what evidently but i i tell you now
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:40:00.480]  i will not obey the president's executive order if he thinks he can become our national legislature
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.200]  worse that when the senate was voting they were playing as if they were a constitutional
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:11.760]  convention shall not be infringed doesn't really leave much room for what they were doing and
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.040]  nevertheless they were doing it and i was quite prepared to to tell people that i was going to
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:23.600]  look for a gun and buy it quote unquote illegally because i have a constitution and yeah just because
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:28.080]  these crooks say we don't it's like saying black people have got to be reattached to plows or
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.640]  something uh no they they have an inherent right to say no so so does everybody but but let's stop
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:40.320]  right there what do you uh what stops them because they all from obama to biden to read go how dare
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.000]  you conspiracy theorist saying we're tyrants that is what really got to them what they try to
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:53.520]  discredit is what they're scared of calling a tyrant a tyrant do you agree with that yeah uh
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:59.120]  the truth of the matter is they are the folks that want to be tyrants they want to tell us what to do
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:06.160]  we should just shut up and do whatever they tell us to do uh that the clearly the way these people
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:13.760]  think and act and by the way that's why we have a second amendment for just like these kinds of
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:21.440]  folks who think and act the way they do we are not going to roll over and play dead for them
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.680]  i i just what i think they have done alex i have in all the years i've been involved in
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.360]  defending the second amendment i have never seen the intensity that we're seeing now
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:40.880]  people are so fed up and i'm not the only one saying they can pass this unconstitutional law
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.200]  if that's what they think they can do but i'm not going to obey it i mean people are just
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.600]  fed up and and they're increasingly rather public about it
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:58.160]  well said what do you make of master sergeant cj grisham highly decorated no criminal record
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.280]  out out in an area i know i have family that area totally rural wild hogs cougars it's actually
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.280]  right by the ranch of ted nugent uh and just out walking with an ar-15 with his shine and having
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.240]  his gun taken and then we'll let you go so now you got to get places we're gonna take calls
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:20.080]  that was so over the top those everybody involved in that needs to be fired that is just
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.040]  absolutely criminal activity on the part of a government agent
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.000]  what do you make of this arrogance where the police say we interviewed him by the way last
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:39.600]  night the interview's up at infowars.com the master sergeant whenever they say well i don't
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.920]  care what the law is you know if people don't like your gun we're going to take it you know
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.440]  the day's going to come when that's going to lead to something really bad happening and they will
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:59.680]  have started it and i think it's important that we make sure that if and when the bad things do
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:07.920]  happen that it's very clear that they are the ones known to have fired first they are the ones known
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:15.760]  to have broken the law that is really important that's what was so important about lexington
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:22.560]  the message that the world got was that the british thugs fired first the problem that the
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:30.240]  staff had right from the get-go was they fired first and it's just essential that we the good
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:37.440]  guys be prepared to take the first round that's right of course the uh bell airs and people would
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.200]  say they'll just stage something and blame it on us and that's why we've got to be worried about
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.800]  false flags i mean as you said fast and furious was a false flag the cbs got the memo to blame
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.720]  the second amendment and we caught them uh with their false flag and you know it's a very good
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:01.520]  talking point and i i've noticed that the uh other side really doesn't have a compact you mean you're
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:09.680]  going to approve my purchase of a firearm you that killed some 400 well we're complicit in the
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:16.320]  killing of some 400 mexicans and a couple of our federal agents you have the moral authority to
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.320]  approve what i do you of the chicago you of the chicago mafia larry pratt get to your meeting
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.280]  be safe up there in massachusetts and we'll we'll talk to you again soon oh last point before i go
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.840]  these calls and people are holding uh how do you expect yeah go ahead let me just point out i'm
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:40.800]  actually uh going to springfield uh massachusetts and i'm in the uh the vehicle by the head of the
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.840]  oath keeper driven by the head of the oath keepers in rhode island so uh we are uh i tell you what
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.840]  we're just all constitution 24 7 you're in good company lastly how do you expect him to come back
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:45:00.000]  now against the second amendment i mean obviously executive order what else uh it's going to be
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.640]  interesting to see what he's going to do with the executive order the problem is he can only really
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:12.320]  jerk the chain of gun stores so how is he going to uh try to do something if i want to sell you a gun
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:19.040]  uh there's just no way they're going to be able to get their nose into that uh so i think they're
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.040]  uh well it's going to be interesting to see what he thinks he can do i know what he's going to do
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:26.480]  he's going to stage another mass shooting larry pratt we'll talk to you again soon thank you for
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.880]  the time sir great alex thanks all right be safe all right there goes larry pratt ladies and
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.880]  gentlemen uh let's go to your calls i appreciate you holding uh let's talk we're gonna go to james
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:39.920]  as a resident boss in a moment but first jake whose special forces he says and then uh jason
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.240]  who's army intel on blue shirt and then and then james and then michael and bill and get to all of
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:50.800]  you before this hour ends uh let's talk uh to jake in california real fast what's your take on
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.120]  all the stuff that's happening and now the news saying navy seals might have done it
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.320]  on these you know before they they said it was these chechens what's your take on that
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.160]  well i i think that he i think that what we have to realize right now is the city of boston is on
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:12.160]  a complete lockdown now out here in california we had a rogue cop who was trained he was in the navy
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:18.240]  he was trained by the lapd he was on the run and the city of la was not on lockdown and i think
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:23.520]  that instead of going back and being consumed with hindsight alex you need to be consumed with
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:28.960]  the fact that a major metropolitan city is on shelter in place for a 19 year old with a gun
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.360]  perhaps there's a lot more to this than we know they want to cover up what really happened that's
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.760]  what all our sources are saying this is a cover-up in action what do you think happened because they
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.200]  they were going to go with the right wing angle they already announced it they couldn't help
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.440]  themselves that they had the arrested right winger then it all stopped when these photos
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.720]  got released what do you think's happening i think that the photos reveal that that the fed
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:55.600]  may have been tipped off hence the guys on the ground in the blast zone knew where it was going
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.680]  to go down they were watching they knew to get out of the zone before the explosion they also
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:08.320]  had radioactive detective gear with them so the point is the point is that they knew something
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.520]  was going to go down they didn't know that say 4chan was going to assemble that photo compilation
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.200]  and it was going to go viral and we were going to see what happened and so now that we've seen that
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.840]  we know and and now we see the massive response we know that something huge is taking place now have
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:32.560]  we speculated could there be something even bigger in play here could there be something radioactive
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.320]  i mean why were those guys there not that it may have been an op or an inside job but this may be
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.560]  legit and we know that chechnyan have had a history of all sorts oh wait a minute they are the the
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.160]  radiation guys wow no no i agree the body language of the seals to me is they were just told to be
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.160]  there for a drill and didn't know uh and because i mean i've looked at now there's a ton of these
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.560]  photos and videos they look just you know and i see some other guys that look you know like older
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:03.440]  special ops like back look totally freaked out you know like whoa what just happened minutes after
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:10.800]  uh the blast my issue is it started clicking last night i've seen them four times since tuesday
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.280]  say maybe it's a former military like a navy seal when they have these creepy fbi and southern
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:23.440]  barbie law center type guys on and so are they looking at framing the seals or what is that
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.280]  let me point out one other thing you see of course you've seen the images because you mirrored them
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.200]  you've seen the images remember the guy who looks kind of older he's wearing the blue
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:39.200]  out blue jacket he's got the backpack on his forearm yes right okay look at that image push
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.240]  in on him tell me he possibly doesn't look eastern european could that guy also be russian
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.520]  i mean and because he does look suspicious he is holding that back pass suspicious
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.720]  is there more people in play look at the turnout that's what my gut that's what my gut well half
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.360]  the people there are spies you can look at the body language it's it's obvious all i know is i
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.520]  believe it's that photo that freaked them out us us and again they said they had the guy they had
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:11.680]  the guy and then and then that whole story changed this i have never seen an operation
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.600]  unravel like this well it's not just that it's unraveling it's that it's unfolding man we're
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:24.560]  seeing this turnout listen the city of boston is on shelter in place la was not shelter in place
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.320]  during christopher dorner the city of boston effectively has shut down all the transit
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:34.400]  everything something is in place and they're telling media the police are saying we'll kill
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.360]  you if you show what's happening yeah well they could be they could be hunting down special ops
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:45.840]  people that have blown the whistle who knows hey one more thing uh dan badandi he has a titanium
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:52.480]  pair to ask the questions he has in the front in front of the world i mean the guy what we say
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.480]  about dan badandi whenever whenever i hired him and then he had obviously his young son and some
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.800]  people get homesick that happens he's sitting back home to be a reporter there he's still employed
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:07.760]  here we do you know what we privately say about badandi when we set him on a mission what release
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:18.400]  the kraken dude well if if badandi's listening right now you know what man there's a whole

[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:22.000]  i kept thinking what if my family had been home the police officer said that more than 85 percent
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.360]  of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders the officer

[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:16.320]  announcing it was on fox that diane feinstein is wanting everybody's guns that's the answer now
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:21.120]  we've we've seen what guns do with terrorists that's their angle got to turn your guns in
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.920]  because the government brings in all these chechens by the way we have an article up on
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.360]  info wars.com about our government uh arming tens of thousands of chechens to blow up russian stuff
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.360]  so it's just like the globalist funded al-qaeda wait till al-qaeda starts shooting down airliners
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:41.760]  well the heat seekers our government helped them get in libya and then when i talk about it when
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.560]  they do it i'll be the traitor because i told you it was all coming i'll be bad because i was right
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:51.040]  by the way facebook the article's up where you're blocking us posting articles about the navy seals
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:56.720]  and other security people that's the key to all this and and and by the way you haven't stopped
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:02.400]  us it's in a couple major newspapers so how dare you say it isn't a real story unbelievable folks
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.800]  get our articles out to everybody let's go to pat in mass was a block down the road from the
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.360]  shootout and explosions then we'll go to james and a bunch of other police and special forces
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.960]  like michael and jason and bill that are holding now go ahead you're on the air you're on the air
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.000]  pat tell us what you saw and heard hey alex how you doing i'm not doing too good actually this is
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:27.200]  it's not fun being at the front of this go ahead no it's not um well i'll tell you i um
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.320]  i'm an electrician and i work at a secure site probably about a block away from where the
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:39.120]  shootout happened and um uh you know we're in a big building and we heard the explosions and
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.200]  it i kind of brushed it off as being you know maybe like the hvac system backfiring something
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:52.320]  like that but uh by the time we were ready to leave about 1 15 um some guys came upstairs and
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:59.840]  said you know the police are outside not allowing anybody to leave the building um and then uh by
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:06.480]  the time we got downstairs the entire area was flanked by boston pd and um we attempted to leave
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.680]  they were scouring the area guns drawn uh with the flashlights out and uh weren't allowing us
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:19.840]  to leave we were able to get out probably about 45 minutes later um after some of the uh police
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:26.080]  presence had died down it was a it was a really wild scene what is your take on all this we were
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:32.800]  told it was right wingers now we're being told it's uh chechen's um well to be honest with you
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:39.840]  alex the whole situation seems really strange for you know for two young guys to have no apparent
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  motive to to bowl off something like this exactly by the way it's not just it's not just what looks
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:49.760]  like navy seals and special forces all around right before the bombing goes off and we know
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.600]  there was a drill happening which they've denied and been caught lying about there's also all sorts
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.080]  of what looked like fed's i mean it was like a third of the people when the bomb went off but but
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:03.120]  but you know back were feds watching and i just don't think they want it coming out that they
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.400]  probably knew what these guys were going to do and let them do it i mean that's the new york
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:11.840]  times reported on last year this is the fbi specialty and bare minimum that's what happened
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:18.160]  it's probably worse what do you think well i i'll tell you alex it didn't i mean it looked like a
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.000]  pretty real scenario to me last night you know it didn't it didn't have any you know kind of false
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  flag sort of oh no no no i'm talking about the bombing no no no i agree there was probably a
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.200]  real shootout and all that no no i hear you no i mean what do you think about the whole thing
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.200]  what do you think about changing stories they had somebody arrested they didn't what do you
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:39.280]  what do you make of that well well they always change the story don't they i mean it's you know
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:45.760]  it seems like they come out with as a bostonian as a bostonian what's your gut on this false flag
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:53.280]  or not um i my gut instinct is probably not to be honest with you no that's why we don't screen
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.840]  your calls we won't hear what you have to say this could be the one in a million where it hadn't been
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:02.960]  staged but then why were their feds crawling all around right before the bomb went off and why are
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.160]  they lying about it certainly seems strange i mean you would think you would think under any any
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.160]  circumstances that that kind of event they certainly would have now i've seen those pictures
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.240]  that you posted of the supposed field team guys and you know i don't understand what those guys
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:19.040]  are doing there um well and why is the media saying i'm lying and it doesn't exist that's
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:24.720]  another thing well why are they on the news saying seals might have done it have you seen them say
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:30.400]  that i haven't seen that no i have um i told people where they said it last night on like
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.680]  six o'clock 6 15. all right well good to hear from you we got more calls coming up from the scene

[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.520]  now that you heard that police officer earlier he said that sounds incredibly suspicious to him

[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:56.960]  media sensationalism this this is this is unheard of i was born and raised in boston i'm 45 years
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:02.480]  old never have i seen anything this crazy this is martial law they're training you to have trips on
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.680]  the streets and get arrested if you leave your home essentially that is what they're portraying
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:17.280]  on the local media uh channel 7 wdb h uh whdd whatever the heck they are they are so uh so proud
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:24.560]  of all this this this craziness now this is the nanny state this is it one 19 year old one look

[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:44.160]  really strange is i i have never seen any anything this this aggressive for some supposed 19 year old
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.960]  i mean they're this worried about some kid that's running the streets yet yet let's put it this way
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:58.240]  if it's just this one guy why does it take so many police and fbi and spot team and bomb ballistics
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.480]  because it's all part of the coup d'etat against america it's all part of the just the total
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.360]  takeover of everything i mean i can't go to the kite festival without national guard out there
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:13.760]  they have tsa in downtown austin searching bags without warrants they just it's about a criminal
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:22.080]  state takeover right right yeah well i again i just i felt i i've been listening to you uh over
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:28.160]  the past couple years and more importantly most recently over the few months and uh i felt
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.080]  compelled today to actually speak out this this was this was the last straw well i will go to city
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.680]  council after all the grandstanding and and the police need to get in trouble for telling ap
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.560]  reporters we'll kill you if you don't stop videotaping us i mean that's just i mean that's
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.360]  just unprecedented grandstanding and i see families driving through and they're pointing
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.520]  guns at them all over the city it's not like they think he's in one block and they're doing that that
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:58.400]  i could see just a whole into other cities just an excuse to get your hands on everybody get
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.560]  everybody conditioned and that's why they're doing this and just cops parading around in just giant
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:09.600]  huge numbers like they're all totally scared to death i mean i and i'm not bragging about my life
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.800]  i grew up kind of rough for whatever reason i might have people pull guns on me and stuff
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:18.160]  i've seen violence i mean i was 14 years old and crapped my pants like this i mean this i mean
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.480]  are the police taking it serious because i look on the news they're all laughing and standing around
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:28.240]  and stuff i know people have been killed as well but i mean you know just i mean to think citywide
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.840]  that you know he's under every chair and it's the end of the world what do you say to that
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:38.240]  right right no the the area with which they've encompassed and and sort of infiltrated their

[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:47.440]  that last night right before i went on the air but they actually found the transcript and what
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:51.680]  they said is this type of thing that a soldier now that doesn't mean it's a u.s soldier that
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:57.120]  means it's someone who probably has experience it could be a u.s adversary so on that particular
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.120]  show i was talking about that's not what they said but i know i've seen them say that so help us dig
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.920]  that up in fact they had it one yesterday from another cnn show i never got to it so they're
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:10.320]  redigging that back up i know i've seen them basically say it's probably a veteran it could be
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:15.600]  a a disgruntled u.s veteran is the thing i've heard them say uh repeatedly and of course we
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:24.640]  have all the clips there's no need to even re-air those uh where they chris matthews uh the young
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:31.200]  turks uh axle rod uh you know saying it's probably a domestic right-winger and then
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.000]  they were all giddy wednesday saying oh yeah it is it is that's what it is a lone person well
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.560]  it's not a lone person and then who is it they supposedly arrested and here's the thing that
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:46.720]  listeners are all freaked out about why do they have most of boston and surrounding cities
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:52.560]  totally locked down saying don't leave your house or we'll arrest you and speaking of that uh we
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.920]  just had a guest on hold saying that their neighbor or their friend got arrested but i
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:03.920]  guess they hung up i want to hear what they have to say 800-259-9231 we're gonna go to everybody
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.680]  right now jason in wisconsin is army and says they have intel on blue shirt suspect everybody's

[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:01.520]  awards.com with specifically what you're talking about and where on facebook we'll look it up thank
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:08.400]  you so much uh let's go ahead and talk to bill ex-navy special operation projects he says bill
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:15.040]  what's your take on what you're seeing uh alex i i think you're dead correct i think it's a false
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:23.040]  flag i mean uh i spent 20 years in the military and uh i haven't seen anything like this before
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:33.600]  since probably 9 11 or 7 7 you know you conduct drills when the real stuff happens and wham
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:39.280]  there's suspicion it's not a conspiracy it's just suspicion it ought to be investigated
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.600]  are you there yes and they don't want to admit the drill and are trying to say none of this
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.960]  even exists and trying to block it all over the web right now and the fbi says don't look at
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:56.160]  other photos what does that sound like to you well i think don't look at other photos means
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:02.160]  we're going to present you with the evidence that we want you to observe and we don't want you to
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.880]  serve observe any other evidence no no that's actually almost a word for word quote of what
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:13.040]  he said he said that he said we'll give you the evidence nothing else is credible exactly exactly
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:21.200]  but the thing is you and your staff put a cog in the wheel when you came up with those photos
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:29.760]  and you presented them online it made them delay the news briefs it delayed the conferences
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.680]  and they had to change your story because of you and your new staff it took them a day to do it
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.400]  well i don't want all the credit it's too dangerous actually other people did that it's just you
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:44.640]  there's there's i am getting a lot of death by the way i am getting a lot of death threats right now
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:52.560]  but uh go ahead okay uh i'd just like to throw a couple things at you if that's okay sure and i i
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:59.840]  think there was i think there is premeditated uh plans of blame and it goes right along with what
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:05.360]  you're saying and this is my opinion after 20 years of military service i think they i think
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:13.360]  they intended on blaming it on a white supremacist gun-owning arcanist number one number two i think
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:20.880]  they planted on tossing it to a disgruntled vet if the first one didn't work and number three
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:27.200]  i think they planned on tossing it to iran china russia or maybe even north korea
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:36.640]  so they could have another reason to implement another conflict and i gotta tell you mr banan
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:44.880]  badandi has got a sack of steel without a doubt well you know what he had him kind of intimidating
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:50.160]  him and threatening him and stuff uh all three times before and after and he's but still they
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:53.520]  were afraid to i guess arrest him for because they didn't want him to be the newscast but
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:59.120]  when he got info wars.com out and all over the world they were carrying that news feed live get
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.920]  normally we get about a million visitors at info wars half a million to prison planet
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:09.680]  big days maybe two million max guess how many visitors we had per minute for several hours
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:16.880]  after that happened oh i was listening to you uh live on the uh on the audio feed on the internet
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.320]  and you just broke the record i mean you broke the record that you broke two days before that
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:29.920]  yeah we were having a hundred thousand new individual visitors per minute and and understand
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:34.720]  that's stacking up on each other uh and i haven't had time to like look at the whole graph but it
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:40.480]  looks like at one time we had like seven million people on the website yeah i don't think that
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:46.720]  actually i had trouble accessing your website because it was so overloaded with people trying
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:56.160]  to do research on it i don't think that pierce morgan um i don't think that never mind forget
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.720]  pierce morgan anyway there's a couple other things i'd like to say that based on my past
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.720]  four or five days of an investigation um i've come up with a couple different things and there's
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:13.680]  at least one that i think you might have missed and if your staff has a time and opportunity to
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:22.320]  check it out i did some research on the internet and came up with a file that said that president
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:31.840]  obama met with a saudi arabian foreign minister no no that's that sir that's ap reuters and it
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:36.240]  was a secret meeting they call it a walk by where they say it's an accident so they don't put a
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:39.760]  record of it but it's still leaked you're absolutely right no no that's true i'm going
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:44.160]  to jump to one more two more calls before the police chief who have tv viewers we can punch
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:52.000]  him up out there he's come to confiscate our guns and he gets so look at him he's been hanging out
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.120]  with his power he has a glow to him now been hanging out with biden up there been hanging
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:03.360]  out with el gangster so anyways he's here to confiscate our firearms but anyways uh that is
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:09.440]  coming up look at the crew out there i i'm gonna ask what he thinks of boston though in martial
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:17.200]  law thank you so much for the call bill uh let's talk to jeff who wants to give his analysis as
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:22.080]  military jeff in canada what's your take on this alex thank you so much i'm going to be as brief
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:27.680]  as i can thank you can you hear me okay yes sir i can very good at approximately 4 10 this morning
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:33.600]  i woke up as a sleep with one eye open usually these days and began to watch what i call phase
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:39.360]  two of your operation which i call operation terror storm times two what happened at approximately
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:45.120]  4 10 this morning was of course there was a press conference and they had a press conference
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:49.520]  announcing that they had approximately 12 victims in the hospital this was the first press
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:54.800]  conference they did in the hospital after the second shooting of an officer this is when they
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:17:02.240]  began phase two of announcing there was a dhs former department of homeland security uh security
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.960]  analyst as they called themselves on cnn she was literally reading so if you go back to that footage
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.920]  you can see it around 4 30 in the morning she's literally reading out what's going to happen
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:21.120]  this whole afternoon by the way she said at four four thirty this morning five o'clock this morning
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:27.840]  this could go all day this could go two days so we're in a two-day marathon here now it's all a
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:33.520]  martial law deal on patriot state it teaches to be good slaves and they even have said later today
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:39.040]  on the menu as part of your vacation we will have a controlled demolition of an explosive so be
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.680]  ready for that and we'll kill any media we see following us because we're busy exterminating our
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:50.240]  patsies right now 100 you know you know alex i dig it up at 4 10 this morning you are it didn't
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.400]  take you very long to get right up to speed and you are literally right up to speed this is a
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:01.360]  sanitation exercise right now we are going after the patsies uh they obviously don't want these
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:06.560]  people to talk uh you're now dragging out the family members out of their homes putting them
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.680]  in front of the cameras uh those families are now going to go through a living hell but let's get
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:17.280]  right back to the script being fed by department of homeland security former department of homeland
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:23.600]  security right to these cnn reporters by the way they were on from 4 30 this morning so about eight
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:29.840]  o'clock i asked your viewers who are these two reporters have you ever seen them in your life
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:36.640]  i watched cnn no no that's look at 9 11 there was suddenly all these new reporters i'm telling you
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:41.120]  this is their big move and they were going to go with the right wing deal but that got screwed up
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:46.240]  because of the drill being exposed and now they've moved to these chechen cutouts that everybody
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:52.800]  knows chechnya is like a cia run uh a proxy state against the russians i mean this is this is
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:59.840]  amazing and and where do you see this ending in closing uh well you know alex i just wanted to
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:04.560]  interject one more thing here you have a car jacking you have a crazy sideways story that
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.000]  the media has tried to be tried to juggle uh between 4 30 this morning and about eight o'clock
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.680]  this morning until it was really obvious to me that we are in martial law they announced a no
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.760]  fly zone over boston i started getting on by the way i had all these military calls on tuesday do
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:26.400]  you remember that saying they've been told get ready for martial law to start in boston on
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:31.360]  friday and then we had scowls and say there's no way they have that intel but when you get ready
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.720]  to go with the soft martial law to condition everybody you finally got to tell the troops

[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:36.720]  i do not believe in gun confiscations of law-abiding americans of of sound minds every time
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:42.320]  you say that i challenge you on twitter to show me where i've ever said we should confiscate guns
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:47.120]  and yeah but you're there but you ignored me you didn't answer that because you will not find
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.320]  a sound bite you will not find an article you won't find anywhere well i'll be honest i didn't
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:56.800]  see the tweet what's on your twitter i said i tweeted you right well i mean i can't keep track
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:01.520]  of all this i follow you jones and that's me i know you plan to put me in a fema camp i never
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.280]  no no no seriously look look i joked around because i know you fled communism in cuba yeah
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.440]  and said you ought to move back to cuba absolutely because because you're and i was i'm in it tongue
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:12.800]  and cheek but you're editing i had to like smoke you out to come down here and confront me i know
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:15.920]  you're not a chicken you want to come down here confront me no i i just want to get the record
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:18.880]  straight up even though you're like a karate champion here i hear i better not challenge you
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:24.160]  to a boxing match look at that piers morgan you already did no it's so piers morgan was 76 piers
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:30.240]  that's all i remember i i have never laughed so hard you that guy could not handle you at all
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:34.160]  well i was a little under the weather when i was there too but let's i want to get into boston
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:39.200]  with you and the whole gun control deal but at the very event you were at uh the city councilman
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:43.440]  uh you know guys had a sign saying no gun ban he said hey when we do this we're going to register
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:47.360]  you but then we're going to get your guns later don't worry but that's not what what he said
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.120]  that's not what he said here's what happened but that is the plan get register him and then get
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:54.880]  the guns i think that's the fear i think that's the fear i can tell you right now that this police
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:00.560]  chief and this police department will never ever participate in the mass confiscation of firearms
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:06.160]  of law-abiding americans it'll be done in phases no and zero face we will never participate in that
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.840]  it's against our conscience you told me the sky would be falling before troops were in austin
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:16.160]  why do i always see national guard and state guard doing the crowd control now no you said uh i told
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:19.760]  you you talked about troops doing some kind of martial law type thing and it's never happened
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.840]  here what's going on in boston right now uh you know what i'm not sure because i'm not there i'm
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:26.320]  here but isn't that martial law when they're locking most of the city down and saying don't
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:32.160]  come out and i will kill the press no i the press is there no ap was told i'll pull up ap
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.360]  they were told you're dead if you come out i heard something live on cnn and i was watching where
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:40.960]  there were some gunshots going on they should be careful you're in the line of fire that's
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.680]  i have not heard seen anything like that uh the bottom line is what's going on in boston
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:51.120]  is they're looking for one more suspect as far as i know from the media reports and uh they've asked
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:56.800]  uh the people in the entire city of boston to stay indoors um would you ever do that in austin
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:01.680]  for like one guy probably i don't want to be critical is i don't know what we think is for
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:06.640]  one guy we don't have all the information i'm sure they have good reason it would take a lot
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.480]  for us to tell the entire city of almost a million people here in the city of austin to everybody's
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.800]  staying and boston's even bigger no we're actually bigger we're wow we're much more spread yeah i
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.320]  mean that's the thing that's so frustrating i guess we've grown so fast we are the fastest
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:25.280]  growing city and region in the nation we're 838 000 folks probably more like closer to 900 000
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.000]  we're a region of almost 2 million people worth over 300 square miles boston i think is about 90
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.440]  we're a colony of california i'm a texan i don't know about you well i mean but listen let's get
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.800]  back to the guns briefly let's be honest okay crime has dropped 49 violent crime in the last
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.840]  20 years directly the main even the fbi has to admit because of gun ownership increasing
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:53.360]  criminals are scared and i can show you those statistics guys will you roll there the 49 drop
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:28:00.080]  in crime rates for the police chief will show you the numbers from fbi.gov here in a moment i mean
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:05.840]  explain to me how i have to be penalized because of bad people but how you being penalized when you
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.040]  go buy a firearm right now at from a licensed dealer which is where i presume that's where
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.760]  you get your guns because as a concern i don't have any guns yeah right sure as a consumer only
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.920]  a couple under the counter right here i got one too i know as a consumer you want to protect
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:23.520]  yourself make sure you get it from a licensed person so it's not stolen so you make sure that
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:29.040]  you're getting something that you can rightfully own listen it's about to me uh to me universal
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:32.320]  background checks is about making sure that the person getting that fire and we have illegal
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:37.200]  aliens right now illegal immigrants that can go into gun shows go to a private seller buy whatever
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.920]  they want uh but they're going to get it anyways no that's what that's it's always used to harass
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:45.840]  here's my issue maybe you really want to do it for law and order and i actually get some of the
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:50.880]  arguments the problem is up top they want the list to take the guns do you know obama's on record
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:54.640]  saying he wants to confiscate guns when he was a state senator did you know the attorney general
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.040]  is their friend but that will never happen alex the constitution united states the second amendment
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.840]  is very clear that we have the right to bear arms i know it's a i know it's a real concern of fear
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.200]  and rightfully so i mean government needs to be kept in check fidel let your parents own guns
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:13.920]  no absolutely not my dad used to actually run guns against fidel you know my my my uncle here's who
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:20.400]  his 80s is still a chl holder i really believe in it gun running my father in cuba absolutely well
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.200]  that's moral to do it against fidel but what about fast and furious that's why well i don't
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:28.480]  that was two different administrations not just to obama but but the thing is when you call me
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:34.800]  a communist that really hurts me because my half of my father's friends were executed by fidel
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:40.160]  cow because only fidel had the guns only fidel well no we the anti-rebels had guns no but i mean
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:44.720]  he he ended up getting most the guns and absolutely and and that's why did fidel want people's guns
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:50.400]  to control them yeah we'll be right back with the awesome police chief art ace of vito stay with us

[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:38.560]  of overdrive i know we've got a lot of police and military and people in boston on the line 800
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:45.040]  259-9031 who are going through all this crazy martial law garbage hey uh you know chief i'm
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.680]  gonna get back into guns for a moment but did you know that i got all the photos from anonymous
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:53.920]  which they which we did google searches on you can do that search they're real photos of the
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:59.760]  navy seals and feds everywhere like 20 feet from the bombers and there's multiple teams of bombers
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:03.920]  there what are you talking about boston yes boston there's multiple teams of bombers and
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:07.760]  they are freaking out right now over the photos we've released and you know that that's why they
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:11.520]  canceled the first press conference they weren't gonna blame it on a right winger now they're busy
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:16.240]  hunting down the uh the second tier of patsy's what do you say to that well i think i i don't
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:20.480]  have all the details so i'll wait uh to get more information but that's the first i've heard of
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:25.040]  that and i mean i've been following a lot of footage looking into all things and uh there's
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.240]  the washington times on our story washington who the washington times from that's from washington
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:35.680]  it's a captured area about foreign banks yeah on the potomac on the east coast can i hold
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.640]  up can i keep can i keep this sure thank you very much valuable intelligence see i focus uh very
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:46.000]  much on on austin that's my biggest concern why does the judge department love you so much because
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.720]  i mean i think most of the anti-gun police chiefs do act like they can't talk even they well listen
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:54.640]  uh i don't know they love me or don't love me but i think that part of our responsibility as
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:58.800]  law enforcement professionals is the way in on public on matters of public safety and
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:06.320]  uh you know the major state chiefs has a position uh paper on uh on gun policy and uh there's a
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:13.120]  there's uh i think the assault weapon ban is something that's supported i i like to i like
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.920]  to focus not on the guns themselves but on the prohibited purchasers the prohibited people that
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:22.080]  shouldn't have them so you're saying you support the assault weapons man on a personal level no
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:27.520]  i don't support it i do so the mayor tells you to like that's the policy of austin once again
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:31.920]  i've never i've never supported uh okay because yeah i mean semi-auto has hardly committed any
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:38.160]  of the crimes as you know listen i support uh common sense universal background checks
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:43.600]  or use the commission of crime yeah uh closing the loophole on on criminals there are people
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:48.320]  there look greed it's human nature people will sell their own mothers if the price is right
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.600]  but i mean lansa stole his guns most of these guys steal their guns but 40 of the guns out there
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:58.240]  there's they're they're bought from private uh citizens and i just think we need to close that
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:02.240]  loop oh we're gonna hear about these supposed terrorists where they got their guns i'm sure
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:05.840]  we will oh yeah this is the this is the next false flag against the second amendment what
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:12.880]  concerns me alex is that you protect the second amendment listen if we don't do things that to do
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:17.280]  better uh in terms of keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and other prohibited purchasers
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.240]  like people that are getting ready to go do a uh with extreme mental illness sooner or later
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:27.120]  there'll be the point of well we can watch rock bottom and everything that everybody fears
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:31.280]  the you know the the assault weapons bans and things of that nature confiscations
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:36.720]  may come true if we don't do the right thing which is i think universal background checks
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:40.880]  is the way to go that's a new spin give us a little or we'll take them all like no no like
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:45.680]  you told my reporters not say that you said that my reporter you said well we already could do
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:50.080]  door-to-door gun confiscation we wanted to you know what i said what you told my reporter you
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:53.920]  said we could already do door-to-door confiscation we would no no that's not what i said yeah you
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:58.960]  did i don't know what i said no what i said was this and i remember that great great reporter i
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.760]  really like that kid you really had some good young people around you what i said was that
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:09.760]  the fear of the slippery slope keeps being used by certain people to not have universal background
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.840]  checks because if you do universal background checks then there'll be a registry and that will
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.800]  lead to confiscations and what i said was that there the government decides to compensate guns
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:21.680]  with or without a registry they're just going to go to door-to-door i mean that's what if that's
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:26.000]  what they decide to do which is not realistic we have uh millions of guns already in our
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.280]  neighborhoods they're not that's never going you know what would happen if they tried that
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:35.040]  be revolution guaranteed so so so why are you worried about something that everybody with half
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:38.880]  a brain knows a is not going to happen because they because they've already done it in many
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.840]  states and counties and cities incrementally sure it's not going to float like wrangle has said in
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:48.560]  the evil south and and the midwest but everywhere else they pretty much already have taken a lot of
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.720]  the guns that have created the hell holes like chicago and new york where the crime bosses
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.520]  perch up there on everybody and the problem is that those places like chicago's to allow
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:01.280]  gun violence because it's too easy to get with the loophole in other places but why isn't it
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:06.000]  crime higher here you can get guns even easier the criminals go there because they know there's
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:11.680]  victims that can't why has the crime do you dispute the fbi number of a 49 drop in violent
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:18.160]  crime since 1991 no and then you have to go back what happened since 1991 we had the cops bill that
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:23.360]  added 100,000 police officers we had the three strike laws so a lot went to went into it sure
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:28.640]  they locked up a bunch of people but gun ownership in in in many university studies it went up crime
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.920]  went down and tex and after concealed carry goes in muggings and carjackings plummet because these
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:41.200]  crooks are scared listen so that's what you're making my point we are we have a lot more in
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  common in terms of our views on gun ownership i i'm all for the chl process here it's a tremendous
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:52.800]  process texans they're for the second amendment but they're also for responsible gun ownership
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.640]  not just letting any any you know tom dick and harry run down the street with a bunch of mission
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.200]  but you know what you're not listening to is that guys queue up before we go to mike martinez the
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:05.040]  city councilman i was there and and let me tell you what happened okay cue him up cue up mike
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:10.320]  martinez go ahead i'll give you the play-by-play what if you just what happened was mike goes up
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:16.240]  there to talk right and then there's a guy there was a big old guy he's just saying it's cute go
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.560]  ahead i said i thought they said cute man i said well thank you very much so so there's a big old
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:25.920]  guy that was a was a pro second amendment you know guy standing in the in the front then there was
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:31.440]  a guy with that sign no gun bans and the second council member martinez started talking this big
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.440]  guy yells you f-ing liar and i don't know i can say the big but he used the actual word and uh
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:42.240]  then then everybody you know starts carrying around and he came up to the guy and actually
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:47.280]  martinez said we're gonna make your sign legitimate but that's where i'm not we have the
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.480]  video i don't think he did but but but i'm telling you what led up to it so after the guy tells mike
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:57.520]  martinez that you know you're an f-ing liar and then there's a little scuttle down there i went
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:00.800]  down there and say we're not gonna have any problems no a lady came up and hit the guy in
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.240]  the back well i didn't see that we have it all on video i don't see this cussing you're climbing
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:10.320]  oh no i was there i was there i was there and so so then mike sees the sign and made that comment
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:14.720]  but when you listen to the rest of it uh i think he did that i was like we're not going to take
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:18.560]  your guns right now but after we finish this work registration we are going to need that sign because
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:22.960]  we're going to make that a reality for you i think if you look at that specific uh if you took that
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.360]  just that sound bite it would make you believe that he wants to take everybody's guns but if
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:32.480]  you listen to everything he had the violence policy center and and mayors against gun violence
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:38.080]  they have all said the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms is the goal the un unit
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:43.680]  air treaty when they tried to pass it in 2001 said there must be an abolition of the civilian
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:48.480]  ownership of firearms because i'm quoting it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.560]  state i can tell you that in this country that will never happen i would never be supportive of
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:57.200]  it and when you talk about gun bans you can tell people that i'm in favor of gun bans i have to
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:01.120]  call you out because i'm not well here's the deal you're you're you're going around with bloomberg
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:06.000]  and joe biden i'm not going around with bloomberg come on man joe biden is a gangster did you have
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:13.520]  dinner with joe no was don corleone there don corleone is a character no i know i want to know
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:17.520]  that joe biden's the real thing what the vice president's position uh i actually got to meet
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:23.120]  with him in his office with uh 11 other police chiefs and i don't believe for a minute that he
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.640]  would uh support a total gun what about him saying go out and shoot a shotgun in most areas
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:32.960]  that's illegal kill your neighbors yeah i don't know about that and says women can't have ar-15s
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:36.400]  they can't use them what the hell is he talking about that's the best gun for a woman i can just
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:41.200]  tell you that uh in my meetings with him person to person not on the internet or anywhere else
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:47.040]  he absolutely what he's advocating for is not a total gun but he cares about the kids
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.800]  let me ask you a question do you own an ar-15 no but i but i have one assigned to me i have an uh
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:42:01.120]  a m and p uh m 15 m for mmp 15 which is uh really a really nice farm i like guns and i like firearms
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.560]  i've always liked to shoot even as a kid and so hey guys will you go get a crew uh bring in the

[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:27.600]  what i support is is com to me subjecting myself to showing an id and having somebody run a
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:31.040]  background check that takes three minutes you know i had to say bring in the black barrett because

[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:40.320]  sweet yeah so which one you like the first one you like this is the what the uh coast guard uses
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:45.760]  i like the first one but for in helicopters on a on a sling so they can shoot through boat through

[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:27.120]  anyways i'm just breaking the taboo here but no let's get serious here for a minute talk about
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:32.560]  the supreme court i think overall that that that that you're playing ball politically and you can
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:36.960]  argue hey if we controlled guns that might actually you know be a good thing the problem
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:42.080]  is it's not being done from on high from that perspective right they are harassing did you see
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:45.760]  the veteran up by temple in the middle of nowhere walking with a gun and they arrest him have you
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:50.880]  seen that viral video no but yeah of the master sergeant well guy being arrested you we don't
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:54.800]  know what it's about no no no he's walking down a rural road with his son with a rifle
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:59.120]  and so how do you know it's not for warrants or something no no they say on the video his son
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.760]  videotapes it and he says it's not illegal to carry a loaded rifle and he goes well you scared
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:07.600]  people so we're not gonna let you walk down the rural road i'm not i don't know anything about it
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:14.480]  but uh back to the uh i just wanted i want to see if i heard this right on klbj when the donner
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:19.120]  thing was going on in la christopher donner uh i remember hearing you on klbj saying that the
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:22.880]  austin police department is a model police department and the rest of the nation should
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:28.080]  be like us uh yes you remember that yes i did say that only got me now i want you well no no
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:32.400]  because they're so bad i mean i mean i mean it's like kind of like we're pretty darn good it's like
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:38.000]  if there were like 20 latrines at the uh you know at the nascar race ours flush right and exactly
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.400]  and like one of them has not you know been overflowed yet yeah so it's kind of like the
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:46.720]  choice no no i mean i'll tell you i know a lot of austin police i've been all over the country
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:52.080]  police are scary in new york they're scary they're in your face they look like goons out of a movie
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:56.960]  so i will say austin police are about as good as i've run into thank you very much and we appreciate
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:01.440]  you and you've got a lot of fans under the awesome police department i'm one of them well all i know
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.320]  is how did you get sucked into the white house to literally be the salacious crumb to obama because
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:11.120]  you know he is a guy that sits on java's leg you know what because i i really believe that we it's
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:18.000]  my duty as a peace officer to weigh in on matters and policy of public safety and what i keep
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.680]  telling folks is if we did a better job keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and crazy

[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:58.160]  nation of laws we have to operate under the rule of law and here's the deal the supreme court scotus
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:03.120]  right gets to the side interpret the law I get beat up for my no refusal weekends on drunk
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:09.280]  drivers I have no use for where it's a violation of the fourth amendment like the Travis county
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.680]  da driving the wrong way down the road uh she uh they actually took blood on her with the search
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:18.720]  warrant should the footage be released of her yes and I think it will be should she should she
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:23.520]  resign um I don't know because I haven't seen the well she sounded drunk when she got up the next
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:28.400]  day I I'll just leave it at that she's a friend so I'd rather not a fellow gun grabbing democrat
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:32.160]  I don't know I don't know what her position is but she's a democrat I don't know I'm not are
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:37.840]  you a democrat no how about how about gun grabbers anonymous I could help you and piers morgan join
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:43.440]  it I'm not a gun grabber stop saying that hey you like that 50 don't you yeah I do actually
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:47.520]  we're gonna go out you don't even that we are going shooting you're not afraid of Bloomberg
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:52.800]  to see you no you listen you have to understand something part of the thing that by weighing in
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:57.840]  on those issues you get to keep people a little bit more to the center not too far to the left and
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:01.440]  I think the last about moderation I don't like anything too far to the right or too far to the
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.160]  left I think that Americans are pragmatic and we need to be a we see any moderate but let me just
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:11.120]  say this about the the court supreme court decision they affirmed once again that with
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:17.840]  a search warrant we get to draw blood from drunk driving but only in Transylvania during full moons
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:24.160]  no only when you're out there but but once again they reaffirm the fact that regardless of what
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:27.920]  people's personal views are on the fourth amendment or the fifth amendment whatever
[02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:33.680]  they want to invoke that the supreme court once again has made it very clear that my are no
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:39.520]  refusal weekends where when we get a search warrant we are able legally constitutionally
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:44.240]  to draw your blood the second piece is that this police chief because I believe in the rule of law
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:49.040]  and I believe in our constitution I believe in our institutions the second that ruling came out
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:53.600]  sure we stopped relying on the transportation code and I told my folks we will no longer do
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:59.440]  immediately effective immediately we will no longer do non-consensual warrantless blood draws
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.480]  period I don't care what but she still tried it did we try it did you did it before well because
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:09.760]  it was well here's my issue I work late a lot I drove home at 5 a.m. that story and you were
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:14.720]  weaving no I wasn't I don't remember the whole story the point what story was that one day you
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:19.760]  were driving home at one day you're driving home at 5 a.m this cop from the Austin PDs came out
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:23.600]  and over and stopped your suspicion of drunk driving they did otherwise I drove home at 5 a.m
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:29.600]  the other day oh no no you told me another one no and and and this is like my fifth time with you so
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.520]  I know but the point is it's like cops everywhere yeah and the point is it's not illegal to drive
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:37.440]  late at night not like I've been driving by neighborhoods by garages or something so what
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:42.320]  happened nothing yeah but you got cops pulled behind you and run your plates and stuff like
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:46.240]  that okay and so that what do you think we're supposed to do well they need to be arresting
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:51.680]  Obama for fast and furious you don't what started under the administration and and but here's the
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:58.400]  deal let me tell you something we get paid to try to uh prevent uh crime from occurring we get paid
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:03.440]  to try to uh stop criminals from hurting people and that's about it so we want us to sit on the

[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:10.080]  and put well let me ask you this it's coming out of the illegal aliens are allowed to drink and
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:15.200]  drive do you arrest illegals when they're drunk come on are you kidding me this county uh two
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:20.720]  years ago we had more people deported out of travis county uh per capita than any other county
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:25.600]  in the in this in the country oh yeah I knew that was true I mean but I mean my whole issue is I
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:29.520]  always read about the illegals I've talked to prosecutors in Austin who said that they just
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:34.880]  the judges just let the illegals go but citizens are seen as big plump juicy milk cows

[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.360]  commissioner is a friend of mine he's a real honorable man when those things happen is that
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:15.280]  the giant guy well he's not i love you man he's got fred flinstone his deputy chief i don't know
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:19.760]  listen when those things happen a lot of information comes out half of it's the media
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:24.480]  runs with stuff with they hear a rumor that's unconfirmed and they start reporting as gospel
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:29.760]  there's a lot of chaos there's a lot of confusion and so i can tell you that i know that at some
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:35.280]  point i will get a uh from ed davis a very in-depth briefing of lessons learned what
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:40.720]  went right what went wrong um i'm just thankful that not uh and no more i mean not that many
[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:45.680]  people were injured or killed i mean my heart goes out to all the victims we had about 26
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:51.280]  members of our department running there well that's terrible members uh was right at the
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:56.720]  finish line right barely missed it and so we you know uh it's terrible it's a good thing they
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.960]  missed it let me ask you this if there was an event god forbid like that in austin you know
[03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:05.520]  let's say like you know the capital 10k or something had a bombing like that would you
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:10.240]  lock the city down i mean i mean are they now going to have uh like proctology exams at any
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:15.760]  public event in austin no but i think here's what we have to be cognizant of you know at airports
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.280]  people wouldn't just you'll just leave a bag and walk away from it and unfortunately if you go to
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:23.920]  our races especially at the beginning at the finish and the starting line you'll see bags
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:29.360]  all over the place you're never gonna listen i get 400 troops thousands of police you can't stop it
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:33.440]  you can't stop i mean all i mean in fact if i was a terrorist there was a security line i would go
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:38.320]  to it yeah you can't stop everything uh but i think when you do austin we're so laid back
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:41.920]  we're just going to be a little bit more aware and just be a little bit more responsible and
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:45.600]  at the end of the day uh you're a little more aware people are trying to get our guns a little
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:50.320]  more aware i'm not in favor of that and i don't know of anybody that uh i don't know of anything
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:54.960]  in the legislation that other than the uh the assault weapons piece that i'm like i said well
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:58.720]  let me ask you this this is my final point on that personal level i'm not in favor personally
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:02.960]  but the major city chiefs that is the position but but but but david not my reporter points out what
[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:07.680]  the white house is proposed what's in the bill is just where a mental health person they say
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:11.600]  they think and it's not a real adjudication and then you lose your second amendment no there's
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:20.000]  the last version that i saw uh you you could go to a panel of doctors to actually go uh to
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:27.280]  appeal it a bloomberg panel no not a bloomberg panel but uh but again uh remember but see that's
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:32.000]  not adjudicated i want a court to rule someone is insane i think that that's what it is that
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:37.760]  exactly what it is uh is the last version i saw where you have to be legally adjudicated as being
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:42.080]  mentally and and at some point if you get better that you can actually go back and have your rights
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:48.960]  restored so i'm not afraid of it i i what about the dad whose son says i'm going to shoot people
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:53.360]  with a water gun so they take all his guns did you see that i don't know anything about that i
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:56.560]  don't think that she's one of the water gun is the end of the world i'm not worried about that
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:02.480]  well i know but see it's the nanny state weirdos that run everything you can't every life's about

[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:31.120]  with their two idiot patsy source on that new york time cbs news in fact guys i didn't play
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:35.760]  that days ago i had the guys re-put the cbs newscast from there and we got a bunch of clips
[03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:40.560]  i haven't played we're in overdrive right now i apologize everybody had to hold and i'm glad the
[03:08:40.560 --> 03:08:46.480]  police chief came in but he was scheduled like a week ago and that guy is so unbelievably charming
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:51.040]  and and quite frankly manipulative it's hard to even be mean to him kind of seen behind the
[03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:55.280]  scenes that that guy will probably end up being the dictator of the country or something no i'm
[03:08:55.280 --> 03:08:59.520]  joking uh anyways we're gonna talk about shooting and we're going to turn him over to the republic
[03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:05.360]  side we'll have art uh a cevito up wearing a tri-cornered hat before we're done with him
[03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:11.440]  uh okay uh let's go ahead and uh talk to michael in illinois air force let's talk about boston
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:17.760]  and drill in chicago thanks for holding sir you're on the air a prior military air force
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:23.760]  um i completely agree with your assessment of uh what transpired in boston it was definitely
[03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:29.920]  a drill and with these types of operations i mean you clearly have any number of uh players that
[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:35.360]  you know in the mix so for instance with the craft uh international you know who knows who
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:40.320]  those guys are you know anyone could put on a uniform uh you know with the mercenary flag
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:46.320]  um you do have the guys with the geiger counters uh so they could have been unaware but the the
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:51.280]  question that continues to pop up with me was they had the guys according you know if we look
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:55.360]  at your photos they're looking right at them they're there the entire time how were they able
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:59.360]  to get away no that's why there's a cover-up and they were going to go with the redneck
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:04.720]  the leftist media couldn't help it and said yes it's a lone redneck we've got you and then we
[03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:09.120]  release the photos and they go oh no now we're not and then they went with the arab angle which
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:13.760]  knowing them that's how they run operations just because that's what they do over and over again
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:18.400]  they had all these multiple avenues with other groups of patsies there but i mean who knows if
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:23.600]  that's even true they've got boston locked down to hunt down and get rid of the patsies that's
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:29.520]  what i believe is the most probable scenario unfolding from the pathological behavior i've
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:34.080]  seen from these people before what do you think oh i think you're spot on and i was just uh
[03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:38.160]  listening to an interview with uh sybil edmunds the other other day and she was you know talking
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:42.960]  about gladio version two and this completely fits that scenario i mean she even talked about
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:47.200]  the you know the chechen uh guys and the russian connection and all that good stuff she talked
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:52.640]  about this before it even came out wow let's get c bale edmunds back on asap folks i think it's
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:58.320]  like frog something boiling frogs is her website but yeah she was an fbi translator who heard the
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:03.840]  government running al-qaeda on 9 11. if gladio has been declassified by the italians partially
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:10.320]  by the germans and partially by the us over 200 bombings carried out across western europe
[03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:16.800]  uh blowing up school buses trains you name it to blame political enemies anytime people got uppity
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:21.680]  then why wouldn't nato do it now that's my question who stands to gain from this
[03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:29.920]  am i still on yes sir oh okay um so the next piece i wanted to toss out there in light of
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:34.400]  gladio in light of the unfolding events in boston is information i picked up yesterday
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:40.880]  yesterday so here in chicago cebel refers to chicago many many times as a major hub of
[03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:50.560]  operations for gladio version two and uh yesterday uh there was a dhs uh seminar if you will at one
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:56.960]  of the large uh towers in chicago and it was called violence in the workplace and uh when
[03:11:56.960 --> 03:12:01.360]  the folks went to it they were surprised that it was really in reference to terrorism in the
[03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:06.560]  workplace and the possibility of an event occurring in chicago and the officials went
[03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:12.080]  on to state that there is a command post in this particular tower and there will be a significant
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:18.240]  drill in may like on a sunday so everyone's ears are like you know completely up on this
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:23.600]  and just want to stay away from all drills and again usually there's not an event but they
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:27.680]  practice also lying to the public i've been to a drill in temple texas that's in my film road to
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:32.640]  tyranny and they we knew about it beforehand and the army bomb squad comes over and goes get out
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:36.720]  of here we go no we're not going to they had marines there and the police were there and
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:44.000]  threatened us and they go on the news and say temple was hit by terrorists and then the next
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:48.880]  day it's in the paper that temple was hit by terrorists but in the last line they admit it
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:55.440]  was just a drill to like psyop people i mean this is this is beyond bizarre and and again it's all
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:13:00.960]  about creating this perception of something that doesn't really exist uh and and that's
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:05.840]  what these active shooter drills are in schools all of it and look if they'll drone a whole
[03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:10.400]  village you know to get quote one bad guy on the cop of stuff they do they'll do anything uh thank
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:14.320]  you very much michael thanks for holding let's talk to kevin in boston kevin you're on the air
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:21.840]  welcome hi uh alex thanks for taking my call thank you buddy it's uh like marshall are over here we
[03:13:21.840 --> 03:13:28.240]  got um you know downtown area and uh cambridge which is uh very close to boston and a lot of
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:35.280]  town it's all on lockdown um the streets look like a ghost town um the reason i'm calling uh
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:40.160]  is i was up all night listening to the police scanner and watching the um the news and seeing
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:48.880]  how how things were unfolding over at um mit uh it was a uh police officer shot and um the police
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:57.520]  scanner said that the individuals um got into a um black mercedes and we're driving towards water
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:14:04.560]  town which is i believe north west of cambridge and um yeah where did college students get all
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:11.600]  this money go ahead yeah and the gun um the the the thing that concerns me is what i picked up
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:21.360]  on the police scanner was the police saying that um there are shots being fired from a stolen
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:28.880]  state police suv and the reports of the automatic automatic gunfire or semi-automatic gunfire
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:35.520]  didn't didn't happen until they reported that you know these individuals were in the stolen state
[03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:43.520]  police suv and the explosions that they say were going on is i mean i'm just speculating here but
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:50.160]  if this was a black suv that was a state police suv it might have been a special forces and they
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:54.640]  might have had an automatic weapon a semi-automatic weapon in there and they also might have had
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:59.920]  grenades in there i mean i'm speculating that no sure but they're saying they said the mercedes they
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:06.000]  said the suv uh that much i know we should look into it being look up state police suv stolen
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  and yeah i was hearing grenades i mean you don't grenades are incredibly hard to get uh i mean
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.800]  those are super well guarded and yeah they were describing hand grenades being thrown like a james
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:21.840]  bond movie look it's all speculation at this point but they may be mopping up special forces
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:27.280]  they were planning to burn you have no i mean that's probably is a hunter-killer operation
[03:15:27.280 --> 03:15:31.200]  uh you know they tell the cops that's the terrorist to get them and there were reports
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:35.520]  they got a naked guy and then shot him i mean they're just god only knows what they're really
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:39.840]  doing in the city right now and it's despicable and it shows how we're becoming a third world
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:44.400]  country because when there's no rule of law a bunch of strongmen just take over it's good to
[03:15:44.400 --> 03:15:48.240]  hear from me glad you're doing okay there in boston now let's talk to mel also listening
[03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:53.360]  to massachusetts where are you uh in mass sir how you doing i'm about 40 miles away but my uh
[03:15:53.360 --> 03:15:59.440]  daughter she's in watertown and she said there's police everywhere on lockdown and the nbt is
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:05.840]  closed but notice lockdown now we have prison planet terms we're now in lockdown we're now
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:11.040]  prisoners go ahead put it because she didn't know you know what martial law was no but it is that's
[03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:17.680]  what martial law is is lockdown it's normal civil law is suspended and it's ruled by military force
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:23.760]  this is martial law period i got a couple uh talking points if you don't mind sir go ahead
[03:16:24.560 --> 03:16:28.400]  all right uh i got an answer to one of your questions i've been hearing you ask a couple
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:34.240]  times today you're asking why are they going after the uh returning vets well my theory is
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:40.960]  because uh they trained them so they know what they're capable of and in the future uh it's to
[03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:47.840]  keep the other you know uh soldiers in subordinate pretty much and another thing with the department
[03:16:47.840 --> 03:16:54.000]  of homeland security i mean they've had 12 years since 9 11 i mean how many people have they caught
[03:16:54.640 --> 03:17:01.120]  other than you know jock straps and underwear and you know groping everybody you know i mean 12 years
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:07.200]  and they didn't get it right this time nobody you know all these bomb sniffing dogs and and uh
[03:17:07.200 --> 03:17:13.200]  thousands of people and nobody saw anybody uh you know leave a backpack i just oh yeah i mean the
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:21.040]  place is crawling crawling with special ops and police right where the bomb goes off and then
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:25.680]  they don't want to talk about that like we had people on the spot trying to stop it we failed
[03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:29.840]  that makes some heroes no they don't want to discuss because there was a drill and why do you
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:36.080]  run a drill to stop the regular police from going up and talking to the suspicious ne'er-do-wells
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:40.880]  because normally you would go question those people at the finish line looking incredibly
[03:17:40.880 --> 03:17:47.360]  shifty that's why you do a drill so you can get the bombs in place they've done it in madrid
[03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:55.040]  and in london and in molly and in dubai and they do it over and over and over again i am so
[03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:59.600]  sick of it and then the media comes out they have the la times here sir
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:06.800]  saying that i am a giant fat rat with a huge uh and then i say flying monkeys were there
[03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:12.800]  that's a quote with navy seals thinking their their their readers are dumb this alex jones
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:20.080]  guy says there were flying monkeys and navy seals what a loon there it is alex jones says navy seals
[03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:26.160]  were there backed up by flying monkeys and then i'm a rat coming out of a sir and then a whole
[03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:33.760]  article saying i'm completely insane and and that there are no navy seals okay so so there you go
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:39.120]  folks and they're blocking these photos everywhere because they want to destroy my name and say i'm
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:44.160]  a liar when all i'm doing and it's too late because it's already in newspapers now about who
[03:18:44.160 --> 03:18:47.760]  are the private security people good to hear from you sir we're going to skip this network break as
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:52.320]  we're already in overdrive here let's go to steve in washington thanks for holding your on the air

[03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:12.160]  i come from a grandfather who was actually uh pretty high up in the masons and he woke me up a
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:18.720]  long time ago but just to comment on this whole uh boston bombing you know i think honestly one
[03:19:18.720 --> 03:19:24.320]  thing uh it was important to look at this at this through all this is uh with their whole changing
[03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:29.520]  of the script obviously we know they were probably going to come after the veterans the constitutionalist
[03:19:29.520 --> 03:19:35.520]  to lock us down even further and i think one reason uh they've flipped the script so hard is
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:40.880]  to directly but indirectly try and discredit you and your amazing team and everything you've done
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:45.520]  by exposing these photos the questions dan was asking you know at the press conferences
[03:19:45.520 --> 03:19:50.400]  absolutely fabulous job so kudos to you and your team thank you god bless you for everything you
[03:19:50.400 --> 03:19:54.960]  do thank you yeah guys let's get dan badandi on the roll i want to get him on now i want to get
[03:19:54.960 --> 03:19:59.200]  him on after we take some more calls to try to go ahead and get him lined up dan badandi i mean it
[03:19:59.200 --> 03:20:04.160]  takes a lot of courage to march in there with the fbi atf all these globalists knowing who they are
[03:20:04.160 --> 03:20:07.920]  and then just take over their press conference with real questions you know to michael savage's
[03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:12.000]  credit i didn't hear paul watson listens to it when he's doing updates at night i listen sometimes
[03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:16.400]  i listen sometimes usually don't have time uh he's a writer who listens to savage over the internet
[03:20:16.400 --> 03:20:20.880]  when he's in england uh and uh he said savage was going of course you want to ask who these
[03:20:20.880 --> 03:20:25.440]  navy seals are you want to ask who all this security is right by the bomb i mean of course
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:30.160]  this should be brought up of course there's witnesses with a drill i mean that is a normal
[03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:38.160]  thing and now uh they are all over the news today just saying i am despicable i am the scum of the
[03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:42.240]  earth i've never seen them on my website saying we're coming for you we're going to put our boots
[03:20:42.240 --> 03:20:45.920]  on your neck we're going to kill you look i already know you killed that little eight-year-old kid i
[03:20:45.920 --> 03:20:51.440]  mean i know you can come kill me i mean yeah i i hate to take it away from you guys out there
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:57.280]  uh but i mean i know the danger i'm in so you don't scare me i mean i hope you get that through
[03:20:57.280 --> 03:21:02.160]  your head i mean somebody's got to stand up to you and and and look you're not going to shut me
[03:21:02.160 --> 03:21:07.200]  down by making me a rat on the cover of the la times you're not going to shut me down by killing
[03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:11.520]  me the info goes forward because ideas are bulletproof and i want you to get that through
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:17.040]  your little brain uh anything else steve well no you know i someone has a master's degree in
[03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:21.280]  communication studies you know i i watch these news events and i see the government group squads
[03:21:21.280 --> 03:21:24.720]  right now in boston going through the neighborhoods you know completely geared up
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:29.120]  these are the real terrorists i mean they're inflicting just as much terror on that city
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:34.400]  right now as the actual bombs that went off you know back on monday and no no it's it's traumatic
[03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:39.360]  it mind control it's planting their flag on everybody and urinating all over them and the
[03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:44.560]  average cop doesn't even know that but i mean it's just pure mob psychology get everybody used
[03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:49.840]  to troops going in and out of houses and saying you're on lockdown this is martial law and now i
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:54.560]  think to the calls tuesday and wednesday of military who sounded credible to me going we're
[03:21:54.560 --> 03:21:58.880]  getting ready we're being told to get ready to start rolling it out friday and of course they
[03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:03.280]  tell them that to see if they'll do it it's also to gauge but you know i had call after call for
[03:22:03.280 --> 03:22:07.280]  military current active duty saying we're getting told ready to roll out on friday
[03:22:08.960 --> 03:22:14.720]  go ahead you know i i spent five years with the 82nd airborne from 94 to 99 and even back then
[03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:18.240]  they were i could tell they were testing the waters with us to see how far we would go and
[03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:22.800]  and do things you know as far as you know violating posse comitatus and um doing things
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:26.000]  against the american citizenry you know it's absolutely ridiculous what they've done to our
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:30.960]  military uh what they're doing to our republic uh the constitutional republic and every time i hear
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:34.880]  the any of our politicians get up there and talk about the democracy we live in i just want to puke
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:40.720]  and and i mean here's the deal i've read a lot of criminology i'm sorry go ahead well let's just say
[03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:44.640]  this isn't a democracy this is a constitutional republic you're right it is you know obviously
[03:22:44.640 --> 03:22:48.800]  you know when you hear the words democracy come out of their mouths they have absolutely no idea
[03:22:48.800 --> 03:22:54.240]  on the original founding of this well they mean democracy if 51 says take our guns we do if 51
[03:22:54.240 --> 03:22:59.360]  say get rid of the borders we do if 51 say we have no rights we have no rights you can't take
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:03.760]  my rights you can't vote my rights away it's that simple god bless you sir and you know here's the
[03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:09.040]  problem the collectivist have they may have a large portion of people sheep-like scared cowardly
[03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:13.520]  dumbed down but there's a large portion of us that aren't and we know what's going on
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:18.960]  and look i've i've studied a lot of history i've said a lot of manhunts a lot of things like that
[03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:24.960]  if you really wanted this you would set up checkpoints only at key areas you thought
[03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:29.200]  the person was in there's no point in checkpoints citywide and bring everything to a stop it's
[03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:34.000]  ridiculous the guy'll just stay in one spot you can't search a city of 700 000 people or whatever
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:39.760]  it is uh it's asinine and what you do is you put undercover people out everywhere and you'd ask the
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:45.440]  public for help you wouldn't have just big groups of men marching around behind armored vehicles
[03:23:45.440 --> 03:23:52.560]  bulging their eyeballs out i mean it is just pure these are the jail guards you're on lockdown and
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:57.440]  they're parading around in their riot here inside the prison this is pure prison psychology prison
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:03.200]  planet let's go to christian utah uh go ahead you're on the air what's your point all right
[03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:08.000]  alex thank you good morning or good afternoon actually listen i've got two things i'd like to
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:15.200]  bring up one of them is no mention of the other three explosive devices that were supposedly found
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:24.480]  almost within four or five hours after the devices were exploded or the jfk library now this whole
[03:24:24.480 --> 03:24:32.000]  thing's a giant cover-up of what really happened sure um no but see in one of those uh uh devices
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:38.560]  i mean they named a location now i don't know the suburbs around boston um but you know i think
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:43.840]  that is implies in and of itself uh that there were other actors that were involved in all of
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:52.000]  this um the other thing i'd like to share um with a 43 year uh career uh both clinically and as an
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  executive working in hospitals involves the decedent's body uh this morning as he was laying
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:06.320]  in the street um i listened to a physician now i don't know if it was the coroner or
[03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:13.120]  a trauma physician at one local hospital but he described that uh he had gunshot wounds blast
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:19.920]  wounds and had been apparently run over by the auto of the younger brother yet when you look at
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:26.960]  the uh the remains of the body he's laying in a perfectly prone position as a place to place you
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:35.040]  in but look at the film of his hands his fingers are totally hyper extended when when your body
[03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:42.160]  um expires your hands going through what they call a position of function yeah rigor mortis
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:49.200]  well no well but see it takes a while for that to set in what i'm saying is the position of function
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:56.240]  is like you're holding a coke can but in a very limp way and your hands would never be hyper
[03:25:56.240 --> 03:26:03.520]  extended unless rigor had started to set in so that is just simply an observation the other thing
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:07.520]  is sure there's no way he's dead with his hands hyper extended he's obviously alive saying i've
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:12.720]  seen the photo you're talking about now they said that maybe somebody else go ahead no i if he'd
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:20.800]  been if he'd been shot uh several times had blast injuries as this position was uh describing and
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:25.840]  been hit by an auto uh he would be totally unconscious the other thing is that when you
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:32.080]  expire your eyes are always open and i'll tell you that that's experience from being a vietnam
[03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:38.240]  here a navy corpsman that served with marine corps uh one of the first emts in the country later a
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:46.560]  nurse critical care background i will tell you uh that when people expire uh their eyelids are open
[03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:51.920]  and their hands are limp sure everybody knows that i mean i'm not a medical person i know that sure
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:57.680]  sure sure but i mean it's just an observation because this uh individual the older brother
[03:26:57.680 --> 03:27:03.360]  was supposedly already expired sir nothing about this is true they've been lying the whole time
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:10.480]  that's my point they're known liars now involved in a in a flaunting of martial law power all part
[03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:14.320]  of the takeover because they're getting ready to implode the economy and they've got to have us
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:20.240]  prepared and ready for martial law and and obama executive orders for gun confiscations this is a
[03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:25.920]  lunatic takeover and they want us to have cops everywhere see this and get it normalized and
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:30.240]  the public to get normalized great points chris let's go to dan badandi who everyone is just
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:36.880]  marveling at taking over just with info real questions uh the media tries to call him a heckler
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:41.200]  no i mean why are there the drill why'd you lie about the drill who are all these troops
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:45.120]  dan a great job uh what do you want to say about what you've witnessed today and
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:47.600]  what's happening now in massachusetts to the area that you're from
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:52.160]  so far it's been a long day still going to go to west springfield to the gun line
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:57.040]  i went to lexington for us the police wrapped up all the area and they told everybody if you
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:01.520]  step on that line you'll be arrested now we were there with the oath keepers nobody wants to go do
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:06.320]  that no i mean i mean sure while the rest there's martial law in the state oath keepers can't be on
[03:28:06.320 --> 03:28:10.400]  the green yeah it's because they can't have real americans on the green now now give me your take
[03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:16.720]  give me your take on taking over the press conferences um it was uh i don't think it's
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:21.680]  just a victory uh for influence here and uh victory for freedom and truth because
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:27.360]  no one they cannot deny uh this uh evidence i mean we you know like you said though uh
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:33.600]  influence got here 100 hits a minute and uh people are down questioning look i talk to people here
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:38.320]  that recognize me and i got mixed feelings uh i had some press saying oh you really suppose
[03:28:38.320 --> 03:28:42.240]  this is a conspiracy because i'm on cambridge street where they detonated the bombs a little
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:48.320]  while ago and um people just questioned a couple guys said yeah i think the fbi is uh you know
[03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:52.640]  behind this spot i don't want to go on camera saying that everybody's afraid of the mighty
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:56.000]  fbi you know and uh oh really you ran into people that thought it was the government
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:02.000]  yeah and they didn't come on camera and uh one uh one media guy said he does agree with us but
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:05.360]  you said you can't come on camera because hey let me ask you this what about when i heard you
[03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:11.360]  bullhorning cnn you took that over too oh yeah i was charged up when i left there and you can

[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:20.240]  we're going down to the corner and uh they were having this uh all the press were doing their
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:24.240]  shows and whatnot i was born and i pulled one the hell out of them i could see them reading off the

[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:08.720]  we're just trying to fight the globalists just like you are and trying to build a platform to
[03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:13.440]  stand up against the new world order all the things they're doing it's really that simple
[03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:17.200]  but going back to dan madani then i'll get all these other callers dan
[03:34:19.040 --> 03:34:23.520]  what do you make tell us more of what was happening but but try to speak a little bit
[03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:27.760]  lower because it's over you're over driving your cell phone uh tell us tell us what else you
[03:34:27.760 --> 03:34:31.520]  witnessed you're out there bullhorning did the police try to violate your first amendment
[03:34:31.520 --> 03:34:36.160]  uh what happened they came over to us so you can't be in the street then we get on the sidewalk then
[03:34:36.160 --> 03:34:39.680]  he said you need to commit them to be on the sidewalk i'm like excuse me you said the rest
[03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:44.720]  of the press was here i'm with the press too and every excuse in the world so what they did i had
[03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:49.600]  two shadow camera guys with me they you know they did that you know familiar police tactic
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:54.240]  they got in the middle of us to try to separate us because they were about to arrest us they were
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:35:00.000]  eyeing to arrest us and um i got close to my camera guy again and they're trying to hold us apart and
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:03.920]  i told them the only thing that saved my thought is i told them we're on the live transmission
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:07.840]  feed right now they backed off quick they said we have to go down the other end of the street
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:13.440]  they were ready to arrest us well they were to arrest you it'd be a major incident because they
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:17.840]  don't want the you know attention to get out about what we're covering now now you told me you had
[03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:23.360]  people come over and try to stop you at the press conference too bringing up a pertinent question
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:27.600]  who are all these private security right around where the bomb went off why do you say there
[03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:34.000]  wasn't a drill uh tell us what happened behind the scenes all right um basically i sat down my
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:38.320]  buddy got there a little bit late but he gave me photographs yeah i could tell who was the guy next
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:42.720]  to me behind me i mean he was uh fed you know disguised as a reporter he's listening he's
[03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:46.560]  peeking over my shoulder every day every time i made a text message well anyway i got handed
[03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:52.320]  photographs he jumps up he throws some guy in the back and i guess i heard in the hallway where you
[03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:58.000]  know they came out um they got photographs so a woman comes out and she gets on the podium says
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:01.120]  the conference is going to be doing about five minutes of getting things together
[03:36:01.120 --> 03:36:05.680]  so when they come out what was the first thing they said ignore all photographs except for what
[03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:11.920]  you see on the fba everything else in the world because you have to pay attention to us we have
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:16.400]  gods you will pay attention to what we have to say that's right you had printouts of you had
[03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:21.920]  printouts of the people of interest trying to show them and they said you only come to us
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:27.520]  we are the only credible people in the world look at nothing else i mean how ridiculous and when
[03:36:27.520 --> 03:36:34.080]  they did that everybody went to info wars.com instead it's like whatever you do don't look
[03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:39.520]  under my bed just look anywhere you want don't look there uh yeah the guy behind me too when i
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:44.000]  get up to the photographs he jumped up and put his clipboard in my way so i couldn't show this
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:48.400]  photos to them which i did anyway to the media he was trying everything that's power to stop
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:51.920]  those phones being shown to the media that's right and the photos were one of the navy seals
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:57.440]  yep the photos of the navy seals and um you know the first patchy they were going to blame on to
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:02.400]  demonize the tea party the guy was a big you know typical tea party looking person and uh you know
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:06.640]  and i we're explaining all this and once we said info was dot com well first of all when the press
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:11.920]  conferences over i got bum rushed by the fbi and that's where my face i told them listen i'm not
[03:37:11.920 --> 03:37:15.600]  afraid of people and they said we're not afraid of you i said well you better be afraid of truth
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:19.120]  and liberty because it's coming your way new criminals are going to jail for killing innocent
[03:37:19.120 --> 03:37:25.840]  people and they backed off and um and the media come over to me i had an entourage of media and i
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:30.480]  we showed the photos we're saying go to influence.com for more information and we're
[03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:35.520]  basically explain what the photos are and this is why the fbi stated do not go anywhere else photos
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:40.960]  but there and that made them look bad i mean we are i see nautical and whatnot in london and
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:45.440]  oh boy they're not used to that they're not used to that when you say hey i think you're involved
[03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:51.760]  in a false flag i mean they don't i mean they're so everybody's being so scared and and it's not
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:56.320]  that we're stupid i mean we know the price we can pay i i know you know as a father but in the final
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:02.080]  equation dan why are you doing what you're doing um because i have a responsibility that uh you
[03:38:02.080 --> 03:38:07.040]  know that parchment paper that's written by a father father says those who have the ability
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:12.560]  have responsibility and duty to um you know to do what we're doing and you got that i got that and
[03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:16.240]  everybody else influences got that and that's what we're doing we know we're risking our lives right
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:20.640]  now i know i mean i was nervous driving home and i dropped my buddies off i was driving down the
[03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:25.120]  highway a black hallway not knowing what the heck was gonna hit me you know i mean and uh i was gonna
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:30.480]  be running off the road i come here i'm at uh cambridge street now when i got out of the car
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:37.040]  i had almost every fed the fbi just staring staring at me like i was seeing himself and i had a
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:42.480]  provocateur with a camera in my face like most of the time you know yelling themselves about you
[03:38:42.480 --> 03:38:47.200]  and then for wars and trying to provoke a fight with me and you know he's causing a big uh you
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:52.240]  know frenzy over there i mean i mean i mean he's caused a big uh scene over there yeah well
[03:38:52.240 --> 03:38:56.080]  undoubtedly there'll probably be repercussions against all of us for this but you know there'll
[03:38:56.080 --> 03:39:01.840]  be repercussions by god against people that do things to us because because like we're sick of
[03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:06.880]  the government letting terrorists attack us putting the underwear bomber on the plane that's on record
[03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:12.160]  we broke that that was confirmed provoca this is clearly provocateur dan badandi in full wars
[03:39:12.160 --> 03:39:17.360]  dot com reporter let me ask you my friend what do you immersed in all this being in boston
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  in closing and then anything else you want to add we're going back to calls what do you think
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:27.040]  is really going on there in boston the story's changing and the shawty ambassadors and now the
[03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:32.240]  chechen cia cutouts i mean what do you think's going on they're doing door to door they're
[03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:38.480]  saying every house in boston and folks it's a major city it is going to be searched
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:42.640]  the problems are there made i interviewed a couple of the neighbors that went down the street
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:46.960]  they said the fdi knocked at the door they were told evacuate the house who wasn't doing the
[03:39:46.960 --> 03:39:50.640]  reason why they've been out here for seven o'clock this tomorrow with no information
[03:39:50.640 --> 03:39:55.760]  they can't go back to their homes they're on video and um i didn't miss the ball that's going
[03:39:55.760 --> 03:40:00.480]  on you know between here boston and mexican i'm telling you right now the new world order is
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:06.960]  laying the hammers out and what we're doing now is god willing you know god bless from god's hand
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:10.880]  they're exposing us and holding this new world order back because they are laying the hammers
[03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:16.240]  out and i'm in the midst of this evil right now and i you know the other thing is keeping me
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:20.720]  sane and safe because god says if i am with you who could be against you and that's the only
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:24.880]  security that i have and i trust and uh you know because i'm in the midst of me like i
[03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:30.240]  scared down by fba agents all day and uh provocateurs and i mean it's nuts they're out
[03:40:30.240 --> 03:40:35.120]  to attack us then because we see we talk the truth and i had mainstream media reporters
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:39.840]  on the sidelines there oh i guess there's a conspiracy too you know seeing uh cocky
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:49.120]  remarks like that and we're getting hit every each direction all right anything else you'd

[03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:43.040]  that big myself i mean i've i've crashed some big press conferences and exposed janet reno
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:48.240]  from her at waco and i've confronted presidents have been arrested and i've been you know
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:53.440]  i mean i i've done some but nothing where it's it's a press conference that's you know
[03:41:53.440 --> 03:42:01.440]  on every tv in north america and most of the ones in europe i mean listen 100 000 visitors
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:12.880]  a minute for hours uh to info wars.com 100 000 visitors a minute and yeah i haven't even
[03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:16.880]  looked at the graphs i looked at it yesterday i was like what i mean it was just like it
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:21.440]  was real traffic too all because he got info wars.com out during that press conference
[03:42:21.440 --> 03:42:27.440]  uh and uh this is a duty i want people to understand you know i get up here and we joke
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:34.320]  around and have some fun and stuff and this is just beyond anything i mean i this is getting
[03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:39.200]  so over the top i don't even know what to say anymore but i think it's important just to know
[03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:45.360]  that we are at a position now that is just unprecedented in the history of the new media
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:51.680]  revolution and a lot of it uh goes to you the listeners to the good lord above to our sponsors
[03:42:51.680 --> 03:42:58.720]  our supporters my doggedness my crews doggedness drudgereport.com uh link it to our stories
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:03.520]  no mainstream media picked up the navy seal photos and stuff drudge did it wednesday
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:08.560]  and then washington times now did a thing on it and washington post had a small mention
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:18.720]  uh but but but at the same time you've got la times showing me as a rat and then saying he
[03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:25.680]  used navy seals obama did backed up by flying monkeys from ozz with a serious article and they
[03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:30.880]  say that i'm you know basically said the navy seals did it uh in the article i didn't say that
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:34.880]  i mean there might have been an operative from some other group in with them but i i don't think
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:40.640]  that's probably the case see that they misrepresent they prey on their audience they prey on their
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:45.440]  readers and it must feel good to just be cowards and just work with whatever you're told and just
[03:43:45.440 --> 03:43:52.800]  read off a teleprompter and they told the media don't cover this for two days now we're two days
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:56.560]  plus into this since this news broke and they none of them have covered it but the washington
[03:43:56.560 --> 03:44:02.960]  times had a good report people bash the washington times all day long but that's you know and of
[03:44:02.960 --> 03:44:06.160]  course its founder was a little strange and stuff but the point is it's a truly independent
[03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:11.200]  publication in my view compared to other stuff out there i mean so many times they cover west
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:15.920]  point comes out and army college comes out and says we're training to take on the tea party
[03:44:15.920 --> 03:44:20.720]  you know that that's an official thing washington times covers it forbes covers it forbes does some
[03:44:20.720 --> 03:44:25.520]  good work but they wouldn't get any traffic if it wasn't for drudgereport.com
[03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:32.240]  uh you know we've got our own traffic from radio listeners and people but you know when drudge
[03:44:32.240 --> 03:44:36.640]  links to us it doubles or triples our traffic i mean i just i mean i'm just telling you who's
[03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:41.440]  out there because let me tell you it's pretty lonely um i wish there were more people
[03:44:43.760 --> 03:44:50.720]  i wish there were more people you know out there i mean man glenn beck came out against the army
[03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:55.600]  that the active duty was walking with his rifle and of course he was walking with his rifle
[03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:59.920]  because it happened to his buddy and it was an active sergeant and they took his guns in that
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:04.960]  same area fort hoods right there and so you know and they're like oh he did it to make a point
[03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:11.600]  uh you know so now he's a bad guy i mean it's like man that's what that's what loyal opposition is
[03:45:11.600 --> 03:45:16.640]  and i'm not even getting it's just it's creepy that on the libertarian flank we've got the enemy
[03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:21.760]  coming down on us we know who they are and then there's just constantly this bayonet being stabbed
[03:45:21.760 --> 03:45:27.840]  in our stomach i'm sick of it man i'm tired of it we need to like circle the wagons against the
[03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:35.200]  wagons against the globalists big time here and you know bill o'reilly's another one who did pieces
[03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:42.160]  on jfk and e howard hunt like 25 years ago when he was on extra or was it hard copy and this is
[03:45:42.160 --> 03:45:46.320]  kind of bad audio to somebody shot it off their television screen but bill o'reilly came out and
[03:45:46.320 --> 03:45:52.560]  attacked alex jones for family guy and dan badandi for asking a question and and they only cover us
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:58.320]  when they could say we're lying and all we did was watson did a blurb about a clip he went and
[03:45:58.320 --> 03:46:02.560]  checked the original family guy you know saying it was two clips from the same episode showing
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:06.560]  how he runs over people at the boston marathon and they say how'd you do it how'd you win and
[03:46:06.560 --> 03:46:12.640]  he shows him detonating two bombs he then goes on to blow up the golden gate bridge too and it's
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:21.040]  called uh a turban cowboy a tea partier that joins al-qaeda that's the whole thing and they came out
[03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:28.160]  on the cnn fox there and said we're just liars that it never happened i mean that's how dumb
[03:46:28.160 --> 03:46:32.160]  they think you are and of course that was just a minor blurb we put out so they chose to focus
[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:38.080]  on that uh and then censored and blocked our videos online so you couldn't see what we really
[03:46:38.080 --> 03:46:42.800]  said you know they take down what we really said they're blocking the navy seal stuff and all the
[03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:50.400]  other and the other suspects uh on facebook that article's up at info wars dot com they do not
[03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:54.080]  want this information getting out there so here is the bill o'reilly clip
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:00.320]  in back of the book segment tonight did you see that we begin with a march 17th
[03:47:00.880 --> 03:47:06.960]  episode of the family guy i'm bob costas here with boston marathon winner peter griffin
[03:47:06.960 --> 03:47:13.680]  peter how did you do it the influence busted maybe i dialed wrong
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:23.840]  no now that didn't actually happen on television that was doctored by some online pinheads they
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:29.360]  distorted that clip from the family guy who is now pulling everything off the net here to explain
[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:34.000]  further julia huddy i think i mean you know you know the way people are people are crazy that
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:39.520]  that was so just i mean it's so ironic that that aired march 17th how could somebody do that two
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:46.080]  separate storylines in one shot hit pause and back it up because there are sick people hit pause back
[03:47:46.080 --> 03:47:51.600]  it up 10 seconds so first they say it didn't happen then she says it aired march 19th they
[03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:57.840]  show him running over people to get to the front of the boston marathon and winning with piles of
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:03.680]  dead bodies and blood everywhere and then they go how do you do it and he detonates a bomb
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:09.040]  blowing stuff up and then he also blows up other stuff so our point is it's about terror attacks
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:15.200]  with cars and bombs and and then they sit there and say we're a liar and then say it never happened
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:20.800]  here let's back it up and yeah play it from there here it is go ahead and play it that's good guys
[03:48:20.800 --> 03:48:29.920]  whenever you're ready okay that's here enough but then they go in these internet geeks and they and
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:36.320]  they twisted it around that's not what people saw on tv no no no they took two separate storylines
[03:48:36.320 --> 03:48:41.360]  in the same show they spliced it together and yeah and it and it does look very convincing
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:47.840]  now he is wearing you can see there how do you do that how can you do that i i you just what you
[03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:54.320]  like technically i guess you i don't know i'm not good at that i'm not so they they just they took
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:58.800]  it they and then they put it up again and you can do anything online you can take anything and
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:02.960]  splice it down you should you know that i mean you just it's easy to do that it's just that it
[03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:07.280]  was a person would do that you know i mean what kind of a person would blow up the boston marathon
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:14.160]  killing us right there back it up 10 seconds what kind of person would blow up the boston marathon
[03:49:14.720 --> 03:49:20.000]  that's why she's got that job as a new world order propagandist there she's saying basically
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:26.000]  we blew up the boston marathon you know the people that would do that and and they get to
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:31.520]  us in a moment we would blow up the boston marathon no no it's you that reads off the
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:36.240]  teleprompter it's you that knows about all this and then gets up there and does this
[03:49:36.240 --> 03:49:39.520]  as if you're the only ones that can be listened to let's go back to this clip
[03:49:40.240 --> 03:49:44.320]  and splice it down you should you know that i mean you just it's easy to do that it's just
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:47.840]  that it was kind of a person would do that you know i mean what kind of a person would blow up
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:51.360]  the boston marathon and kill innocent people yeah i know but we know but that's a different
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:58.720]  situation um trying to you know capitalize in this way uh it just all right i think we live in
[03:49:58.720 --> 03:50:03.200]  a very disturbing of an opportunity for some sickos out there all right now you think that's
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:08.480]  disturbing look at this governor deval patrick uh commonwealth of massachusetts having a press
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:13.920]  conference i'm gonna tell you is this another false flag state attack to take our civil liberties
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:20.400]  are sticking their hands on the streets no next question dan good job getting your question into
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:25.200]  the governors and others no doubt you shut down their press conferences what can you tell us about
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:31.200]  behind the scenes dan modonti um susa asked a question and you know asked again and they
[03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:36.480]  wouldn't answer the question and i got the look of death from every federal agency that was there
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:41.520]  the um the government officials everything and i knew where to add grab my camera quick you know
[03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:45.360]  since the press conference is over because uh the woman gets right on the stage obviously in the
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:50.640]  press conference and everybody gives me the look of death so i grab my equipment and generate out
[03:50:50.640 --> 03:50:56.640]  of there all right now that's not a joke um that's a real talk show host and this idiot in a car
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:51:02.560]  and that they're saying is it's an inside job the u.s government bombed the people in boston
[03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:08.560]  the talk show host is alex jones he's a he's a conspiracy theorist he's kind of like the guru the
[03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:13.200]  you know the king of the conspiracy theorists and he's been on the air since day one saying this is
[03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:18.720]  a job of the fbi it's a false flag job you heard the reporter question as whether it was false flag
[03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:22.080]  job meaning you know if it's just you know they're twisting it around to make it look like it's
[03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:26.400]  something else another entity but really is the government it's so sick and this guy's an idiot
[03:51:26.400 --> 03:51:31.360]  and you know the people at the press conference totally ignored it throw them out i think that
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:38.080]  this uh internet stuff with this access now that people have has made more crazy people because
[03:51:38.080 --> 03:51:42.800]  people who are borderline crazy now go in there and become we don't buy your crap anymore the

[03:52:55.520 --> 03:52:58.560]  need to throw you out of the press conference because you're supposed to sit there and fold

[03:56:15.280 --> 03:56:20.880]  thank you alex hey um one thing i want to say that you would be on a shadow of a doubt or a
[03:56:20.880 --> 03:56:25.840]  raving lunatic and let me explain why this is a this is a quote that was put out by
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:30.880]  death and games and he says the truth's initial commotion is directly proportional
[03:56:30.880 --> 03:56:37.120]  to how deeply the lie was believed and when a well-packed web of lies has been sold gradually
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:42.720]  to the masses over generations the truth is totally utterly preposterous and its speaker
[03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:50.240]  is a raving lunatic so that's why i say you're a raving lunatic thankful for you because you've
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:55.120]  probably been the spearhead of this whole country basically on the information that you've been able
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:56:59.600]  to gather and stuff so it doesn't by the way i don't i don't like to actually have to admit
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:03.920]  that we are the tip of the spear right now and it's super creepy i don't i don't like it
[03:57:03.920 --> 03:57:08.400]  well i can appreciate that man but you're appreciated by millions of people across this
[03:57:08.400 --> 03:57:13.600]  country and we all see but i can say one thing especially your audience not that i have all the
[03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:18.720]  answers but i do know one thing that we are going to overtake and we are going to win and we're
[03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:22.800]  going to get on the right side of history and all these thugs and criminals in the district of
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:28.400]  criminals up there and these turncoats that have you know tried to down our second amendment
[03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:32.880]  rights and that these people their day is coming of reckoning real soon real quick there is a
[03:57:32.880 --> 03:57:37.040]  paradigm shift that's going on in this world right today just going to shift the whole balance of
[03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:43.840]  power of wealth and money and power and it's coming and they know it and i think on top of
[03:57:43.840 --> 03:57:48.320]  what you have done which is a major dynamic you definitely got these people on the run and god
[03:57:48.320 --> 03:57:52.720]  bless you for it no we've got them on the run and if they do set me up or kill me or anything i want
[03:57:52.720 --> 03:58:01.200]  you all to continue info wars i want my operation to continue i want to be able to just have them
[03:58:01.200 --> 03:58:06.160]  to just have them defeated go out confront them at press conferences confront them everywhere
[03:58:06.160 --> 03:58:12.400]  take over the info war never back down um look they're not going to stop us the reason they
[03:58:12.400 --> 03:58:15.520]  haven't killed me believe me they love to they kill people all the time is they know would
[03:58:15.520 --> 03:58:20.160]  probably turbo charge everything be like in road warrior when they turn the nitrous oxide on it
[03:58:20.160 --> 03:58:26.080]  you know the vehicle goes into you know doubles its speed in mere seconds so uh whatever hell i'm
[03:58:26.080 --> 03:58:29.360]  so damn exhausted sometimes they come after and i even worry about it i'll be like oh really you're

[04:01:08.640 --> 04:01:13.120]  coming to try to kill me i would get adrenaline rush get my gun and try to find a place to hide
[04:01:13.120 --> 04:01:17.040]  and wait for them but i wouldn't be just running around marching around i don't know how these
[04:01:17.040 --> 04:01:21.040]  cops march around like little kids in these uniforms bugging their eyes out acting tough
[04:01:21.040 --> 04:01:26.560]  like 10 hours at a time it's like some weird narcissistic mental illness or something i i just
[04:01:27.360 --> 04:01:31.520]  i mean i just don't even get it i mean you know i kind of get white knuckle when i'm driving down
[04:01:31.520 --> 04:01:37.760]  a one lane road on each side of like 70 and it's at night and there's deer and stuff and you know
[04:01:37.760 --> 04:01:41.680]  somebody have a blowout and go right into your lane you're going 70 they're going 70 that's

[04:01:47.760 --> 04:01:53.040]  to get over in the shoulder and and try to stay away from because i realize that's a danger
[04:01:53.760 --> 04:01:58.320]  and i mean just like a city of six hundred thousand or whatever it's just running around and
[04:01:58.880 --> 04:02:05.520]  total abject complete you know bonkers fear everything else you can imagine
[04:02:06.400 --> 04:02:12.320]  makes absolutely no sense uh unless you realize it's a power grab and there is a major cover-up
[04:02:12.320 --> 04:02:17.760]  going on their whole narrative has unraveled and uh they're just counting on the public being so
[04:02:17.760 --> 04:02:22.000]  dumb it's like dorner we're now in the 21st century they're like we're going to burn him
[04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:26.160]  down yeah kill him burn that cabin down okay get the fire i've got it we're placing it the fire's
[04:02:26.160 --> 04:02:30.320]  lit okay we got fire mission completed we burned him down and there you go number one that's an
[04:02:30.320 --> 04:02:33.680]  internet rumor there's no audio of that oh actually got it from six different sources
[04:02:33.680 --> 04:02:43.040]  different people saying it we didn't mean burn it down we didn't mean burn it down we didn't mean
[04:02:44.000 --> 04:02:51.280]  burn it down talking to you like you are a low grade moron now we're going to re-air this on
[04:02:51.280 --> 04:02:54.880]  the nightly news again tonight really great report just looking at some of the recent drone stuff
[04:02:54.880 --> 04:02:58.240]  even from their whitewash it's clear they're lying about the numbers being killed by drones
[04:02:58.240 --> 04:03:03.360]  when obama talks about anybody using a bomb to kill innocent civilians as a terrorist
[04:03:03.360 --> 04:03:07.120]  and i tend to agree with you and are there real chechen terrorists yeah they're funny
[04:03:07.120 --> 04:03:10.880]  about the cia most of the time but there's a chance these can be real chechen terrorists
[04:03:10.880 --> 04:03:14.480]  i want to know why there was a drill they're lying about and all those intelligence agencies
[04:03:14.480 --> 04:03:18.640]  right there when it happened looking right where the bombing was using the drill for the stand down
[04:03:19.760 --> 04:03:26.400]  that's the evidence of the false flag and if this is proven to not be a false flag which i think
[04:03:26.400 --> 04:03:31.520]  it's gone from one percent chance to maybe five percent chance i will eat my hat and apologize
[04:03:31.520 --> 04:03:38.640]  and be very pleased i mean i would do cartwheels and probably go on vacation for a week and and
[04:03:38.640 --> 04:03:45.360]  and and and run around popping champagne bottles because i really want to believe that the
[04:03:45.360 --> 04:03:50.000]  government is not this evil i really want to believe they didn't do thousands of lethal tests on
[04:03:50.000 --> 04:03:54.960]  foster kids and black people and native americans and poor communities and abilations and
[04:03:55.840 --> 04:04:00.080]  jewish kids in israel you know the ringworm kids radiating to death i mean i know about all that
[04:04:00.080 --> 04:04:03.840]  and it's like oh yeah the government killed four thousand kids here and five thousand there and
[04:04:03.840 --> 04:04:09.680]  a thousand here and injected people with syphilis over 45 years and yeah last year the un gave you
[04:04:09.680 --> 04:04:14.320]  know millions of kids this polio vaccine it killed a bunch of them and sixty thousand got paralyzed
[04:04:14.320 --> 04:04:19.200]  or whatever but yeah guardasil kills the kids blah blah blah yeah autism's from one in thirty
[04:04:19.200 --> 04:04:24.240]  thousand or one in twenty five thousand thirty years ago to one in fifty and there's all these
[04:04:24.240 --> 04:04:29.200]  false flags and all these admissions and i'm supposed to just ignore all of that now i got
[04:04:29.200 --> 04:04:35.040]  the next crew coming in here and uh they're gonna be in there about two hours and we're gonna have
[04:04:35.040 --> 04:04:38.720]  the nightly news tonight that they're gonna do because i'm getting out of here well actually i'm
[04:04:38.720 --> 04:04:44.240]  not getting down there i'm gonna go work on my magazine for an hour uh and then i gotta go i
[04:04:44.240 --> 04:04:49.920]  gotta get out of here i mean the problem is i'm so worked up that i can't even sleep in fact i
[04:04:49.920 --> 04:04:54.880]  stopped drinking coffee yesterday at about three o'clock and i went home went to bed about 10 and
[04:04:54.880 --> 04:05:01.680]  and woke up at 3 a.m so that's some of the best sleep i've had all week um so actually i'm all
[04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:06.640]  the reason i say that is so you know i'm at you know i'm not fully operational here uh because
[04:05:06.640 --> 04:05:11.680]  i'm gonna start getting burnt out but we got chris matthews saying the bombing might be emotional
[04:05:11.680 --> 04:05:17.200]  uh uh domestic attack in response to tax day cnn warns of right-wing extremists behind boston

[04:07:06.800 --> 04:07:11.600]  with one of the other reporters i just you know issues with family and stuff too but i'm trying
[04:07:11.600 --> 04:07:16.800]  to expand the operation so we can go 24 hours a day i woke up at 3 a.m and went to the computer
[04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:22.720]  hadra took care of a sick child at about 4 a.m i get on the computer headache from hell and i see

[04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:39.040]  more journalist writers to work overnight and have a night shift i need money to do that
[04:07:39.040 --> 04:07:44.720]  i need it takes a lot of money to hire people and run this operation i've been so busy i haven't
[04:07:44.720 --> 04:07:49.120]  even plugged books videos products our bandwidth bill is going to be off the charts right now
[04:07:49.840 --> 04:07:53.840]  it said you want to turn all these servers on because we got all these clouds and cdns
[04:07:54.560 --> 04:08:01.520]  they can just flick on but i gotta pay for it i'd imagine we'll probably have a 70 80
[04:08:01.520 --> 04:08:06.000]  000 bill from the video and the extra audio and all the servers i mean we're talking about
[04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:11.760]  six seven eight nine ten million people a day now with a graphic heavy sight i mean it's it's
[04:08:11.760 --> 04:08:18.480]  just bonkers and um i don't know what's an extra hundred thousand people a minute for about two
[04:08:18.480 --> 04:08:23.280]  and a half hours piling on compounding i mean i mean that was just yesterday so be sure and donate
[04:08:23.280 --> 04:08:29.120]  to us so we can be strong and robust and have vets on you know for their legal defense when
[04:08:29.120 --> 04:08:33.680]  they're having their guns confiscated for no reason in texas uh you know this is a major
[04:08:33.680 --> 04:08:38.240]  aircraft carrier in the fight against the globalist we are not that big a mothership
[04:08:38.240 --> 04:08:42.480]  we're the biggest ship we've got and when we're able to fire on the enemy with history and common
[04:08:42.480 --> 04:08:51.040]  sense we're about all there is out there engaging them we're about all there is uh and uh again i'm

[04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:24.320]  drones and then we're going to come back uh with uh the host jakari jackson and david knight stay
[04:10:24.320 --> 04:10:32.160]  with us this was a heinous and cowardly act and given what we now know about what took place the
[04:10:32.160 --> 04:10:38.960]  fbi is investigating it as an act of terrorism anytime bombs are used to target innocent
[04:10:38.960 --> 04:10:45.280]  civilians it is an act of terror i'm lianne makadu and this is an info wars special report
[04:10:45.280 --> 04:10:50.800]  the obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are authorized only against specific
[04:10:50.800 --> 04:10:55.360]  senior al-qaeda leaders and their associates that were directly involved with the september 11th
[04:10:55.360 --> 04:11:00.800]  terror attacks and those who pose an imminent threat to america this is in direct contrast
[04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:06.160]  to the findings reported last week by mcclatchy who reviewed top secret intelligence documents
[04:11:06.160 --> 04:11:11.760]  obtained by their national security reporter the documents show that drone strikes in pakistan over
[04:11:11.760 --> 04:11:17.520]  a four-year period didn't meet those standards of authorization and at times the cia killed people
[04:11:17.520 --> 04:11:23.760]  who were only suspected or who probably belonged to militant groups mclatchy found that during a
[04:11:23.760 --> 04:11:31.920]  12-month period ending september 2011 at least 265 of the 482 people estimated to have been killed
[04:11:31.920 --> 04:11:38.640]  by the cia were not senior al-qaeda leaders but instead were assessed as afghan pakistani and
[04:11:38.640 --> 04:11:45.280]  any an unknown extremist in fact according to news media accounts drones killed only six top
[04:11:45.280 --> 04:11:51.200]  al-qaeda leaders in those months the report also lists killing of afghan insurgents whose
[04:11:51.200 --> 04:11:57.280]  organization wasn't on the u.s list of suspected terrorist groups at the time of the 9 11 strikes
[04:11:57.280 --> 04:12:03.600]  43 of 95 drone strikes reviewed for that period hit groups including unidentified individuals
[04:12:03.600 --> 04:12:10.960]  described as foreign fighters and other militants in a june 2011 talk at john hopkins university in
[04:12:10.960 --> 04:12:17.360]  washington cia head and drone mastermind john brennan said that the u.s is exceptionally
[04:12:17.360 --> 04:12:22.720]  precise and surgical in terms of addressing the terrorist threat and by that i mean if there are
[04:12:22.720 --> 04:12:27.760]  terrorists who are within an area where there are women and children or others you know we do not
[04:12:27.760 --> 04:12:33.840]  take such action that might put those innocent men women and children in danger he added that in the
[04:12:33.840 --> 04:12:39.120]  last year there hadn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency
[04:12:39.120 --> 04:12:44.240]  precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop accordingly the reports mclatchy
[04:12:44.240 --> 04:12:50.720]  reviewed estimated there was a single civilian casualty an individual killed in an april 22nd
[04:12:50.720 --> 04:12:58.240]  2011 strike in north waziristan however according to a report by the bbc of that exact strike out
[04:12:58.240 --> 04:13:05.440]  of the 25 casualties five women and four children were killed in a nearby house a 2011 investigation
[04:13:05.440 --> 04:13:11.520]  by the bureau of investigative journalism found at least 10 individual attacks in which 45 or more
[04:13:11.520 --> 04:13:16.880]  civilians appear to have died pitch interactive created this graphic showing the casualties of
[04:13:16.880 --> 04:13:22.960]  children civilians high-profile individuals and others resulting from drone strikes in pakistan
[04:13:22.960 --> 04:13:29.360]  between 2004 and 2013 all of this information conflicts with what brennan had to say last year
[04:13:29.360 --> 04:13:34.080]  we only authorize a particular operation against a specific individual if we have a high degree
[04:13:34.080 --> 04:13:40.080]  of confidence that the individual being targeted is indeed the terrorist we are pursuing contrary
[04:13:40.080 --> 04:13:45.680]  to the cia's position that civilian casualties have been exceedingly rare the documents show
[04:13:45.680 --> 04:13:52.640]  that drone operators weren't always certain who they were killing in light of these facts
[04:13:52.640 --> 04:13:59.120]  the deadly potentiality of domestic drones is even more pressing the mass introduction of unmanned
[04:13:59.120 --> 04:14:05.200]  aerial vehicles is set to sweep the national airspace by 2015 yet our government has yet
[04:14:05.200 --> 04:14:10.560]  to set the rules by which the president is authorized to target civilians on american soil
[04:14:10.560 --> 04:14:16.560]  the 12-hour filibuster in march by senator ran paul highlighted this issue i think we should all
[04:14:16.560 --> 04:14:24.000]  judge as inadequate the president's response when he says he hasn't killed americans in america yet
[04:14:24.880 --> 04:14:31.040]  he doesn't intend to but that he might i don't think that that is a response that we should
[04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:36.560]  tolerate we also know that we have targeted people for sympathizing with the enemy we've had many
[04:14:36.560 --> 04:14:41.840]  people who have dissented in our country we've had people in our country who have been against
[04:14:41.840 --> 04:14:49.120]  the afghan war against the iraq war i was opposed to the iraq war what are the criteria for who will
[04:14:49.120 --> 04:14:56.080]  be killed could political dissent be part of the standard for drones drugs and you say well that's
[04:14:56.080 --> 04:15:04.320]  ridiculous we have listed people already on websites and said that they were risk for
[04:15:04.320 --> 04:15:11.280]  terrorism for their political beliefs considering the recent media spin targeting patriots and then
[04:15:11.280 --> 04:15:16.560]  lumping them in the same category as al-qaeda are we not setting the stage for drones to be used
[04:15:16.560 --> 04:15:23.280]  freely on american soil against those with dissenting opinions can you kill non-combatants
[04:15:24.080 --> 04:15:29.920]  and people say well the president would never kill non-combatants the problem is is that's who
[04:15:29.920 --> 04:15:36.320]  we're killing overseas reports show that 98 percent of the casualties from u.s drone strikes
[04:15:36.320 --> 04:15:43.920]  are civilians anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror so by
[04:15:43.920 --> 04:15:49.520]  his own definition does obama consider himself a terrorist i'm leon mackadoo and this has been an
[04:15:49.520 --> 04:16:05.200]  infowars special report yes it is not new and it is not honor all right and welcome back to the
[04:16:05.200 --> 04:16:10.160]  alex jones radio show i'm jakari jackson filling in i will be joined by david knight in just a few
[04:16:10.160 --> 04:16:14.560]  minutes he's actually over in the tv studio conducting an interview and i just want to take
[04:16:14.560 --> 04:16:17.840]  a moment and pause from this uh this boston news we'll definitely be talking about that a little
[04:16:17.840 --> 04:16:23.280]  bit later on when david knight gets here in studio but this weekend we i wouldn't say we celebrate
[04:16:23.280 --> 04:16:30.160]  but we observe the anniversaries of waco and oklahoma city and even these uh the new situation
[04:16:30.160 --> 04:16:36.320]  in waco with the fertilizer plant and also um i guess the boston bombing as well this is a
[04:16:36.320 --> 04:16:41.360]  very jam-packed week and other definitely uh incidents that have happened during this week in
[04:16:41.360 --> 04:16:46.320]  history i would like to start uh there's something that came to my attention a little bit earlier
[04:16:46.320 --> 04:16:52.000]  today this is something that you can find on infowars.com facebook blocks infowars posts on
[04:16:52.000 --> 04:16:57.920]  suspicious men wearing backpacks now we i was reading through the tip line earlier today uh
[04:16:57.920 --> 04:17:02.240]  the show tips at infowars we do read those i was reading those before we came in and got a lot of
[04:17:02.240 --> 04:17:06.960]  tips off of it this was one of them and basically you can find this article in infowars.com it talks
[04:17:06.960 --> 04:17:12.960]  about how facebook is blocking our post on on facebook facebook is blocking our post on facebook
[04:17:12.960 --> 04:17:18.560]  and allow myself to introduce myself but not just there also on youtube there's a video i put up a
[04:17:18.560 --> 04:17:23.760]  couple weeks not a couple weeks a couple days ago on the alex jones youtube page it was from my
[04:17:23.760 --> 04:17:28.960]  nightly news segment a couple nights ago and people kept questioning why is this uh is this
[04:17:28.960 --> 04:17:34.560]  post blocked there is no explicit content in that video except for the truth uh i believe it's now
[04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:41.840]  off the off the blocks uh settings but all it was it was titled trendy's call for white terrorist
[04:17:41.840 --> 04:17:47.600]  and what that is it was about the salon article that said they wanted a a white terrorist because
[04:17:47.600 --> 04:17:54.640]  if it was some type of minority group like muslims or some type of uh maybe like homosexual group or
[04:17:54.640 --> 04:17:59.440]  you know some type of group they've deemed as a minority those people would be targeted but with
[04:17:59.440 --> 04:18:04.080]  when it's a white terrorist there is no targeted group but you know as i pointed out in that
[04:18:04.080 --> 04:18:10.160]  article it targets uh timothy mcveigh when the oklahoma city bombings and so on and so forth
[04:18:10.160 --> 04:18:14.640]  so i'm not exactly sure why that happened but there has been some censorship of info wars over
[04:18:14.640 --> 04:18:20.400]  the last couple days and not surprising you got guys like dan badandi you know going into press
[04:18:20.400 --> 04:18:25.440]  conferences shutting them down making the mainstream address him and that's uh that's a
[04:18:25.440 --> 04:18:30.960]  major victory not just for dan but just for the whole alternative news movement because so far
[04:18:30.960 --> 04:18:35.200]  they just want to ignore you ignore you ignore you ignore you then they try to fight with you
[04:18:35.200 --> 04:18:40.640]  now they're trying to say you know dan and alex are super rats and you know all this all this
[04:18:40.640 --> 04:18:46.640]  other silliness but if the guys can get ready there's a clip of the naked man and what this is
[04:18:46.640 --> 04:18:51.440]  uh i believe it was cnn we're in a clip earlier today uh earlier this morning i believe it was
[04:18:52.080 --> 04:18:57.760]  after the shootout at mit concerning the the boston situation uh there was a shootout and
[04:18:57.760 --> 04:19:04.480]  a car chase and after that they produced a i guess it was a suspect at the time a naked gentleman who
[04:19:04.480 --> 04:19:10.240]  was uh told to strip naked by police or fbi whoever it was in was escorted into a car and
[04:19:10.240 --> 04:19:15.280]  guys just let me know when you have that and my question is who is this naked man because there
[04:19:15.280 --> 04:19:20.720]  have been conflicting reports that he was this was a suspect and then he was let go i'm not exactly
[04:19:20.720 --> 04:19:24.960]  sure if he's still in custody or what happened to the guy okay so we do have that clip so we'll
[04:19:24.960 --> 04:19:29.360]  just go to that right now then talk about it afterwards the individual had been stripped
[04:19:29.360 --> 04:19:34.800]  naked by law enforcement presumably out of caution to make sure that he didn't have any
[04:19:34.800 --> 04:19:38.800]  explosives on him this is the individual cnn photojournalist who you had heard just a minute
[04:19:38.800 --> 04:19:44.640]  ago shot this in watertown this evening police handcuffed a man the man you see in this video
[04:19:44.640 --> 04:19:50.800]  getting into the police car he's believed believed to be associated with the shooting at mit and the
[04:19:50.800 --> 04:19:56.960]  subsequent chase through the streets of greater boston so you saw him right there he was a naked
[04:19:56.960 --> 04:20:03.520]  uh fairly in shape guy they placed him into the police car after telling him to strip himself
[04:20:03.520 --> 04:20:08.480]  but naked and uh conflicting reports some people say he's still in custody some people say he has
[04:20:08.480 --> 04:20:12.000]  been released but when we open the phone lines up a little bit later when day or night gets in
[04:20:12.000 --> 04:20:15.920]  here we definitely want to hear from you if you have any information who this guy is if you live
[04:20:15.920 --> 04:20:20.800]  in boston especially if you're one of the people who've had your you're in one of those lockdown
[04:20:20.800 --> 04:20:25.440]  situations where your house is being searched you're told don't go outside or all that other
[04:20:25.440 --> 04:20:28.800]  stuff so we want to hear from you when we open the phone lines up in a little bit and david
[04:20:28.800 --> 04:20:32.000]  nice going to touch on this when he gets in here but i want to talk a little bit about the
[04:20:32.000 --> 04:20:38.000]  branch davidian compound at waco that was rated some 20 years ago now is back in
[04:20:38.880 --> 04:20:45.520]  uh a few not a few years ago but back years back uh says during the standoff several women and
[04:20:45.520 --> 04:20:51.920]  children left the compound but on april 19 19th nearly 80 sect members died when the compound
[04:20:51.920 --> 04:20:57.760]  burned after tear gas was fired into the building so sect members they had to throw that in there
[04:20:57.760 --> 04:21:02.880]  and then they said they died after tear gas was fired into the building it was the tear gas not
[04:21:02.880 --> 04:21:08.880]  the uh the flame throwing tank or the officers climbing onto the roof and busting out the windows
[04:21:08.880 --> 04:21:14.480]  and throwing incendiaries and uh all kinds of other madness it was this tear gas canister
[04:21:14.480 --> 04:21:19.200]  just like we saw in the chris dorner case where you know they can feel the flash bang and the
[04:21:19.200 --> 04:21:24.800]  burner which burns your whole house down apparently even though we heard him on the radio saying burn
[04:21:24.800 --> 04:21:31.280]  that mother effort down it was the tear gas it was the flashbang grenades and not anything else
[04:21:31.280 --> 04:21:35.440]  and david knight i believe is actually conducting an interview over the waco massacre and he'll
[04:21:35.440 --> 04:21:40.400]  have much more on that in a second but in the meantime let's talk about the current situation
[04:21:40.400 --> 04:21:47.680]  in waco that is the fire that has 12 dead confirmed and 60 still missing in the city of west
[04:21:47.680 --> 04:21:52.480]  now this happened just a few days ago it started at a fertilizer plant we haven't been talking much
[04:21:52.480 --> 04:21:56.880]  about this because you know it's uh it's hard to get these things in the news when we have
[04:21:56.880 --> 04:22:01.360]  a manhunt and so forth going on but i definitely want to take the time to point it out and also
[04:22:01.360 --> 04:22:07.120]  we'll take calls on this as well uh waco uh the fertilizer plant the uh the branch the video and
[04:22:07.120 --> 04:22:12.160]  situation oklahoma city all that stuff we want to make sure all of our callers can call in and
[04:22:12.160 --> 04:22:18.640]  address those situations but here in west uh the fertilizer plant went up and smoked uh the
[04:22:18.640 --> 04:22:24.880]  investigation is still ongoing uh definitely have a a fume situation out there and it was just very
[04:22:24.880 --> 04:22:28.640]  curious to me i'm not saying this is directly related but it's a very convenient thing that
[04:22:28.640 --> 04:22:33.520]  they had this uh this fire at the fertilizer plant right around the same time as the waco
[04:22:33.520 --> 04:22:38.720]  uh it's a donald i'm not sure if anniversary is the right word but the waco remembrance and so
[04:22:38.720 --> 04:22:42.240]  that's going to scare a lot of people away because even david knight was talking about going down
[04:22:42.240 --> 04:22:46.160]  there then we got you know of course inundated with the uh the boston news and the other news
[04:22:46.160 --> 04:22:51.040]  in the senate but uh there was talks about going out to waco and you know with the cherry on top
[04:22:51.040 --> 04:22:57.440]  of the of the fume situation i guess you would call it we didn't have a chance to get out there
[04:22:57.440 --> 04:23:03.600]  but we definitely want to take your calls on that in the upcoming segments so do we have the phone
[04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:10.720]  lines open can we open those up okay we'll give those open in just a second so let's go through
[04:23:10.720 --> 04:23:15.520]  some more of these new news items here in the stack also somebody called in yesterday and i
[04:23:15.520 --> 04:23:20.000]  wanted to address this a gentleman called in i believe it was a gentleman called in and said
[04:23:20.000 --> 04:23:27.120]  hey have you guys seen these pictures online of uh you know the alleged unit craft at the boston
[04:23:27.120 --> 04:23:32.240]  marathon and you know we've had some of those on our website on infowars.com but he says hey if
[04:23:32.240 --> 04:23:36.240]  you take a look at this website i can't remember the name of the website you can check it out and
[04:23:36.240 --> 04:23:41.920]  see these gentlemen all crowded around a particular vehicle well mike adams the health ranger he
[04:23:41.920 --> 04:23:46.720]  called me last night he said hey i followed up that lead from that collar and it does indeed
[04:23:46.720 --> 04:23:52.560]  seem to be true and you can find that on naturalnews.com mike adams article about the
[04:23:52.560 --> 04:23:58.720]  the gentleman who you know appeared to be affiliated with craft around a vehicle huddled
[04:23:58.720 --> 04:24:02.880]  around that vehicle so uh it's a very good question you know i believe we are on the case
[04:24:02.880 --> 04:24:07.840]  trying to find out if craft was indeed there or not and if they were there what were they doing
[04:24:07.840 --> 04:24:12.640]  there so that's another call we got off the tip line also the uh the naked man somebody sent me
[04:24:12.640 --> 04:24:17.200]  that i was searching for that video and then i saw it in our show tips at infowars so we definitely
[04:24:17.200 --> 04:24:22.640]  use that just like we got the uh the image of the guy having his papers checked in boston that was
[04:24:22.640 --> 04:24:26.960]  off the tip line as well so definitely give us your tip to show tips at infowars yeah of course
[04:24:26.960 --> 04:24:32.400]  there is a lot going on on that uh on that website or excuse me on that email but we get to stuff
[04:24:32.400 --> 04:24:37.600]  and we can and uh we do the best we can to shift through that so you guys let me know when uh when
[04:24:37.600 --> 04:24:42.800]  you're ready to go with that so let's look at this police going door to door and hunt for second
[04:24:42.800 --> 04:24:49.520]  marathon bomb suspect so it just makes me think when you have situations like this bombing in
[04:24:49.520 --> 04:24:57.040]  boston the chris dorner situation one man or i guess in this case uh two men in boston pretty
[04:24:57.040 --> 04:25:05.440]  much shut down a city or at least a suburb in the case of uh boston in a more rural area okay
[04:25:05.440 --> 04:25:08.960]  oh i guess we'll give out the phone number right now it's the 877 number the guys are telling me
[04:25:08.960 --> 04:25:18.080]  we're ready so it's going to be 877-789 alex that is 877-789-2539 and we'll take your calls
[04:25:18.080 --> 04:25:22.960]  and get you on the air but back to the point i was making with the uh the lockdown situation
[04:25:22.960 --> 04:25:27.440]  you have a situation where two guys in boston and one guy in california can pretty much shut
[04:25:27.440 --> 04:25:33.840]  down the city send the police the fbi and all these other agencies into a panic and it brings
[04:25:33.840 --> 04:25:38.960]  the the notion brings the question what if there was more people if you know if 10 people decide
[04:25:38.960 --> 04:25:43.520]  to go off and do this how would they be able to handle this they can't handle one guy in la and
[04:25:43.520 --> 04:25:47.680]  two guys in boston i mean what what are we paying these people for and don't get me wrong the police
[04:25:47.680 --> 04:25:53.040]  the police definitely have a difficult job of implementing pretty much martial law checking
[04:25:53.040 --> 04:25:57.920]  house to house uh you know show us your papers kind of deal that's what the city comes to or
[04:25:57.920 --> 04:26:02.400]  i guess what the country comes to when you have one or two people out there highly motivated to
[04:26:02.400 --> 04:26:07.760]  inflict harm and definitely uh regardless if you believe the uh complete stories of the chris
[04:26:07.760 --> 04:26:12.640]  dornish situation or this boston situation i don't believe the official story on either one of them
[04:26:12.640 --> 04:26:18.880]  not saying there aren't elements of truth but we saw the uh the aunt of the suspects on tv saying
[04:26:18.880 --> 04:26:22.800]  i want to see the footage and that's the big deal we were watching that footage last night
[04:26:22.800 --> 04:26:27.920]  during the fbi press conference and they said hey here are the two guys who did the uh who did the
[04:26:27.920 --> 04:26:32.800]  deed and we're saying okay so we're watching the guys walk around uh rocking around the corners
[04:26:32.800 --> 04:26:36.240]  and we're saying okay so when's the guy going to put down the bomb when's the guy going to put down
[04:26:36.240 --> 04:26:42.080]  the mob the bomb and they never showed the guys putting down the bomb i'm not exactly sure why
[04:26:42.080 --> 04:26:46.800]  that is i don't think it's disrespectful to the family to at least show the guys placing the bomb
[04:26:46.800 --> 04:26:52.400]  down and then there were the um pretty much uh ridiculous reports that these guys have multiple
[04:26:52.400 --> 04:26:57.120]  backpacks and backpacks like they're pulling rabbits out of hats they're pulling bomb backpacks
[04:26:57.120 --> 04:27:03.840]  out of bomb backpacks the colors don't match but you know cnn had a nice uh analysis nice
[04:27:03.840 --> 04:27:09.040]  uh visual representation when dan badani was bullhorning them they said hey yeah just we'll
[04:27:09.040 --> 04:27:12.720]  you just pull it out just like you know pull a rabbit out of a hat and that was pretty much
[04:27:12.720 --> 04:27:20.240]  their explanation going hard to uh going hard to get the official story out there so i'll take a
[04:27:20.240 --> 04:27:23.520]  break from ranting and we'll go to kyle in iowa
[04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:34.080]  on yes go ahead kyle hey um i was curious um i don't know if you guys had been paying
[04:27:34.080 --> 04:27:38.080]  attention to it but earlier this morning when they released the names of the suspects
[04:27:38.080 --> 04:27:46.240]  and all that my wife had went on to see if the guy had a facebook page and she noticed a couple
[04:27:46.240 --> 04:27:52.160]  things that were peculiar and the page did not stay up very long um and i took several photos
[04:27:52.160 --> 04:27:57.040]  of it it was kind of a wing ding or kind of a whiz bang kind of thing um because i pulled it down
[04:27:57.040 --> 04:28:05.440]  right away uh but there was a bunch of pictures that were dated from like october january april
[04:28:05.440 --> 04:28:09.120]  or whatever that were supposedly on this guy's page but if you looked at the little clock right
[04:28:09.120 --> 04:28:14.640]  next to it they were all posted this morning really there was a there yeah there was a gal who
[04:28:15.280 --> 04:28:20.400]  had called that out and within four minutes of her calling that out because i just got up to
[04:28:20.400 --> 04:28:25.280]  go check it out because my wife had got me and i was and i was busy so i didn't go to it right
[04:28:25.280 --> 04:28:30.320]  that second i was like quick print off a bunch of that take pictures she did that by the time
[04:28:30.320 --> 04:28:35.920]  i got there the guy's whole or one of the the suspect that's still alive yes his whole facebook
[04:28:35.920 --> 04:28:43.200]  profile was taken down it was replaced with a different one same pictures and all the all these
[04:28:43.200 --> 04:28:48.560]  pictures he had a bunch of weird like mugshot looking pictures yeah i was gonna ask you about
[04:28:48.560 --> 04:28:53.120]  that well since you brought that up let's talk about that now about the uh mugshot looking
[04:28:53.120 --> 04:28:58.240]  pictures because when i was first watching the uh the news today and they announced uh once they
[04:28:58.240 --> 04:29:03.440]  identified the guy's uh the name and identity they said uh here's a picture of him my first question
[04:29:03.440 --> 04:29:07.120]  was where did they get that picture it looked like a mugshot and then one of our reporters
[04:29:07.120 --> 04:29:11.600]  lianne macadu she said they got that off his facebook page now i've seen some pretty silly
[04:29:11.600 --> 04:29:17.760]  looking pictures on facebook but i haven't seen one it looks that much like a mugshot yeah yeah
[04:29:17.760 --> 04:29:22.960]  why um on uh aaron dykes's facebook page because i'm his buddy on there i actually sent him a
[04:29:22.960 --> 04:29:28.560]  private message and i posted a bunch of the pictures on his timeline of the ones we took
[04:29:28.560 --> 04:29:34.560]  down and there's a few more we we printed off a few of the uh um comments and stuff that were
[04:29:34.560 --> 04:29:41.200]  on there like when the girl was calling that guy out and everything um but it was the whole thing
[04:29:41.200 --> 04:29:46.560]  with his facebook euro it had his name in there so if they created a fake facebook he never had
[04:29:46.560 --> 04:29:53.120]  one before or it was somebody trolling that had his exact same name now when they took it down
[04:29:53.120 --> 04:30:00.160]  and put it back up again it was you know in the euro um or the facebook it was some check it was
[04:30:00.160 --> 04:30:06.720]  uh i had to pull it up here but it was uh her name think about facebook like sir i haven't seen
[04:30:06.720 --> 04:30:10.960]  the particular page you're talking about and like i said it was taken down so i can't really address
[04:30:10.960 --> 04:30:14.720]  that situation myself but you know anybody can make a facebook someone can make a jakari jackson
[04:30:14.720 --> 04:30:19.680]  facebook you know so you have to it's just be aware of those situations the way no i i understand
[04:30:19.680 --> 04:30:27.120]  that because uh it the way it was done seemed um it just seemed really fishy that all of a sudden
[04:30:27.120 --> 04:30:32.720]  this facebook page got pulled out pulled down when they were when they got called out like i said
[04:30:33.280 --> 04:30:39.200]  on aaron dykes's facebook my wife did a write-up with all the all the specifics because she knows
[04:30:39.200 --> 04:30:44.960]  more the specifics than i do right um and we're we're kind of looking at it like well it could
[04:30:44.960 --> 04:30:50.400]  be a troll but these are the things that seem a little weird all these pictures were posted today
[04:30:52.000 --> 04:30:58.240]  um and in his first initial facebook it looked legitimate because it had a whole timeline and
[04:30:58.240 --> 04:31:01.920]  everything to it it wasn't just like oh i just put up a facebook page today there's a whole history
[04:31:01.920 --> 04:31:06.480]  on there she checked that out because i want to see what this guy was about yeah yeah and then
[04:31:06.480 --> 04:31:11.520]  all of a sudden the next one is just a bunch of uh mug shots and but all of a sudden his he
[04:31:11.520 --> 04:31:16.960]  apparently he she or whatever apparently lived in chicago and changed their address to boston
[04:31:16.960 --> 04:31:22.960]  and then all of a sudden boom that was gone too um but she the full write-up and it's a rough
[04:31:22.960 --> 04:31:27.680]  it's a rough write-up it's like a rough draft right but i wanted to get it out but it's it's
[04:31:27.680 --> 04:31:32.560]  on aaron's facebook page okay well definitely if you're listening to aaron check that out but you
[04:31:32.560 --> 04:31:37.760]  can also send it to us at uh show tips at info wars and we'll try to take a look at that thank
[04:31:37.760 --> 04:31:43.600]  you for your call we're going to move on now to jeremy in texas all right how are you today sir
[04:31:43.600 --> 04:31:48.640]  doing very well how are you i'm doing very well thank you for asking i want to preface this with
[04:31:48.640 --> 04:31:54.160]  90 percent of all warfare psychologically and so the war that we see fought on our streets
[04:31:54.800 --> 04:32:00.240]  is not the war to be concerned about everything's a test bed and a caller calling earlier and say
[04:32:00.240 --> 04:32:05.920]  that we have to have multiple exit points so that's what the i does uh whenever that happens
[04:32:05.920 --> 04:32:11.280]  and i really see that bombing as a kiss of uh kiss of death if you will because they could have easily
[04:32:11.280 --> 04:32:16.160]  blown up that whole corridor and cause much more havoc oh yes but having small little proxy wars
[04:32:16.160 --> 04:32:22.880]  like this what it does create a test bed for uh future events i mean and people think that martial
[04:32:22.880 --> 04:32:27.680]  law is going to slowly come to america it's going to happen all at once and i don't know if the
[04:32:27.680 --> 04:32:33.200]  whole movement is quite keen on that but i really feel like whenever it really goes down you're
[04:32:33.200 --> 04:32:37.440]  going to see events happen all over the country and when that happens you'll have marshall all
[04:32:37.440 --> 04:32:41.520]  happen all over the country people will beg for it yeah and just like you said because they think
[04:32:41.520 --> 04:32:47.680]  of big big events like uh 9 11 or the uh the oklahoma city bombing and you know those things
[04:32:47.680 --> 04:32:52.320]  are you know huge events but they happen you know with good spaces in between but now you have these
[04:32:52.320 --> 04:32:57.680]  small uh explosions a movie theater shootouts and you know that's going to happen anywhere that's
[04:32:57.680 --> 04:33:01.840]  going to happen in small town america they don't have to be you know you know uh fairly decent
[04:33:01.840 --> 04:33:06.240]  sized cities like boston and that's when you're going to have people begging uh please take my
[04:33:06.240 --> 04:33:10.080]  rights please come check my house even though i nobody nobody's in here except me and my dog
[04:33:10.080 --> 04:33:16.560]  please come check my basement in my attic to make sure that i'm safe there is a line being drawn in
[04:33:16.560 --> 04:33:21.680]  the sand right now and that line is those who think for themselves and those who do not because
[04:33:21.680 --> 04:33:26.320]  when this martial law comes in comes in it's implemented hand me your guns whatever whatever
[04:33:26.320 --> 04:33:30.320]  it is uh to be concerned about it's not to be concerned about the handling your guns or someone
[04:33:30.320 --> 04:33:34.720]  knocking on your door what's really to be concerned about are your neighbors who either think for
[04:33:34.720 --> 04:33:39.840]  themselves or they do not because of i mean you know mortal technique even said they don't have to
[04:33:39.840 --> 04:33:44.000]  uh institute martial law they can just turn the water off that's an excellent point prevent you
[04:33:44.000 --> 04:33:49.680]  from having food they can prevent all these various things so um what's really concerned
[04:33:49.680 --> 04:33:56.000]  about is uh do you think for yourself or do you not and it's up to us it is our duty not just to
[04:33:56.000 --> 04:34:02.960]  do things to stop this but to get into contact and to build our community um as an equal force of
[04:34:02.960 --> 04:34:08.080]  opposition against what it is that we believe we're facing excellent point thank you we'll
[04:34:08.080 --> 04:34:13.280]  finish your point sir yeah and so i want to just uh make one quick point on seth mcfarland because
[04:34:13.280 --> 04:34:18.000]  he has a joke he says it's not so bad that we're running over all these uh boston runners had
[04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:23.200]  someone done that then it would it would have been bad but since it didn't happen it's okay
[04:34:23.200 --> 04:34:28.720]  so that's mcfarland if you're listening you're joking that's all right thank you jeremy yeah
[04:34:28.720 --> 04:34:35.040]  that's uh he is referencing two things there one the immortal technique interview alex did uh i
[04:34:35.040 --> 04:34:38.880]  believe was one or two months ago on the info boards nightly news so you can definitely check
[04:34:38.880 --> 04:34:44.720]  that out on prisonplanet.tv or even on the youtube archives and as far as the family guy situation
[04:34:44.720 --> 04:34:48.640]  you know people will take that as uh what they will we do have the bill o'reilly clip let's cue
[04:34:48.640 --> 04:34:52.800]  that back up since uh the guy mentioned it and i'll give you guys a little time to do that but
[04:34:52.800 --> 04:34:58.480]  the uh the family guy clip for the people who haven't seen seen it it was a uh a boston marathon
[04:34:58.480 --> 04:35:02.720]  episode i believe it aired maybe about a month ago where the main character peter griffin won
[04:35:02.720 --> 04:35:09.520]  the boston marathon by mowing people down in his vehicle and they had uh blood and guts and all
[04:35:09.520 --> 04:35:15.760]  that stuff hanging around and paul joseph watson spliced that uh two ends of an episode together
[04:35:15.760 --> 04:35:21.120]  so then you can see uh peter griffin using a cell phone to detonate bombs and fox came out
[04:35:21.120 --> 04:35:25.840]  and said oh this is outrageous this has nothing to do with the uh with the bombing i'm not saying
[04:35:25.840 --> 04:35:30.560]  it does you know either but it was definitely a eerie coincidence so let's go ahead and roll that
[04:35:30.560 --> 04:35:38.000]  clip and back in the book segment tonight did you see that we begin with a march 17th episode of the
[04:35:38.000 --> 04:35:44.080]  family guy i'm bob costas here with boston marathon winner peter griffin peter how did
[04:35:44.080 --> 04:35:54.880]  you do it damn phone's busted maybe i dialed wrong that's enough that's enough so you saw that that
[04:35:54.880 --> 04:36:00.080]  episode was called turban cowboys and peter griffin i believe is a tea party or teamed up
[04:36:00.080 --> 04:36:05.760]  with some type of uh extremist group and was doing some ill deeds so you can take that as what you
[04:36:05.760 --> 04:36:09.760]  will like the clip they showed right there was spliced together but it was from the same episode
[04:36:09.760 --> 04:36:14.480]  that was one of the earlier criticisms that you know paul joseph watson took these different
[04:36:14.480 --> 04:36:19.520]  pieces from different episodes no it's the same episode he just put them together for the uh for
[04:36:19.520 --> 04:36:23.360]  the sense of simplicity and you can take that that's what you will but anybody who is not
[04:36:23.360 --> 04:36:28.720]  familiar with the family guy show they have all kinds of outrageous scenarios uh demonizing
[04:36:28.720 --> 04:36:33.440]  religious groups and so forth somewhat similar to south park south park is a little more uh
[04:36:33.440 --> 04:36:37.040]  extreme in that aspect but you know you can watch that and make your own conclusion
[04:36:37.040 --> 04:36:39.440]  we'll move on to laura in california
[04:36:42.160 --> 04:36:47.760]  hi thanks for having me on oh thank you and i want to say uh first of all that you and your
[04:36:47.760 --> 04:36:55.440]  partner there are excellent oh thank you miss you guys and i just recently started so i wanted to
[04:36:55.440 --> 04:37:00.560]  make sure i said that i you really complement each other you both have nice deep voices and
[04:37:00.560 --> 04:37:06.480]  it just sounds real professional oh thank you okay so anyway i work at a sheriff's department
[04:37:07.520 --> 04:37:14.000]  i won't say which one okay but the uh question has come up
[04:37:15.680 --> 04:37:22.160]  about the media and the police and the sheriff's department and how they handle things let me tell
[04:37:22.160 --> 04:37:31.360]  you i handle the media and uh i am under strict instructions never to ever let anything out until
[04:37:31.360 --> 04:37:38.960]  they have the exact information to give the media so i found it very incredulous that they would
[04:37:38.960 --> 04:37:45.280]  put all this stuff on the media about this whole event and then pull it back and change it and
[04:37:45.280 --> 04:37:49.200]  change it and change i said this does not make lower can you hold on for just one second i just
[04:37:49.200 --> 04:37:53.440]  want to talk to the guys for one second can you guys queue up the clip boston cop intimidation
[04:37:53.440 --> 04:38:01.680]  it should be in the uh the new folder go ahead laura go ahead laura you know unless an event
[04:38:01.680 --> 04:38:07.200]  is completely staged like i suspect sandy hook was to some extent to what extent i don't know
[04:38:07.200 --> 04:38:13.520]  but they may have been able to get support through threatening officers or what not certainly i know
[04:38:13.520 --> 04:38:19.200]  uh eric holder came in under the cuff it was reported through i think it was abc or mbc i
[04:38:19.200 --> 04:38:23.440]  have the document on that and he came in and talked to the first responders what do you want
[04:38:23.440 --> 04:38:30.640]  to talk to first responders for i know first responders and uh they you know there'd be no
[04:38:30.640 --> 04:38:35.280]  reason for him to do that unless there's some other thing going on but anyway i didn't want to mention
[04:38:35.280 --> 04:38:45.760]  that and uh also when they in the beginning of the boston race and all the specialized people
[04:38:45.760 --> 04:38:53.600]  that we saw there and we know they were there as soon as that happened within so many feet even
[04:38:53.600 --> 04:38:59.040]  it was 20 or 40 feet they would have gone in the direction of the gun and they would have had an
[04:38:59.040 --> 04:39:06.560]  immediate lockdown in a vicinity of that area i'm saying and suggesting to you guys that they would
[04:39:06.560 --> 04:39:13.920]  have found them they would have gotten a guy at that time so you know all this is really really
[04:39:13.920 --> 04:39:19.920]  kind of murky isn't it all the information we're getting and uh i feel that they would have caught
[04:39:19.920 --> 04:39:29.920]  him also i wondered uh if did you hear jicardi that uh he was with his brother the younger
[04:39:29.920 --> 04:39:36.560]  brother apparently got away now how do you get away when there's so many people there they kill
[04:39:36.560 --> 04:39:42.080]  your brother was that oh you're referring to after after the shootout is that what you're talking
[04:39:42.080 --> 04:39:49.200]  about miss and after they got his brother they apparently escaped in the car right and then did
[04:39:49.200 --> 04:39:55.120]  they did and they shot and killed his brother but then i heard a report that he laughed or got away
[04:39:55.120 --> 04:39:59.920]  now i find that i heard i heard that as well you know he said the the story is ever changing now
[04:39:59.920 --> 04:40:04.400]  thank you for your call we'll have to move on and uh but that situation i heard it earlier this
[04:40:04.400 --> 04:40:07.920]  morning probably about 8 30 this morning i was at the gym and i was running on the treadmill they
[04:40:07.920 --> 04:40:13.760]  had the tvs in there and they said the younger brother actually ran over the uh the older brother
[04:40:13.760 --> 04:40:18.560]  and you know it has that changed since 8 30 this morning i'm not exactly sure there were
[04:40:18.560 --> 04:40:24.400]  there were reports uh like we just showed you the report earlier of the naked man being placed into
[04:40:24.400 --> 04:40:30.400]  a police car so i'm not exactly sure what that ties in if that was the older brother i mean he
[04:40:30.400 --> 04:40:35.840]  to me he looked somewhat like him but you know it's not the best quality of video so uh it's
[04:40:35.840 --> 04:40:42.000]  definitely a iffy situation i am like you if these people were as armed and as dangerous as they were
[04:40:42.000 --> 04:40:45.920]  you know hyped up to be i think there would have been more of a police presence but in the meantime
[04:40:45.920 --> 04:40:51.840]  let's go to uh something that she alluded to the uh cop intimidation factor so let's play that clip
[04:40:51.840 --> 04:40:57.120]  right now here he is look here's the police right here with us anything here's a police officer
[04:40:57.120 --> 04:41:02.880]  pointing an m4 at a reporter's face look here he is just so you guys don't see him wrong playing
[04:41:02.880 --> 04:41:10.720]  an m4 at the cameraman's face who's this guy that is near the who is this guy no one else looks like
[04:41:10.720 --> 04:41:15.920]  it looks like a terrorist but then things really picked up it looks like a terrorist look at this
[04:41:15.920 --> 04:41:21.360]  guy he's just running around with his m4 okay if you guys can get that clip ready again i want to
[04:41:21.360 --> 04:41:25.680]  play it from the beginning so people can clearly see that the the back of his jacket does say
[04:41:25.680 --> 04:41:31.360]  police on it this is something after the uh the boston bombing i'm not exactly sure at one point
[04:41:31.360 --> 04:41:36.320]  what point but after the boston bombing you saw the officer there running around recklessly
[04:41:36.320 --> 04:41:39.840]  endangering now there it is right there you can see it right there on your screen if you're on
[04:41:39.840 --> 04:41:45.760]  prisonplanet.tv the police right here with us anything here's a police officer pointing an m4
[04:41:45.760 --> 04:41:51.120]  at a reporter's face look here he is just so you guys don't see him wrong playing an m4 at the
[04:41:51.120 --> 04:41:55.600]  cameraman's back and freeze it when he puts the gun in his face you can cut it cut out if you
[04:41:55.600 --> 04:42:01.440]  have to but let's freeze it right when he puts the gun in the guy's face just let it play and
[04:42:01.440 --> 04:42:05.920]  we'll freeze it when he gets there police right here with us anything here's a police officer
[04:42:05.920 --> 04:42:11.600]  pointing and now wait until he gets the camera in his face look here he is just so you guys don't
[04:42:11.600 --> 04:42:16.400]  see him right there right there okay so if you're watching on infowars.com forward slash listen to
[04:42:16.400 --> 04:42:21.360]  leave it up for a second this is a police officer you saw saw him with the uh with the police on
[04:42:21.360 --> 04:42:27.040]  his back uh he's holding an m4 rifle according to the the person uh reviewing this video you
[04:42:27.040 --> 04:42:32.320]  can see the cameraman there with this camera i can't see what the cameraman guy's face looks
[04:42:32.320 --> 04:42:37.360]  like but just from the back he doesn't appear to be one of the suspects so why is this officer
[04:42:37.360 --> 04:42:43.920]  running around recklessly endangering people showing his uh his firearm in their faces that
[04:42:43.920 --> 04:42:48.880]  is called menacing as you saw in the okay you guys can take it down now as you saw in the project
[04:42:48.880 --> 04:42:53.760]  veritas video and uh the guy goes to the police station he said well can i be like joe biden and
[04:42:53.760 --> 04:42:58.080]  you know wave my shotgun around and to scare people and the woman said no that's called
[04:42:58.080 --> 04:43:02.720]  menacing you will go to jail if you do what the vice president tells you and there's a uh like
[04:43:02.720 --> 04:43:07.360]  the guy said i call that guy a terrorist he is terrorizing the the media there you know we've
[04:43:07.360 --> 04:43:12.480]  heard reports of media having their their cameras confiscated we've heard reports of death threats
[04:43:12.480 --> 04:43:17.600]  even in some cases i believe ap reported that against different media personnel and there you
[04:43:17.600 --> 04:43:22.800]  go there's uh your uh your martial law at its finest your police state at its finest somebody
[04:43:22.800 --> 04:43:28.720]  having a gun shoved in their face by the police not these terrorists but you know some police
[04:43:28.720 --> 04:43:33.280]  officer who i'd say was terrorizing the people in that situation we'll move on now to steven in
[04:43:33.280 --> 04:43:40.240]  florida yeah hey good afternoon i wanted to say first of all on the heels of what the uh lady
[04:43:40.240 --> 04:43:47.120]  caller said you know i think that uh listening to uh you and david and uh darren and the others
[04:43:47.120 --> 04:43:53.280]  there you guys epitomize what news reporters and media people should be and so i just wanted to
[04:43:53.280 --> 04:43:59.920]  commend you for your professionalism and i think the key is that you deal in truth and not fiction
[04:43:59.920 --> 04:44:06.160]  unlike the dinosaur so-called mainstream it's coming out more and more just like you saw the uh
[04:44:06.800 --> 04:44:10.960]  the bill o'reilly clip and if you want to see some more bill o'reilly clips you can go look at this
[04:44:10.960 --> 04:44:15.440]  stuff from what is it he was on hard copy or some show back in the day he's yelling and freaking out
[04:44:15.440 --> 04:44:22.240]  at people but yeah that's that's what it is yeah so uh anyway but thank you for your uh comments
[04:44:22.240 --> 04:44:27.840]  sir but go ahead yes sir uh i just wanted to say about you were mentioning about the situation in
[04:44:27.840 --> 04:44:34.320]  waco with this fertilizer plan you're uh harkening back to waco and uh you might want to check into
[04:44:34.320 --> 04:44:38.960]  this alex would probably know about this because he's good friends with uh there's a guy named
[04:44:38.960 --> 04:44:46.560]  tex marz that's also there in uh i know i'll text marzia yeah and years ago after that incident
[04:44:46.560 --> 04:44:52.400]  occurred there with the branch division the whole debacle he came out with some intel that said that
[04:44:53.040 --> 04:45:01.200]  janet reno the pit bull nickname was the one that gave the order for the you know atf and it was a
[04:45:01.200 --> 04:45:06.880]  whole military operation of basically murdering those people but then it was given at the behest
[04:45:06.880 --> 04:45:12.880]  of hillary clinton and that's the angle i've never heard really covered in the whole thing about
[04:45:12.880 --> 04:45:18.240]  uh you know the whole thing that happened at waco uh so she had her own personal agenda i guess is
[04:45:18.240 --> 04:45:24.000]  what the way uh tex was putting it and so you guys might want to kind of check into that angle
[04:45:24.000 --> 04:45:27.200]  i wouldn't be a bit surprised if that's true knowing the history of the clintons and how
[04:45:27.200 --> 04:45:31.920]  ruthless they are when the murder trail that's in the wake of everything they've been involved in
[04:45:31.920 --> 04:45:37.040]  how many people have died you know because of them but uh you know i just wanted to say too
[04:45:37.040 --> 04:45:42.240]  i'm a runner and i was just thinking about this i went out and ran today i'm wondering how long it's
[04:45:42.240 --> 04:45:46.400]  going to be till we get to the point where somebody like me is just going to be running
[04:45:47.120 --> 04:45:51.840]  along the road you know and all of a sudden the cops are going to pull me over and i'm suspicious
[04:45:51.840 --> 04:45:57.360]  just because i'm running you know just because of you know what happened in boston and i mean
[04:45:57.360 --> 04:46:01.920]  i go out to a lot of races and i mean there's a lot of people that come out there with you know
[04:46:02.480 --> 04:46:09.360]  backpack type of bags where they carry all their gear and you know i'm i'm i'm i'm really uh really
[04:46:09.360 --> 04:46:14.640]  of seeing the day i'm kind of expecting it now where i mean they're going to try and not just
[04:46:14.640 --> 04:46:20.480]  the major races like boston or new york or chicago but even smaller ones because we always
[04:46:20.480 --> 04:46:24.560]  have police out there just directing traffic but where it's going to come down to where they're
[04:46:24.560 --> 04:46:29.360]  going to want to be going through everybody's gear that comes out there to participate i don't think
[04:46:29.360 --> 04:46:34.480]  that's a very far-fetched statement i definitely appreciate your call sir uh like you're saying the
[04:46:34.480 --> 04:46:40.160]  uh the bombing and uh in boston and he's thinking that the day could come that you know everybody's
[04:46:40.160 --> 04:46:44.960]  gonna be searched just for showing up and i think that is a very real possibility especially with
[04:46:44.960 --> 04:46:50.720]  your uh with your school events i think uh that's definitely could easily happen like i've told the
[04:46:50.720 --> 04:46:56.800]  story i went to my niece's not funeral good god i went to my niece's graduation she was very much
[04:46:56.800 --> 04:47:03.440]  alive i went to my niece's graduation a a few years ago and um they were checking people's
[04:47:03.440 --> 04:47:07.280]  bags to get into the graduation now when i graduated it was an open event anybody could
[04:47:07.280 --> 04:47:11.760]  just walk in the building i think they may have had a metal detector or something but that was it
[04:47:11.760 --> 04:47:16.160]  they weren't checking anybody's bags they weren't patting anybody down it was just you know come as
[04:47:16.160 --> 04:47:20.000]  you are as long as you don't you know leave the roscoe at home and you could come in but you had
[04:47:20.000 --> 04:47:25.280]  to have a ticket to get into the graduation and you know that's the new thing you have to have
[04:47:25.280 --> 04:47:29.840]  your back searched and all that so i definitely think that is a possibility i believe it was the
[04:47:29.840 --> 04:47:34.240]  the illuminati card game or something along those lines they had that picture of the jogger and this
[04:47:34.240 --> 04:47:39.280]  is nobody expects a jogger to have a bomb or have a gun or whatever the card said and you know that's
[04:47:39.280 --> 04:47:44.640]  gonna be a new thing it's just gonna be anybody can be a terrorist at any time for doing anything
[04:47:44.640 --> 04:47:49.600]  just like they uh got the saudi guy now i'm not exactly sure what the situation is with the uh
[04:47:49.600 --> 04:47:54.640]  the saudi national if he was a terror threat or not but it seems you know like a very probable
[04:47:54.640 --> 04:48:00.400]  cause it or like probable case i should say that they just saw a dark-skinned man uh running away
[04:48:00.400 --> 04:48:04.000]  from the scene like that guy's running away from the scene well so is you know are the white people
[04:48:04.000 --> 04:48:07.520]  and the brown people and the and the yellow people and everybody else but you know they want to
[04:48:07.520 --> 04:48:12.400]  target this guy for xyz reason i'm not saying he was you know clear of any charges because we saw
[04:48:12.400 --> 04:48:18.880]  the congressman uh questioned mrs napolitano about that and she says well i don't know anything about
[04:48:18.880 --> 04:48:22.960]  that and we'll tell you if that's something you should be concerned about very similar to what
[04:48:22.960 --> 04:48:28.880]  the fbi director and some of the other major news organizations have said we'll tell you what to be
[04:48:28.880 --> 04:48:32.320]  concerned about don't concern yourself with anything else we definitely appreciate your call
[04:48:32.320 --> 04:48:38.400]  the number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine alex that is eight seven seven seven
[04:48:38.400 --> 04:48:45.280]  eight nine two five three nine and we'll go on to colin in missouri hi how you doing today
[04:48:45.280 --> 04:48:51.360]  very well good i just kind of wanted to weigh in on uh my thoughts on the fact that wake uh
[04:48:51.360 --> 04:48:57.200]  west texas kind of taking away attention from the boston bombing boston bombing really took
[04:48:57.200 --> 04:49:02.560]  attention away from the fact that they burned up uh the jfk library yeah and then while in in the
[04:49:02.560 --> 04:49:06.800]  midst of all this going on we've got cisco being passed through the house of representatives
[04:49:06.800 --> 04:49:11.040]  um and different things that are taking our attention away from the things that we really
[04:49:11.040 --> 04:49:17.040]  you know should be focusing on especially the fact that bush and cheney and obama
[04:49:17.840 --> 04:49:22.240]  have been indicted for war crimes no one's really focusing on these things and i just kind of wanted
[04:49:22.240 --> 04:49:27.600]  to weigh in on that yeah we talked about that yesterday and also the day before with uh dr
[04:49:27.600 --> 04:49:31.760]  steve pachiniki was on referencing that so you can go dig in the archives for that stuff but
[04:49:31.760 --> 04:49:37.280]  that stuff is very much important david knight has spoken at length about cispa and some of the other
[04:49:37.280 --> 04:49:42.400]  things going on because people think well we won uh we won the gun debate well like obama said he
[04:49:42.400 --> 04:49:46.800]  just put it on hiatus i'm pretty sure he's going to come forward with some executive orders so you
[04:49:46.800 --> 04:49:50.720]  know don't even rest on the gun issue but just like the gentleman said there are plenty of things
[04:49:50.720 --> 04:49:57.440]  going on in the world uh you know we have waco and uh oklahoma city those uh those memorials and
[04:49:57.440 --> 04:50:01.840]  and many other things so definitely be vigilant of those then sir do you have uh anything in
[04:50:01.840 --> 04:50:07.440]  particular you want to talk about with the jfk library that was it i just wanted to just to let
[04:50:07.440 --> 04:50:11.840]  everyone understand that we can't just be focused on one thing that there are multiple avenues that
[04:50:11.840 --> 04:50:16.160]  we have to explore multiple things that we have to focus on when we're fighting for our freedoms
[04:50:16.160 --> 04:50:21.040]  because they're not just attacking on on one issue they're they're focused on multiple issues
[04:50:21.040 --> 04:50:25.920]  so you know just remember to stay vigilant and focusing on everything that's going on not just
[04:50:25.920 --> 04:50:31.280]  one or two issues all right appreciate your call sir yes and we're taking calls on numerous topics
[04:50:31.280 --> 04:50:35.200]  it doesn't have to be about boston you know that's the one of the hot button issues right
[04:50:35.200 --> 04:50:39.360]  now but you can call about waco you can call about the jfk library you can call about whatever you
[04:50:39.360 --> 04:50:44.080]  want you can call call about uh about gmos or anything else so just let us know what you want
[04:50:44.080 --> 04:50:50.880]  to talk about we'll move on to jason and california yes sukari it's a pleasure to finally
[04:50:50.880 --> 04:50:55.920]  talk to somebody at the infowars team a long time listening i've been calling a lot never got through
[04:50:55.920 --> 04:51:01.440]  so well congratulations today's the day well yeah it's a happy day here in california for me but
[04:51:01.440 --> 04:51:08.480]  that's the only thing i'm happy about what i'm curious about is uh if anybody i'm sure it's
[04:51:08.480 --> 04:51:14.720]  talked about they're in the office with all of the info wars team but with the numbers growing
[04:51:15.280 --> 04:51:24.000]  of people that are opening their eyes essentially of things that are going on and that questions
[04:51:24.000 --> 04:51:32.720]  that go unanswered is there any sense of an of an end game we're finally going to get somewhere
[04:51:33.440 --> 04:51:39.600]  and people will answer for whether it be war crimes lies whatever well the big thing is is
[04:51:39.600 --> 04:51:44.640]  people just don't want to hold uh their public officials responsible for things because uh you
[04:51:44.640 --> 04:51:50.880]  take a look at just use obama for example you know he has uh fast and furious and mangazi and
[04:51:50.880 --> 04:51:55.360]  multiple drone strikes that have killed children but he hides behind the sandy hook kids and you
[04:51:55.360 --> 04:51:59.280]  know other people saying hey well i'm trying to help these people out and you can you know debate
[04:51:59.280 --> 04:52:02.560]  whether he's trying to really help them or not but these are the people i'm working on and i
[04:52:02.560 --> 04:52:06.640]  don't care about anybody else i mean why doesn't he fly around with the other parents of the children
[04:52:06.640 --> 04:52:10.800]  that died in drone strikes so you know of course the other things i've referenced fast and furious
[04:52:10.800 --> 04:52:16.560]  and so on so it's really up to the people to hold these people accountable every press conference
[04:52:16.560 --> 04:52:21.920]  every uh book signing or wherever else these people may be go there say hey don't just you know
[04:52:21.920 --> 04:52:26.240]  do the flowery answer oh i'm so thankful you're doing this stuff about sandy hook go in there hey
[04:52:26.240 --> 04:52:30.320]  what about this what about that eric hoda what about fast and furious uh mrs clinton what about
[04:52:30.320 --> 04:52:34.400]  mangazi that's what it's going to take you have to go in there and you can do it a little more
[04:52:34.400 --> 04:52:39.760]  eloquently than maybe alex jones or uh dan badani but definitely get these issues out there that's
[04:52:39.760 --> 04:52:45.520]  what it takes and uh remind your friends of that anytime somebody wants to talk about uh whoever
[04:52:45.520 --> 04:52:49.440]  mrs clinton oh i love mrs clinton well did you know that you know bengazi or whatever the
[04:52:49.440 --> 04:52:55.200]  situation is and you just have to keep reminding people because people often forget boy that
[04:52:56.480 --> 04:53:03.200]  you brought up alex and uh mr mondini but people with that attitude what i've always said they have
[04:53:03.200 --> 04:53:10.400]  a place they do a perfect example is alex on piers morgan i wouldn't have expected anything
[04:53:10.400 --> 04:53:16.960]  else from alex and he got his point across and and i guess what i'm trying to get to with so many of
[04:53:16.960 --> 04:53:21.920]  us i mean i can't remember the exact numbers that alex uh brought up about as far as unique website
[04:53:21.920 --> 04:53:28.080]  visits and all of that information but with so many millions of people daily sooner or later
[04:53:28.080 --> 04:53:34.960]  we're going to get to a point where we're going to have i mean comparable to a political party
[04:53:34.960 --> 04:53:40.880]  we're going to have enough numbers where we can say answer this why were there navy seals
[04:53:40.880 --> 04:53:46.400]  at the boston marathon uh why do you kill civilians in drone strikes you know
[04:53:46.400 --> 04:53:52.720]  at any number of things and i'm just i i'm trying to be an optimist but surely someday
[04:53:53.440 --> 04:54:00.320]  we're going to get there where the criminals and wires have to answer and it's uh it's just like
[04:54:00.320 --> 04:54:07.680]  you said i just wish there was a uh a way other than being a fan of info wars and talking to an
[04:54:07.680 --> 04:54:13.440]  individual i wish there were more ways that weren't just but don't get me wrong i'm a big
[04:54:13.440 --> 04:54:21.200]  believer in second amendment but right they just weren't only second amendment rallies or something
[04:54:21.200 --> 04:54:26.000]  you know something like that it's i think we spend too much time concentrating on especially
[04:54:26.000 --> 04:54:31.600]  since sandy hood concentrating on second amendment and not enough time concentrating on all ten
[04:54:32.640 --> 04:54:37.920]  in the pillar right right just as a group as a as a group of people that are opening their eyes and
[04:54:38.640 --> 04:54:43.440]  i i'm just curious what your thoughts on it were if we're ever going to get somewhere with it
[04:54:43.440 --> 04:54:50.640]  i hope that we will but i also uh wanted to ask if there's anything that i personally and
[04:54:50.640 --> 04:54:56.320]  a large group of my friends alex said that he's trying to get to maybe a 24-hour status
[04:54:57.680 --> 04:55:01.360]  we live in california i know you've got a few people that work with you guys out here
[04:55:01.360 --> 04:55:05.120]  but we're willing to do stuff for free just to get the word out there and i'm sure a lot of
[04:55:05.120 --> 04:55:13.440]  people across the country are right so anything we can do you or alex or mr 90 whoever say the word
[04:55:14.240 --> 04:55:18.800]  and you're gonna get people to help you so i just want you to keep up the good work
[04:55:18.800 --> 04:55:24.240]  okay all right thank you for your call all right and as far as what uh the caller was addressing
[04:55:25.440 --> 04:55:30.160]  people who want to be uh active i mean you don't have to wait for you know info wars to tell you
[04:55:30.160 --> 04:55:34.080]  you know we'd like to do something like we have the bumper sticker contest we have the uh the
[04:55:34.080 --> 04:55:38.240]  paul revere contest and those things are great uh you know you want to make a video and put info
[04:55:38.240 --> 04:55:43.520]  wars in the title but more than anything just be active because it's one thing to you you've
[04:55:43.520 --> 04:55:47.200]  write your friends on facebook and twitter and you put out articles i mean and that does help
[04:55:47.200 --> 04:55:52.320]  that may wake a few people up but the big deal is to go out there and confront these people it
[04:55:52.320 --> 04:55:55.600]  doesn't like i said you know i'm not bashing alex and dan badani when i say you know you don't have
[04:55:55.600 --> 04:56:01.120]  to do their tactics but the reason i say that is not everybody is you know up to not everybody's
[04:56:01.120 --> 04:56:05.440]  bold enough to go stand in the front row and yell at the fbi you're not everybody's bold enough to
[04:56:05.440 --> 04:56:09.760]  go yell at uh president bush like alex does you don't have to do those things i mean those things
[04:56:09.760 --> 04:56:14.640]  are you know great they're great uh news pieces if you if you do those things but just anything
[04:56:14.640 --> 04:56:18.240]  just be active in your community you can go hand out flyers on the corner i mean you have
[04:56:18.240 --> 04:56:22.160]  to engage people personally is that that'd be the only advice i'd give to people because i meet
[04:56:22.160 --> 04:56:26.640]  people uh when we do various things around town they say hey you know what would you recommend
[04:56:26.640 --> 04:56:31.680]  engage people personally whether that's in a um a very friendly sense you're just trying to
[04:56:31.680 --> 04:56:36.000]  spread the message or could be a little more uh hostile sense like you're going out there to
[04:56:36.000 --> 04:56:41.280]  confront you know some corrupt politician and that would be the uh the advice i give to anybody so i
[04:56:41.280 --> 04:56:46.480]  definitely appreciate your call sir we'll move on to is that darren in new york
[04:56:48.880 --> 04:56:54.640]  hello yes oh yeah it's darren i'm from new york i was just trying to touch up on a little bit of
[04:56:54.640 --> 04:56:59.520]  the blossom and what i've been seeing compared to the news media and then the photos that people
[04:56:59.520 --> 04:57:05.120]  been sending about the whole entire police force basically taking their own people and putting them
[04:57:05.120 --> 04:57:11.520]  as prisoners basically i see in my eye really i haven't seen that i have a couple of family members
[04:57:11.520 --> 04:57:16.720]  down there and thank god they left before all this happened but when uh before the maintenance
[04:57:16.720 --> 04:57:20.800]  started they tried going home to go get some of their stuff and uh after the shootout and
[04:57:20.800 --> 04:57:26.240]  everything there was a blockade set up along i forgot what exit it was but the police basically
[04:57:26.240 --> 04:57:30.800]  told them to get all their cards they searched everything asked for their identification and
[04:57:30.800 --> 04:57:35.200]  my sister-in-law she didn't have her identification so they took her to you know like the drum ping
[04:57:35.200 --> 04:57:40.160]  type bill and interrogated her for what seemed like almost hours she said but all it ended up
[04:57:40.160 --> 04:57:44.800]  being was the police force patting down the kids and the whole entire family and basically called
[04:57:44.800 --> 04:57:49.280]  it a good day and told them that they can't get in the city you told them that you said they patted
[04:57:49.280 --> 04:57:53.680]  down the kids they patted down the kids what's up yeah they patted down anyone that was in the
[04:57:53.680 --> 04:58:01.440]  vehicle uh this morning wow yeah so i mean this morning you said this morning what's up you said
[04:58:01.440 --> 04:58:05.440]  this morning they did that this morning it was like basically like a couple hours after the
[04:58:05.440 --> 04:58:11.040]  shootout or whatnot oh wow yeah no i mean i'm in the service and stuff like that so i mean when
[04:58:11.040 --> 04:58:15.360]  i heard about info awards i was back in 2011 i was like oh this is a bunch of hoopla because
[04:58:15.360 --> 04:58:19.520]  i was like you know the government can do no wrong but after this happened i kind of opened
[04:58:19.520 --> 04:58:24.800]  my eyes a little bit and i kind of started talking to the people in the company and i was like this
[04:58:24.800 --> 04:58:30.000]  seems like more than just this and then there's been a lot of soldiers like dude they're like
[04:58:30.000 --> 04:58:33.760]  this looks like if uh the government wants to try doing something with this it's like we're on the
[04:58:33.760 --> 04:58:39.040]  brink of almost what seems like a civil war because it would believe a little bit more a couple of guys
[04:58:39.040 --> 04:58:42.080]  that are saying it because they're like watch these people in boston they're gonna get tired
[04:58:42.080 --> 04:58:46.320]  of being locked up and next thing you know it's gonna take that one guy to accidentally get shot
[04:58:46.320 --> 04:58:50.080]  by a cop or something and then so you know you're gonna have a whole town basically trying to ride
[04:58:50.080 --> 04:58:53.680]  against the police so we might have an la right over our hands if uh the government's not too
[04:58:53.680 --> 04:58:59.120]  careful trying to finish up a comic book uh right well i definitely you know i think non-violence
[04:58:59.120 --> 04:59:03.520]  is the best thing in the situation but i do agree that the people of boston will soon be very fed
[04:59:03.520 --> 04:59:08.880]  up if they're not already with the police present their police presence there in the police state
[04:59:08.880 --> 04:59:12.800]  telling them to remain in their homes and having their papers checked when they want to go out to
[04:59:12.800 --> 04:59:17.040]  the grocery store and whatnot but i definitely hope for a peaceful solution thank you for your
[04:59:17.040 --> 04:59:26.080]  call darren we'll move on to ronald in texas hello ronald yes can you hear me yes go ahead
[04:59:26.800 --> 04:59:30.080]  okay good uh saying good afternoon how are you doing very well sir thank you
[04:59:31.120 --> 04:59:36.480]  yeah now there's a couple things i wanted to bring up i don't know if you noticed that photo
[04:59:36.480 --> 04:59:45.440]  of that supposed leg injury victim from the bombing i'm sorry sir go ahead have you noticed
[04:59:45.440 --> 04:59:54.560]  the photo of that leg injury uh after the bombing attack i saw a picture of a of a photo uh excuse
[04:59:54.560 --> 04:59:59.680]  me had a picture of a victim who was hit by shrapnel supposedly it was on one of the big
[04:59:59.680 --> 05:00:04.000]  new york newspapers if i recall and that photo was doctored are you referring to a different
[05:00:04.000 --> 05:00:10.400]  picture sir um i'm not sure which one you saw it shows us individuals supposedly with a severe
[05:00:10.400 --> 05:00:16.880]  traumatic leg injury now i spent three years special forces as a medic i worked as an rn yada
[05:00:16.880 --> 05:00:23.760]  yada shock trauma you name it now number one if you have your legs are blown off like that
[05:00:24.880 --> 05:00:29.280]  you're going to have to have a tourniquet there's no tourniquet number two you'd be bleeding
[05:00:29.280 --> 05:00:35.840]  profusely number three you would not be wide awake you'd be actually in shock right and yet here he
[05:00:35.840 --> 05:00:44.000]  is sitting up he's awake there's no blood the rescue workers had no blood on them so that was
[05:00:44.000 --> 05:00:51.040]  all a staged event are you talking about that particular image that you saw or yes exactly and
[05:00:51.040 --> 05:00:56.800]  i've had a lot of friends of mine that are on facebook i use it to get the word out because
[05:00:56.800 --> 05:01:05.920]  i also write for your infowars prison planet sure and a lot of them are also in journalism
[05:01:05.920 --> 05:01:12.480]  and so they've been forwarding me photographs etc like you know what's going on up there in boston
[05:01:12.480 --> 05:01:18.320]  and so on now a lot of people aren't bringing up the fact that they're using the military there
[05:01:18.320 --> 05:01:26.960]  in how it violates the posse comitata fact they're also not bringing up the fact that in 1803
[05:01:27.760 --> 05:01:34.800]  the u.s supreme court ruled in marbury versus madison that any law that violates the constitution
[05:01:34.800 --> 05:01:40.720]  is automatically null and void now it's my understanding sir i'll guess i can ask you
[05:01:40.720 --> 05:01:45.200]  it's my understanding that uh and i'm not making an excuse for him but people like the national
[05:01:45.200 --> 05:01:49.840]  guard can be active and on the streets if requested by the governor is that accurate sir
[05:01:50.800 --> 05:01:59.600]  yes and no they could aid in rescue work but they cannot aid in place work okay because that's what
[05:01:59.600 --> 05:02:06.240]  the posse comitata fact was meant for is a separation of the military from doing civilian work
[05:02:07.840 --> 05:02:13.840]  in other words they can't go in and we're going to police this area like they did in new orleans after
[05:02:13.840 --> 05:02:20.560]  hurricane katrina yes now the other thing i bring going would like to bring up is the fact that
[05:02:22.000 --> 05:02:31.200]  you notice that the um obama and multiple others were indicted and then suddenly you had the
[05:02:31.200 --> 05:02:40.560]  bombing and next obama said oh this um one white guy sent his letters to him and someone else and
[05:02:40.560 --> 05:02:47.680]  and someone else and it had ricin yeah that guy who was the elvis elvis uh the one that just
[05:02:48.320 --> 05:02:56.720]  popped up on the screen the unique thing is to manufacture ricin in large enough quantities
[05:02:56.720 --> 05:03:02.800]  to kill a human you'd need at least any excess of over 200 pounds of castor beans
[05:03:03.920 --> 05:03:09.760]  and you'd actually have to remove the beans out of the husk and then scrape the white powder the
[05:03:09.760 --> 05:03:15.760]  fibers and then you have to process that dehydrated so on and you have to have almost a degree in
[05:03:15.760 --> 05:03:24.960]  chemistry to manufacture it and yet here the people are believing this well sir i'll ask you
[05:03:24.960 --> 05:03:32.160]  have you seen the alex jones interview where he talks to john mccathy yes i had and how he went
[05:03:32.160 --> 05:03:39.040]  ahead and john mccathy actually brought up that and the bad thing was when alex jones uh oops you
[05:03:39.040 --> 05:03:44.000]  know he's going kind of nutty and i thought no you could always tell when a person's serious
[05:03:44.800 --> 05:03:52.640]  by the their voice and here he suddenly went from haha i'm joking to deadly serious now i'm talking
[05:03:52.640 --> 05:04:00.160]  about it was the belize government or the columbians or whoever but it goes back to that
[05:04:00.160 --> 05:04:06.640]  point the same with the anthrax scare you know it was weaponized anthrax well here we're going to
[05:04:06.640 --> 05:04:12.240]  need to create a patsy all in the name of stripping away our rights oh yeah i definitely
[05:04:12.240 --> 05:04:19.200]  believe that all this stuff is about stripping away our rights sir and like myself as a disabled
[05:04:19.200 --> 05:04:26.320]  veteran and i've talked with a lot of veterans here in where i live in east texas we're not
[05:04:26.320 --> 05:04:33.040]  going to go down quietly in the night if they try to bring in martial law or they try to bring in
[05:04:33.040 --> 05:04:41.920]  the un peacekeepers or whatever to take away our guns we're not going to just go off and whisper
[05:04:41.920 --> 05:04:46.720]  and hide and you know turn everything over and many veterans are saying that i definitely
[05:04:46.720 --> 05:04:50.960]  appreciate your call sir i want to read this article this was from a uh a few days ago more
[05:04:50.960 --> 05:04:56.480]  veteran arrested for rudely displaying rifle and i do believe alex talked to this guy uh yesterday
[05:04:56.480 --> 05:05:00.960]  or the day before and this was a gentleman he was outside with his son hiking and they have some
[05:05:00.960 --> 05:05:06.320]  wild game in that area i believe some cougars and uh wild hogs and so forth and he's approached by
[05:05:06.320 --> 05:05:10.000]  the police a war veteran and the police say hey why do you have this rifle he says you know there's
[05:05:10.000 --> 05:05:14.160]  there's a wild game out here you know that you live in this area or at least you police this
[05:05:14.160 --> 05:05:18.800]  area and you can see it right there if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com
[05:05:18.800 --> 05:05:23.440]  forward slash listen then the police are they have a guy up against the the police car and why
[05:05:23.440 --> 05:05:26.640]  do you have this gun and so forth and veterans aren't going to put up with this you know i'm
[05:05:26.640 --> 05:05:32.240]  definitely not advocating any type of violence but i do believe there's a very uh high powder
[05:05:32.240 --> 05:05:36.480]  cake scenario there you know the police in boston or wherever else could you know knock on the wrong
[05:05:36.480 --> 05:05:41.120]  door with the wrong kind of you know right type of circumstances should i say the wrong type of
[05:05:41.120 --> 05:05:45.840]  circumstance and you know end up with a shootout because people don't want people in their home hey
[05:05:45.840 --> 05:05:50.000]  they tell the cops straight up hey i'm in this house by myself it's me and my dog and my gun
[05:05:50.000 --> 05:05:53.920]  just leave me alone and you know bad things can happen i definitely don't want that to happen but
[05:05:53.920 --> 05:05:58.960]  that is definitely a possibility the number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine
[05:05:58.960 --> 05:06:04.080]  alex that is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine is david knight out there
[05:06:04.080 --> 05:06:10.720]  is he still in the back studio okay that's fine we'll uh we'll continue on we'll move on to is
[05:06:10.720 --> 05:06:19.120]  that barbara in virginia yes hi how are you today i'm very well yourself i'm actually very disturbed
[05:06:19.120 --> 05:06:25.120]  at everything that i'm seeing on cnn um since this morning i i mean i turned on the news this
[05:06:25.120 --> 05:06:30.560]  morning and i see the picture of uh the older brother and it said dead and i'm like what wait
[05:06:30.560 --> 05:06:37.120]  wait you know how did that happen yeah right it happened overnight and i'm and and the whole thing
[05:06:37.120 --> 05:06:42.160]  i mean i saw our movie years ago and it basically had to do with government corruption and it was
[05:06:42.160 --> 05:06:50.320]  called double take i don't recall that it's like this had double take like just just painted all
[05:06:50.320 --> 05:06:56.880]  over it meaning they're showing you one thing but what's really happening is something completely
[05:06:56.880 --> 05:07:03.760]  different and what's been aggravating me since this morning is that everywhere all these reporters
[05:07:03.760 --> 05:07:12.240]  on cnn are like oh well police believe that they these two are the one are the suspects who for
[05:07:12.240 --> 05:07:19.920]  the bombing in in um boston like okay so basically you gunned a guy down on a belief whatever happened
[05:07:19.920 --> 05:07:26.240]  to evidence exactly you know and that's that's the question everybody keep keep asking you know they
[05:07:26.240 --> 05:07:30.720]  say if these are the two guys and you're confident that these are the two guys why can't we see them
[05:07:30.720 --> 05:07:36.640]  placing the bomb down exactly i mean they they show other times when there's something accurately
[05:07:36.640 --> 05:07:42.080]  happening they show you things now this time oh there's no footage there's nothing um a few
[05:07:42.080 --> 05:07:48.960]  minutes ago i actually saw that uh their mother came out and she was speaking um uh it was just
[05:07:48.960 --> 05:07:55.360]  her voice and she said that uh the eldest brother had been followed around by the fbi for like over
[05:07:55.360 --> 05:08:00.480]  three years are you referring to his mother their mother or their aunt i saw their aunt did you see
[05:08:00.480 --> 05:08:05.040]  something else they was their mother she said anybody would know who how these boys are would
[05:08:05.040 --> 05:08:11.360]  be her and the aunt had came out previously and had said you know you say that that they did it
[05:08:11.360 --> 05:08:16.400]  where's the evidence show me the proof she said she's a lawyer from back home from their country
[05:08:16.400 --> 05:08:20.560]  and she says you can't just show me what you you know you're showing me this you're showing me that
[05:08:20.560 --> 05:08:26.240]  where is the proof that they did it everybody wants the proof they haven't produced any proof
[05:08:26.240 --> 05:08:33.440]  besides the fbi's testimony that these guys were or the uh culprits in this situation or at least
[05:08:33.440 --> 05:08:38.160]  have reason to suspect these guys were the culprits in the situation they have shown us
[05:08:38.160 --> 05:08:44.400]  no bomb drop uh no you know bloody hands or whatever the the case may be they just say
[05:08:44.400 --> 05:08:54.640]  they did it and uh we're supposed to abide by that and ignoring other you know and you know and it
[05:08:54.640 --> 05:09:01.040]  just it's it's what's to keep them from being for anyone who was there to be pointed out and say well
[05:09:01.040 --> 05:09:06.000]  you know you were walking down the street and you had this so you must have did it you know at this
[05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:12.480]  point there is no there is no documented proof that they actually did it all you see is them
[05:09:12.480 --> 05:09:18.880]  walking down the street casually and you know and then disappearing um the other thing that is
[05:09:19.600 --> 05:09:24.000]  i see on the cnn ticker that comes up every once in a black because you know any once in a while
[05:09:24.000 --> 05:09:32.080]  because of the fact that they put so many new statements on the ticker and it says that there
[05:09:32.080 --> 05:09:39.200]  will be a controlled explosion yeah when is that when is you guys know have they updated that
[05:09:39.200 --> 05:09:43.520]  situation of when that is supposed to happen do we know anything about that okay the guys are
[05:09:43.520 --> 05:09:48.880]  checking out yes i saw that earlier this morning and my reaction to that was uh don't they have
[05:09:48.880 --> 05:09:54.480]  bomb sniffing dogs and uh robots that can dismantle bombs and so forth but they're just
[05:09:54.480 --> 05:10:02.320]  going to blow up a scene and then going afterwards yes this is true this is this doesn't make any
[05:10:02.320 --> 05:10:06.320]  sense to me you have and you know they have they're sitting here you know they're ready
[05:10:06.320 --> 05:10:11.200]  to sit there and take guns from everyone who oh well you have an assault rifle you have a rifle
[05:10:11.200 --> 05:10:17.520]  you know and we want to take it away but all these people you know policing every innocent
[05:10:17.520 --> 05:10:22.160]  you know bystander just in their homes oh where you can't leave where you're going to get shot
[05:10:22.160 --> 05:10:27.360]  so you're not they're not they don't believe they're creating terror on a town oh they
[05:10:27.360 --> 05:10:30.880]  definitely are definitely are okay we have an article on thank you for your call miss we'll

[05:10:46.240 --> 05:10:50.560]  is that him okay so there's an 18-year-old who died if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv
[05:10:51.120 --> 05:10:57.840]  and mr white hat suspect number two as they're calling him okay and the lady brought up a very
[05:10:57.840 --> 05:11:03.360]  valid point talking about how the police are mishandling the situation in some cases harassing
[05:11:03.360 --> 05:11:08.160]  innocent people we showed you the clip earlier of the officer menacing people with his rifle
[05:11:08.160 --> 05:11:13.520]  menacing people who are obviously reporters or if not you know reporters these people who are running
[05:11:13.520 --> 05:11:18.480]  around with uh with camera equipment and the police are menacing them with their rifles so
[05:11:18.480 --> 05:11:28.240]  the number to call in is 877-789 alex that is 877-789-2539 and you can call in on any topic
[05:11:28.240 --> 05:11:31.760]  many people want to talk about the boston situation that's perfectly fine if you want
[05:11:31.760 --> 05:11:37.040]  to talk about gmos or whatever else the situation may be in your area you are welcome to do that as
[05:11:37.040 --> 05:11:46.320]  well we'll move on to marcus in california hello yes hello jakari uh great to be on
[05:11:46.320 --> 05:11:53.120]  oh yes thank you uh the last lady barber she nailed it right on the head um with the cops
[05:11:54.240 --> 05:12:00.640]  and uh and actually i noticed that they mentioned that it's a voluntary lockdown they kept
[05:12:00.640 --> 05:12:07.920]  emphasizing that on cnn uh and they had uh somebody on there saying it's just uh
[05:12:10.240 --> 05:12:16.560]  you know it's it's it's a voluntary lockdown yeah i heard them say that and then i was listening to
[05:12:16.560 --> 05:12:20.720]  the police scanner a little bit earlier i believe they'd taken down most of the the police scanners
[05:12:20.720 --> 05:12:25.040]  but we found one and i was monitoring it before i came on air and they said there was some lady
[05:12:25.040 --> 05:12:28.560]  who worked at an animal shelter and she was trying to get to the animal shelter but she had to get
[05:12:28.560 --> 05:12:33.760]  permission from the police just to you know go to her job to feed the animals there so it doesn't
[05:12:33.760 --> 05:12:41.200]  sound too voluntary to me and and uh i also wanted to mention that uh cnn showed an interview of the
[05:12:41.200 --> 05:12:48.320]  father of the boys who uh the alleged suspects and he was convinced he the first thing he said
[05:12:48.320 --> 05:12:54.960]  is they're framed they were framed and he said that you know the the coward police killed his
[05:12:54.960 --> 05:13:00.480]  other son and they're probably going to kill the other son he wants to see justice and uh it was
[05:13:00.480 --> 05:13:06.720]  it was really interesting and then um when they went back to the anchor he added it was very
[05:13:06.720 --> 05:13:11.680]  interesting after they conducted that interview that uh some russian government officials came
[05:13:11.680 --> 05:13:18.160]  in to question him and took him away the question the father that's correct no i didn't hear that
[05:13:18.160 --> 05:13:21.680]  part i did see the uh the interview you're referring to but i didn't know that he had
[05:13:21.680 --> 05:13:28.160]  been detained by russian officials right right the reporter who who uh queued up the interview
[05:13:28.160 --> 05:13:31.840]  after the interview he came you know he said oh it's also interesting to note he was talking to
[05:13:31.840 --> 05:13:36.960]  anderson cooper it's also interesting to note that some russian government officials came to
[05:13:36.960 --> 05:13:42.960]  further question him and they they took him away hmm well we'll definitely just wanted to get that
[05:13:42.960 --> 05:13:47.600]  we'll have to look into that uh so i i was not aware of that but we'll definitely take a look
[05:13:47.600 --> 05:13:56.640]  at that thanks for your call sir we'll move on to josh in ohio hello josh yes yes go ahead

[05:15:02.960 --> 05:15:10.960]  all staying at a marriott hotel in waco when the drill was scheduled for a town 60 miles away
[05:15:12.320 --> 05:15:18.160]  since the the real explosion did happen they since cancelled the drill and all of the people
[05:15:18.160 --> 05:15:24.640]  that were scheduled to do the drill are assisting really and you guys uh looked that up you said
[05:15:24.640 --> 05:15:30.480]  black rain yeah it's called operation black rain and i and i sent three different links the
[05:15:30.480 --> 05:15:35.520]  original page from the people that organized the event and then two other pages that had just uh
[05:15:36.080 --> 05:15:41.200]  touched on it but i wanted to send you the official links that away the other ones weren't
[05:15:41.200 --> 05:15:46.960]  like yeah send it if you can send it right now with uh put the headline in the put the what you
[05:15:46.960 --> 05:15:51.760]  said in the headline operation black rain and put that one other thing the screenshot i was talking
[05:15:51.760 --> 05:15:56.560]  about my cell phone they took down this logo from the site i figured they would cut the whole site
[05:15:56.560 --> 05:16:04.160]  but they didn't but the uh the logo had tsa on it it was this weird symbol it was a black and yellow
[05:16:04.160 --> 05:16:09.200]  circle and um my buddy has it on his iphone we might be able to send that picture too but it
[05:16:09.200 --> 05:16:14.800]  was taken down from the page yeah we just saw they had it on the screenshot it said fema in texas and
[05:16:14.800 --> 05:16:19.040]  i couldn't see the whole article but uh it definitely looked interesting yeah if you have
[05:16:19.040 --> 05:16:24.320]  those send those to uh show tips at info wars and also writers at info wars and we'll definitely
[05:16:24.320 --> 05:16:30.640]  take a look at those thank you for your call sir we'll move on to steve in nevada how you doing
[05:16:30.640 --> 05:16:35.840]  very well sir go ahead um i just wanted to draw your attention back to an article that
[05:16:35.840 --> 05:16:43.200]  paul joseph watson uh wrote uh boston bombing culprits identified yes um in that article on
[05:16:43.200 --> 05:16:49.040]  april 17th um there was these pictures all the of the navy seals and all those guys but there was
[05:16:49.040 --> 05:16:57.840]  also some uh like a screenshot from a guy named anonymous and he said that uh laws were being
[05:16:57.840 --> 05:17:02.480]  written screw you he said i work on a security commission and i've just received word to start
[05:17:02.480 --> 05:17:06.560]  campaigning on a campaign we've been working on for the last two months and that'll make sense
[05:17:07.280 --> 05:17:14.400]  he goes down and says they're going to pin this event on a male in his late teens to early 20s
[05:17:14.400 --> 05:17:19.440]  and he said he's going to do it because he's unstable well uh he said one person in that
[05:17:19.440 --> 05:17:23.760]  screenshot but what we have here now are two people one in his teens and one in his late
[05:17:23.760 --> 05:17:30.240]  and his early well in his 20s young guy and so then he goes on to saying that uh there's they're
[05:17:30.240 --> 05:17:35.840]  going to find firearms and a book in his home and they're going to use uh reloading powder for the
[05:17:35.840 --> 05:17:42.240]  explosion and um that the reloading powder shouldn't be on sale for the public and um
[05:17:42.240 --> 05:17:45.520]  because you can make ammunition with and all that so i just want everyone to go back
[05:17:46.240 --> 05:17:52.960]  to that article that paul joseph watson wrote on april 17th called boston bombing culprits
[05:17:52.960 --> 05:17:59.600]  identified and look at that screenshot that that anonymous guy put up uh where he wrote that out
[05:17:59.600 --> 05:18:03.600]  because some of that sort of seems to be playing out because what's really interesting in that
[05:18:03.600 --> 05:18:09.520]  what he wrote there he said they won't find the suspect till later this week the raid is issued
[05:18:09.520 --> 05:18:15.840]  to occur friday so that's today is that the actual article guys i can't see it from this distance but
[05:18:15.840 --> 05:18:22.400]  that is the article we have on screen okay okay yeah that's it and so um yeah so that's very
[05:18:22.400 --> 05:18:29.120]  interesting to me um and i'm just trying to i'm wondering you know did this guy have a tip did he
[05:18:29.120 --> 05:18:34.960]  know something was going on and yeah we we have addressed that earlier um that was brought to our
[05:18:34.960 --> 05:18:39.760]  attention a day or so ago but i'm definitely glad you brought that back up uh people can go to that
[05:18:39.760 --> 05:18:44.880]  scroll up to the top so guys can see that um see that headline because that says if even if the
[05:18:44.880 --> 05:18:50.240]  even if they plan to do something like this or he did have uh secondary information and he wasn't
[05:18:50.240 --> 05:18:57.280]  exactly accurate it seems to be unfolding and sort of like he was showing and you know that the plan
[05:18:57.280 --> 05:19:05.760]  can always be changed um but it seems like he knew something with uh he had some kind of uh he knew
[05:19:05.760 --> 05:19:11.840]  something he had some type of uh some type of tip yes uh and we were uh informed that the the other
[05:19:11.840 --> 05:19:15.600]  day and thank you for bringing that back up people can go to that article and see it there for
[05:19:15.600 --> 05:19:20.720]  yourselves uh it's definitely chilling to us and it's folding and folding just like uh the article
[05:19:20.720 --> 05:19:24.960]  had pointed out thank you for your call sir so everybody go to that if you uh if you were ever
[05:19:24.960 --> 05:19:29.760]  in doubt you can go check that out and see it for yourself i've just been joined in studio by one
[05:19:29.760 --> 05:19:35.040]  mr david knight hey dr how you doing so you just did an interview about waco is that correct yes
[05:19:35.040 --> 05:19:39.600]  actually uh it's going to be on tonight's nightly news and i just talked to mike i can't hear him
[05:19:39.600 --> 05:19:44.240]  in my earpiece i don't know if you guys are having any audio difficulty but go ahead he's got me am i
[05:19:44.240 --> 05:19:48.640]  online okay i can hear him now yes well i was uh just interviewing mike mcnulty it's an interview
[05:19:48.640 --> 05:19:53.200]  that's going to be on tonight on the nightly news and for those of you who don't know him you may
[05:19:53.200 --> 05:19:59.280]  know his films he did waco rules of engagement and he also did waco a new revelation and we
[05:19:59.280 --> 05:20:04.160]  actually have that yes right here in the infowars shop so that's right check that out this is a new
[05:20:04.160 --> 05:20:10.240]  version he also did a third film that uh kind of came out that the second film caused a lot of stir
[05:20:10.960 --> 05:20:17.680]  within the administrations and and uh caused some a revelation of some flare tapes that's
[05:20:17.680 --> 05:20:23.520]  forward-looking infrared that showed some thermal imagery so he did a third documentary about that
[05:20:24.080 --> 05:20:30.080]  this package right here has those two most recent documentaries there and it's really interesting
[05:20:30.080 --> 05:20:36.160]  because this is someone he's looked at the waco incident over the last 20 years this is the 20th
[05:20:36.160 --> 05:20:44.000]  anniversary of the ending of it where so many children and men and women were died in a fiery
[05:20:44.000 --> 05:20:50.080]  conclusion to that and he's he's looked at this but you know what we talked about in the interview
[05:20:50.080 --> 05:20:55.280]  was how much things really haven't changed the way the government deals with these types of things
[05:20:55.280 --> 05:21:01.680]  right how it comes out of nowhere essentially sometimes it's hard to tell where the malevolence
[05:21:02.480 --> 05:21:06.880]  ends and the incompetence begins you know it's kind of this this thing going back and forth and
[05:21:06.880 --> 05:21:12.160]  the way that they manipulate the public opinion and the way they manipulate the press and the
[05:21:12.160 --> 05:21:20.720]  stories that are set up to cover that kind of incompetence uh and so it's really important and
[05:21:20.720 --> 05:21:27.520]  very pertinent to today's debate for people to take a look at this and if you look at what
[05:21:27.520 --> 05:21:31.200]  happened with waco if you look at what happened with ruby ridge if you look at what happened with
[05:21:31.200 --> 05:21:35.040]  the oklahoma city bombing all these different things you realize that there's a pattern of
[05:21:35.040 --> 05:21:40.080]  behavior here and that's why we were so quick to jump out and say some of the things that we did
[05:21:40.080 --> 05:21:45.520]  that they just were not adding up and that it looked like a pattern of behavior and what we saw
[05:21:45.520 --> 05:21:50.240]  at the time this all happened in 1993 the internet wasn't there but i was involved with a group of
[05:21:50.240 --> 05:21:54.640]  people in the libertarian party and we were passing around information on bulletin boards
[05:21:55.200 --> 05:21:59.680]  and just as we see today with the internet uh we were sharing information with people who were on
[05:21:59.680 --> 05:22:06.240]  site and uh and and we were seeing very different information than was being presented to the public
[05:22:06.240 --> 05:22:12.320]  and the people who are in power right now at the fbi and at cnn and fox news they don't want you
[05:22:12.320 --> 05:22:17.680]  to see this stuff they've got a very narrow focused story only look here nothing else exactly
[05:22:17.680 --> 05:22:22.960]  and and they're desperate about that now because it really was a seminal moment for those of us who
[05:22:22.960 --> 05:22:28.960]  are looking at it at that point and it was it was just uh because again it was it was a wake up
[05:22:28.960 --> 05:22:34.800]  moment and for people my age that were active at that time uh it's really a bigger deal than
[05:22:34.800 --> 05:22:40.160]  september 11th because we see the whole framework of of our country changed legally after september
[05:22:40.160 --> 05:22:46.880]  11th but for those of us who saw just the mass propaganda manipulation and malevolence of our
[05:22:46.880 --> 05:22:52.800]  government at that point in time it was a really seminal moment and these films by mike mcnulty
[05:22:52.800 --> 05:22:56.800]  really lay it out so it's very important for people to see this it's very important for them
[05:22:56.800 --> 05:23:01.120]  to get this information of their friends and finally i'll say he's got a very detailed blog
[05:23:01.120 --> 05:23:08.800]  that is copsproductions.com and uh if you go there and look at his editorials you'll see
[05:23:08.800 --> 05:23:13.280]  it's essentially overflow information but he talks about and we talk about this in the interview
[05:23:13.280 --> 05:23:17.840]  tonight when they come for the guns you can do one of three things you can either turn them in
[05:23:17.840 --> 05:23:21.280]  you can wait for them to come to your house and have a firefight like the branch davidian's did
[05:23:21.280 --> 05:23:25.600]  and we see how that ends or you can do a third thing and we talked about that third thing tonight
[05:23:25.600 --> 05:23:29.200]  if you want to see it you can tune in to the nightly news tonight all right nice plug for
[05:23:29.200 --> 05:23:36.720]  that can we show the uh the video on the uh on the shop site waco a new revelation so people can
[05:23:36.720 --> 05:23:41.360]  check that out on the infowars store so guys just throw that up whenever you get a chance now david
[05:23:41.360 --> 05:23:46.960]  waco is something that's very near and dear to your heart uh why is that why is this one so
[05:23:46.960 --> 05:23:53.680]  important to you well like i said at the interview you know it was really a crossing in the rubicon
[05:23:53.680 --> 05:24:00.480]  uh i could see public opinion absolutely turned against these people uh even evangelical christians
[05:24:00.480 --> 05:24:06.240]  10 years ago especially because they this was a guy who had messianic fantasies and he believed
[05:24:06.240 --> 05:24:10.640]  he was some kind of reincarnation of jesus i don't know exactly what his theology was
[05:24:10.640 --> 05:24:16.560]  because it didn't really matter to me no matter how bad his theology was there was no excuse to
[05:24:16.560 --> 05:24:22.080]  burn him and a bunch of women and children to death uh he had had situations before where
[05:24:22.080 --> 05:24:27.680]  there had been disputes some of them even violent and he had had his due process with a sheriff who
[05:24:27.680 --> 05:24:33.520]  had come out and served him and that could have all been handled very easily but we had a federal
[05:24:33.520 --> 05:24:39.440]  bureaucracy that interjected itself into this situation for political reasons for funding
[05:24:39.440 --> 05:24:43.920]  reasons because they were trying to extend their jurisdiction and their control and because they
[05:24:43.920 --> 05:24:49.680]  were trying to pull back some of the bad pr that they had gotten in the ruby ridge investigation
[05:24:49.680 --> 05:24:54.160]  and so when they came in and they started doing this things immediately came out they said well
[05:24:54.160 --> 05:25:00.080]  we came after him because he had a fully automatic machine gun well it turned out that uh he just
[05:25:00.080 --> 05:25:05.200]  hadn't paid a license that was what that was the the technicality that was there and so one of the
[05:25:05.200 --> 05:25:11.440]  things that we learned about that was that gun laws can be so complex and so lethal that we need
[05:25:11.440 --> 05:25:16.160]  to be really careful about infringing on the second amendment you know is if you infringe on the second
[05:25:16.160 --> 05:25:21.680]  amendment and you make it a big issue uh out of a gun crime people die frequently because of that
[05:25:21.680 --> 05:25:27.120]  and so that was part of it but it was also for me i guess a seminal moment because i saw how the how
[05:25:27.120 --> 05:25:34.720]  the press and the government were able to manipulate opinion from evangelicals to actually
[05:25:34.720 --> 05:25:38.720]  i heard so many of them say well he deserved it anyway he was a child molester or whatever
[05:25:38.720 --> 05:25:43.920]  child molestation is not the jurisdiction of the atf no not at all start all that because
[05:25:43.920 --> 05:25:49.440]  a child molestation and if there was child molestation give the guy due process but we
[05:25:49.440 --> 05:25:55.920]  hear today that uh if somebody is adjudicated or or some psychiatrist i should say has an opinion
[05:25:55.920 --> 05:26:01.280]  that somebody is dangerous then that person ought to have their guns taken away from them by force
[05:26:01.280 --> 05:26:06.960]  if necessary uh lethally confiscated if necessary that's that's the implication of that right that's
[05:26:06.960 --> 05:26:12.880]  that is something that can happen and yet here we are 20 years later and who is in the crosshairs
[05:26:12.880 --> 05:26:18.400]  of the government it's those same evangelicals right now 20 years later and i said it at the time
[05:26:18.400 --> 05:26:22.800]  it's that old cliche that if uh that you heard out of nazi germany the guy said when they came
[05:26:22.800 --> 05:26:25.840]  for this group i did nothing when they came for that group i did nothing when they came for me
[05:26:25.840 --> 05:26:32.640]  there was no one left we were telling people that over and over again 20 years ago and like i said
[05:26:32.640 --> 05:26:36.800]  some of the people who were the biggest to criticize the divisions the divisions and who
[05:26:36.800 --> 05:26:41.200]  had the least sympathy for it happened there were the evangelicals and now we're seeing people like
[05:26:41.200 --> 05:26:49.200]  lieutenant colonel frank rich come sending out this uh email to his subordinates saying that
[05:26:50.880 --> 05:26:55.440]  the family research council and the american family association two of the most mainstream
[05:26:55.440 --> 05:27:00.800]  evangelical organizations out there are hate groups yes that is so close to calling them
[05:27:00.800 --> 05:27:06.400]  terrorists and justifying what you want to do to them and telling his subordinates they do not
[05:27:06.400 --> 05:27:11.920]  they do not share our army values and i mean this is in a document where he is talking about
[05:27:11.920 --> 05:27:16.800]  radical revolutionaries i mean we're talking about white supremacist groups and ku klux klan
[05:27:16.800 --> 05:27:21.360]  and islamic terrorists and everything and he's lumping the american family research council
[05:27:21.360 --> 05:27:27.600]  and the family research council and the american family association into those categories and so
[05:27:27.600 --> 05:27:33.600]  if we do not stand together for the bill of rights all the bill of rights uh not just the
[05:27:33.600 --> 05:27:37.600]  second amendment we're all going to be in this together and that's the thing that really stands
[05:27:37.600 --> 05:27:43.200]  out to me how that all unfolded and as we see now in just 20 years and we see the same people in
[05:27:43.200 --> 05:27:49.760]  place as well eric holder had a big role in the waco subsequent investigations yeah and not just
[05:27:49.760 --> 05:27:56.000]  waco uh also oklahoma city this week yes and uh i'll just tell my oklahoma city story when
[05:27:56.000 --> 05:28:02.560]  oklahoma city happened i was in third grade um david nice smile though i guess he's thinking
[05:28:02.560 --> 05:28:08.960]  about how old he was at the time and uh i lived in tulsa oklahoma which is about a little over
[05:28:08.960 --> 05:28:13.200]  an hour from oklahoma city and i've you know been to the memorial out there and all the teachers
[05:28:13.200 --> 05:28:18.080]  were scared and you know a little freaked out about the whole situation and came out or you
[05:28:18.080 --> 05:28:24.000]  know the official story is timothy mcveigh and terry nichols uh handled that situation even
[05:28:24.000 --> 05:28:28.400]  though there have been multiple tests you can see it in a noble eye that we have here that the bomb
[05:28:28.400 --> 05:28:34.400]  as the official story says was constructed cannot bring down a building of that magnitude and cause
[05:28:34.400 --> 05:28:39.840]  that kind of damage also in the noble eye you can see uh the then governor of oklahoma saying that
[05:28:39.840 --> 05:28:45.520]  there were multiple bombs found inside the uh the murrah building uh nobody wants to talk about that
[05:28:45.520 --> 05:28:49.600]  and how did those bombs get there because the official story says that neither timothy mcveigh
[05:28:49.600 --> 05:28:54.320]  nor terry nichols ever stepped foot inside that building so if they didn't step foot inside those
[05:28:54.320 --> 05:28:58.880]  buildings inside the building and bombs were found inside that tells you at least one other person
[05:28:58.880 --> 05:29:02.640]  had to be involved to place those bombs in there but nobody wants to talk about that and i remember
[05:29:02.640 --> 05:29:08.240]  when that happened the new american which is the publication of the john birch society had an
[05:29:08.240 --> 05:29:14.400]  article from a retired general whose specialty was demolition and he said there was absolutely
[05:29:14.400 --> 05:29:20.000]  no way that a single car bomb could have caused a that much damage to that building and b it would
[05:29:20.000 --> 05:29:24.880]  not have done a blast pattern in that particular you know it took off the shared off the whole
[05:29:24.880 --> 05:29:28.880]  front of the building essentially he said it would have been concentric going out that was very
[05:29:28.880 --> 05:29:34.880]  convincing for me very convincing and that documentary a noble lie goes there's a lot more
[05:29:34.880 --> 05:29:39.840]  to that story i mean that right there was you can look at something and when they're that's why we
[05:29:39.840 --> 05:29:44.640]  call bs on a lot of these things when you look at some of these lies they are so profound that you
[05:29:44.640 --> 05:29:49.280]  say okay all right i don't believe what they're telling me about this and at that point you've
[05:29:49.280 --> 05:29:53.360]  got to start doing the research and it's going to take a long time for us to get to the bottom
[05:29:53.360 --> 05:29:58.400]  of what really happened here at the boston marathon bombing just as it did for oklahoma city
[05:29:58.400 --> 05:30:03.760]  just as it did for waco but we can tell already that the government is giving us an inconsistent
[05:30:03.760 --> 05:30:09.200]  and a dishonest story about this and the thing that you've highlighted there with boston
[05:30:09.200 --> 05:30:14.000]  oklahoma city and waco evidence was destroyed because we just heard them say they want to
[05:30:14.000 --> 05:30:19.520]  destroy the crime scene in boston they burned down the waco compound and they uh demolished
[05:30:19.520 --> 05:30:24.000]  the oklahoma city building even though you know there's plenty of evidence to be found same thing
[05:30:24.000 --> 05:30:29.920]  in uh 911 they got the evidence uh they knocked down the buildings and they quickly escorted the
[05:30:29.920 --> 05:30:34.800]  the remains yes away from the scene there are certain like you said and it's why it's important
[05:30:34.800 --> 05:30:39.920]  for people to look at this waco documentary there is a certain pattern of behavior involved with
[05:30:39.920 --> 05:30:46.400]  these quote-unquote investigations that lays the groundwork for deception and dishonesty and you
[05:30:46.400 --> 05:30:49.760]  know they're not being transparent with people they're not being honest they're changing their
[05:30:49.760 --> 05:30:54.720]  story they're covering up and removing evidence and when they do that you know they're up to
[05:30:54.720 --> 05:31:00.400]  something and usually what follows with that is they then turn around and use that official
[05:31:00.400 --> 05:31:06.000]  narrative story as the basis to fundamentally transform our society in some way we've seen
[05:31:06.000 --> 05:31:11.120]  it happen over and over and over again and that's what we're calling right here we don't have all
[05:31:11.120 --> 05:31:17.120]  the answers all the answers didn't come out for waco uh for for over a decade right but when he
[05:31:17.120 --> 05:31:21.920]  started uncovering this doing his research during his freedom of information act it had profound
[05:31:21.920 --> 05:31:26.800]  implications for janet reno and other people although they were never brought to justice as a
[05:31:26.800 --> 05:31:31.040]  matter of fact they're now in charge of justice if you want to call it that way the justice department
[05:31:31.040 --> 05:31:36.080]  which is not really justice but uh you know eric holder has been you know very well rewarded for
[05:31:36.080 --> 05:31:41.120]  his toeing the line for the bureaucracy and one of the things that mike mcnulty said in in the
[05:31:41.120 --> 05:31:45.440]  interview was that we often think of dictatorships as being centered around an individual around
[05:31:45.440 --> 05:31:51.040]  adolph hitler or stalin or julius caesar whatever but it's really centered in our country around
[05:31:51.040 --> 05:31:56.960]  these bureaucracies they're the ones that have this un and unfortunately uh these bureaucracies
[05:31:56.960 --> 05:32:02.160]  never die they just get bigger you know they they're almost like a a corporation that never
[05:32:02.160 --> 05:32:07.520]  dies there's a lot of of uh you know the name the names change but the game stays the same that's
[05:32:07.520 --> 05:32:12.560]  right that's right exactly okay thank you for that dave we'll move on to our calls uh did we
[05:32:12.560 --> 05:32:18.720]  already talk to steve in nevada or is he still still holding okay let's go to steve in nevada
[05:32:19.680 --> 05:32:24.080]  well i'm still i was your previous caller okay i stayed on the line but i wanted to interject
[05:32:24.080 --> 05:32:30.240]  something to what he was saying about oklahoma i think the uh the uh furthest column uh according
[05:32:30.240 --> 05:32:36.160]  to the blast information would have only been receiving 23 pounds per square inch of pressure
[05:32:36.160 --> 05:32:42.240]  from that blast any lady in high heels it puts a lot more than 23 pounds square inches per inch
[05:32:42.240 --> 05:32:47.360]  down on concrete matter of fact concrete's often rated like 5 000 pounds per square inch wetter
[05:32:47.360 --> 05:32:54.880]  how in the world does that concrete shatter with 23 pounds of comp of um uh pressure on that and
[05:32:54.880 --> 05:32:59.440]  get off the air but i just stayed on in case you wanted to come back to something okay all right
[05:32:59.440 --> 05:33:09.760]  thank you steve i will move on to michael in nevada is that me yes great so uh long time listener
[05:33:09.760 --> 05:33:16.880]  first time caller uh finally got an opportunity because you're running all day uh i'm a
[05:33:16.880 --> 05:33:25.520]  mathematician software engineer inventor 165 iq guy and the subject of proof is what you brought
[05:33:25.520 --> 05:33:31.280]  up again and again and one of one of my interests it's a very strong interest i've had it since i
[05:33:31.280 --> 05:33:38.080]  was a teenager and i'm in my 60s now there's a field called horary astrology that's where you
[05:33:38.080 --> 05:33:46.400]  look at the event as it's as it's described by the time and place where it occurs and you can tell
[05:33:46.400 --> 05:33:54.000]  what's going on in circumstantial wise it's told actually in the event itself and uh if you look
[05:33:54.000 --> 05:34:04.320]  at the event um for the uh bombing in boston it's an extremely clear astrological event um
[05:34:04.320 --> 05:34:08.160]  why don't you tell us your findings sir why don't you tell us your findings
[05:34:09.440 --> 05:34:14.480]  yeah well it's clearly uh where we did it to ourselves that is to say the
[05:34:14.480 --> 05:34:21.520]  uh the ruler of the first is in the eighth mercury it's a communication by the people who did it to
[05:34:21.520 --> 05:34:29.840]  us in other words it's not a foreigner it's the people themselves uh what there are a number of
[05:34:29.840 --> 05:34:36.880]  elements uh this sun and mars are both in the eighth house of death um in other words it was
[05:34:36.880 --> 05:34:43.120]  going to be a fiery event i already had it on my calendar as a very dangerous day i was going to
[05:34:43.120 --> 05:34:50.560]  stay off the road road so to speak because it was tax day a day where everybody gets crazy anyway
[05:34:50.560 --> 05:34:58.160]  and the the uh that particular conjunction was something that uh was easy to see coming a long
[05:34:58.160 --> 05:35:02.320]  time right so can you uh can you give us your ultimate findings um you know what you've got
[05:35:02.320 --> 05:35:09.920]  it looks like a it looks like uh people very high in authority uh did the action uh public servants
[05:35:09.920 --> 05:35:16.400]  uh public servants people in very high authority liars who uh deliberately caused the event and
[05:35:16.400 --> 05:35:23.280]  did so in order to improve their power improve their authority okay well thank you very much
[05:35:23.280 --> 05:35:26.560]  i appreciate that thank you sir we'll move on to fred and oregon
[05:35:28.720 --> 05:35:34.160]  can you hear me yes go ahead hi i just want to talk about a brief similarity between the
[05:35:34.160 --> 05:35:43.200]  aurora shootings and boston bombing sure go ahead alex jones talks a lot about how uh people are
[05:35:43.200 --> 05:35:47.520]  about the elites have their own beliefs about luciferianism and that sort of thing and that's
[05:35:47.520 --> 05:35:52.080]  what they believe in not what he believes and uh i'm the same way um but you'll notice that the
[05:35:52.080 --> 05:35:57.520]  guy that did the shootings at aurora uh he associated himself with a joker and uh he painted
[05:35:57.520 --> 05:36:04.560]  his herald orange and you know uh associated with the joker and uh the joker is a symbol of uh
[05:36:05.120 --> 05:36:12.400]  revelations 9 11 apollyon he's kind of like this uh devil general crazy guy who causes chaos i
[05:36:12.400 --> 05:36:21.200]  noticed that the suspect who is fleed in his sling right now his name uh is jocar the d z h sound uh
[05:36:21.200 --> 05:36:25.760]  yeah i'm having a difficult time pronouncing that name but we'll go with that pronunciation go ahead
[05:36:25.760 --> 05:36:32.480]  sir yeah yeah so if you just uh you know plug into like google translator that sort of thing it's
[05:36:32.480 --> 05:36:39.280]  totally makes a j sound and the joker and uh i'm just saying uh there's there's the side of it you
[05:36:39.280 --> 05:36:44.000]  got to do the info side and uh well i mean it's all info but uh the more realistic side and more
[05:36:44.000 --> 05:36:50.320]  tangible stuff at all but these elite people also have these spiritual beliefs that are really messed
[05:36:50.320 --> 05:36:56.000]  up and uh i think if you look into the spiritual side of all this and uh understand that then you
[05:36:56.000 --> 05:37:00.160]  have a greater understanding of what they do and why they do it and when they do it and that's all
[05:37:00.160 --> 05:37:03.680]  really hard to say so uh thank you for your time thank you all right thank you sir i think people
[05:37:03.680 --> 05:37:09.680]  looking at alex's uh bohemian grove that was a real eye opener for me i think uh to see the
[05:37:09.680 --> 05:37:15.120]  luciferian context of all that you know but right kind of reminds me of what he's saying there of
[05:37:15.120 --> 05:37:21.840]  the uh that movie with um robert deniro angel heart where his character was louis cyford and
[05:37:21.840 --> 05:37:25.920]  it was really kind of it was really lucifer you know he's really the devil in it but uh
[05:37:25.920 --> 05:37:29.200]  sorry if i gave that away for anybody but it's a pretty old movie you probably won't watch it
[05:37:29.200 --> 05:37:34.320]  right all right the number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine alex that is eight
[05:37:34.320 --> 05:37:40.320]  seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine we'll move on to liberty lover in indiana
[05:37:40.320 --> 05:37:47.040]  hey guys hey how you doing um first off this is separate my comment common denominator to
[05:37:47.040 --> 05:37:52.960]  all of this is eric holder you guys are talking about him he is the commander but um really
[05:37:52.960 --> 05:37:56.320]  quickly i'm going to run through these points it's only three of them and then you guys comment
[05:37:56.960 --> 05:38:03.760]  ben ghazi all right what was the administration's original story a man's freedom of speech through
[05:38:03.760 --> 05:38:10.640]  youtube in america caused right in the world that led to the distance of our ambassador in which it
[05:38:10.640 --> 05:38:21.200]  seemed you're cutting you're cutting out a little bit sir and the this i'm sorry we're losing you
[05:38:21.200 --> 05:38:24.880]  we're about to let you go i'm sorry i think i know where he's going what he's saying is is that
[05:38:24.880 --> 05:38:30.000]  they're commonly the common thread here is that they're trying to blame uh you know like you said
[05:38:30.000 --> 05:38:36.640]  with ben ghazi oh it was somebody doing a really incredibly bad movie in hollywood that precipitated
[05:38:36.640 --> 05:38:41.520]  all of that right they're very quick to blame us for our freedoms you know we like to say the
[05:38:41.520 --> 05:38:45.920]  muslims are attacking us because of our freedoms it's like no they're not yeah they're trying to
[05:38:45.920 --> 05:38:51.040]  say uh bin laden and his crew hate us because we have big screen tvs and hummers and all that stuff
[05:38:51.040 --> 05:38:55.440]  i'm like i don't think that's what the cause is i don't think the muslims hate our freedoms as much
[05:38:55.440 --> 05:39:00.480]  as the feds hate our freedoms yeah and that's that's a very good point we'll move on to alan
[05:39:01.360 --> 05:39:08.000]  it just says south i don't know if it's south carolina or wherever hello alan yeah hey yeah
[05:39:08.000 --> 05:39:15.120]  this is alan yes i'm glad i'm glad getting through guys uh i just got a a little bit of info here
[05:39:15.120 --> 05:39:24.000]  that i wanted to cover a little quick um the uh the guys that were seen with the uh black back
[05:39:24.000 --> 05:39:32.400]  black backpacks and the the navy seal looking guys there if you look it up uh online you'll find that
[05:39:32.400 --> 05:39:38.960]  these guys what it's what it's stating was that they were national guard cst teams of civilian
[05:39:38.960 --> 05:39:44.160]  support teams i saw something about that yeah go ahead yeah they um if you search it you can search
[05:39:44.160 --> 05:39:50.400]  it on google images and it'll pull up the image of the guys and it'll show them actually uh walking
[05:39:50.400 --> 05:39:56.640]  later in a group and you can see them all standing there a couple of them have their cst best on and
[05:39:56.640 --> 05:40:01.680]  um there is an article i can't remember the name of the article but there is an article that was
[05:40:01.680 --> 05:40:06.960]  stating that they were scheduled to be there and they were there during the running so i don't know
[05:40:06.960 --> 05:40:12.480]  if that was those guys but uh one more quick point i wanted to make about the craft international
[05:40:12.480 --> 05:40:18.800]  guys uh craft international does not have operatives they're not a private security
[05:40:18.800 --> 05:40:23.920]  contracting company they're a training company they're basically like a firearms training
[05:40:24.480 --> 05:40:29.520]  company they uh they teach civilians law enforcement military but they are not a
[05:40:29.520 --> 05:40:33.920]  contracting company now if one of these guys attend to the class and bought a hat or something
[05:40:33.920 --> 05:40:40.880]  like that but um i don't know but i do know that craft is not a contracting company they do not do
[05:40:40.880 --> 05:40:47.120]  private security okay okay thank you sir yeah i had heard uh the possibility about these guys
[05:40:47.120 --> 05:40:52.080]  being national guard as he pointed out and i'm not too familiar with uh with the craft organization
[05:40:52.080 --> 05:40:57.120]  i was familiar with uh the logo but not too much with their organization yeah we went to their site
[05:40:57.120 --> 05:41:02.000]  and we have requested information from them a public statement they have not responded to that
[05:41:02.000 --> 05:41:07.040]  and they also there's a lot of people who are asking them the same question on their facebook
[05:41:07.040 --> 05:41:13.680]  site and uh they're not responding there either we've also sent in a request to them there but um
[05:41:13.680 --> 05:41:18.240]  so they're kind of kind of close i mean when you go to most companies they'll give you a phone
[05:41:18.240 --> 05:41:24.560]  contact or something like that they only have a info at the craft.com to send them information
[05:41:24.560 --> 05:41:28.880]  so they're they're not really you know they're kind of a bit secretive probably where these guys
[05:41:28.880 --> 05:41:34.960]  came from and um uh there's pictures of uh some of the trainers there that that look exactly like
[05:41:35.600 --> 05:41:40.560]  uh what these guys look like these guys did not look as alex has said they they look like
[05:41:40.560 --> 05:41:46.080]  they came from the craft or from uh former navy seals or current navy seals they did not look
[05:41:46.080 --> 05:41:51.200]  like national guardsmen sure when you see all the craft photos in their own training videos online
[05:41:51.200 --> 05:41:56.800]  that's what they wear and then it's the punisher that the seals all use but then the it looks like
[05:41:56.800 --> 05:42:02.720]  the red craft there as you see that's why we're saying so we call them and sure uh i know they're
[05:42:02.720 --> 05:42:07.200]  for training maybe they were hired as part of the exercise and i'm not and again i don't think they
[05:42:07.200 --> 05:42:12.080]  were involved from the body language i think they were part of the drill so so that's what we're
[05:42:12.080 --> 05:42:16.400]  saying yeah we didn't say that they were you know complacently involved in you know the bombing
[05:42:16.400 --> 05:42:22.160]  exactly and and i'm not and i said day one the different saudi arabians the redneck all those
[05:42:22.160 --> 05:42:26.560]  people i believe they were patsies too now we're seeing photoshop stuff because i've been looking
[05:42:26.560 --> 05:42:31.920]  at pretty clear in the media of the guy you know they're now chasing around where it looks like he's
[05:42:31.920 --> 05:42:36.480]  standing behind a little kid that got blown up i mean this is this is disinfo heaven and that's
[05:42:36.480 --> 05:42:41.600]  what i'm saying that's what you see time and time again in a false flag is this swirling confusion
[05:42:41.600 --> 05:42:44.960]  so you don't know what's real you know that's what the operators have called them and said no that's
[05:42:44.960 --> 05:42:49.760]  how it is well that's how it was in oklahoma city that said five groups it's six groups they had
[05:42:49.760 --> 05:42:56.800]  there six groups so that they always should just keep falling back to the next patsy all right if
[05:42:56.800 --> 05:43:01.200]  you go back and you look at uh youtube and look at the seven seven bombings in london they were
[05:43:01.200 --> 05:43:05.040]  interviewing a guy and he was with a security organization he was saying this is just amazing
[05:43:05.040 --> 05:43:09.040]  we were here training with our security organization the exact same scenario at the
[05:43:09.040 --> 05:43:14.240]  exact same time in the exact same place what are the chances of that well it turns out the chances
[05:43:14.240 --> 05:43:20.400]  are like astronomically zero you know so it it's a sort of thing when we saw that one and that's
[05:43:20.400 --> 05:43:26.320]  why dan pressed them so hard on is this a drill is this a drill and they would not give us a clear
[05:43:26.320 --> 05:43:31.040]  answer they avoided that question the police chief avoid that question when he asked him that because
[05:43:31.040 --> 05:43:35.120]  that is a real telling sign that's a tell-tale sign and it's not to say that the people who
[05:43:35.120 --> 05:43:39.680]  are involved in the drill are aware of it just as i said it was a it was an amazing thing to that
[05:43:39.680 --> 05:43:45.200]  guy who was with a security organization there in london on the seven seven bombing right he was
[05:43:45.200 --> 05:43:50.720]  absolutely amazed himself these people if they were involved with the craft there for training
[05:43:50.720 --> 05:43:54.880]  uh you know as part of an exercise that's why it would you know we're not saying that they're
[05:43:54.880 --> 05:43:59.280]  involved with it but we're also not able to get any confirmation from them one way or the other
[05:43:59.280 --> 05:44:03.280]  whether they're participating in it in any way yeah so i hope we answered your question now and

[05:44:58.640 --> 05:45:03.920]  curious what he meant by a lawful assembly is that something that is outside of the electoral
[05:45:03.920 --> 05:45:10.640]  system yes it is it's completely constitutional do you have anything you said you're involved in
[05:45:10.640 --> 05:45:16.000]  a group is that what you do in your group it's not a group it's a lawful assembly we're about

[05:45:45.360 --> 05:45:47.520]  i will move on to jamie in washington
[05:45:47.520 --> 05:45:55.120]  hello jamie regarding the police radio at the time just after the bombing that you have linked
[05:45:55.120 --> 05:46:00.960]  in your archives on the 17th deeper into the recording there's a possible transmission that
[05:46:00.960 --> 05:46:07.120]  could be um an operative talking i have sent the dialogue and the time stamps to show chips
[05:46:07.680 --> 05:46:13.440]  but i'd like to go over the time stamps that are of interest and think it would be very powerful
[05:46:13.440 --> 05:46:18.240]  to play these segments for the audience to hear as well further on sure that'd be great
[05:46:19.200 --> 05:46:28.400]  quickly uh 25909 and of course this is that blog dog boston marathon police radio if you search
[05:46:28.400 --> 05:46:35.520]  that but at 25909 someone says this is the real deal uh we're just checking on your eta to
[05:46:35.520 --> 05:46:43.440]  downtown there's a long silence and then someone pretty upset says i'm dumping i'm dumping i'm not
[05:46:43.440 --> 05:46:50.880]  getting near there i just gotta dump and run i'm dumping and running lady breaks in i'm sorry
[05:46:50.880 --> 05:46:57.920]  stanley repeat we can't hear what you're saying i'm jumping and running i'm not i can't see the
[05:46:57.920 --> 05:47:08.400]  pro i can't see the what i the pro p ro okay i i i just gotta get going here is that okay
[05:47:08.400 --> 05:47:15.680]  i gotta go and the lady goes yes go so that to me is pretty worth listening to
[05:47:16.560 --> 05:47:25.280]  and just a quick second tip at 255 45 it sounds like an officer he says bleaches over here
[05:47:25.280 --> 05:47:30.480]  and the library but the note to think about here is the library explosion announced at the first
[05:47:30.480 --> 05:47:36.720]  press conference by the boston mayor or police around 5 15 p.m eastern on the day of the bombing
[05:47:36.720 --> 05:47:41.920]  said the library explosion had only happened about 30 minutes ago so why did the cops know about it
[05:47:41.920 --> 05:47:49.760]  at 255 and are directing others to that location besides the bleachers so thank you and i hope this
[05:47:49.760 --> 05:47:56.560]  cracks things more well all right thank you that's interesting information thank you so much and uh
[05:47:56.560 --> 05:48:01.680]  as far as that we send that to show tips and put blog dog timestamp in the in the headline thank

[05:48:41.280 --> 05:48:45.440]  perfectly fine we'll move on to chuck in or if you're interested in the boston bombing
[05:48:45.440 --> 05:48:47.440]  move on to chuck in oregon
[05:48:51.040 --> 05:48:59.360]  hello yes go ahead good uh yeah i just wanted to uh mention that uh my brothers and i have a
[05:48:59.360 --> 05:49:06.400]  program on blog talk radio if i'm allowed to say that yeah and uh we received an email today after
[05:49:06.400 --> 05:49:13.840]  our program saying that uh we might not be able to uh because of the situation in boston we may
[05:49:13.840 --> 05:49:20.320]  not be able to have our regularly scheduled programs uh this next week really why would
[05:49:20.320 --> 05:49:26.480]  that be are you there are you there are you located anywhere near there no i'm in oregon
[05:49:27.040 --> 05:49:31.520]  oh wow so they just said you because the situation in boston you can't have a broadcast is basically
[05:49:31.520 --> 05:49:36.720]  what they said yeah what time i'm just curious sir what type of programming do you have
[05:49:36.720 --> 05:49:51.040]  uh basically you know we go over the the headlines the news of the day so did they give you any
[05:49:51.040 --> 05:49:54.640]  reason for that or they just said that you might not be able to have it simply because of what's
[05:49:54.640 --> 05:50:00.000]  going on in boston that's the only reason yes yeah i thought that was very strange
[05:50:01.280 --> 05:50:06.000]  that is very strange well you know we have seen situations all across the country the day after
[05:50:06.000 --> 05:50:11.840]  this bombing happened usa today had pictures of essentially martial law type of things going on
[05:50:11.840 --> 05:50:18.720]  in cities all the way across the country all the way out to la and uh i mean we we looked at it and
[05:50:18.720 --> 05:50:23.760]  we were just absolutely amazed were we yeah i'm even today i was watching cnn and they had a
[05:50:23.760 --> 05:50:28.720]  a hummer or a humvee whatever you call it parked on a city street just like it like it's a mailbox
[05:50:28.720 --> 05:50:32.640]  or something like it was supposed to be there and that's what we're so concerned about is that this
[05:50:32.640 --> 05:50:38.720]  is being used to fundamentally transform our society to uh take these military drills which
[05:50:38.720 --> 05:50:44.880]  have been occurring in big cities on a more and more frequent basis to do this even more in the
[05:50:44.880 --> 05:50:49.840]  open and make it more of our day-to-day life and to use this as a justification well because it was
[05:50:49.840 --> 05:50:56.080]  a bombing in boston no longer will you be allowed to openly congregate without turning this area
[05:50:56.080 --> 05:50:59.920]  into a police state you know wherever you are we're going to do a tsa number on you and we
[05:50:59.920 --> 05:51:04.880]  know the tsa has been building up for this for quite some time they've been stockpiling the
[05:51:04.880 --> 05:51:10.880]  tools to do this they've been running test runs with viper at various public places typically
[05:51:10.880 --> 05:51:15.200]  having to do with transportation things like train stations and bus stations that sort of thing but
[05:51:15.200 --> 05:51:19.280]  they've also been at sporting events which has absolutely nothing to do with transportation
[05:51:19.280 --> 05:51:25.520]  not at all at romney rallies and yes the other candidates during the election so they're aching
[05:51:25.520 --> 05:51:31.520]  aching to expand their jurisdiction and their little bureaucratic empire and that's exactly
[05:51:31.520 --> 05:51:36.480]  the types of things as we said before that were going on and that was the backstory to waco
[05:51:36.480 --> 05:51:40.000]  yes why that happened now sir i'm sorry to hear that's happening to you is there a phone number
[05:51:40.000 --> 05:51:44.560]  or maybe an email somebody can you know viewers can contact to say hey i want this guy show on the
[05:51:44.560 --> 05:51:54.720]  air um let's see um i guess you could just contact blog talk radio but i i'd like to know if this has
[05:51:54.720 --> 05:52:02.160]  happened to anybody else that has a program on yeah anybody else uh who's on blog talk or any
[05:52:02.160 --> 05:52:06.880]  any uh affiliate and they say hey my show has been been canned at least temporarily because
[05:52:06.880 --> 05:52:11.520]  of the situation we want to hear from you thank you for your call chuck we'll move on to drew in
[05:52:11.520 --> 05:52:21.920]  indiana hello drew yes go ahead um yeah i had two questions uh one whatever happened with the oath
[05:52:21.920 --> 05:52:30.160]  keepers at lexington and two um there's a woman walking in front of the two guys that her face is
[05:52:30.160 --> 05:52:35.840]  bleeped out like the fed that's putting this wire yeah i noticed that her balloons go up like it's
[05:52:35.840 --> 05:52:41.200]  signaling the second bomb to go off well i i'd have to look at the images again i remember when
[05:52:41.200 --> 05:52:47.280]  i was watching that cnn uh the clip when i first saw it was on cnn the fbi footage was uh you could
[05:52:47.280 --> 05:52:51.280]  see some people not just that woman you were referring to but uh some people had their faces
[05:52:51.280 --> 05:52:54.880]  blurred but some people didn't and i thought that was very strange that if you're going to blur you
[05:52:54.880 --> 05:52:58.400]  know this guy in the crowd why don't you just blur everybody's face right you know i mean you're the
[05:52:58.400 --> 05:53:03.040]  fbi you should have the resources to you know blur people's faces i thought that was odd and what was
[05:53:03.040 --> 05:53:08.960]  your other point sir uh whatever happened with uh lexington today with the oath keepers did they
[05:53:08.960 --> 05:53:15.120]  show up or what happened they essentially declared i think uh some sort of martial law there and and
[05:53:15.120 --> 05:53:18.720]  we were hearing that uh they were telling reporters they couldn't come out and cover things so
[05:53:18.720 --> 05:53:23.280]  um i've i've been in and out of the situation today like i said i was working on other aspects
[05:53:23.280 --> 05:53:29.600]  of the show so i'm not really sure but uh alex was talking to stewart rose earlier and i believe
[05:53:29.600 --> 05:53:34.080]  that they weren't letting anybody meet anywhere they essentially had the whole area in lockdown
[05:53:34.080 --> 05:53:38.480]  because they've got this manhunt going on there the narrative is that uh they're throwing hurling
[05:53:38.480 --> 05:53:41.920]  bombs at people and yeah they're sitting there driving down the street throwing bombs out the
[05:53:41.920 --> 05:53:45.760]  back of their truck uh sir if you want to find out more about that i believe you can either do
[05:53:45.760 --> 05:53:51.360]  either do i'm not sure if stewart on earlier today i know he's on yesterday i was busy oh he
[05:53:51.360 --> 05:53:56.480]  was on today okay i was busy monitoring the uh the radio traffic of the uh boston situation so
[05:53:56.480 --> 05:54:00.160]  you can check the archives of earlier today and you can hear it from stewart himself
[05:54:00.160 --> 05:54:02.880]  all right thanks for your call sir we'll move to jay in texas
[05:54:05.360 --> 05:54:12.160]  question what legal authority how can i'm looking at uh fox news and all this
[05:54:12.160 --> 05:54:15.680]  that's telling people to leave their homes immediately and then they go in there
[05:54:16.240 --> 05:54:21.200]  don't they need a warrant what's going on well it's called martial law i think yeah that's
[05:54:21.200 --> 05:54:25.680]  pretty much declare martial law no they haven't declared it but they are acting like it yeah
[05:54:25.680 --> 05:54:30.400]  it's a state of emergency i believe i mean how how how many times have they declared an actual
[05:54:30.400 --> 05:54:34.240]  war in all the wars that we've had that we've been involved in right they don't necessarily
[05:54:34.240 --> 05:54:38.320]  get a declaration of war they just do it and they don't necessarily get a declaration of
[05:54:38.320 --> 05:54:42.320]  martial law they just do it and that's what they're doing right now they don't they don't follow
[05:54:42.320 --> 05:54:48.240]  these rules that we're yeah i mean i'm blown away by this i can't believe it absolutely just in
[05:54:48.240 --> 05:54:53.600]  perspective we've had shootings and other bombings i mean it's not i mean i hate to say but it's not
[05:54:53.600 --> 05:54:57.760]  you know the most uncommon thing in the world and they don't shut down cities and go house to house
[05:54:57.760 --> 05:55:02.160]  and get out your house i do agree they should have some type of a warrant but uh they're just
[05:55:02.160 --> 05:55:06.960]  doing whatever they want to do pretty much and that's why this looks like a very easy way to
[05:55:06.960 --> 05:55:11.440]  i mean they're clearing out whole neighborhoods telling everybody to leave their homes go go to
[05:55:11.440 --> 05:55:15.600]  the police station and wait until we tell you to come back and then they go into everybody's
[05:55:15.600 --> 05:55:20.480]  homes that's total incentive i can't believe it yeah absolutely and that's what we were saying
[05:55:20.480 --> 05:55:23.680]  from the very beginning and that's what the mainstream press was saying they said this is
[05:55:23.680 --> 05:55:28.400]  going to be a transformational event just like september 11th right and we were saying yeah and
[05:55:28.400 --> 05:55:33.760]  it's going to transform us into the next level of tyranny which is what we're seeing happening
[05:55:33.760 --> 05:55:38.320]  right now today in boston yeah and and when it first happened i was just calling uh you know
[05:55:38.320 --> 05:55:42.400]  calling out to obviously going to have checkpoints and all that in which they did having troops check
[05:55:42.400 --> 05:55:46.000]  your papers on the streets and so forth and they wouldn't even beyond that we're going to come into
[05:55:46.000 --> 05:55:49.920]  your home and you need to stay outside until we get done i really don't have an answer to your
[05:55:49.920 --> 05:55:53.040]  question sir but i do agree with you that they shouldn't be doing those type of things
[05:55:54.080 --> 05:56:00.320]  okay all right thanks all right thank you and is that fabian in indiana
[05:56:00.320 --> 05:56:07.760]  yes sir okay go ahead hi there um been uh wanting to call you guys i was wanting to specifically

[05:58:57.680 --> 05:59:03.040]  and that is look at the patterns look at what's been happening we've seen these patterns over
[05:59:03.040 --> 05:59:07.120]  and over again when we see certain things like this happening even though it can take a very
