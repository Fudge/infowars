[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:22.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.840 --> 00:29.960]  Okay, I'm going to try to fit it all in today.
[00:29.960 --> 00:33.000]  This broadcast is going to be totally jam-packed with news information.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.800]  Your calls, former governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, is popping in in the last 30
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.600]  minutes, presidential candidate, who is running TV and radio ads everywhere.
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.200]  Every time I turn the radio on, he's buying ads on this network, on Genesis.
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.880]  I hear it on every clear channel station.
[00:50.880 --> 00:51.880]  It's crazy.
[00:51.880 --> 01:00.800]  So I'm going to ask him how all that's going, and will he Ross Perot, Rick Perry's clone,
[01:00.800 --> 01:04.320]  also known as Mitt Romney?
[01:04.320 --> 01:08.160]  So we're going to be discussing all of that today.
[01:08.160 --> 01:14.120]  Wow, last night, I am sitting there watching the debate, just for some reason, I decided
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.120]  to watch it.
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.680]  I usually read a transcript of the debates, because it's such theater.
[01:18.680 --> 01:19.920]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:19.920 --> 01:20.920]  It's so canned.
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.640]  Then I just read a transcript, and then highlights, you know, we play on the show.
[01:26.640 --> 01:35.320]  But I watched the whole thing, and Obama looked totally arrogant and angry that he was being
[01:35.320 --> 01:37.400]  asked questions.
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.640]  My children all thought he was creepy, but they also thought Mitt Romney was creepy.
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.520]  And my wife said he's like a charming vampire.
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.520]  And that's what I've always said.
[01:46.520 --> 01:51.400]  And Mitt Romney reminds me of Count Dracula, so in every way.
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.320]  I mean, it's like he could be, he could star as a head vampire in any movie.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.120]  I'm going to ask any casting director that Mitt Romney is, well, he is central cast in
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.440]  Count Dracula.
[02:02.440 --> 02:09.320]  Now that joke aside, within minutes, I tweeted, and you can go to real Alex Jones, within
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.880]  five minutes of the debate starting at nine o'clock Eastern, eight o'clock Central, I
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.040]  was saying Obama is flat, Obama is out of gas, Obama is arrogant.
[02:19.040 --> 02:21.280]  And people were like, man, Alex, you never tweeted this much.
[02:21.280 --> 02:22.360]  I was tweeting every minute.
[02:22.360 --> 02:31.600]  I said, we're watching the absolute collapse of Obama if he doesn't come alive here.
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.720]  Because the American people on average don't really know about policies.
[02:34.720 --> 02:38.600]  They just go off of how your hair looks and how you act and are you confident.
[02:38.600 --> 02:43.160]  And he couldn't stand Mitt Romney staring at him the whole time because everybody walks
[02:43.160 --> 02:45.960]  around groveling to the president all day.
[02:45.960 --> 02:52.680]  The senator of four years ago was confident, but not ultra super, totally narcissistic
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.200]  and arrogant.
[02:54.200 --> 02:56.280]  Now everybody saw Obama.
[02:56.280 --> 03:02.720]  Can you imagine if Mitt Romney gets in how arrogant he'll be in four years?
[03:02.720 --> 03:07.920]  So again, if you go down deeper into my tweets at real Alex Jones down there from last night,
[03:07.920 --> 03:13.880]  you'll see about 10 I sent out and the first ones I sent out, I broke down.
[03:13.880 --> 03:15.760]  Yeah, it's more.
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.080]  It's down at the bottom right there.
[03:17.080 --> 03:18.400]  Yeah, go back up.
[03:18.400 --> 03:19.400]  Go back up.
[03:19.400 --> 03:20.400]  It's right there.
[03:20.400 --> 03:21.400]  It just says, keep going up.
[03:21.400 --> 03:23.960]  Here, I'll just punch it up on screen right here.
[03:23.960 --> 03:25.440]  I'll punch it up on screen right here.
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.640]  I'll just do it right here.
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.360]  I'll just go to Twitter right here, real Alex Jones and show people.
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.120]  You can punch this screen up.
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.560]  It says, watching the debate now, both men work for the same globalist.
[03:37.560 --> 03:39.600]  That was right as it started.
[03:39.600 --> 03:43.400]  And then a minute later, Obama is in trouble.
[03:43.400 --> 03:44.920]  He looks totally impotent.
[03:44.920 --> 03:47.520]  This is going to be big.
[03:47.520 --> 03:48.520]  Next one.
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.480]  Obama knows that when you raise taxes, it drops revenue.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.960]  That's the plan.
[03:53.960 --> 04:00.440]  Again, Romney needs to bring up, you didn't build that if he wants to win, which he basically
[04:00.440 --> 04:01.440]  did.
[04:01.440 --> 04:02.440]  Wow.
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.440]  Romney just told the truth.
[04:03.440 --> 04:05.400]  He said raising taxes lowers revenue.
[04:05.400 --> 04:07.720]  I couldn't believe that.
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.080]  He was actually defending small businesses too.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.960]  So both men are puppets.
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.880]  This whole show is to make us think we have a choice.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.800]  Last week tonight, this debate was a game changer for Romney.
[04:22.800 --> 04:24.160]  Too bad it's fake.
[04:24.160 --> 04:26.520]  I sent that out before it was even over.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.440]  I sent that out the last few minutes of it.
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.560]  And then, well, I have even mainstream media and even all the liberals are in routed panic
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.560]  right now.
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.520]  Obama burned to the ground last night.
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.440]  He burned to the ground last night.
[04:41.440 --> 04:48.520]  But hey, it doesn't matter because Mitt Romney is run by the same people and it gets worse.
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.760]  I agree with Sarah Palin.
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.120]  She said, watch them, they're going to stage something.
[04:53.120 --> 04:55.360]  And you better bet your boots.
[04:55.360 --> 04:56.360]  That's in the cards.
[04:56.360 --> 05:00.040]  We'll be right back with the real news, the big news.
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.440]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.680]  half year on record.
[05:05.680 --> 05:08.800]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.520]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.520]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[05:18.520 --> 05:19.520]  food prices.
[05:19.520 --> 05:24.160]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[05:24.160 --> 05:27.120]  your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[05:27.120 --> 05:31.040]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.680]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.840]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.680]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.880]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's stored for 25
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.240]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.240]  Don't wait.
[05:48.240 --> 05:53.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.520]  Call 800-409-5633 or e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.040]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[06:00.040 --> 06:03.760]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[06:03.760 --> 06:05.800]  But not all silver is equal.
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.320]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred
[06:09.320 --> 06:12.200]  times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[06:12.200 --> 06:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  SilverSol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.760]  bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.240]  SilverSol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial
[06:28.240 --> 06:30.920]  bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[06:30.920 --> 06:35.200]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria's
[06:35.200 --> 06:36.640]  molds and yeasts.
[06:36.640 --> 06:40.920]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm
[06:40.920 --> 06:43.360]  yourself with supernatural silver.
[06:43.360 --> 06:47.640]  SilverSol liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.080]  at home, school, or work.
[06:49.080 --> 06:52.560]  Go to www.supernaturalsilver.com and be prepared for any emergency.

[06:59.560 --> 07:03.160]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for tree speakers.
[07:03.160 --> 07:07.920]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[07:07.920 --> 07:08.920]  at infowars.com.
[07:08.920 --> 07:15.160]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly
[07:15.160 --> 07:16.160]  convincing.
[07:16.160 --> 07:21.760]  It's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com.
[07:21.760 --> 07:25.320]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[07:25.320 --> 07:29.480]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[07:29.480 --> 07:33.680]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[07:33.680 --> 07:36.480]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[07:36.480 --> 07:40.080]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[07:40.080 --> 07:44.760]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[07:44.760 --> 07:47.640]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.440]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing
[07:52.440 --> 07:54.600]  the scourge that is vaccines.
[07:54.600 --> 08:08.040]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[08:08.040 --> 08:15.040]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.320]  GCN Radio Network.
[08:20.320 --> 08:24.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us as we kick off another worldwide
[08:24.680 --> 08:25.680]  transmission.
[08:25.680 --> 08:34.600]  It is Thursday, the fourth day of October, 2012, coming up, a libertarian presidential
[08:34.600 --> 08:40.960]  candidate making big waves trying to get into the debates and filing lawsuits over that.
[08:40.960 --> 08:45.800]  He is going to be joining us, Gary Johnson, coming up in the last 30 minutes of the third
[08:45.800 --> 08:47.400]  hour today.
[08:47.400 --> 08:51.520]  Obviously, the debate is huge news.
[08:51.520 --> 09:00.800]  I've got several articles here where London and Vegas bookies who had been two to one
[09:00.800 --> 09:09.760]  against Romney have now basically moved about halfway towards Romney, and the money says
[09:09.760 --> 09:14.680]  that if Obama loses the next debate, they're going to be neck and neck, and then if he
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.200]  loses the next one, Romney is going to surge ahead.
[09:19.200 --> 09:26.520]  Again, the thing is theater, it's two pillars of the New World Order, it's two heads on
[09:26.520 --> 09:35.000]  the same ogre, they've got different ties, but they're still there on the same body.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  They work for the very same interest, but the globalists have to give us some choice,
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.120]  and there are big political machines of the Democratic and Republican parties who hate
[09:44.120 --> 09:52.040]  each other at many levels, who are battling for the levers of control, whereas the Republican
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.040]  party operates kind of as the corporate fascists who, well, we're against big government, that's
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.520]  why we promote giant government and corporate welfare.
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.600]  And then it expands out from there with the Democrats who are also corporate fascists,
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.200]  but pose as socialist communists who are just racing ahead with authoritarian activity,
[10:13.200 --> 10:16.400]  and then the Republicans kind of act as a placeholder for them whenever the Democrats
[10:16.400 --> 10:21.280]  are out of power, well, the Republicans get back in and then just cement all the gains,
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.680]  and every new administration wants all the new powers that the last criminal administration
[10:26.680 --> 10:32.720]  seized on, and so no one ever gives up any of the power, and so the government just gets
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.760]  bigger and bigger and more arrogant and more out of control.
[10:36.760 --> 10:44.520]  Now I'm going to get to the debate coming up later in the hour, and I'm going to play
[10:44.520 --> 10:51.000]  the chips here on air of Romney, of Obama, some of the moments that I thought were the
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.440]  biggest zingers, and then of course in the second hour we will open the phones up for
[10:56.440 --> 11:04.760]  you to give us your take on all of this, but I began tweeting within three or four minutes
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.680]  of the debate beginning that Obama looked completely beaten.
[11:10.680 --> 11:15.400]  He looked, impotent was the word I used on my Twitter account, or realallocshones, Twitter.com
[11:15.400 --> 11:19.840]  forward slash realallocshones for those of you that follow or want to follow us, and
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.980]  I began to send screenshots out of different, shots of both men's faces.
[11:24.980 --> 11:31.500]  Romney was animated, electric, alive out of the gates like a champ.
[11:31.500 --> 11:38.920]  He was like Cassius Clay coming out in his debut, heavyweight fight and beating the champ.
[11:38.920 --> 11:45.400]  Again, they're puppets, it's a giant show, the greatest show on earth, it's a distraction,
[11:45.400 --> 11:52.600]  it's a diversion. But regardless, it is a game changer now because it will mean differences
[11:52.600 --> 11:59.080]  in approach if Mitt Romney actually swings the country behind him and the system allows him
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.880]  to win. They may pull out the stops of the election fraud, they may engage in October surprise,
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.520]  even Sarah Palin said that. We have a video clip of that, Governor Palin said, hey, they're gonna,
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.960]  they're gonna pull some trick, they're gonna pull some event. ABC News said Monday there may be an
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.680]  October surprise militarily. Well, I think that October surprise has already started and that's
[12:18.680 --> 12:22.760]  really our big news today, I'm gonna be getting to here in a moment, but here are just some of the
[12:22.760 --> 12:28.360]  headlines. So I began tweeting within three minutes of seeing Obama, I said he looks beat,
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.080]  he looks impotent, he looks flat, he is in big trouble. And I saw tweets coming back at me,
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.880]  responses going, hey man, I thought you were, you know, against both parties and hey man,
[12:39.880 --> 12:45.560]  you know, why don't you shut up or hey man, why don't you, you know, leave Obama alone?
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.400]  Hey, I'm just calling it like I see it, that's why my job is so easy. I just try to tell the
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.640]  truth and tell what I see. And that's what you get, does it mean that my perspective is always
[12:55.640 --> 13:00.840]  right? No. But throughout the evening, I sent out, I don't know, seven, eight, nine tweets,
[13:00.840 --> 13:06.360]  what is it, nine tweets. And I said, this is a game changer. Well, that's what they're saying
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.800]  today and it's not just the Republicans saying it, shingin' in poll, most watchers say Romney,
[13:11.800 --> 13:21.000]  the debate winner. That's shingin' in. Incumbent debate curse, Barack Obama fails and falls to
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.880]  Mitt Romney, national journal. Weekly standard, Romney, the path we're taking is not working,
[13:27.880 --> 13:38.200]  it's time for a new path. Campaign stops. Charles M. Blow, or Blow, from the New York Times,
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.520]  and he goes on to say that Obama absolutely got trounced. Here's another one out of the hill.
[13:44.520 --> 13:51.480]  Obama can't promise a stubborn response to Romney in next debate. Politico, first presidential
[13:51.480 --> 13:58.360]  debate, Obama hit with left hook on TV online. Politico says he was destroyed. Philly student
[13:58.360 --> 14:06.920]  told to lose Romney t-shirt or get out. Told it was a KKK shirt kicked out of the school, told not
[14:06.920 --> 14:10.440]  to wear the Romney shirt. Well, all over the country, you can't wear American flag shirts in
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.360]  San Francisco or Dallas, Texas, you're thrown out because it's seen as anti-Mexico. I'm just
[14:16.360 --> 14:21.640]  gonna have a free speech in this country. Michael Mordo, Obama, this is Washington Times. This is
[14:21.640 --> 14:28.760]  what happens when you pick John Kerry as your debate coach. Washington Post, Romney goes on
[14:28.760 --> 14:35.880]  offense forcing Obama to defend record, says that Obama lost. Real clear politics has a video clip
[14:35.880 --> 14:45.080]  of this. Chris Matthews freaks out that Obama, what was he doing? Says he lost. Carvel says Mitt
[14:45.080 --> 14:55.720]  Romney came with a chainsaw. Romney lands punches against subdued Obama in first debate. Al Gore
[14:55.720 --> 15:02.520]  comes out and says it's the high altitude of Denver is why Obama looked drugged. Californians
[15:02.520 --> 15:08.520]  watch think Romney won clash with Obama in first debate. That's in big scientific Gallup poll,
[15:08.520 --> 15:21.480]  Rasmussen and ABC all show that he trounced Obama. Video potential worry for Obama campaign.
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.040]  And it just goes on and on. So I'll stop. I'll stop right there. I've got even more stacks of this.
[15:30.040 --> 15:38.600]  So listen, it was obvious within minutes that Barack Obama wasn't suffering from altitude
[15:38.600 --> 15:45.960]  sickness at 10,000 feet in Denver, the mile high city or 9,000, whatever it is. I've been to Denver
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.360]  many times. I live here in Texas, you know, about where I'm at a thousand feet above sea level.
[15:51.480 --> 15:56.840]  I've been to Denver many times. I feel great. Now you have about 15, 16, 18,000 feet. I feel it.
[15:56.840 --> 16:05.400]  The fact is, both men have not been living in the mountains. So that cancels each other out.
[16:07.000 --> 16:17.640]  Obama is arrogant as hell now. Obama is on a power trip and did not like Mitt Romney
[16:17.640 --> 16:23.720]  radiating aggression at him. Romney went in there like a corporate shark. And I've been
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.560]  around those type of guys that are extremely charismatic and those corporate guys act real
[16:27.560 --> 16:33.240]  calm and real nice till it's time to get a deal done. And then they will come in and just pound
[16:33.240 --> 16:39.400]  you with energy. And that's what Romney was doing was just beaming hatred at him with a smile on his
[16:39.400 --> 16:45.240]  face the whole time. And Romney absolutely annihilated Obama. You want to know what happened?
[16:45.240 --> 16:53.240]  Romney was radiating corporate hatred and power at Obama. And Obama was absolutely
[16:53.240 --> 16:59.320]  hating it and felt cornered and so was getting into his presidential arrogance. Now you're not
[16:59.320 --> 17:05.960]  going to get that analysis anywhere else. I know people. I know what I saw. Mitt Romney absolutely
[17:05.960 --> 17:16.360]  dominated and cornered him. Just like we saw Bill Clinton do to George Herbert Walker Bush.
[17:16.360 --> 17:19.240]  Remember when Clinton would arrogantly we even walk into his space
[17:19.240 --> 17:28.600]  and would even glare at him. That's what was going on last night. And people are so primitive and
[17:28.600 --> 17:34.280]  dumbed down in this country whether you like Obama or not that all they saw was two chiefs
[17:34.280 --> 17:41.880]  up in front of the tribe at the cave and Romney was up there physically with his presence dominating
[17:41.880 --> 17:50.200]  Obama. Dominating him and and dominating him verbally and and calling him out and saying
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.960]  my sons I got five of them. They tell me something over and over again that didn't
[17:53.960 --> 17:58.760]  true. You stop it. He said you're a little boy. Stop lying.
[18:02.200 --> 18:06.120]  I mean he's just absolutely dominating him and I don't think Obama's going to come back
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.080]  from it unless somebody drugs Romney or something or or unless something happens to Romney.
[18:11.080 --> 18:18.120]  Unless I mean it's it's over. Obama is such a narcissist and Romney's probably a psychopath
[18:19.320 --> 18:25.640]  that at least this now I'm going to get into it. The point is that it was amazing to watch
[18:25.640 --> 18:30.840]  if you're into human psychology. Now that said I'm getting into this later in the hour and next
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.440]  hour in your calls. The clips all of it. Okay. We're going to have a whole big report on that.
[18:34.440 --> 18:45.960]  That said it's fun as it is with the soap opera that is is presidential politics as as fun as
[18:45.960 --> 18:52.840]  it is to focus on the play by play like it's an NFL game or a NHL game as fun as that is
[18:53.960 --> 19:00.040]  or the World Series of Baseball. We can learn from it politically and learn how they manipulate
[19:00.040 --> 19:06.600]  us but other than that it pales compared to the October surprise. What are we saying in the new
[19:06.600 --> 19:15.320]  magazine the the the October issue. October surprise war question mark. Well as I've told you
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.400]  and there's a big curtain memo Alex Jones article that we wrote together this morning.
[19:19.400 --> 19:26.360]  It's the top story at info wars dot com right now. War with Iran started five years ago. We have all
[19:26.360 --> 19:35.640]  the proof. Now it's leading up to open military confrontation and Turkey has now started shelling
[19:36.280 --> 19:44.360]  into the yesterday into today. Syria and the whole thing is getting ready to go sky high
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.840]  unless politically we do something and it doesn't look like the establishment is going to stop what's
[19:48.840 --> 19:54.200]  happening. So you notice the economy's melting down as they get ready to flare up this big regional
[19:54.200 --> 20:00.120]  war. That many analysts take it lead to World War three. The war already started folks we'll be back.
[20:00.120 --> 20:04.920]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[20:04.920 --> 20:10.200]  year on record. 78 percent of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn but
[20:10.200 --> 20:15.960]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices. The cost to feed livestock
[20:15.960 --> 20:20.600]  is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to
[20:20.600 --> 20:25.880]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[20:25.880 --> 20:31.080]  eFoods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases eFoods will have to raise prices too.

[24:24.280 --> 24:43.000]  So, the globalist CIA puppet, Barack Obama, meets the corporate vampire, the charming vampire,
[24:43.000 --> 24:51.160]  Count Romney. And Count Romney, well, basically Dracula says to Von Helsing,
[24:51.160 --> 24:58.440]  come here, come here, Von Helsing. And that is basically what happened to Obama. Obama was
[24:58.440 --> 25:06.760]  cowed, absolutely cowed. And I love seeing arrogant people cowed, but it was Count Dracula doing it.
[25:06.760 --> 25:12.280]  So, he looks just like a Count Dracula. I mean, folks, dressing him up in a black
[25:12.280 --> 25:17.240]  cape with red inside, he got Count Dracula. Come on, he's ready to star right now in movies.
[25:17.240 --> 25:22.920]  Okay, I'm going to shut up right there. Here's the big news. The global meltdown is accelerating.
[25:22.920 --> 25:26.360]  I got a big stack of incredible news. Gold is almost 1,800 an ounce right now.
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.520]  And Turkey, that for nine months on record, has injected more than 50,000 Saudi Arabian,
[25:34.520 --> 25:43.080]  Pakistani, Afghan, and of course, North African jihadis, Wahhabist, to slaughter
[25:43.080 --> 25:48.120]  Christians, Jews, and Muslim minority groups. I mean, it's on record. They're blowing up the most
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.520]  ancient markets in the world. I mean, world heritage sites, they're blowing up churches,
[25:52.520 --> 25:57.000]  they're throwing people off roofs, they're beheading people, they're making fathers,
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.240]  car bomb people, or they kill their whole family. They show up, they line your daughters and sons
[26:01.240 --> 26:04.280]  up in your wife, and then this is on record. And they say, we're going to kill them if you don't
[26:04.280 --> 26:08.760]  get in that truck and go drive it into the police department. They had five bombings yesterday,
[26:08.760 --> 26:14.200]  three more suicide bombings today, and our media is like these suicide bombers are heroes.
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.440]  Our media is like they're fighting Assad. I mean, meanwhile, these are family people.
[26:19.320 --> 26:26.120]  The jihadis have victims driving these bombs in. Just come out in the news. I mean, this is so
[26:26.120 --> 26:32.520]  immoral, so evil, and they can only do it because the American people cannot find Syria on a map.
[26:32.520 --> 26:38.200]  What is it? 20% of Americans have a passport. They've done studies every year with university
[26:38.200 --> 26:44.200]  graduates. Most of them can't find Australia on a unmarked map. They give them world maps with
[26:44.200 --> 26:50.280]  the countries cut out, and they don't show the name. They can't find Australia folks. Many people
[26:50.280 --> 26:57.720]  don't know their state capital. The government runs al-Qaeda to overthrow Libya, to engage in
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.160]  black genocide, to sexually mutilate women, put burkas on their heads, blow up the colleges.
[27:03.160 --> 27:09.800]  Any Muslim country that is truly progressive by, quote, modernizing and empowering its people,
[27:09.800 --> 27:14.840]  the globalists put the Saudis in, and it's over. And I'm not even attacking the Sunnis.
[27:14.840 --> 27:19.880]  It's a radical group of Sunnis that the globalists run that British intelligence set up a hundred
[27:19.880 --> 27:25.160]  years ago. And it's all on record, but people are like, what's Saudi Arabia? I just know brown
[27:25.160 --> 27:32.360]  people are over there, so the TSA has got to grab my wife's breast. I mean, it is so crazy,
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.480]  ladies and gentlemen, that for five years, the State Department admits Bush signed an executive
[27:37.480 --> 27:42.360]  order, Obama expanded it. They've had four different al-Qaeda groups and a Kurdish group
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.280]  blowing up military bases, blowing up bridges, blowing up power plants, sabotaging dams,
[27:48.280 --> 27:55.800]  machine gunning people at checkpoints, causing riots, mass killings, and now it leads to chemical
[27:55.800 --> 28:04.520]  plants getting blown up, missile bases being blown up, military bases being blown up.
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.400]  They're clearly dropping 2,000-pound bombs out of B-2 bombers on them. If you look at the wreckage,
[28:09.400 --> 28:15.160]  these aren't car bombs, a lot of them. That's in Iran. The war started five years ago, and Curtin
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.480]  Mo and I went and got mainline articles where they admit, well, you know, the war is already on.
[28:19.480 --> 28:25.880]  People keep asking, when's the Iran war going to start? The CFR says it started last fall, just
[28:25.880 --> 28:31.720]  like I said, they were going into a hot phase. It's a hot phase when they got 50,000 shihadis,
[28:31.720 --> 28:37.320]  according to the Associated Press out of Turkey alone, massing there at U.S. controlled bases,
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.920]  infiltrating into the border. So what does the Russians backing the Syrians do? And I'm not
[28:42.920 --> 28:46.680]  for the Russians of the Syrian government. The point is, they're being attacked. They're not
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.880]  one-tenth as bad as al-Qaeda. So I'm against this war. I'm against it because it's an offensive,
[28:51.880 --> 28:56.840]  premeditated attack, just like I'm against, even if your neighbor's not a nice guy,
[28:56.840 --> 28:59.880]  going over and beating him in the head with a lead pipe when he's got his back turned.
[29:00.440 --> 29:07.640]  Assault preemptively without someone aggressing at you is out of control. And Syria, the young
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.800]  Assad has tried to work with the West, just like Qaddafi came and invested all the country's money,
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.560]  led in Western companies, said, I'm against al-Qaeda. I'm against the, they set him up, folks,
[29:17.560 --> 29:22.200]  and stole the Libyan people's money. It's over 50, $60 billion last time I checked.
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.240]  So they double-crossed him. When we get back, we're going to break this down, folks. The whole
[29:27.240 --> 29:31.960]  Middle East is going up in flames. Right as the world economy melts down, we're going to get into
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.720]  that. All of this on time. What happens when they start collapsing the world currencies
[29:37.720 --> 29:42.600]  and the world reserve currency, the dollar, they start a war as a political diversion.
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.480]  And it's starting to happen. And the average American won't even know there's a war.
[29:49.400 --> 29:56.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.520]  Sick of the globalist, eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you

[30:59.400 --> 31:05.160]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans
[31:05.160 --> 31:09.560]  are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy homecrafted
[31:09.560 --> 31:13.800]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir. It seems there's a war on
[31:13.800 --> 31:18.280]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not sure what the food
[31:18.280 --> 31:22.200]  police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[31:22.200 --> 31:26.280]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in
[31:26.280 --> 31:31.000]  almost every culture. Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges,
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.160]  Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[31:35.160 --> 31:38.760]  But here's some good news. South Berlin Americans can now discover the secrets to
[31:38.760 --> 31:42.840]  making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes. Since it's
[31:42.840 --> 31:46.680]  still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information,
[31:46.680 --> 31:53.160]  check out fermentationfactor.com. It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods,
[31:53.160 --> 31:59.720]  and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.

[33:49.320 --> 33:56.280]  And simulcasting on XM-166, as well as number one podcast for radio talk show
[33:56.920 --> 34:03.080]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Just go to the listen section and find the live streams,
[34:03.080 --> 34:10.040]  the video streams, and also the podcast as well. Again, thank you so much for joining us on this
[34:10.040 --> 34:20.600]  live edition. Okay, where to start? Because there is so much news and information to get to today.
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.160]  I want to get into economic news here in about 10 minutes.
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.600]  But first off, let me get back into what's happening and just put it in very calm terms.
[34:34.600 --> 34:44.040]  We are told that we should give up all of our rights and have everything we do be tracked by the NSA
[34:44.040 --> 34:51.640]  illegally because Al Qaeda is imminently about to murder all of us. We get the official government
[34:51.640 --> 34:57.240]  training manuals and they say that the Homeland Security is really for the American people,
[34:57.240 --> 35:02.520]  gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, landowners, private property holders,
[35:02.520 --> 35:07.400]  but number one returning veterans says they're terrorist. The manuals badmouth Thomas Jefferson
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.280]  and George Washington. Don't believe it, just type in government anti-terror manuals, badmouth
[35:12.280 --> 35:16.280]  founding fathers. You'll get probably 20 different ones, video clips of them teaching it to police,
[35:16.280 --> 35:22.040]  you name it. The cops nodding their heads. I mean, it's all about authority. The federal
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.880]  God says anything pro-America is bad, anything that you would expect to see in Soviet Russia,
[35:27.880 --> 35:34.040]  or Nazi Germany, or communist China, or communist Cuba, anything authoritarian, it's good and called
[35:34.040 --> 35:41.240]  security. Anything that's basic freedom is called bad and extreme. The new army manual that
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.680]  for army intelligence operating domestically that Wired Magazine reported on a few days ago
[35:47.960 --> 35:54.200]  says if you don't trust the government or you think mainline ideologies are a fraud, you are a
[35:54.200 --> 36:01.480]  terrorist. I mean, imagine a movie 50 years ago, a science fiction movie, we're in the future in
[36:01.480 --> 36:10.920]  America, children, hands scanned to buy and sell, cameras watch you in the bathroom, publicly there
[36:10.920 --> 36:16.840]  are government documents where they put cancer viruses in the vaccines, and world governments
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.080]  being announced run by foreign banks. You'd say, man, that'll never happen. That's a crazy movie.
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.920]  And now they're just getting started. So here's the deal. We're told we got to end our freedom for
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.400]  quote, security, which is really the insecurity of a tyranny because of al-Qaeda. And then,
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.880]  meanwhile, our so-called government, which brags it's been taken over by foreign banks,
[36:35.880 --> 36:41.720]  the army and Navy War College, Professor Thomas Barnett on C-SPAN lecturing to the war colleges,
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.800]  says the military works for foreign banks and Wall Street. I mean, it's not debated. They
[36:47.800 --> 36:54.440]  brag everywhere that they've conquered us. They put their boot on our chest, spit in our face,
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.440]  tell us we're slaves, announce world government. And if we say, I don't want to be under your
[36:58.440 --> 37:03.080]  unelected world government, they go, hey, ADL, Southern Barbie Law Center, we got a racist here.
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.840]  Yeah, there's no world government run by banks. And if you say it, you are racist.
[37:09.400 --> 37:12.680]  And if you don't like government health care, you're a racist or, I mean,
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.600]  yeah, this is what it's come down to now. And they only get away with it because the
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.320]  general public does not know which end is up. Not because they're inherently stupid,
[37:24.280 --> 37:29.880]  but because they've been raised as spectators to just watch TV, entertain themselves,
[37:29.880 --> 37:33.960]  they're decadent. And they've been poisoned so the IQ's lowered somewhat, but still,
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.240]  they can get it. But they are so lazy, they have a cognitive dissidence,
[37:39.240 --> 37:49.240]  learned helplessness, Stockholm syndrome, response, normalcy bias, where they attack.
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.880]  We were like, hey, there's certain checkpoints up down the highway with the TSA that they're
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.200]  not even sworn officers. Plus, it's a 10th Amendment violation states rights and it's a violation
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.880]  of the 4th Amendment too. It's very dangerous. Dangerous third world countries have checkpoints
[38:03.880 --> 38:10.040]  and they're like, oh, Jack conspiracy theorist, see when the TSA has told people on video,
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.400]  you've seen the videos, that when they're being groped, hey, I don't like you grab my genitals.
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.920]  Oh, what's wrong conspiracy theorist? See now, even having a view and saying,
[38:20.120 --> 38:28.040]  I like red sauce on my linguine instead of cream sauce. Oh, we're serving cream sauce.
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.840]  And if you don't like that, you're a conspiracy theorist. See now, having any opinion,
[38:32.840 --> 38:38.760]  you're supposed to just be told what the new reality is as Carl Rove told the New York Times
[38:38.760 --> 38:43.080]  and Washington Post at a cocktail party. If you've never read the quotes, just type in
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.040]  Carl Rove history's actors. They'll give you the full quote where he says,
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.440]  it doesn't matter what reality is, we'll just tell you what the new reality is day to day
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.880]  and you will do to flee report on it because we control reality now. Is that clear?
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.560]  And you're supposed to turn and go, okay, so I'm supposed to get my rights up because of al-Qaeda,
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.560]  but then our government founded al-Qaeda, runs al-Qaeda, still runs al-Qaeda,
[39:07.560 --> 39:13.160]  and is turning al-Qaeda loose to go in and just murder Muslim minority groups,
[39:13.160 --> 39:20.040]  Christians, Jews, blowing up churches, throwing fathers, Christians off bridges and houses in
[39:20.040 --> 39:27.000]  churches, desecrating churches, desecrating crosses, dressing up in orthodox priest robes,
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.680]  defecating on the altar, blowing up things, murdering people and Turkey and,
[39:37.560 --> 39:42.040]  well, they've got jihadi infiltrators out of Iraq that the West is sending in,
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.000]  they're sending them out of Turkey and out of Jordan that they're sending in over into Turkey,
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.040]  and it's all on record and the Council on Foreign Relations says al-Qaeda is good now,
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.080]  and we quote, need al-Qaeda, that was two months ago, and they've been attacking for nine months,
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.640]  and they're blowing up the ancient churches and ancient synagogues and ancient mosques,
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.000]  and they're blowing up the ancient, burning down the ancient giant,
[40:05.800 --> 40:09.720]  oldest grocery store in the world's been blown up, totally blown up and burned,
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.880]  and they're just murdering from all sides and Turkey is now shelling Syria.
[40:13.880 --> 40:23.160]  And I'm supposed to get behind al-Qaeda because the government now says, you know,
[40:23.160 --> 40:30.040]  that Syria is a bad guy, and al-Qaeda has said they're going to kill all Jews and expel all
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.960]  Christians, and then now I'm anti-Semitic if I don't want them to kill all the Jews,
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.880]  I mean, it's just the dog-gondous thing because the public doesn't know where Syria is,
[40:41.880 --> 40:47.800]  the public doesn't know anything, and we're going to get hurt so bad, folks.
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.840]  The global is 12 years ago, it was in Bloomberg and AP, took all the death benefits of U.S. troops
[40:52.840 --> 40:55.960]  from World War II through today, they've been paying their whole life to a death benefit,
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.400]  they died the widow, it's nothing. They're now taking private bank accounts everywhere and
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.240]  giving it to mega banks and courts are ruling, they can do it. Folks, we're in trouble,
[41:05.240 --> 41:08.840]  they intend to enforce all this at the barrel of a gun, as Mao Zedong said,
[41:08.840 --> 41:13.240]  political power goes out of the barrel of a gun. We've been conquered by foreign ruthless banks,
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.240]  whose ideology is population reduction. Look at these headlines,
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.720]  war with Iran started five years ago, infoawards.com, assault on Syria matches
[41:21.720 --> 41:27.400]  Brookings Institution regime change strategy, leaked World Bank demographer, vaccination campaign,
[41:27.400 --> 41:34.120]  part of population reduction policy, and it's all admitted how the vaccines are killing and
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.000]  sterilizing people with their admissions. Oh, look, they're admitting they're killing us with
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.720]  this, they have Bill Gates admitting it on video, and it's like, oh, sure, that would be on the news
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.920]  if it was true. Is it on the news that your five-year-old just got diagnosed with cancer?
[41:52.200 --> 41:56.840]  You're 30 years old, you just married a 26-year-old woman, you love her, she just got diagnosed with
[41:56.840 --> 42:01.960]  what, colon cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, which is it? Your 35-year-old husband just got
[42:01.960 --> 42:06.200]  diagnosed with lung cancer, doesn't smoke, folks, they're murdering us. You think they're just going
[42:06.200 --> 42:12.840]  to murder the Syrians or murder the Iraqis or murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder,
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.840]  all, the whole world is under attack, soft kill, covert operations, the government ships in drugs
[42:18.840 --> 42:25.800]  on record, it's pure evil. And now they're gearing up to start these big wars. People ask, why are
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.080]  you still on the air then? Because they think you're so stupid this doesn't even matter.
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.440]  But they're not as arrogant as to know if they start rounding everybody up now, it may backfire on
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.280]  them. They want to get big wars and financial collapse in place first and have crime rates
[42:40.280 --> 42:46.680]  explode and society degenerates so you beg for people to be shut down before they go ahead with it.
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.240]  They want a UN law, you can't criticize anybody or any religion, that's all being promoted right now.
[42:53.240 --> 42:59.080]  So here's the headlines, Turkish artillery strikes on Syria continue for second day,
[42:59.080 --> 43:06.120]  Harats. Oh Alex, you're fear-mongering, where are the new wars? I don't know, Libya, Syria, Pakistan,
[43:06.120 --> 43:13.080]  Iran, blowing up old military bases, Strait of Hormuz, the navies of 20 plus countries all
[43:13.080 --> 43:18.920]  massing. I don't know, I mean, they tell us the recession ended four years ago, but every
[43:18.920 --> 43:23.560]  private metric, shadow, statue, name it says we've been in a depression for four years. They're just
[43:23.560 --> 43:28.760]  rioting all over Europe, raiding grocery stores, they've got riots all over the US,
[43:29.400 --> 43:34.760]  malls being taken over, gas stations being taken over, but the media keeps it, you know,
[43:34.760 --> 43:40.440]  quiet so it's not a big deal. 60,000 dead on the US-Mexico border the last five years.
[43:40.440 --> 43:45.080]  Oh, Mexico's not in a depression, it's a nice place, go vacation. They've learned if they don't
[43:45.080 --> 43:49.720]  call something a war, it's not a war. They don't call something a depression, it's not a depression.
[43:49.720 --> 43:58.440]  They play semantical games with you. You got almost 50 million people on food stamps, over 160
[43:58.440 --> 44:06.840]  million people on welfare one way or the other. Can you imagine the Great Depression, 49 million
[44:07.480 --> 44:13.480]  people in soup kitchen lines every day? That image, well now they just get cards,
[44:13.480 --> 44:19.400]  it's all being launched to bring in the world government and the world government is being
[44:19.400 --> 44:29.000]  announced right now. Voice of America, Turkey strikes Syria. Turkey authorizes military action in
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  Syria after a mortar attack to kill civilians. They've got infiltrating and they're there with
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.240]  the Russian troops that's confirmed now they killed that Russian general. It's a proxy war.
[44:39.240 --> 44:47.640]  US and NATO and Israeli and Turkish trained jihadi al-Qaeda people with black al-Qaeda flags,
[44:47.640 --> 44:55.480]  black uniforms. They make up at least half the fighters are infiltrating the border and so the
[44:55.480 --> 45:02.200]  Russians and the Syrians are there battling them and now Syria has got big guns up lining up and
[45:02.200 --> 45:09.640]  Turkey has got big guns lined up firing into Syria right now. Boom, boom, boom. Oh, that's not a war.
[45:10.760 --> 45:17.320]  Where's the war, Alex? Where is it? You've got to go read Kurt Nemo's article with Alex Jones.
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.760]  I contributed to it. War with Iran started five years ago. You've got to go read this.
[45:22.760 --> 45:26.440]  I'll cover it after I get into the debate news and economic news, but it's on.
[45:26.440 --> 45:33.400]  It's on, man. Turkey attempts to trigger war with Syria. Attempts to trigger it? I mean,
[45:33.400 --> 45:39.160]  it's on. They're attacking them. See, now they didn't call Korea a war, so it wasn't a war,
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.160]  but we just lose. How many tens of thousands of troops would be losing Korea? It was like
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.320]  a hundred thousand or something? That's not a war because, hey, Obama's a peace prize winner.
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.160]  That attack on Libya, that wasn't a war. Forty plus thousand deaths, not a war.
[45:51.160 --> 45:57.960]  Turkey's prime minister office says Turkish artillery fired on Syria, firing continues.
[45:57.960 --> 46:02.680]  Assault on Syria matches Brookings Institute regime change. Al Qaeda responsible for four
[46:02.680 --> 46:06.360]  attacks on U.S. embassies in September, but our government runs Al Qaeda.
[46:09.560 --> 46:15.000]  Meanwhile, they've got admitted attacks, military, you name it, blowing up major buildings every week
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.440]  in Iran, and that's not war. Here's the economic news, and we're going to get more into this with
[46:22.440 --> 46:29.560]  Ted Anderson right now. Weekly job claims edge higher, progress still slight, CNBC orders to
[46:29.560 --> 46:34.920]  U.S. factories plunge on airplanes, computers, refinery problems in California gas prices,
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.640]  skyrocketing to $4.15. Fed easing, no, it's dollar devaluation and speculation. Fed easing has little
[46:41.640 --> 46:48.680]  impact so far. Fed out of bullets. Portugal announces enormous tax rises. Spain after tax hikes,
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.880]  revenue tumbles, CNBC, they know when they raise taxes, revenue tumbles. That's the plan.
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.760]  You think California didn't know when they raised taxes two years ago wouldn't plunge everything?
[46:58.760 --> 47:04.520]  They want to plunge it. Economic warfare, warnings that massive stock market crashes imminent.
[47:04.520 --> 47:10.520]  Michael Snyder, economic collapse blog at infowars.com. U.S. added more debt Monday than there was
[47:10.520 --> 47:18.360]  from 1776 through Pearl Harbor. New privacy fears as Facebook begins selling personal access to
[47:18.360 --> 47:24.520]  companies to boost ailing profits. A rare occurrence in the Saudi currency market tells
[47:24.520 --> 47:27.960]  you that trouble is brewing in the Middle East. Brewing? How about it's exploded?
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.840]  Like you walk in and your teenage daughter, you know, 16-year-old daughter is in bed with five
[47:34.840 --> 47:42.440]  guys. You think she might be going a little wild? It's like coming home and your teenage
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.600]  son's got heroin needles jammed in his arm. You think Billy might be in a little trouble?
[47:48.680 --> 47:54.520]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up here. Ted, gold's what's almost gone up to 1800 a day.
[47:55.720 --> 47:59.080]  They're saying quantitative easing's behind that. Unlimited quantitative easing,
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.880]  80 plus billion a month given to the private banks. The banks are announcing record profits
[48:03.880 --> 48:08.920]  again off our tax money. We've got to pay back. But the media says we're lazy and that taxpayers
[48:08.920 --> 48:12.840]  need to pay more. And Romney said last night, hey, I'm not going to cut a bunch of taxes
[48:13.400 --> 48:19.160]  to Obama. So there you go. If they slash taxes, revenue would explode. But Kennedy cut the one
[48:19.160 --> 48:24.360]  tax bracket by 50 percent. The other tax bracket by 35. Tax receipts more than doubled. Why can't
[48:24.360 --> 48:31.560]  they do what JFK did, Ted Anderson? Well, you know, reducing taxes does raise revenue for the
[48:31.560 --> 48:36.680]  government. But it's political suicide plus also like you, I believe that they're trying to drive
[48:36.680 --> 48:43.320]  this thing right through the floor. It's getting so obvious now it's not even funny. This morning,
[48:43.320 --> 48:50.040]  when I started looking at gold, gold hit $1,800 an ounce in Europe in the futures market.
[48:50.040 --> 49:02.600]  So far today, the spot price of gold, 1796-20 at its high. I mean, it's melting apart. Mario
[49:02.600 --> 49:09.560]  Draghi, the president of the central bank in Europe, started talking about the $367,000
[49:10.360 --> 49:16.040]  jobless claim in the United States that was just announced. And the gold prices just started to
[49:16.040 --> 49:22.040]  rise like crazy. Germany right now is considering a gold standard to get away from the United States'
[49:22.040 --> 49:29.320]  inflation. You know, right now we're in this QE-4 or QE-3 and we're just driving the value
[49:29.320 --> 49:33.720]  of our currency right through the floor. The way that they describe it is, here's how they say it,
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.840]  is as gold as money according to the Dutch bank says it would go further. However, to argue that
[49:38.840 --> 49:44.840]  it could be characterized as good money as opposed to bad money, which would be represented by many
[49:44.840 --> 49:49.960]  of today's fiat currencies. And then he's talking about good money, leaving the countries and
[49:49.960 --> 49:56.680]  disappearing into hordes while the bad money comes in by the bucket falls.
[49:56.680 --> 50:04.040]  Exactly. Translate that, Ted. The elite are buying gold, farmland, firearm stocks, military stocks,
[50:04.840 --> 50:10.120]  and exiting basically everything else, raw material stocks, but exiting everything else
[50:10.120 --> 50:16.040]  while they pump the world with devalued crud because they know what the effect's going to be,
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.920]  hyperinflation. Oh, absolutely. You can see all the central banks moving into gold and you can
[50:20.920 --> 50:25.720]  see all the elite. As a matter of fact, George Soros himself has been moving into gold. The people
[50:25.720 --> 50:31.480]  who know what's going on are getting into gold. Then they're telling the general people, the
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.640]  common folk, you know, you stick with the money, stick with the currencies, stay away from gold
[50:35.640 --> 50:40.760]  and silver. It's not good for you. It's only good for us. Let me tell you something. We're like
[50:40.760 --> 50:46.920]  sitting on the Titanic and the captain is saying, hey, Mayday, put on a life preserver. We're going
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.520]  down. That's what's happening in the end. And the bankers are saying, you don't want to get in that
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.520]  live boat. You stay over there. We're getting in it, but you don't get in it. You're like,
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.040]  but you're getting in it. That's a conspiracy theory. Yes, I'm getting in it. Conspiracy.
[50:58.040 --> 51:02.680]  We just stand and go, okay, conspiracy. Conspiracy. And full in here, as the food police shut down
[51:02.680 --> 51:07.640]  food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.880]  homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut,
[51:11.880 --> 51:16.280]  yogurt and kefir. It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy
[51:16.280 --> 51:20.760]  bacteria. But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods
[51:20.760 --> 51:24.520]  have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.920]  and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture. Even today, Japanese eat
[51:28.920 --> 51:34.360]  miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple
[51:34.360 --> 51:38.360]  for healthy living. But here's some good news. Self-Reliant Americans can now discover the
[51:38.360 --> 51:42.760]  secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes. Since
[51:42.760 --> 51:46.680]  it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information,

[54:15.160 --> 54:21.880]  break that down, take your phone calls. We'll continue with other world news and incredible
[54:21.880 --> 54:27.720]  big brother and population reduction vaccine poisoning news, big breaking news there.
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.760]  Kurt Nemo's article is up at infowars.com. Kurt Nemo, Alex Jones. War with Iran started five years
[54:34.760 --> 54:43.640]  ago, but then it breaks down how the wider hot war is just slowly escalating in front of us.
[54:43.640 --> 54:50.360]  But it's like if you have a gas top stove like I do, and it goes from one to ten,
[54:50.360 --> 54:55.720]  one is simmer, ten is on full flame. Yeah, five years ago it was on one flame,
[54:56.920 --> 55:03.000]  and then four years ago it was on three flames, and then two years ago it was on five, six flames.
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.200]  It's now up to like seven, eight flames, and they're turning it up. People are like,
[55:08.200 --> 55:14.200]  where's the war? I don't know. Thrones bombing everybody, huge proxy wars, Turkey shelling,
[55:14.200 --> 55:20.120]  Syria, US troops, they're masked. I've got family in the military, all been sent over to the Middle
[55:20.120 --> 55:27.880]  East, all get ready for a huge war. It's already going on, and it's happening right as all Hades
[55:27.880 --> 55:33.800]  breaks loose. Now, I got Ted up here, obviously, was 30-plus years in gold and silver, 15-plus
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.640]  with Midas Resources. I just bought some gold and silver from Ted just Monday, and I'm not selling
[55:39.640 --> 55:43.560]  the gold, I bought it 300 bucks an ounce, and I'm not selling the silver, I bought it five bucks
[55:43.560 --> 55:49.000]  an ounce from Midas Resources 12 years ago, and I know it's a steal at the price I'm getting it,
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.640]  in my view, because I know global devaluation is accelerating. There's a pitch here, it doesn't
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.600]  really support the network, it's a lost leader, but you can get two silver dollars of just a
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.720]  beautiful make, Ted can tell you about that, for 72 dollars, that's at cost, Ted bought them when they
[56:03.720 --> 56:08.520]  were lower, so that's how I can do that now. With Obama Deception, American Dream Film,
[56:08.520 --> 56:11.640]  exposing the Federal Reserve and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, incredible,
[56:11.640 --> 56:18.280]  and Dishonest Money, an amazing book that we also sell for $19.95 at infowars.com, that's free,
[56:18.280 --> 56:25.160]  two films and a book for free, free with the two silver dollars, so go check that out at
[56:25.160 --> 56:31.320]  minusresources.com, or there's a banner on infowars.com. Ted, I mean, the point is people
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.560]  need to get into golden silver, in my view, and I mean, I only promote what I believe in,
[56:35.560 --> 56:38.840]  that's one reason we're so popular, is I promoted things that have been successful,
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.840]  because I do my research, what I do, I tell people to do, I mean that's win win win,
[56:42.840 --> 56:49.080]  that's what a Christian does, but expanding on this, I know that you've sold out of most
[56:49.080 --> 56:54.840]  the golden silver you bought months ago, so what's the silver and gold at price-wise,
[56:54.840 --> 56:59.800]  I know that's how you pass on these savings to people, for what it is today, and when are your
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.880]  prices going up, and briefly, because we're about to go to break, order some of the gold and silver,
[57:03.880 --> 57:09.240]  super radio specials, people can call 800-686-2237 and get.
[57:10.680 --> 57:17.240]  Well, I mean, obviously the best deal I have is the one that you described, $72 gets you a book,
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.400]  two videos, two silver dollars, and you're not going to beat that anywhere, I mean,
[57:21.400 --> 57:25.640]  cryin' all out, you can't buy the two silver dollars for that anymore, price of silver's
[57:25.640 --> 57:33.000]  gone up to $35 plus an ounce now, so you're just, they're not available, but we do have many other
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  great offers, and right now, presently, you can pick up the Frank coin at 388,
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.360]  the walking Liberty half, very affordable, one of my favorites for everyone out there, 1707,
[57:45.160 --> 57:49.160]  we have the Lakota Nation coin, people still love that, it's at $43,
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.560]  there's just a lot of things, some of you are very concerned about gold confiscation,
[57:53.560 --> 58:00.440]  it's a controversial issue, I realize, but we still, we carry the $20 Liberty's at $21.54,
[58:00.440 --> 58:05.080]  for those of you who like the bullion, which I love as well, currently, right now, the Canadian
[58:05.080 --> 58:12.120]  Maple Leaf is at $19.57. I bought buffaloes and pesos, as you know, Ted, I like Mexican
[58:12.120 --> 58:16.760]  pesos, it's the most gorgeous coin I've ever seen, but I just bought some buffaloes, and again,
[58:16.760 --> 58:20.680]  those are non confiscatable under the different rulings, and that's why it's important.
[58:21.240 --> 58:25.000]  Yo, Ted, stay there, I want you to explain, confiscatable versus non confiscatable,
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.440]  people like, oh, come on, they're not gonna confiscate again, oh really, they confiscated
[58:28.440 --> 58:32.760]  it from my great-grandpa in 1933, of course, he didn't turn it in, because he was a Texan
[58:32.760 --> 58:37.880]  and an American, and a lot of other sheep did, but now it's actually starting, we'll be right back.
[58:37.880 --> 58:47.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.280 --> 58:53.960]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative,
[58:53.960 --> 58:58.520]  but not all silver is equal. Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically
[58:58.520 --> 59:03.160]  shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers. It can destroy
[59:03.160 --> 59:07.320]  thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology. Silver Soul resonates at
[59:07.320 --> 59:12.040]  the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling
[59:12.040 --> 59:16.680]  it to kill without direct contact. Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.720]  resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use. It can be used
[59:21.720 --> 59:25.880]  internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds,
[59:25.880 --> 59:31.000]  and yeasts. With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation,
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.720]  arm yourself with supernatural silver. Silver Soul liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go
[59:35.720 --> 59:39.240]  emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:17.080]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.440]  All right. Coming up, I'm going to give the post-debate breakdown, which is one of the most
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.080]  historical debates we've had in recent history. I mean, it is too globalist puppets, but they
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.360]  are battling each other over the levers of spoils, over the goody goods of looting the
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.400]  American people and bringing us into the New World Order. They are fighting over who can
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.200]  rearrange deck chairs on the proverbial Titanic. So that is coming up and your phone calls will
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.320]  give the number out in the next segment. But going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, we were getting
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.600]  into a plug here for gold and silver. I mean, I'm surprised. I mean, I know you've sold thousands
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.880]  of them the last few weeks, two silver dollars for 72 dollars. You can't even buy those in the
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.040]  market to up for that with two free films in a book. I mean, that's, that's joke level good,
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.280]  Ted. I mean, I feel so good promoting that. How long until you have to go up on that?
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.720]  I know you went up a few weeks ago from 63 to 72. How long, Ted?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.360]  Well, I'm going to hold on on this one as long as I can, Alex. It'll probably be sometime this
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.080]  weekend. I'm guessing that gold will hit over $1,800 an ounce here very soon. Silver will be encroaching
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.200]  $40 an ounce. I'm simply not going to be able to sell two silver dollars, give away all these other
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:45.720]  goodies for 72 dollars delivered when the shipping alone is, you know, it's $6.50. I mean, it,
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.040]  but it does educate the people. It's a great way to get new people started with precious metals.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.360]  Uh, like you say, it's a loss leader, but I think it's more than a loss leader. I mean,
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.960]  it's always been my intention to educate the people, get people informed, understand the fiat
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.640]  system. That's why it's so geared toward that. Your Obama deception video is great. Uh, that,
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.240]  that book by Joe Plummer, the dishonest money is right on target. I mean, I, you know, it's just
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.360]  one of those ways for me to get the information out. And so we'll be holding it until this weekend.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:24.840]  But if you want to get involved, uh, let me tell you something at, at $40 an ounce silver,
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.000]  I'm not going to be able to sell two silver dollars for 72 bucks put in two videos and a book. It's
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.800]  just not possible. I would be out of business. I'd be broke and you'd have to go find it somewhere
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.480]  else. So yeah, no, it's going to have, it's going to have to go up. I'm going to hold it through
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.600]  this weekend for sure. Eight hundred, eight hundred, six, eight, six, two, two, three, seven.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.320]  Uh, now, now, now, now, I mean, again, briefly explain to people, Ted, the difference, uh,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:55.240]  between confiscatable gold and non confiscatable. I mean, I got the non confiscatable, uh, U.S.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.520]  Mint stuff just because I know it's so popular and it was so close to melt, uh, at the deals you have.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.160]  Well, what people don't realize is that the government plays a lot of games. I mean, you,
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  you can buy a U.S. gold eagle and not have to worry about the 60, 45 ruling and not have to
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.880]  give up a social security number and get a 1099 form when you're selling on a Krugerrand and a
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.760]  Maple Leaf. You do have to do that. Bags of junk silver. You have to give up the, the social
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.040]  security number, but if you buy mercury dimes, you don't have to. It's just this, this crazy game
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.760]  that the United States government plays trying to influence one over the other and so on and so
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:37.320]  forth. Confiscation happened in 1933. Anybody that's trying to tell you that it didn't is lying
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:44.200]  to you. Franklin D. Roosevelt closed the gold window and confiscated gold on a Monday. He got
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.920]  into office on a Friday, but now we're seeing those coins being confiscated. What are the ones
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.160]  they're grabbing that when they find people with them, the ones from 1933 that are worth millions
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:01.160]  a piece? There's another example of confiscation. It brings it right back to date. The 1933 coin
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.200]  was never issued. So somebody had some of those coins. So obviously somehow they got out of the
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:12.040]  mint. The dummy who had the coins went back to the mint and said, hey, are these authentic?
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.240]  And then they confiscated from the guy. This happened recently. I mean, they confiscated
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:23.640]  the silver from the people that were, that were trading the Norfed dollars and, and, and, you
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.120]  know, it's incredible. Eight hundred six, eight, six, two, three, seven. The brokers, there are
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.280]  great guys and ladies that can answer all your questions, but tell them the Alex Jones radio
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.920]  special. That is the absolute secret loss leader stuff. You've got to have that, not just radio
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:45.400]  special. Alex Jones radio is the crime, not a crime, wide spectrum of the best deals you're
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.200]  getting the deals. I get when you ask for that, ladies and gentlemen, eight hundred six, eight,
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.240]  six, two, three, seven for the loss leaders. All right. Thank you so much. Ted Anderson will get
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:01.960]  more updates with you. Gold surging towards 1800 owned ounce sick of the globalist. You Genesis

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.640]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.400]  to that article coming up in the next hour ahead of former governor of new mexico and
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.720]  libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson coming i'll get his take on the debate that he's
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.920]  suing to be led into in the the next debates that are coming up i got a bunch of clips here
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.960]  from last night's debate and i was walking out of the office last night and david or tease one
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.360]  of our great reporters said you're gonna watch the debate tonight and i said no i don't watch the
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.720]  debates i'll read a transcript tomorrow night i'll probably watch gilligan's island with my
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.040]  children if i do watch any tv that's what we watch is like gun smoke or gilligan's island we do let
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:29.560]  him watch tv every once in a while after dinner but as he said you know for some reason i want to
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.440]  watch this transcripts you know are great and i watch highlights sometimes and play them here
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:42.120]  obviously i have the crew watching it so i don't have to it's like but the reason i read is i can
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:47.000]  get it done a lot faster than watching it and all the propaganda it's so disgusting you know the
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.560]  all the canned responses all of it but but here's my bottom line within within a minute
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.160]  or two of the debate beginning you can go to twitter.com forward slash real elec shones
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:07.320]  and notice i said obama looks impotent flat he's in trouble i mean he looked like he was on a
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:18.520]  couple volumes and uh the bottom line was he did not like having someone question him because after
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.320]  four years or almost four years as el presidente he's just everybody stepping and fetching and
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:30.520]  running around behind him and the fact that romney was glaring at him and smiling at him on purpose
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.560]  i mean even if you're a confident person having somebody stare right at you and and romney's got
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.720]  quite a presence that whole good boy swede pie act is a total cover that's a corporate snake right
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.000]  there you turn your back on him he'll stick it in like my wife called him he's a charming vampire
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.680]  count Dracula my parents uh you know have the same take on romney my kids have the same take
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:00.040]  my kids thought that uh you know obama was creepy uh they thought romney was sneaky uh but i mean
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:11.480]  that's basically what was happening obama was dominated and obama uh basically does not want
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.680]  to be questioned and obama cannot stand being questioned because he's a narcissist and an
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.880]  ego maniac and i was tweeting within minutes hey he's losing this is going to be big this is going
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.960]  to be a game changer and people are like oh now you're taking partisan sides no i mean if i see a
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.720]  mac truck run into a volts wagon and i say man that mac truck crushed that volts wagon the mac
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:40.920]  truck was barely dented it's not that i'm for the mac truck i'm just reporting on what happened
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:48.280]  i'm just reporting on the facts now the vegas books i've got some articles on that uh the habitual
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:56.360]  gamblers gamblers who have uh a compulsion to bet all the time 24 seven on event outcomes have
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:03.560]  already spoken via their favorite venture in trade an initial reaction is the favorable for
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:10.520]  is unfavorable and is not favorable for the incumbent that's what zero hedge reports and uh
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:20.360]  the bookies are saying that that debate did not bode well for el presidente obama
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:31.720]  so that's what's going on on that front right now um this was a total implosion for obama
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.920]  and i don't think he can handle it i don't think he can handle romney getting in his face like that
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.240]  and laughing at him you know i've noticed the tsa and others whenever they get our videos banned
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.800]  on youtube or whenever they come after us and other government groups it's when we make fun of them
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.960]  and we talk about how they're criminals they're dangerous they're evil they're sinister they
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.840]  love it when you laugh at them and when romney said hey you know my sons like to repeat things
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.040]  that aren't true over and over again when they were kids but it doesn't change the facts uh obama
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.160]  got really mad uh lear who looked like he has parkinsons and other things parkinsons patients
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.360]  but was was was doddering must be drinking too much diet coke or something you know it's it's
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.080]  been linked to that aspartame poisoning uh he was doddering up there and and i was timing it
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:23.640]  partway into it obama was just dominating and taking two three minutes more than he was supposed
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:30.600]  to get uh interrupting uh you name it so even though lair news hour funded by the government
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:35.800]  romney said he'd get rid of uh government funding for that even though there was an obvious bias
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:43.080]  there it did not work and that's why i read at the start of the show scores of of la times
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:50.840]  washington post new york times uh al gore christ matthews all saying it was a devastating
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.520]  route for obama and he better get back in there and attack well romney needs to do that too
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.080]  but again they're so close to each other you notice lair kept saying now what makes you
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.880]  too different because this is the establishment once they're to look like there's a difference so you
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.760]  feel like you've actually got a choice here but but just looking at the propaganda spectacle
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:19.640]  itself analyzing that it was a route par excellence from three minutes in uh obama
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:32.280]  uh was absolutely totally uh folding uh now let me again uh just uh read over some of these
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.640]  some of these headlines uh so that you can get the gist of this palin warns obama camp
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.600]  will not go down without uh without swinging will pull something yeah false flag it's gonna
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.200]  stage the vent that's in the cards i mean it's gonna happen but you got to look at it tough
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:54.920]  reviews for jim lear as debate moderator ap well yeah i mean he could hardly talk uh
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:05.160]  it continues here uh with all of these all of these different uh headlines dealing with the fact
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:12.520]  that that everybody said that he basically uh imploded i've got my stack all screwed up here
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.440]  from the beginning of the uh from the beginning of the broadcast thought i'd put these back back in order
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.520]  but uh here are just some of those uh headlines uh that we're going to go over here now i just
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:33.720]  can't find them the point is is that i read those uh in uh found them here it says uh video potential
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:40.360]  worry for obama campaign california's watch think romney won clash with obama in first debate
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:48.760]  uh that's uh a group of uh polls uh that's washington post rasmussen gallup and others
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:56.280]  the hill romney lands punches against subdued obama in first debate carvel mitt romney came
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:04.760]  with a chainsaw christ matthew's freaks out at obama what was he doing romney goes on offense
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:11.080]  forcing obama to defend record washington post uh michael more to obama this is what happens
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:17.160]  when you pick john carrey as your debate coach uh philly student told to lose romney t-shirt
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:23.240]  to school or get out told romney is kkk the authoritarianism of these people first presidential
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.920]  debate obama hit with left hook on tv politico obama can't promise us to have a response to
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:37.240]  romney and next debate the hill uh it just goes on and on and on uh romney was able to out obama
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:43.400]  obama that's van jones uh new york times in cool hand barry goes on to say he lost the debate
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:51.480]  just on and on and on cnn most watchers say romney debate winner incumbent debate curse
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:58.440]  barack obama falls to mint romney national journal so it goes on and on i mean i i just there's
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:05.080]  so many of these i can't read them all so even the democratic party operatives have to admit he got
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:12.520]  destroyed because no one buys their bull anymore i i kind of don't like this that cnn and msnbc now
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.240]  know they have one tenth of the audience they had just five years ago they're a joke big radio shows
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:23.080]  in major cities have bigger audiences it's it's total illusion but radio and local news still
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:29.000]  watches cnn and msnbc to get the talking points because they think that's the big show they think
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.280]  that's the big you know arbiters of reality we still cover them we still respond to them
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.880]  i mean there are legends in their own mind i only cover them to show that they've even
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.680]  realized they can't sit up there and say that obama won that debate or it was a tie or both
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:51.720]  got some good shots in they can't do that because it's game over unless you come into martial law
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.440]  and try to put us in reeducation camps which obama's told the army prepare for three months ago
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.480]  why don't republicans use the public army manual under obama saying prepare americans for
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.080]  reeducation camps because then you have to admit the fema camps you have to admit the
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.280]  military industrial complex you have to admit the tyranny you have to admit the nsa spying you have
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:17.080]  to admit the nsa uh criminality you have to admit that the the the tsa activities you have to admit
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:24.200]  i've been right and others have been right so barring a stage terror attacks and martial law
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:30.760]  takeover it's not going to work when they put obama in either it's not going to work you can
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.760]  put obama back in you can put romney back in it's not going to matter we're going to wake up to
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:40.280]  romney people are going to figure that out too as well that's the agenda it's over you guys can
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:46.280]  rearrange stuff pull tricks pull rabbits out of hats and it works but for shorter and shorter
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:51.080]  periods now look at obama they build him as the second coming of christ actually said in the news
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.440]  he was jesus remember that now look at him okay it isn't working anymore people are getting wise
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:04.200]  despite all the fluoride erin fulin here as the food police shut down food co-ops the omish and
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.920]  small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but the

[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.640]  because obama he's got a peace prize the toll free number to join us here on air today on this
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:45.480]  thursday edition is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 i'm alex jones the websites are info wars.com
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:53.000]  and prisonplanet.com are streaming video the radio show at prisonplanet.tv all right i got a bunch
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.480]  of these clips let's start going through them uh this is where romney tells obama to grab uh
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:07.560]  bol simpson then says uh why he does not want to raise taxes to not kill jobs and uh this is really
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.040]  important because i was tweeting within five minutes into the debate point out that when you
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:19.560]  raise taxes too high it actually lowers revenue this is well known uh but again uh romney basically
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.520]  went there which is the truth because there's this idea that raise taxes give more goodies to people
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.840]  know raise taxes to shut down your competition because the fortune 100 is basically exempt from
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.840]  taxes they want high taxes to shut down their competition just like they use china to leverage
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.360]  out all their competition okay this is a rigged system here it is i mean do you support simpson
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.680]  bowls i have my own plan it's not the same as simpson bowls but in my view the president should
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.880]  have grabbed it if you want to make some adjustments to it take it go to congress fight for it that's
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.640]  what we've done made some adjustments to it and we're putting it forward before congress right now
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.640]  a four trillion dollar plan but you've been president for years you've been president for years you
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.560]  said you cut the deficit in half it's now four years later we still have trillion dollar deficits
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.200]  the cbo says we'll have a trillion dollar deficit each of the next four years if you're real like
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.600]  we'll get to a trillion trillion dollar debt i mean you have said before you cut the deficit in
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.760]  half and the four i love this idea of four trillion and cuts you found four trillion
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.000]  dollars of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget except we still show
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.680]  trillion dollar deficits every year that doesn't get the job done let me come back and say why is
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:32.600]  it that that i don't want to raise taxes why don't i want to raise taxes on people and and and
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.400]  actually you said it back in 2010 you said look i'm going to extend the tax policies that we have
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.200]  now i'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this when
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.720]  we're in recession you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone well the economy is still growing slow
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.280]  as a matter of fact it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement and so if
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.400]  you believe the same thing you just don't want to raise taxes on people and the reality is it's not
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.960]  just wealthy people you mentioned donald trump it's not just donald trump you're taxing all right
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.360]  now let's go to this next clip here this is where romney defends giving tax breaks to oil
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:11.400]  companies if they drill domestically they make it really hard and attacks obama for giving
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.520]  90 billion to green energy now i don't like the fact that romney says i like green energy
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.280]  really you like giving a half billion to one company that builds nothing another half billion
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:28.920]  another 90 billion total i mean these were pure chicago mafia wealth transfers i mean obama is
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.840]  just such a snake folks he he writes the ndaa his lawyers do then he says he's against it while
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.640]  secretly the letters got brought out saying pass it he says don't worry i won't sign it so opposition
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:45.000]  couldn't kill it then he signs it now remember the globalists they want you to think one of these
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  guys is actually running things it's the lawyers and the handlers it's just the fact is obama puppet
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.040]  can't handle romney puppet uh let's go ahead and go to this clip dealing with the uh green energy
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.400]  scams so let's go through the one by one first of all the department of energy has said the
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:08.520]  tax break for oil companies is 2.8 billion dollars a year and it's actually an accounting treatment
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:15.960]  as you know that's been in place for 100 years now time to end it and and in one year you provided
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:22.360]  90 billion dollars in breaks to the green energy world now i like green energy as well
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:27.640]  but that's about 50 years worth of what oil and gas receives and you say exxon and mobile
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.280]  actually this 2.8 billion dollars goes largely to small companies to drilling operators and so
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.720]  forth but you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent why that 2.8 billion
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.560]  dollars is on the table of course it's on the table that's probably not going to survive you get that
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:49.560]  rate down to 25 percent but but don't forget you put 90 billion dollars like 50 years worth of breaks
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:56.680]  into into solar and wind to to salindra and fisker and tesla one i mean i had a friend who
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.480]  said you don't just pick the winners and losers you pick the losers all right so so this is not
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.800]  this is not the kind of policy you want to have you want to get america energy security
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.640]  sure second topic all right let's continue here we're gonna break and make a play a few more
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:15.400]  clips and go to your calls at 800 at 25 at 992 31 we have loaded phones but as somebody hangs up

[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:27.800]  topic but i do hope to bring up the debate you know not uh reptoids or something uh now again
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:36.360]  this is soft soaping romney's calling these tax breaks there's even more on top of that 90
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:44.200]  billion in just free stinking money free money your tax money to these scumbag globalists
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:55.480]  we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn

[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.560]  word about our local AM and FM affiliates spread the word about the local station you're listening
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.440]  to have you told somebody about the show in the station today if our three million listeners
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:22.600]  the day just tell a few people a week about the show it's game over folks i mean liberty is rising
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:29.800]  okay so i've been playing clips from the debate where obama basically folded uh like a lawn chair
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:33.720]  but again it's kind of sad that romney doesn't mean all the stuff he's saying
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.080]  because when he actually voted for stuff it was for abortion it was for gun control it was for
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:45.960]  open borders it was for carbon taxes it was for global warming al gore love it's for police state
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:52.120]  but the guy i heard last night i liked except for this point uh where where he's he's in
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:57.640]  because obama has helped more than anybody pay to move general motors to china paid to shut down
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.520]  our power plants but then china can have three new ones a week coal power plants uh paid with
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:10.520]  incentives and so when you're informed it's otherworldly to see obama up there because he'd earlier
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.360]  talked about you want to outsource jobs you want to have tax incentives to leave the country and you
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.560]  know romney's talking about lower taxes on small business that's good but it's a tax as a tariff
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:27.080]  basically to have china with slave labor and no environmental standards no welfare no workers come
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.560]  as more and more of that is demanded here the quality of life goes down the services go down
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:39.240]  and the jobs leave so the new jobs are security guards and things like that that's the news we
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.240]  were gonna have this great service economy we don't even have that now we have a police state
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:48.920]  minder economy i drove by the acl festival they're setting it up i think that's the big music festival
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.240]  they're setting up down by uh silker park right well anyways i drove i drove by because ed barton
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.960]  springs closed this morning so i'm swimming the river most those yuppies freak out when i'm swimming
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.000]  around in there so awesome it's like it's like it's like the rainforest or something i had hundreds
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.520]  of carp around me and huge catfish and snapping turtles wild kingdom much better than the caribbean
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:14.360]  anyways i'm down there and it was cops everywhere and park clothes a giant park for security sweeps
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.920]  and and there were weird security guards standing around to shovel everywhere everything's a big
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:23.160]  security event you know they have the army out at the kite festival a few months ago
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:29.320]  just the terrorists are everywhere um that's the new economy so uh here is uh romney mox
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.840]  obama's comment on moving jobs overseas giving businesses a tax break uh so here's that club
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.320]  which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas look i've been in business for
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.520]  25 years i have no idea what you're talking about i maybe need to get a new accountant
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.080]  but but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.320]  what we do have right now is a setting where i'd like to bring money from overseas back to this
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:01.560]  country uh that that's just pure bull by the way romney went in with hedge funds and took over
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:07.160]  businesses and chopped them up and sold them off and stole pension funds i mean all you talk
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.840]  about staples it was already established i mean romney's a bad guy folks supported banker bailouts
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:21.160]  you name it uh so all i'm saying is that's a load of bull uh let's go ahead and go to obama
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:26.520]  snaps at jim lair this went on quite a bit and then he went on like four minutes after this
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:33.000]  i mean obama was hogging the time and it did not come off as presidential because he had to
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.120]  leave his teleprompter at home while the corporate shark was there fighting over the the the the the
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:46.200]  slop the government trough that he wants to snuggle his little goldman sacks nose down into
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.760]  but see goldman sacks wins either way they're bankrolling both guys the administrations are full
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:58.680]  of the same people let's go to this club now the last point i'd make before uh two minutes is up
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:08.440]  sir no i i think i had five seconds before you interrupted me was the irony is that we
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.000]  and then it goes on with the counter by lair later who was actually able to summon up some
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.080]  mental acumen when he says oh well uh you're uh that's five minutes for your five seconds um but
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:25.400]  it was definitely uh lair was leaning the entire time uh towards obama that was pretty obvious
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.480]  now here's a clip where romney uh well i'll let the club speak for itself here it is
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.640]  look i got five boys i'm used to people saying something that's not always true but just keep
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:40.680]  on repeating it and ultimately hoping i'll believe it but that that is not the case all right i will
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:47.960]  not reduce the taxes paid by high-income americans and number three i will not under any circumstances
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:53.400]  raise taxes on middle-income families i will lower taxes on middle-income families now you cite a
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.640]  study there's six other studies that looked at the study you described and say it's completely
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.680]  wrong i saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by three to four
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.480]  thousand dollars on middle-income families throw all these studies out there but let's get at the
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.440]  bottom line that is i want to bring down rates i want to bring the rates down at the same time
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.880]  lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth so we keep getting the revenue we need and
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:24.360]  you think well then why lower the rates and the reason is because small business pays that individual
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.200]  rate 54 percent of america's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:37.000]  tax rate but at the individual tax rate and if we lower that rate they will be able to hire more
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.080]  people for me this is about jobs right this is about getting jobs for the american people yeah
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:48.200]  do you challenge what the governor just said what you said about it okay so here's the bottom line
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.920]  romney won the debate unfortunately you can't believe anything he says and both guys are bought
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.840]  and paid for about the same interest it's just same puppet master running both puppets and
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.320]  you know the right hand of the puppet master is a little bit better than the left hand and it was
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:08.200]  beaten up the left hand you know over there obama pun intended he's left-handed uh show all of that
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.880]  is going on but here's the deal romney at least has to give lip service and say he's anti-abortion
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:20.360]  and romney has to defend small business in the free market where obama openly attacks it and says
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.240]  you didn't build that and if romney really wanted to win he'd come out and say you didn't you didn't
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.520]  build america mr president and and and small business people and entrepreneurs and inventors
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:39.160]  and trailblazers they did because look government doesn't work at a large level and and sometimes
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.000]  you can have a well-meaning government that can do some good things up front it always gets infiltrated
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:50.760]  and taken over and becomes corrupt 99.9 of the time literally government creates a nightmare
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:58.840]  everybody knows that historically and you sit there and you see obama and and all these socialists
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.960]  i mean look i know democratic party supporters i see them all the time they are the most neurotic
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:11.880]  control freak chicken-necked scared people they're scared of citizens having guns they
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:17.800]  love the nanny state they hate strong men they they they don't like the family i mean i've been
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:22.920]  around them are there people that could be on the left that you know believe in organic food and
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.960]  you know not being racist and who are nice folks yeah there are those people but historically the
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.520]  people on the left work for the government they work for the system and for them the bigger the
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.800]  system gets the better their life they are members of a gang and you got a bunch of corporate
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.520]  gangsters that now run the government and they love the useful idiots down there that get a tiny
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.080]  amount of chicken feet they love making them dependent they love not having competition they
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:54.360]  love government being able to shut down their competition and that is the secret and the heart
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:02.200]  and the core to all of this so i like the fact that romney got animated i like the fact that
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.520]  you know i mean because look when you've got an american president running down business owners
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:15.320]  and saying you didn't build jack squat jack you got a problem on your hands uh businesses are hard
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:20.440]  to run especially a news organization that its main mission is news not business but i get distracted
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:25.240]  by the business and having to fund things and having to wear that businessman cap a government just
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:29.000]  i mean literally you know government's a joke you've been around it you've worked with government
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.440]  you've had to go get stuff from the government you had to go get permits and things they're a
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:39.640]  bunch of neurotic weirdos usually who are entitled and now call themselves officials and authorities
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.000]  and and want to let us know we're keeping you safe from al qaeda that they run all right i'm
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.600]  going to take calls for the rest of the sound about 15 minutes to the next and i'm getting the
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:54.120]  sci-fi news it'll blow you away and then gary johnson's joining us but uh right now let's go to
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:45:01.240]  your calls again the toll-free number to join us 800-25-99-231 uh let's go to jack in tennessee
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.760]  listing on the free phone app what is it iphone we got iphone droid you name it uh jack you're on
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.520]  the air welcome yeah but this is perfect since gary johnson's joining us but uh calls back in
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:18.520]  uh may you told me to call in a talk show radios and i've been doing that recently just a ton man
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.720]  i got one earlier this morning every time to the neocon response but long story short uh i went to
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:28.920]  belterberg with you guys crazy things that was five or six months ago and uh i was in the washington
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:34.040]  times uh to been wolfgang article do you remember that one i do remember seeing that i remember
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.120]  talking to wolfgang over the phone i don't think i met him in person but do you have a comment it was
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.160]  nice to meet you do you have a comment on the debate or anything yeah man i was gonna say uh
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:48.040]  how can we expose these uh neocon conservative talk show puppets for who they really are besides
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.320]  just exposing them on their own shows maybe making a youtube video that goes viral or yeah i mean do
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.200]  stuff like that but i'd call into these neocon shows so they do have big audiences compared to uh
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.600]  their so-called competition msnbc and you call in you're like yeah romney absolutely destroyed him
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:10.440]  uh but it was crazy to watch romney argue against his own record so do you think if romney gets in
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.800]  he'll actually be pro-gun and anti-abortion and against carbon taxes because he supported all
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:22.840]  that and and because you know it's important to expose and push these neocons and these fake right
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:29.800]  wing talk show hosts more into reality because then that won't let the democrats get as far
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.920]  afield towards tyranny as well the further the right moves towards the left which again that's
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.400]  using a fake paradigm but that's how they see it the more they can get their globalist agenda done
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:47.480]  i appreciate your call uh let's uh talk to um martins in louisa litho wania i guess he's got
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.240]  back in today we had first time callers yesterday uh what's your take on the debate
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:47:01.880]  i want to ask about uh the column yeah unfortunately sir i can't understand you i apologize if you
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:05.160]  send us written emails maybe we could start reading some emails on the air that'd be
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.560]  good thing to do read questions on the air uh rick in california you're on the air
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.760]  hey alex how's it going good sir uh wow i can't believe i'm talking to you hey uh real quick i found
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.880]  i found you guys five six years ago on a five dollar bill and i still have that and it was awesome
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:26.760]  that was a great way it's a very effective way people write info wars dot com on on federal
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:32.440]  reserve notes yes i was gonna i didn't want to watch the debate last night i turned it on and in
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:38.760]  the first minute i was like he's screaming like a little mouth and it was comical i could not
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:45.240]  believe it we know the bankers uh or you know or betting on both horses but it was enjoyable to
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:51.080]  watch him squirm like the little mouth he is and uh yeah well i mean the deal was made to put
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.280]  obama in four years ago john mccain is a democratic party operative placeholder i mean if that's a
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:02.360]  fact like bob dole uh now he's actually up there on the stage with a corporate globalist piranha
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:09.160]  that wants his mafia don job uh and so yeah no obama is actually dealing with a contender now
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:14.040]  people say is it totally reg that they're behind closed doors together no not really i mean they're
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:20.840]  two gangsters that you know that that want to head job um i had a quick question for you
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:27.000]  do you think that the fact that obama wants to draw down our military is that so that at some
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.320]  point we have to rely on the un and nato yes but but i mean look at that name drawdown build down
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.480]  it's like calling the patriot act patriotic uh they just mislabel everything whether you're for
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.880]  a big military or not you're calling it a drawdown or a build down is is is an oxymoron it's not a
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:53.880]  building something down is tearing it down yes here's the deal uh over time they already call
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:58.760]  our troops when they die in the newspaper nato troops nato is now in afghanistan north atlantic
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.560]  treaty organization that's not atlantic anything it they said 30 years ago they'd make it the new
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:09.720]  world army so yes down the road they do intend on getting rid of the united states nukes that's
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.880]  being announced they do intend on getting rid of everything and the un will have it and no one
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:20.760]  else will have weapons and the un is to be backed by the chinese the the the the un the top globalist
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.680]  china will be the new center of the world down the road that's the plan
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.840]  well keep doing what you're doing brother thank you uh i'm just trying to survive here
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:36.760]  like you brother yeah i don't i mean the cfr admits this this is their plan that they call

[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.080]  they're going to stage terror attacks whenever they go for this and blame it on domestic groups
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.320]  and at that point the military has got to know the the the patriots didn't didn't blow up your
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.600]  building okay uh the globalist did uh you know the same ones that have killed tens of thousands
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:44.440]  u.s troops and declassified experiments you know them the admitted criminals uh we're going to be
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:49.560]  getting to that the next hour uh back to your calls uh jeff uh finishing your points uh on the
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  debate what else were you noticing uh there with obama i mean he just looked angry that he was being
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.760]  asked any questions see he looked like a spoiled brat an arrogant president a guy on a power trip
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.240]  he looked like kim jong il being asked questions you don't ask the supreme leader questions
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:13.560]  right you know i agree you know it is a black man uh calling from canada uh i found it it almost
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:19.560]  like watching uh to use the old court quote unquote wrote it for racist standard watching the white
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:26.840]  man school the black man and i think that kind of imagery that kind of cosmetic optics uh in the
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:35.080]  united states uh will prompt anyone that would have any reservations about uh obama uh to to
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:39.480]  look at romney a little bit more closely and again i know i understand this is all theatrics
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:46.600]  no no no i agree with you i agree with you at at one level that that that in anything now white
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.960]  guys are always the bad guy so it's bad if a white guy does good i i understand that's the
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:57.240]  hyper psychology that they use it to get everybody at their throats in the political correctness but
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:02.520]  i guess i wasn't watching it as a white guy black guy but i did think about and and today they're
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.720]  saying it's racist in the news to criticize i saw several articles obama so so i mean it does
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.160]  come down to that point but i guess when bill clinton intimidated george harbert walker bush
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:17.240]  that was racist against white people because i mean bill clinton is the first black president they
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:25.000]  said all this identity politics makes me sick uh but uh yeah there will certainly some whites maybe
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.800]  christians that don't like mormons maybe baptist they'll probably vote for romney now because they
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.920]  think well he showed that black guy and then and then you'll probably have some minorities who
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:39.320]  were going to vote for romney who probably will think well that's not allowed he must be racist
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:46.120]  because he was beating obama uh anything else sir yeah thank you the the right at the beginning of
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.480]  the debate when romney you can replay this for your audience uh in a couple seconds but then i
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.040]  hope the next debate you will do it on air that you will carry this on prison planet tv which is
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.520]  where i'm watching you right now great quality by the way i hope that you'll carry the debate live

[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:12.040]  matter where i tried to watch this debate whether it be on c span or the mainstream media libertarians

[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:24.120]  about reaffirming the democratic party republican party two-headed monster and uh you're right next

[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:11.000]  your whole staff thank you your family everything i you have changed our lives i have a 13 year old
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.440]  he's a listening use since he was 10 because i used to homeschool and a 20 year old and i love how
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:22.040]  after you like you'll have someone come on and i'll say something and then you put it like in
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:28.600]  layman's terms because i have a 20 year old who's asperger but he's like high functioning asperger
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:35.720]  but he understands you could take something so complex and when you say it he gets it and i just
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:41.800]  you just don't know i'm on the info wars team with the young devotee products everything this is like
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:47.560]  the alex jones house over here well god bless you ma'am uh well we we're all in this together so
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:54.040]  please don't thank me but i want to thank you your words mean a lot to me okay i didn't watch the
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:02:01.240]  debate only because i fully agree with jerald it's the political reality show and also like a lot of
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:07.080]  months ago i don't know how many but so many months ago you had said uh oh obama better watch out
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:12.280]  because the money that they put behind him last year they're putting it behind romney and i was
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:18.040]  like you know what if they did that then it's over and sure enough as the weeks go by in a month go
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:24.920]  by you can just see things in the news where they are turning on obama and do i think prepping for
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:30.840]  this debate i mean he it looks like only romney prepped and i don't know what they did to poor
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:37.480]  obama he looked like he may have just gotten off a plane or something and just showed up but no i
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.120]  agree so you didn't watch it but later saw some clips of it no no i mean within minutes obama
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:48.520]  looked totally exhausted totally disheveled uh you could tell he was out of gas i mean it's one thing
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.320]  to look physically tired it's another thing to you know just look like he didn't want to be there
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:03:00.280]  and then here's the you know here's the hungry dog romney coming at him so i uh i agree with you and
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.320]  the whole thing's a distraction to begin with but if we cover it we can then bring in new people
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:11.000]  and show them the propaganda by covering the issue you said we could talk about the wars that
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.080]  are going on but i just wanted to talk about i watched this show it's like mosaic news or something
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.800]  it's on link the link some channel called link channel but this morning they showed something
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:29.160]  they put up like five warnings warning we're about to show something graphic and it was somewhere in
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:37.240]  syria and they said al-qaeda has they captured 20 syrian rebel or they won't even rebel they were
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.480]  syrian officers i know i've seen it and they shoot them and cut their heads off there's a bunch of
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:48.440]  footage like that oh my goodness and i was like but it just hurt my heart because they look just
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:54.040]  like each other just like i'm next i'm black and white you know i didn't know i didn't i mean there's
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.800]  a bunch of those clips which one was with them hacking their heads off throwing them off roofs
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:03.000]  or shooting them no not yet they i think it was probably before they hacked up it because they
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.800]  had them all lined up you could tell they were outside and they were walking and they were counting
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:13.160]  because you know they play the english words at the bottom and they were going count them count them
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.600]  count them but the ones that were on the ground and they look so young they look like they're 17
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:25.720]  21 23 and it's just so sad man are you not patriotic our government says al-qaeda is now good
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:31.320]  and is doing a great job attacking syria libya and iran but al-qaeda is also bad you need to give
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:35.320]  your rights up because of al-qaeda that that makes sense doesn't it i mean the government's good
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.680]  total sense total sense total sense okay good yeah i'll kind of bad but i'll kind of good
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.680]  all right we'll be uh right back well i'm just unpatriotic i'm against al-qaeda and i know that's
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:54.920]  extreme that's not american that's that's bad i i i admit i'm bad it's it's something i'm getting

[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:17.320]  okay let me blitz through news then i will go back into your calls then presidential candidate
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:23.720]  on libertarian ticket gary johnson making news in a big way trying to get into the debates does that
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:30.440]  well that sabotage lord romney and just like what happened with ross perot getting bill clinton in
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:38.120]  well i mean george herbert walker bush was mr mr world government mr u n should run everything
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.760]  i mean these are globalist in there they fight over who gets to be in charge but that's it
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:47.160]  i also want to get into a compilation of videos because new videos are coming out of cops beating
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:54.600]  up quadruplegics thanks and the courts have even been defending them like beating quadruplegics if
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.720]  they don't follow a police order to stand up and walk i'm not joking i'm like well you should
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:07.240]  just park the red sea cop tells you do something next we're gonna save a cop tells the corpse to
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.040]  get back up and walk around they can shoot the corpse for not following orders that is coming
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.480]  up you think i'm joking we're gonna be getting into that here in just a moment i think it's
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:21.160]  reasonable i think police ought to go to a graveyard and just announce arise police order
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:28.520]  and this skeletons all pop up out of the ground because the state is god i shot a video a few
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.560]  days ago when it was raining and uploaded it last night to youtube of a double rainbow it's it's up at
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:41.160]  the alex jones channel also tweeted it out at real alex jones and you know i said god didn't build
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:46.520]  that rainbow obama and the state did because you know government is god the state is god and
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.360]  it had about 98 likes on the video but i didn't see some christians saying how dare you
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:59.320]  do that i mean it's like Pharisees or something i'm pointing out the state is not god by pointing
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:05.720]  out how ridiculous it is that they want to be god so uh you know the Pharisees they didn't like some
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:10.600]  other people as well uh it's all about how they're high and mighty and you're bad okay well you need
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:13.880]  to get out there and do something i love how critics can always criticize everything i do
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:19.000]  but what have you done what are you doing in the arena but see if you can just be a critic of
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.120]  somebody in the arena that makes you big as you explain how it should be done and the way it should
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:31.400]  be done and everything else i am now digressing excuse me all right let me give you this big
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:37.080]  news story and it ties into what we're covering uh in the second issue of the info wars magazine
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:43.400]  you can subscribe to at cost at info wars store.com i should add the technocracy rise of the robots
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:49.000]  end of humanity section why do i know this because hundreds of books thousands of white papers
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:59.560]  statements by the entire Nobel scientific laureate roster from Bertrand Russell to Julian
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:08.840]  Huxley to Aldous Huxley to Edward Bernays just all of them their religion is they are scientific
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:14.840]  technocrats in their words and they're going to create a scientific artificial habitat to take
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:20.360]  over society with social engineering and chemical engineering and the food and water and biological
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:27.400]  engineering to make the humans they allowed to live less than 20 percent of what's alive now
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:33.560]  they're going to phase out and kill the rest brain damaged four foot tall that's their words
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:45.960]  robot microchip implanted biological androids and by the way in my new magazine half the
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:51.000]  magazine 48 pages there's like five six articles on that subject with their quotes and where they
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.720]  said it i'm talking about owners of you know the biggest tech companies out there billionaires
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:02.440]  i mean you better find out about this now i've told you over and over again they're putting
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.200]  cancer viruses in the vaccines but not just cancer viruses they've been caught just type
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:12.120]  in cancer viruses and vaccines type in polio and vaccines type type in microplasm in vaccines type
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:17.880]  in un documents sterilizing vaccines type in un caught sterilizing with vaccines i mean it's
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.440]  it's it's mainstream news but it's always just in the news like it's no big deal oh yeah the
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:28.600]  government last year shot up 67 000 kids the or of the millions that india shot up 67 000
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:32.520]  got polio and died or are in wheelchairs now or
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:43.160]  and then it's just a footnote and no big deal so i'm ranting here all over the united states the
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.880]  department of defense is paying free money though because it's your tax money you know it comes from
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:54.280]  the feds it's free as obama said last night to put in ai computers in the bathrooms the classrooms and
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:14:05.480]  the uh the uh have a curious because tech is so cheap mit talks about not just having microchips
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:10.440]  in all products rfid soon the size of grains of sand or smaller that communicate back and
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:14.680]  forth through the smart meters that are being put up everywhere and the lamppost nationwide
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.560]  homeland security spending something like 20 million dollars the last three years uh last time i checked
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.400]  to have microphones and cameras hidden in the street lights that they now admit are going in
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.920]  the town i live it's like oh big deal hidden cameras and microphones i mean that's what you
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:33.720]  have in a free society i mean after all i just it's all beyond crazy whether it's australia
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:38.600]  germany england there's a headline uh british schools put cameras in bathrooms lockers associated
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:46.920]  press so two years ago department defense san antonio put cameras in the bathrooms in the
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:54.360]  lockers in the showers uh that's in tennessee the showers over the top uh and they call people
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:58.600]  extremists when parents complain they go you're you're an extremist it's just and they're like
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:03.560]  oh that's a terrorist i don't like cameras in the you know 11 year old girl bathrooms in the one
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:10.040]  case in tennessee and it's all delphi technique how they handle it when everybody freaks out
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:14.440]  they go it's no big deal the school says it's all right the board said it was all right
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.520]  homeland security gave us the grant and they're the school trainer accused of hiding camera
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:24.360]  in bathroom no no no it's not okay for the pervs to do it it's the government doesn't but yeah
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:31.560]  that's san antonio with that down there but these ai computers hooked into the department of defense
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.640]  that's they're actually hooked into the nsa center down in san antonio studying them
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:41.720]  they uh they the computer tracks how much calories are in an apple how much you eat
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.040]  and in the future the parents are going to be fined just like parents are now being jailed
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.840]  if your child's late to class if you don't eat all the food and the federal government says
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:57.160]  what food you're going to eat this has all been announced so here's the brisbane times
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.080]  handmade humans may hold the key to saving the world now how many times have i told you
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:05.960]  they're going to make you so sick with the gmo so sick with the cancer viruses and nanotech that's
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:11.640]  what engineered viruses really are that you're going to have to get gene therapies and things
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:16.520]  from government to even stay alive and then they're going to say we've got to redesign humans
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.760]  to survive in the new environment so you're going to go to the government and they'll get your
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:29.960]  your sperm and your egg and then they will create the zygote and re-engineer it because that's what
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:36.120]  Aldous Huxley said in 1932 they would do and he said in 62 he met with the head bankers and that
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:42.680]  that was the plan uh by the year 2010 but now we know they're about 10 15 years behind their own
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:49.640]  numbers and he told berkeley he said you could either join us or be destroyed and he laughed at them
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:56.360]  in 62 before he died so that's how i know all this i mean he wrote about clones genetic engineering
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:03.640]  four foot tall gibbering servant minions brain chips and people 1932 the entire world we live in
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:09.000]  is what they plant and it goes on human induced climate change is one of the biggest problems
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.280]  that we face today millions could suffer hunger water shortages disease and uh coastal flooding
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:19.720]  because of climate change so latest scientists suggest there may be near or even beyond the
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:25.240]  point of return he goes on scientists want not just geoengineering of the earth and its atmosphere
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:32.040]  and the and the plankton but also humans and it goes in to say uh pharmacological meat intolerance
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:37.960]  where you won't be able to eat meat you'll be four feet tall uh and uh segregation sterilization
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:42.680]  and genocide and they go on to say yeah the nazis did it but we're going to do a better job
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:48.840]  it actually says it big article you need to go read it okay i'm going to come back and cover
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.320]  more of this but let me just continue there are hundreds of these articles a month i see
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.280]  i look at this the atlantic magazine how engineering the human body could combat climate
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.320]  change from drugs to help you avoid eating meat genetically engineered cat like eyes and reduce
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.360]  the need for lighting a wild interview and it goes on no no this is what their folks they're
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:13.640]  already engineering you with mutations in the food and water that's why they're popularizing
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:19.160]  mutants through things like x-men and stuff they've already got hundreds of chimera mammals
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:24.040]  mixed with humans it's already rolling out here's the daily male planet of the apes
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:29.000]  save the world by genetically engineering humans to be smaller suggest nyu philosopher
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:35.480]  on and on and on just hundreds of them how engineering human body could combat climate
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:41.720]  change i mean just goes on and on okay now now understand all this that's why they've
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:48.600]  got department of defense cameras watching your kids that's why here's the latest article out
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:57.000]  on this today that i wanted to go over now in florida this is going in all over the state
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.240]  i had it in my stack and had so many of these you can't uh they're now putting in the cameras
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:09.160]  in the uh lunchroom guys during the break just reprint me the one about the the cameras are on
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:16.200]  the trash cans taking video of your face scan to match it and to track how much vegetables are being
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:21.480]  thrown away for the federal government same department of defense so just getting kids
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.440]  used to there's cameras on trash cans because you're going to be taxed on what you throw away
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:31.240]  designing to implode the economy that's what there'll be no underground economy because
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:35.720]  everything's going to be totally tracked and that's the real reason for all this uh so it's
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:40.760]  going in nationwide and this is their plan and in the future if you're a little bit overweight
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.360]  they're going to take you from your parents and put you in a government training reeducation camp
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:49.480]  that's actually already started in arkansas uh show it's all department of labor department
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:53.560]  of commerce department of agriculture and it's worldwide the exact same plans are going in
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:58.440]  nationwide okay that's why they're arresting the amish or they're going after everybody

[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:19.000]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:59.000]  of this is going on it is so incredibly frustrating to know i'm right to know the enemy thinks we're
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:06.600]  so stupid they operate like like like like we can't even see or think or hear or taste or touch or smell

[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.960]  i'm literally light years ahead of most people i've talked to a billionaires executives media
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:22.840]  people and they're always smart but in certain little ways they're not general knowledge people
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:30.120]  and i don't know what's hard about history so many other empires have taken over countries or nations
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  and killed everybody to dominate them the romans did it the israelites did it the you know the
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:41.560]  kamer the kameru's did it i mean this is a this is something in history the aztecs would take over
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.800]  the surrounding tribes and kill everybody until they didn't have anybody else to kill started
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:51.400]  killing themselves their culture collapsed uh human sacrifices in every culture this these
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.360]  evil strains of people every race color creed religion throughout history ends up going this way
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.320]  where psychos get in control first decadent people let corrupt get in control then corrupt
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.960]  get pushed out by really tough meanies and then the meanies get pushed out by really vicious
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:13.320]  control freaks and then psychos and then sadistic psychos get in and then all hell is released and
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:23.160]  it's just satanism hellraiser blood party black uniforms fires death let's just genetically
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:29.560]  engineer everything murder everybody i mean you know that's that's that's that's what it is
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.080]  and i'm and we're following this historical line i'm like danger will robinson danger we need to

[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:40.200]  we are back ladies and gentlemen and former new mexico governor gary johnson presidential
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:46.280]  candidate and libertarian party ticket qualified nationwide is our guest obviously we want to
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:51.400]  get his take on uh moves he's making to try to get into the future debates he tried to get into
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:56.040]  last night's debate uh love the libertarian party or hated i tend to really like it because it has
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:34:03.000]  the basic ideas of freedom compared to the two party um dictatorship it's one body two heads
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:10.200]  the twins as many call them uh they don't want to allow other parties or other ideas into the
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:16.680]  debates now some then argue well if you do that you're going to get a ross perot and that's going
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:22.840]  to put that's going to put somebody like bill clinton back in uh so here to discuss that uh is
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:27.560]  gary johnson my issue is why did people think things were going to get different putting
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.360]  barack obama in and then they thought things would be different you know putting mit romney in uh
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:37.080]  they are bought and paid for by the same corporate establishment the crony capitalist
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:42.760]  who are monopoly men and don't want a free society they want a controlled top down
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:47.720]  authoritarian system we got an article here today just came out at info wars dot com
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:52.760]  military police use for crowd control in south carolina and it links the local news saying yeah
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:58.600]  regular army are on the streets now just to keep you safe not a drill they're here they're the so
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.480]  what are they getting ready for on that front on every level things that were unthinkable 10 years
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:09.480]  ago like the nsa warrantlessly wiretapping the american people uh it's happening uh and joining
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:14.600]  us is gary johnson gary governor there's so much to cover here today thanks for taking time out
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:20.680]  your busy schedule uh what's your take on the debate last night i mean you obviously uh wanted to
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.720]  be there but i guess the two-party system kept you out well it's amazing to me that the two of
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:31.880]  them can get up there and argue over who's going to spend more money on medicare when we should have
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:37.640]  a raging debate and discussion in this country on how we're going to be able to cut it uh significantly
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:43.000]  and still provide an effective safety net that ought to be the discussion but the discussion is uh
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:49.160]  you know um who's going to spend more money and then romney talking about spending more money on
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:54.200]  the military that the that a balanced budget is important but he's going to hold medicare in check
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.400]  and spend more money on the military that doesn't add up and of course more money in the military
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:05.240]  is continued military intervention that as you talk about all the time alex and i applaud you for
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:10.280]  doing so you know we have hundreds of millions of enemies to this country that would not exist but
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:15.400]  for these military interventions and you elect either one of these guys we are going to continue
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:21.560]  to erode our civil liberties we're going to have a heightened police state at the end of four years
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:27.000]  regardless of which of these two are elected we're going to continue to militarily intervene in other
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:34.920]  countries and we're going to continue this unsustainable uh debt uh and uh and spending and that's
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:40.040]  going to result in a monetary collapse i think sooner than later unless we actually grab grab it by
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:46.760]  the horn speaking of dependency have you seen the obama phone lady how pitiful it is saying
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:53.560]  obama gave us a phone he's going to do more uh 50 million people on food stamps roughly half the
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.120]  population depending on government one way or another forced to pay into a government system
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:04.440]  that's been looted i mean to see our country built on the real free market now thinking what made
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:10.600]  north korea so horrible or communist russia so horrible that that's our hope and like you said
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  both candidates debating how many goodies they're going to give us i mean this country uh i don't
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:22.360]  know if it can survive another four years of either one of these uh you know uh two party systems
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:28.280]  because they're so close to each other well i know i know i'm speaking to i know i'm speaking to the
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:34.920]  choir here but it is just that it's making it's making promises it's absolutely not sustainable
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:40.280]  somehow somehow we believe that the easter bunny santa claus the two ferry they're all coming
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.520]  look we're burying our head in the sands sand over this i think we all understand that it's
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:49.080]  going to be mutual sacrifice on the part of all of us we're going to save this country
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:55.080]  and saving the country starts with balancing the federal budget and and then back to our military
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:01.640]  interventions uh wow i haven't been listening to your show but i'm sure that you're commenting
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.320]  about syria the fact that we're we are backing the syrian rebels and a quarter of the syrian
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:12.760]  rebels apparently are al-qaeda based yeah well i was about to bring that up next governor uh
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:19.320]  actually some numbers are half of them but nato stages is in turkey sins and men they're blowing
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:26.680]  up churches blowing up the oldest market in the world uh killing people blowing up churches as i
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:33.160]  said and the media says they're heroes but then i'm supposed to give my rights up because al-qaeda
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:38.280]  is hiding under the table and tsa has got to check my wife's underwear to make sure you know that
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:44.600]  that uh something isn't hiding in there but yeah then al-qaeda the cfr said two months ago are good
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:51.480]  guys in syria uh i ran i ran i read this last week has 70 inflation and that's because of
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:57.080]  our trade embargo well guess who the iranian citizens blame for this they don't blame their
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:03.240]  government they blame us and then you're back and then you're to then you bring this perspective of
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:08.520]  gosh what if we actually opened up trade with iran what effect would that have would that be
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:14.120]  similar to trade with china is china really a threat a military threat given that they're
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.360]  buying up our debt and they're one of our major trading partners i would argue that they're not a
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:25.080]  threat at all because they are a trading partner and every criticism of in the environment that i
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:32.520]  am in right now the constant criticism of free markets when the real criticism is crony capitalism
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:40.920]  when the real criticism is uh is corporate welfare and uh neither no politicians understand the
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:45.800]  difference between corporate welfare and free market governor i interrupted you when i started
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.640]  ranting about al-qaeda i guess i'm unpatriotic because i don't support them with some people
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:55.800]  that are pro war but it really is orwellian when al-qaeda is our big enemy but al-qaeda is also good
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:02.040]  they gave them libya now syria they're using them to attack iran this is on record the covert
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.720]  war against iran as you know has been uh raising for a while but getting back to this you've now
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:16.920]  got turkey shelling syria you've got russians in syria you've got proxy wars a lot of analysts
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:24.200]  as you know sir are saying this could lead to a huge wider new world war flesh out your take on
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:30.440]  this geopolitically because romney for one it wants to increase defense spending and
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:35.640]  sounds like he wants to have a war with russia or something well and i'm sure you draw the
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.280]  distinction all the time we should provide ourselves with a strong national defense but
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:46.120]  defense is the operative word where we're anything but defense we're militarily intervening
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:51.640]  and as a result we have hundreds of millions of enemies that we wouldn't otherwise have and
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:57.720]  here i ran i swear to you that they're they're both girding over who's going to pull the trigger
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:07.560]  first and i i just hope uh that in the name of a reelection barack obama doesn't bomb iran with
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:15.640]  that notion in mind before the election and then uh and then now we have uh israel really kind of
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:22.600]  dictating to the united states uh that here's the actions that we should be taking uh you know what
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:26.920]  we don't want any countries telling us what we should or shouldn't do and yet this is what we
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:33.080]  do constantly every single day all across the globe is there any wonder that there is this
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.840]  vilification of the united states and our policies but isn't it like you said the crony
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.480]  capitalist a handful of big insiders that get banker bailouts and corporate welfare contracts
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:50.920]  they're driving the us itself and they don't care if we get the blame because the world isn't
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.920]  sophisticated enough to know we ourselves are puppets of these interests what would you do to
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:02.760]  counter if you got in as president uh the monopoly capitalists that are in there well i am the counter
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:12.200]  i you know for for as dire as that is and it is um i arguably i'm in the position that i'm arguably
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:17.640]  i'm the only one in the position to make a difference uh with this running for president
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:22.440]  of the united states i mean i'm on the ballot in 47 states and the district of columbia were
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:28.040]  litigated in the other three so there are other third party candidates but nobody comes close so
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:36.440]  doing what we can do you do what you do every single day alex i'm doing what i can perhaps
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:43.400]  i'm the tip of the spear here with regard to how do you actually fix this as president of the united
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:49.960]  states this can be fixed and it can be fixed every single day and i based that on my experience as
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:55.400]  governor i realized that these are two different experiences vastly different experiences but i
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:03.000]  always found that good government was easy it wasn't hard it just started with uh issues middle
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.280]  was issues end was issues it wasn't about politics it was about issues and that you could actually
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:14.120]  dramatically affect no no me you did do a lot of positive things as governor and get a ton done
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.960]  in de mexico and also what like record vetoes of both parties garbage but let's expand on that
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:26.600]  obviously you have an antitrust suit against the major parties from monopolizing politics
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:33.000]  imagine the fireworks if you would have been in that debate tell us about your suits where they're
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.600]  going uh and what you would have said if you were in the debate i mean if you were watching it last
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:43.800]  night were there any points where you were chomping at the bit to respond to one of these two yahoo's
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:50.440]  oh i'm chomping at the bit at at everything that goes down i mean uh if i would have been on stage
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:57.480]  don't bomb iran um let's get out of afghanistan tomorrow bring the troops home i believe marriage
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:03.240]  equality is constitutionally guaranteed and the drug wars legalized marijuana now i'm the only one
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:08.040]  that would not have signed the national defense authorization act allowing for arrest entertainment
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.600]  of us citizens without being charged i would like to repeal the patriot act these guys support the
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.560]  patriot act you know they both with a straight face talk about a balanced budget but then the
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:22.600]  next sentence has to do with increased spending i promise i'll submit a balanced budget to congress
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:30.200]  in the year 2013 and that means taking on the entitlements medicaid medicare so security really
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:35.480]  is a problem that is pale in comparison to medicaid and medicare and military spending the reduction
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:42.440]  of military spending taking taking it down by 43 percent taking it back to 2003 spending levels
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:48.680]  and then i am advocating abolishing you know they talk about jobs abolish the income tax abolish
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:56.280]  corporate tax uh eliminate the irs take out the irs now you're talking replace all of that with
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:02.040]  one federal consumption tax which i'm going to argue is a template to no taxes uh over the long
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.920]  term but uh and then the federal reserve you know the only i'm the only candidate that would sign
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:13.800]  legislation uh abolishing the federal reserve sound money as opposed to not sound money uh repealing
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:19.160]  legal tender laws allowing for competing currencies let me raise this point you know you've said that
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:24.200]  writing in ron paul is a waste of votes yeah no kidding and i've been a big supporter of ron paul
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:30.600]  for 17 years since he ran for congress the second round um i like rand i encourage him to run i've
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:36.840]  don't ran for 14 years back when he used to campaign for his dad 15 years i guess it's about 97 uh
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:41.560]  and i've seen rand kind of start cozying up more of the republic establishment i guess to try to
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:46.520]  change him but i see him changing more and then i see some of their campaign people writing articles
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:52.680]  saying don't criticize bilgerberg that's conspiracy stuff well well ron paul has criticized the smoky
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:59.480]  rooms of bilgerberg we've got clips of him doing it on this show so you know my concern is i would
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.360]  really expect to see some support if not from rand paul who wants to run for president later from
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:10.200]  ron paul for you uh would you like to encourage ron paul to uh let me try to get you in the debate
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.400]  so you can inject some real issues well that would be terrific i'm not expecting it though and i'll
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:21.480]  just point out again ron paul asked me for my endorsement in 2008 i gave it to him when i
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.800]  dropped out of the republican primary i asked everyone that was going to vote for me to vote for
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.080]  ron paul and you know on the debate stage in the debate that i was able to be in i was asked who
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.560]  on stage would you pick as your vice presidential candidate well there's only one pick and that
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:41.400]  was ron paul and i said that on stage but i don't think he's going to endorse me and i'm not asking
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:48.040]  for it and i think it has to do with rand and the fact that um you know his son is a us senator and
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:53.480]  i i respect that but i think that's sure i mean i get it it's just that that's not how ron paul's
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:59.640]  always operated making backroom deals so it it's a little hurtful now i've got to be honest with you
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:05.080]  i'm very torn i'm normally governor johnson extremely decisive which they say is a good
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:10.760]  trade and talk show host but i go back and forth constantly i can't stand obama because of his
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:18.760]  anti-gun garbage and his globalist anti sovereignty garbage and then mit romney i know mit romney did
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:23.640]  the opposite of everything he's saying he's for now i mean i liked romney what he said last night a
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.360]  lot more than obama uh even though that would have been like a democrat in the 70s the stuff
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:32.840]  romney was saying it shows how far we've been pulled towards status big government collectivism
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:37.880]  but then i do think you know if if if gary but if gary johnson got into the debates he'd probably
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:43.240]  take enough votes away from romney uh because the collectivists aren't going to vote for you
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  you know they have no idea what time of day it is they just want their free money uh and that
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.800]  might put obama in but then i think well maybe let things get worse quicker maybe if there was
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:56.440]  four more years of obama things would get so bad we have a total pendulum swing instead of like
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:01.800]  romney staging a pendulum swing but it isn't real but then i think yeah but who knows what obama
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:07.720]  could do it could be really bad maybe romney would be better and i just vacillate all over the place
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.680]  but then i finally think look there should be other parties involved the two parties are corrupt
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:18.040]  we've got to get other parties in there and bring competition to this so i'm going to try to support
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:24.520]  gary johnson getting in the debates well uh and i think you're also tug bringing up the whole wasted
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:30.360]  vote phenomenon what's more of a wasted vote than voting for somebody you don't believe in i ran two
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:36.360]  campaigns for governor where i did not mention my opponent in print radio or television i just
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.880]  think people are hungry to vote for somebody as opposed to the lesser of two evils what did i
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:49.640]  see last month where uh obama ran 82 000 negative ads against romney last month i'm sure romney
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:56.440]  did the same when it came to obama uh look the way we change the system is voting for the person we
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:49:02.360]  most believe in and by doing that that's how we change things i think ross perot really brought
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:10.040]  up about an awareness of the economy and the debt and uh the the whole country woke up as a result
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:15.320]  of ross perot's camp and then his family got death threatened he stood down let's say you got in to the
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:21.400]  debates you suddenly turbocharged to 35 you were now going to be the winner in a three-way race
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.880]  and they call up and say gary we're going to murder your son your children your wife we're going to
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:32.280]  cut their heads off if you don't drop out uh what would you do well alex i i would like to first of
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:38.520]  all um i'd like to know a link to what the what actually went down with ross perot and you probably
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:44.360]  talk about that all the time but i don't know what that link is you know if that happened i would be
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:50.760]  very very transparent and and this is you know ross perot was leading in the polls when he stood
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:59.240]  down but i i you know who who voted for him um i didn't hear a real cognizant explanation of
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.520]  what that was all about he may have given it but i didn't hear it you know he said it he said it to
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:09.720]  a few reporters but it didn't get reported but in the dallas papers but i was i was uh in dallas
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.880]  at the time now i was already an awesome at the time um but i remember it being covered barely
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:18.200]  uh he said my family was threatened i can't really imitate him well but my family was
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:24.120]  threatened my wife and daughter i am not that's it the bushes was but i mean the bushes he was
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:29.400]  throwing it to clinton in a way so that didn't make sense maybe the whole thing was staged
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:34.680]  maybe ross perot was working for clinton well the difference though you you're asking me the
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:41.240]  difference and the difference if that happened to me is i would be about as transparent with that
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:46.520]  as i possibly could be i mean amazing stay there let's come back to that with governor gary johnson
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:54.920]  give you his website you can see the sign behind him the people's president gary johnson

[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:23.080]  thought and a lot more just we've we've got some obama phone type ladies and men on video here
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:27.800]  in austin that are pretty darn powerful as well we're gonna be having four in the radio tomorrow
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:33.400]  lord well and and some other surprises uh new mexico governor former governor gary johnson
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:39.080]  is our guest right now finishing up that question i mean if you got threatened if you were i mean
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:42.440]  look they don't want you in the debate because people want something different they probably
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:46.680]  would vote for you you'd probably become president that's why the two parties won't let you in
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:53.720]  exactly right that's exactly right is um let me let me point out the obvious uh i'm uh polling
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:55:00.040]  at six percent let's just say obama and romney both are at 45 percent do you hear my name six
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:06.440]  times every time you hear obama or romney's name 45 times no you hear my name one time for every
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:13.240]  5000 times you hear these guys names if my name if i was just being given the credit for where i'm
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:20.280]  at right now six times mention for every 40 45 times you heard obama's name i would be the next
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:29.880]  president the six would go to 1118 i'd be at i'd be at 35 amazing i love the new radio ads
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:35.960]  i've been hearing all over radio uh where you basically break down well i mean repeat what's
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.440]  in that ad to the audience because you're saying hey try freedom for four years do you like slavery
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:45.880]  again go back to it oh you're right if you if you like if you like what's been happening you know
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:51.640]  well first of all vote libertarian vote libertarian with me this one time give me a chance and when i
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:58.840]  say me i i i really use that in the context of we i i realize that i am the spokesperson for
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:05.640]  liberty and freedom right now by default and it isn't by default uh ron paul you know what when i
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:10.920]  ran uh as a republican i thought it was going to be hard to marginalize two people on stage talking
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:16.920]  about the same thing um i didn't find myself marginalized i found myself excluded and i found
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:22.360]  ron paul to continue to be marginalized and if the convention the republican convention in
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:28.920]  tampa didn't highlight that beyond anything else the fact he wasn't even allowed to speak uh i i'm
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:34.280]  just i'm outraged by all of it that somehow they can sweep this under the road i don't think i don't
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:39.640]  think ran got that just being patted on the head being given a speaking slot was good enough to
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:46.920]  sell out the cred so his dad could still just be kept quiet and be m i a so that ran could sit around
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:52.840]  in in rooms with republican leadership and be told you know he's a golden boy i i think they're
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:59.560]  stringing him along but uh but plus paul has been loved because they've never compromised
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:04.840]  and so i this really puts a dent uh in something that was teflon but i don't want to get off into
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:10.440]  a bash fest about that right right right here here it is it's it's now we need bold leadership now
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:16.360]  we need a president that's going to get up every single morning and take on these issues and and
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:21.640]  that's why i wanted to get elected governor of new mexico and that's what i did as governor of new
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:29.800]  mexico you know it wasn't about it wasn't about politics the the uh the um the issues that surrounded
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:34.840]  me when i was governor you know the controversies always had to do with the issues here what johnson
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:39.800]  said about school choice today here what he has to say about the war on drugs you know he's privatizing
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:45.160]  prisons which in new mexico uh we can get off on that tangent well governor we're almost out of time
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:50.040]  let me just say this regardless you're out there getting on television getting on c span getting
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:55.320]  on hundreds of radio shows letting people know there's an alternative that's what ron paul did

[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:29.960]  all right ladies and gentlemen in some of the other news here tsa worker steals 500 from traveler
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:37.160]  as punishment for complaining travelers who display lack of obedience targeted for retaliation

[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:50.920]  tsa's invasive pat down procedures with the tsa agent admitting the theft was a punishment for
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:56.760]  the man's lack of obedience and in other news federal court rules in favor of indebted attention
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:03.880]  of us citizens obama's emergency stay on india block extended but that fight is just now heating up
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:15.240]  and the tsa is now reinstating approval uh to film after backlash well i mean it's the law you can
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:19.240]  film then they said you couldn't they had to reverse that that's all up at prisonplanet.com
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:25.000]  and info wars.com i wanted to bring tata anderson up do we have him oh fantastic i saw a thumbs up
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:29.800]  that's what i thought that meant uh tata i wanted to get you on here because it gold's hit 1800 in
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:33.960]  europe a few dollars short of that here in the united states this is a big psychological point
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:37.640]  curtain demo wrote two days ago that uh he thought it was going to go above that because
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:42.440]  some of the numbers the elite are pouring into gold right now what's happened with gold today quick
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:53.080]  update all right well hitness and hitness hard uh all right well uh no ted anderson there for
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:59.080]  you uh the point is uh ladies and gentlemen uh because he needs to go with skype audio instead
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:02.760]  of using the access unit or whatever he's doing but it just it's it's done we're not going to do it
[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:10.280]  anyways the point is ladies and gentlemen is that is that currencies are being devalued
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:17.560]  worldwide right now and people are rushing into gold and silver and we've been proven right again
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:21.240]  that they've done everything they can to suppress it but despite that gold and silver
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:27.880]  are exploding in price you can give mitis resources a call uh if you would like
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:31.800]  and ask them about the alex jones specials they have two silver dollars for 72 bucks you can't
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:37.000]  get two silver dollars for that it's a lost leader and two free films and a book uh that's
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:44.040]  800 686 2237 and i'd say the little bit of capital it creates helps fund genesis communications
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:48.760]  network but actually these lost leaders don't even do that but gets into gold and silver
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:03:02.600]  800 686 2237 800 686 237 uh and again if they continue to destroy the world economy by design
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.840]  to consolidate it uh gold and silver is just going to go to the moon uh historically uh if
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:16.760]  that continues uh so again uh ladies and gentlemen i think that now is the time to get
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:20.840]  into gold and silver i mean i think it's been the time for 12 years you've seen it go you know
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:26.360]  gold from 300 bucks to 2000 they drove it back down it'll back up to 1800 you've seen silver at
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:31.160]  less than five dollars you know up to 50 bucks and then back down to 30 and then back up to 40 and
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:37.720]  i mean it's just all all moving in in the long 10 12 year graph it's moving up there's some dips on
[03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:44.600]  that line but over time it's going up up up so that's the bottom line on that ladies and gentlemen
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:50.280]  um that i believe that it's important to get into golden silver and the best place to do that
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:57.080]  is mitusresources.com uh and they have the alec shone specials uh link through there
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:01.080]  with the silver dollars and the three free uh the two films in the book i mean that's just
[03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:07.000]  beyond insane uh deal loss leader it's about to go up in prices the gold and silver bullion he's got
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:12.280]  prices are reflecting that he bought it a few weeks ago it will be going up he said next week
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:22.760]  show on the radio specials take advantage of all that 800 686 2237 800 686 237 now that's it for the
