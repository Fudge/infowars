[00:22.560 --> 00:32.640]  Jones ladies and gentlemen it is the 18th day of May 2014 I am your host Alex Jones
[00:32.640 --> 00:38.040]  thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide original transmission of the
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.560]  info war again I'm your host Alex Jones the news websites are info wars dot com
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.560]  and prison planet dot com now the broadcast you're gonna hear today is
[00:46.560 --> 00:52.440]  almost like a news magazine we're gonna cover the waterfront of issues in the
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.960]  second hour with a bunch of reporters coming in special reports the lawlessness
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.240]  of the globalist how to beat them so many different topics man on the street
[01:01.240 --> 01:07.440]  interview now coming up in the first hour we're gonna have in studio David
[01:07.440 --> 01:15.800]  night and of course staff sergeant bigs and then we are going to break down some
[01:15.800 --> 01:19.720]  other issues as well that are extremely important in fact first when we come
[01:19.720 --> 01:24.440]  back I want to hit on why the globalists want to go after rural populations
[01:24.440 --> 01:30.000]  and shut those down not just here in the United States but all over the world so
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.200]  again thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition but first off this aired
[01:35.200 --> 01:39.720]  last week on this nightly news and it was very informative so I wanted to play
[01:39.720 --> 01:45.280]  the Chicago Jackson special report it's just two minutes long Justice Department
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.240]  targets patriots but ignores police brutality or it's just about three
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.200]  minutes long so a lot coming up here on this Sunday transmission and remember
[01:55.200 --> 01:58.320]  if you're listening or watching this transmission you are the resistance
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.200]  there is often talk that only military and police should have guns that if
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.640]  there is an incident a man in uniform will swoop in and save you and there
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.120]  are plenty of good people in those positions but we can't ignore the
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.280]  blatant abuse of power that do occur such as an off-duty NYPD member who got
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.520]  drunk and shot a man six times to anyone who'd point out that the man was off the
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.880]  clock at the time of the shooting I'd be quick to point out that he shot a man
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.760]  six times on the other side of the country a man fleeing from police was
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.040]  shot in the back fell down a staircase and died reports are that the man had
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.680]  previously been menacing with a pair of scissors but was unarmed when he was
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.840]  killed from behind moving now to Texas a sheriff responding to a burglary killed
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.320]  the dog of the victim who called him apparently pepper spray wasn't a good
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.360]  enough option to keep the dog at bay and earlier this year Albuquerque police
[02:53.360 --> 03:09.440]  killed a homeless man for the heinous crime of camping
[03:23.680 --> 03:33.140]  let's contrast that with responsible citizens handling firearms while they're
[03:33.140 --> 03:37.640]  reversing the ladies holding onto her purse still chasing them all the way
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.960]  to the middle that's when a perfect stranger intervenes you can see him
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.320]  there in the PT cruiser at the top of the screen and that good Samaritan came
[03:46.320 --> 03:49.520]  out and drew his weapon and scared them and then that's when he pulled him off
[03:49.520 --> 03:54.720]  the car someone snapped this picture of the man holding the two suspects at bay
[03:54.720 --> 04:01.340]  a few minutes later police arrived she heard the suspect say this he said that
[04:01.340 --> 04:07.040]  crazy has a gun and that's when I was finally down on the sidewalk and I shot
[04:07.040 --> 04:13.400]  it into the dirt into the grass area and and to let him know you know I've
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.560]  got a gun and I know how to use it with all of this in mind the Department of
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.680]  Justice is continuing their attack on the Second Amendment by limiting banking
[04:22.680 --> 04:27.200]  options for gun stores this in addition to the DOJ running guns into the hands
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.320]  of Mexican drug cartels with operation fast and furious so to the good Samaritans
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.760]  and constitutional police alike be aware that if the DOJ continues these
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.040]  actions virtually unchecked you may find your right to bear arms infringed in a
[04:42.040 --> 04:47.600]  way that you wouldn't expect you can find more reports at info wars.com all
[04:47.600 --> 04:51.600]  right great job Jacarie Jackson we'll be right back after this one-minute break
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.700]  and get into the main transmission this is a special show lined up for you this
[04:55.700 --> 04:59.320]  Sunday I'm Alex Jones stay with us
[04:59.320 --> 05:05.120]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential
[05:05.120 --> 05:13.240]  situation. The police are shoving people shoving Alex shoving the crowd. Whether it's the radio show the news websites
[05:13.240 --> 05:17.480]  documentary films or the nightly news info wars is the tip of the spears. Is
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.640]  this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.760]  homelands security by sticking the hands down on the pants on the streets. It's up
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.680]  to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's
[05:27.680 --> 05:33.200]  what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do. You watch the Assad regime is going to be
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.480]  blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.680]  What we see now is a war against reality it's a war against the truth. It's more
[05:42.680 --> 05:47.240]  vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[05:47.240 --> 05:53.240]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family. Visit infowarsnews.com

[05:57.520 --> 06:13.160]  the next level in the councils of government we must guard against the
[06:13.160 --> 06:17.920]  acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the
[06:17.920 --> 06:31.760]  military industrial complex. It's a military mission in north st. Louis
[06:31.760 --> 06:36.040]  heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see
[06:36.040 --> 06:39.720]  those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood if you see
[06:39.720 --> 06:44.560]  military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis do not be alarmed guns will
[06:44.560 --> 06:49.080]  be taken no one will be able to be on yes take all weapons mr. and mrs. America
[06:49.080 --> 06:53.320]  turn them all in just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a
[06:53.320 --> 06:58.320]  vastly different way enough enough enough enough enough the Department of
[06:58.320 --> 07:02.960]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to
[07:02.960 --> 07:08.240]  like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition and it's canceling news 12 Jeff Burrell
[07:08.240 --> 07:11.760]  discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.160]  biggest problem us so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private
[07:16.160 --> 07:19.920]  idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and
[07:19.920 --> 07:23.480]  recognize that kids belong to whole communities if you got a business that
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.480]  you didn't build that somebody else made that happen
[07:27.480 --> 07:32.720]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[07:32.720 --> 07:36.960]  in the journal pediatrics black Hawk choppers soaring to the night sky but
[07:36.960 --> 07:41.880]  this is only a drill heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the
[07:41.880 --> 07:45.480]  suspect house-to-house
[07:50.680 --> 07:56.600]  it's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military
[07:56.600 --> 08:03.920]  I am in my apartment sir I am inside I have two words for you predator
[08:03.920 --> 08:12.320]  once you will never see it come the dramatic scene played out in front of
[08:12.320 --> 08:16.320]  our cameras parents grabbing their children and running after spending the
[08:16.320 --> 08:20.120]  night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the
[08:20.120 --> 08:23.880]  muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle they let them in the area they told them they
[08:23.880 --> 08:27.080]  could come in and now they're coming in like their trespassers punching and
[08:27.080 --> 08:31.600]  shoving people we're not running and we're not
[08:31.600 --> 08:42.320]  knocking down if you are on the march the Empire is on the run live from the
[08:42.320 --> 09:02.760]  info wars dot-com studios it's Alex Jones potential for the disastrous rise
[09:02.760 --> 09:17.440]  of misplaced power exists and will persist and that intro that you just
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.240]  heard or watched if you're watching the news and info wars dot-com forward slash
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.280]  show we simulcast TV here not just radio illustrates in three minutes 16
[09:26.280 --> 09:29.960]  seconds the police state that's not just building up here in the United States
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.800]  but worldwide and ladies and gentlemen governments across the planet and the
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.800]  special interests that control them are becoming more and more lawless thank you
[09:39.800 --> 09:45.440]  for joining us on this Sunday worldwide transmission it is the 18th day
[09:45.440 --> 09:52.800]  ladies and gentlemen again that is the 18th day of May 2014 I am your host
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.960]  Alex Jones and we see here in the United States the classical conversion of our
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.240]  police into paramilitaries we see the use of the military domestically we see the
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.400]  end-deposit commentatus and that's being done so that the offshore corporate
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.600]  interest that are anti-free market can take over and fully conquer this nation
[10:13.600 --> 10:17.920]  now last week we had a bunch of different news articles up at info wars
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.320]  dot-com and we're going to have staff sergeant Joe Biggs as an info wars
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.000]  reporter and investigative journalist David Knight in studio with us coming up
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  in the next three segments then we've got a bunch of news from legalizing
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.360]  violent felony legal aliens under Obama to the situation that's unfolding with
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.840]  the shutdown of beef production in this country under agenda 21 it is a jam packed
[10:40.840 --> 10:47.360]  broadcast coming up today but we see classical authoritarianism we've seen
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.080]  professors fired in the US in the news last week because they were exposing that
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.600]  global warming wasn't real and wasn't man-made and as a power grab we see
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.120]  reports banned in England of the times of London reported scientists and cover
[11:01.120 --> 11:04.440]  up of damaging climate view that the fact of the earth's getting colder and
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.760]  that we need carbon dioxide for plants to live they're being shut down we see
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.800]  the next to Susa having people that were going to be interviewed by him
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.400]  canceling because of federal threats and he's been arrested because he made a
[11:15.400 --> 11:22.320]  film against Obama Obama 2016 I mean this is creepville and if you get scared
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.760]  of it and have the chilling effect with the IRS going after anybody right of
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.120]  of Lucifer anybody right of Mao Zedong they're going to win they're going to
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.320]  take over are we really scared of these people they're totally illegitimate
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.600]  they've seized control the military they've seized control of most states of
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.040]  the police but most military and police are awake now and don't want to be part
[11:43.040 --> 11:49.000]  of this we've got to grow some guts and say no we've got to get involved and
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.240]  understand what's happening will destroy our future now here are some of the
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.440]  articles from the week leaked documents reveal Marine Corps Urban Training Center
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.320]  based on US town for domestic war against the American people in full wars
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.560]  dot-com a marine source gave us these secret documents but it's not secret in
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.620]  Forbes and Stars and Stripes and everywhere that oh the main enemy of the
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.600]  military and North com the northern command is the Tea Party returning
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.520]  veterans and gun owners that's all over the news we broke that six years ago
[12:16.520 --> 12:22.640]  now it's passé it's redundant we need to have a debate about this and ask why
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.000]  is this happening it's totally illegal it's totally creepy and it's being done
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.600]  because the system plans to end our free society now I sent my reporters David
[12:31.600 --> 12:38.860]  Knight and Joe Biggs up to Fort AP Hill in Virginia outside Bowling Green
[12:38.860 --> 12:42.400]  Virginia and they were there on Wednesday and Thursday they got back
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.800]  Friday they're gonna be in studio with us coming up and they went on the base
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.240]  big shut them as military IDs and I'm retired military blah blah blah they let
[12:50.240 --> 12:55.240]  them on inside the giant base is a 300 acre facility where they train with mock
[12:55.240 --> 13:00.000]  groups of Baptist churches public schools you name it and it's clearly for
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.600]  war domestically against the American people to acclimate the troops but more
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.400]  importantly the military Army Marine Corps FBI you name it training for
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.960]  insurgency in America with the Tea Party as the enemy and just like our
[13:13.960 --> 13:18.080]  military trained before Vietnam in jungle warfare just like it trained for a
[13:18.080 --> 13:24.240]  decade before for desert warfare before 1991 they're training and admitting the
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.120]  new enemy is a civil war ignited by special interests that want to fully
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.360]  conquer this country I don't want this to happen obviously that's an
[13:34.360 --> 13:39.400]  understatement this is so horrible and it's so real we have this article on
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.760]  Friday as well by Paul Joseph Watson up on info wars.com police now armed for
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.720]  war against returning veterans there's a video of this in an interview for Fox
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.120]  59 I should have played this last Friday but I should have played maybe
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.080]  we'll play later in the show it's up on info wars.com an interview with Fox 59
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.600]  and Morgan County Indiana police sergeant admits that the increasing
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.200]  militarization of domestic police departments is partly to deal with
[14:05.200 --> 14:09.520]  returning veterans who are now seen as a hometown terror threat again they're
[14:09.520 --> 14:13.160]  mainlining it this used to be secret when I first broke this six years ago
[14:13.160 --> 14:16.480]  with the my act report people didn't believe it Ron Paul called me and said
[14:16.480 --> 14:20.640]  Alex I know you're credible but is that really real I said call the phone
[14:20.640 --> 14:25.320]  number Ron Paul's office called me and it turned out it was real of course it
[14:25.320 --> 14:30.760]  was real this is now on Fox TV saying well we got armored vehicles and are
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.520]  training for war because we're about to have a war with the veterans oh this is
[14:36.520 --> 14:42.880]  insane in a chilling story entitled armed for war Pentagon surplus gives local
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.600]  police an edge we learn how a mine resident vehicle in rap which was once
[14:48.600 --> 14:51.480]  used during the occupation of Afghanistan will be patrolling the streets of
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.800]  central Indiana according to the report waiting for the war with veterans
[14:55.800 --> 15:01.440]  folks in the sitcoms the dramas the kids cartoons the movies the veterans the
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.960]  patriots the libertarians are going to blow up the government that's in sort of
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.360]  war it hasn't happened yet but the globalist are going to stage the terror
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.840]  attacks to say see they did it go arrest them and then a civil war will start
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.960]  because folks aren't going to the FEMA camp this is so real if you love your
[15:17.960 --> 15:23.720]  family admit over the years I've been right admit this stuff's real let's force
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.600]  a public debate about this let's say no and let's stop it but this video is so

[15:47.000 --> 15:50.720]  credentials that authorizes to be on it were taken away because it was a
[15:50.720 --> 15:54.560]  self-fulfilling prophecy the military thought they'd found terrorist after all
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.280]  one of them was a veteran and there's nothing more evil according to the new
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.280]  world order the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with

[20:35.640 --> 20:40.760]  standard time now I talked about this in the last segment and gave you some of
[20:40.760 --> 20:44.480]  the background about the leaked document reveals marine corps training center to
[20:44.480 --> 20:48.840]  take on the american people and some of these documents that are listed it talks
[20:48.840 --> 20:53.720]  about taking on americans against socialism americans against a new world
[20:53.720 --> 20:57.960]  order they're training to take on the tea party gun owners that's in Forbes
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.160]  magazine that's all over the news but they don't want reporters to go cover
[21:02.160 --> 21:06.480]  this and our reporters were there last wednesday and thursday david night and
[21:06.480 --> 21:11.760]  staff sergeant joe begs they did a great job that big is fort ap hill oh it's very
[21:11.760 --> 21:16.040]  spread out like I said it's about 10 15 minute drive to get back from the front
[21:16.040 --> 21:22.480]  gate to the asymmetric warfare group and so you know we were we'd never had any
[21:22.480 --> 21:25.560]  problems at the front gate I mean we expected that we're gonna have problems
[21:25.560 --> 21:29.560]  once we got in so once we were arrested nice tried to start the u-stream but
[21:29.560 --> 21:33.080]  unfortunately we just didn't have the bandwidth to really get you stream up I
[21:33.080 --> 21:35.800]  like you stream because I did a great job I mean obviously you're out there
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.800]  with a technology that's not a hundred percent but expanding on that they had
[21:39.800 --> 21:43.640]  even given you a slip of paper that time again that you could be in there but
[21:43.640 --> 21:46.800]  later when they came and arrested you they took that away yeah as soon as I
[21:46.800 --> 21:51.440]  pulled up the the MP ripped it from my hands asked me to pull over told me to
[21:51.440 --> 21:54.360]  turn the car off and then he took the keys from me and walked off and they
[21:54.360 --> 21:57.220]  threw that piece of paper away and that was kind of like my proof that I had
[21:57.220 --> 22:02.600]  gone through all the protocol to sign myself in on base and david as well now
[22:02.600 --> 22:07.640]  david's done amazing research over the weekend pulling up different pentagon
[22:07.640 --> 22:12.920]  briefings about this base to prove what it's really for I mean it's already on
[22:12.920 --> 22:16.400]  record but they're trying to hide that and we're gonna start getting that in a
[22:16.400 --> 22:20.520]  few minutes but first off Staff Sergeant Biggs David Knight you got in the day
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.800]  before openly shot video of the stuff that nobody else had gotten the churches
[22:23.800 --> 22:28.880]  the model of the US the subway system bottom line combat veteran you name it
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.400]  what is this facility for Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs well the main thing that it
[22:33.400 --> 22:36.680]  echoes in my mind every time in the military it's a long-standing saying
[22:36.680 --> 22:41.280]  you train how you fight you know I don't train to fight to go to Iraq in a
[22:41.280 --> 22:47.400]  jungle so would that be and said this center looks like America so what
[22:47.400 --> 22:50.440]  they're saying is their directive is we're training how we fight this is
[22:50.440 --> 22:54.280]  where the next fight is going to be and the asymmetric warfare colonel even says
[22:54.280 --> 22:58.560]  we're preparing for what's next well what is what's next you know what does
[22:58.560 --> 23:02.960]  that mean so that's the scary thing before Vietnam they train for jungle
[23:02.960 --> 23:07.240]  before the desert wars they train for that now they train for us yeah what
[23:07.240 --> 23:10.720]  about the facilities that you and David Knight found we have high-def video now
[23:10.720 --> 23:15.280]  on info wars.com with like boxes to put people in torture tables you said you
[23:15.280 --> 23:19.280]  delivered people up to things like that in Afghanistan yeah we had stuff you
[23:19.280 --> 23:24.280]  know set up in Afghanistan and this facility that area that was one of the
[23:24.280 --> 23:27.920]  unknown buildings that were marked on that map so it was right beside the
[23:27.920 --> 23:30.280]  madrasa or the school whatever you'd want to call it wherever they're
[23:30.280 --> 23:34.840]  classifying that as but that room had you know table set up with chairs the
[23:34.840 --> 23:39.320]  one had like a medical exam table and then also it had a panel that went
[23:39.320 --> 23:42.840]  underground so that could have been like some kind of holding you know hot box
[23:42.840 --> 23:45.640]  area where they want to keep someone until they get some information and you
[23:45.640 --> 23:49.600]  said that looks just like Afghanistan well those little areas yeah the way
[23:49.600 --> 23:54.600]  that was set up exactly but the issue is the rest of it's like America Baptist
[23:54.600 --> 23:58.880]  you know churches and stuff this look like a torture facility to you I don't
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.920]  know if that's exactly per se what they're using it for there but they were
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.960]  training they definitely do some kind of training in there for that I'm assuming
[24:05.960 --> 24:10.640]  I mean that looked like that to me to the T briefly you said you've delivered
[24:10.640 --> 24:14.320]  people in and heard the screams yeah we've had to even we've had to escort
[24:14.320 --> 24:19.280]  some people back to our compounds and then let these other government agency
[24:19.280 --> 24:24.560]  guys take over and take them in there and then you David your observations
[24:24.560 --> 24:28.520]  while you were there well you know Alex Madison said if oppression and tyranny
[24:28.520 --> 24:32.080]  ever come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.000]  everything in that town is small town America except for the mosque that's a
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.360]  beard in my opinion that's what that is it was I don't know what a beard is it's
[24:43.360 --> 24:47.920]  like gay guys and Ollie would have a fake wife exactly like Michelle Obama I
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.880]  mean that's their fake wife okay so it and the thing is just back in the end
[24:52.880 --> 24:55.480]  of March if you remember there was that press conference where they had the guy
[24:55.480 --> 25:00.040]  from Europe and he's talking to Putin and he's saying that the the NATO missiles
[25:00.040 --> 25:04.440]  that are appointed at Russia he said that's really against Iran and not Russia
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.280]  and remember Putin started laughing at him you know hysterically if we had
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.320]  Saddam Hussein for example training with airplanes with commercial airplane
[25:13.320 --> 25:17.560]  hulks you know had guys training to take them over what would we think do we
[25:17.560 --> 25:20.920]  think that he's training to take over airplanes and attack America as a
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.840]  terrorist what if Russia had an American city down to every detail we would
[25:25.840 --> 25:28.880]  freak out training yeah or China and they were running through there we would
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.040]  think wow this is a prelude to invasion why isn't it a prelude to invasion when
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.520]  our own military is doing it and when they do it over and over again in all
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.000]  these cities from LA to Chicago condition people exactly exactly so they're
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  doing it even more and on Friday we had the story from Mikhail Phelan about the
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.200]  Marines doing the same thing this time there is no mosque and in Camp Lejeune
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.400]  there's a Christian church and there's farm buildings that they've added to make
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.040]  it more American and that's what we saw there we stood at the corner of first and
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.280]  main street and I took Joe Biggs's picture as the security guard as
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.080]  security guard who let us in was driving driving by watching I'm taking his
[26:05.080 --> 26:10.680]  picture there at the corner of first and main with with newspaper stands in the
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.520]  background and phone booths phone booths and all the kind of stuff that you would
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.320]  typically and we've got the HD video that you guys got posted right now on this
[26:18.320 --> 26:22.840]  Sunday edition info wars.com and we've got this segment and two more coming up
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.920]  to break down what happened to you but also overall what this means because we
[26:26.920 --> 26:30.880]  have the articles and Forbes you name it training to crush the Tea Party the
[26:30.880 --> 26:34.120]  military's new mission I mean this should be the biggest debate in the
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.600]  country right now oh yeah yeah it's absolutely amazing to see this going on
[26:38.600 --> 26:42.680]  and of course they don't want to talk to anybody about this if they would talk
[26:42.680 --> 26:46.480]  to people about it I want to give her the opportunity to make your best case
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.200]  that this really isn't against the American people I mean we've seen it
[26:49.200 --> 26:52.360]  over and over again we see and by the way we called for three four months since
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.600]  February try to talk scent letters everything trying to go as real media
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.200]  and investigate this and finally you guys get arrested for three hours for
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.120]  going to do it because you're the enemy I mean they've been trained to fight
[27:03.120 --> 27:06.400]  veterans returning veterans is the number one enemy they train to fight so
[27:06.400 --> 27:09.400]  Joe you're the enemy showing up well asymmetric warfare group put out a
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.600]  document saying that any any soldiers that don't support agenda 21 are
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.000]  considered to be extremists and you know points to look at for in a soldier like
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.600]  patterns and behavior buying weapons and distancing themselves from the brass
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.960]  to top brass is considered an extremist movement and to be watched and flagged is
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.280]  this not just a collaborator globalist movement that sees control of the whole
[27:35.280 --> 27:38.920]  infrastructure and is now saying anybody that doesn't accept the takeover tea
[27:38.920 --> 27:42.760]  party evangelical Christians libertarians were terrorist that right
[27:42.760 --> 27:46.560]  there tells us David this is an occupied government well when you watch this
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.480]  conference that they had eight years ago everything that the senator for
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.520]  asymmetric warfare is about is of course warfare is warfare against what they
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.560]  call insurgents which be people who rebelling against what they they want
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.040]  to do and they're saying that this is not religiously motivated is motivated by
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.120]  people who see their resources being taken away who are being dominated who
[28:07.120 --> 28:13.240]  have no self-determination who had their dignity taken away slaves exactly and so
[28:13.240 --> 28:16.760]  what do we see in America we see them coming in and taking our dignity away
[28:16.760 --> 28:20.520]  they're taking our private property away and they understand this is
[28:20.520 --> 28:23.920]  politically motivated they understand that people will rise up and rebellion
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.360]  when they see that happen if that can't be stopped and so instead of correcting
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.480]  the problem they're doubling down to fight us and that's what the insurgency
[28:33.480 --> 28:36.560]  is about we ought to pull up that weatherman clip that came out in
[28:36.560 --> 28:39.520]  testimony in federal court where they said they're gonna put 50 million of us
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.840]  in camps and kill 25 million David Knight staff sergeant Joe Biggs are our
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.040]  guests we got two more segments in this first hour coming up and then we're

[32:08.120 --> 32:12.120]  are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced

[33:37.120 --> 33:43.480]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs Army Combat Veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq is here

[33:47.000 --> 33:51.880]  show sometimes in Forrest Nightly News okay you've got a bunch to cover breaking
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.320]  this down a bunch of clips so you guys have got the floor in this segment the
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.720]  next to go over this well Alex one of the things that I was looking at as we
[33:59.720 --> 34:03.640]  were going out there was a conference that they had in 2006 the Center for
[34:03.640 --> 34:07.720]  Asymmetric Warfare and that kind of gives their overall view their
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.080]  strategic view of what the problems were with the insurgency in Iraq and I
[34:12.080 --> 34:15.240]  thought there were some amazing parallels to the Tea Party to what's
[34:15.240 --> 34:19.360]  happening in America but to start out with this what is legitimate government
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.000]  this is Dr. John Esposito Georgetown University his professor of Religion
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.960]  International Affairs he'd said earlier in the conference that this is
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.440]  absolutely not about religion this is about political and economic self
[34:31.440 --> 34:34.480]  determination this is when people feel like they've lost their freedoms they
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.360]  have no control over their lives that's what's really motivating him he said
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.720]  religion provides a framework for that but it's this other stuff it's the
[34:41.720 --> 34:45.760]  bitter clingers that don't like globalism exactly and he said what is
[34:45.760 --> 34:49.920]  legitimate government let's play that clip the bottom line which I think should
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.080]  be a no-brainer but there's still some debate about it among different people
[34:53.080 --> 34:59.480]  is that the primary cause it has to do with political grievances with the issue
[34:59.480 --> 35:04.200]  of occupation power distribution of political power not with religion of
[35:04.200 --> 35:09.320]  bad theology but religion plays an important role and I'll refer to that
[35:09.320 --> 35:14.640]  in a second so they're calling people that are resisting occupation terrorists
[35:14.640 --> 35:18.440]  exactly and so there's a lot of parallels to what they see going on in
[35:18.440 --> 35:21.800]  Iraq and all these other countries that they've invaded they see that same
[35:21.800 --> 35:25.520]  thing happening here in America that's why I think it makes perfectly good
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.440]  sense from their standpoint from their perspective the Tea Party groups are
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.080]  analogous to the Muslims that they're fighting in foreign countries because
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.280]  they're both concerned about their loss of self-determination their loss of
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.200]  dignity but he has a clip there where he says how do we determine what these
[35:42.200 --> 35:45.160]  regional governments are that are legitimate which ones are legitimate and
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.720]  he goes well a good yardstick is to see how dependent they are on security for
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.320]  their stability in other words a more they have to crack the whip on people
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.960]  ramping up security in order to keep the country stable that shows you that it's
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.520]  an illegitimate government what does it say when we've got a 9% approval rate
[36:01.520 --> 36:05.200]  of Congress and they're hammering us with the militarization of the police
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.840]  absolutely North Korea is militarized it's illegitimate Mexico is militarized
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.920]  it's illegitimate America's Miller to rise it's illegitimate exactly and I
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.280]  want to play this clip to of the eliminate the true believers guys this is a
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.200]  colonel he's a retired U.S. Marines and he was in it for a very long time he
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.160]  took pride in the fact that he never was part of the Pentagon he never had any
[36:28.160 --> 36:33.080]  any assignments of the Pentagon he was always in the field and listen to what
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.720]  he says about true believers these guys who are coming in are the most dangerous
[36:38.720 --> 36:42.640]  of all because they're true believers and true believers whether they're Muslim
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.000]  and their Christian or their Marine are dangerous people because there is no
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.960]  other way other than their way and you've got to either you've got to
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.440]  eliminate them unbelievable you got to eliminate anybody that has some hard
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.640]  core principle you don't want to have your five-year-old taught how to be have
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.600]  sex by the public school well you've got to be eliminated and he includes in
[37:05.600 --> 37:10.280]  there you know he's a Marine he includes in their Marines he doesn't want Marines
[37:10.280 --> 37:13.400]  who are true believers maybe they truly believe in the Constitution no no they
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.320]  say with number one terror threat is veterans they're coming after the
[37:18.320 --> 37:20.680]  people they've already used they know that we've gone over there and we've
[37:20.680 --> 37:24.920]  seen what's behind the curtain and they know that you know we all went in there
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.120]  with this belief that we were going to be fighting for this pure thing and then
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.920]  now we see the evil back there and we're standing up and all of a sudden
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.040]  patriots are now the new terrorists that's right you got to eliminate the
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.280]  people with a mindset of Captain America can we play that again and tell
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.080]  folks who this is saying that this is Colonel T. H. Haymes H-A-M-M-E-S retired
[37:44.080 --> 37:48.120]  U.S. Marines and this is the Center for Asymmetric Warfare conference back in
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.960]  2006 eight years ago I gotta say this is really creepy how did you dig this up
[37:51.960 --> 37:54.960]  it's on YouTube it's on their YouTube now but what made you think to go find it
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.240]  well I'm looking to see anything I can about the Center for Asymmetric Warfare
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.880]  and they've only had a couple hundred people watch this over eight years but
[38:01.880 --> 38:04.920]  nobody's paying it wow let's play that clip one more time these guys who are
[38:04.920 --> 38:09.880]  coming in are the most dangerous of all because they're true believers and true
[38:09.880 --> 38:13.440]  believers whether they're Muslim their Christian or their Marine are dangerous
[38:13.440 --> 38:17.760]  people because there is no other way other than their way and you've got to
[38:17.760 --> 38:25.560]  either you've got to eliminate them guys can you pull up later the FBI clip
[38:25.560 --> 38:30.000]  for the next time where they the weathermen said they had to kill the
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.280]  American people because we're true believers I mean this is really creepy
[38:34.280 --> 38:41.000]  talk oh yeah scary and and the same guy also says he talks about the poverty of
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.320]  dignity if you guys can pull that clip up and he says it's not about specific
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.120]  causes it's about not having control of one's life go ahead and play that clip
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.920]  the course is really the poverty of dignity that Dr. Esposito explained so
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.400]  clearly it's not about specific causes as much about as I have no control of my
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.320]  life and whatever I'm rallying around whether it's the tamils the Chechens
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.840]  the Sunnis Islamic it's really about getting control and having a say in how
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.160]  my life runs oh that's so evil that people having the globalist run over
[39:13.160 --> 39:16.320]  them want to run their own lives and their own government that is so evil
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.120]  that sounds almost as bad as George Washington you know Alex when my wife
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.720]  was getting her master's degree in education one of the class classes
[39:23.720 --> 39:26.880]  that they had to take was a BS Skinner class and the title of the book was
[39:26.880 --> 39:29.840]  Beyond Freedom and Dignity a lot of people are familiar with that has been
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.720]  widely read the idea is that it's a deterministic behavior modification
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.800]  treating people as if they were animals and removing their freedom and their
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.440]  dignity he was absolutely opposed to that and that's what we see happening
[39:42.440 --> 39:47.200]  TSA is a perfect example of that taking your dignity not just your freedom but
[39:47.200 --> 39:50.480]  your dignity and that's what this colonel is talking about he said it's the
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.400]  poverty of dignity that is motivating these people to rise up against the
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.120]  he's basically saying free will exactly exactly what's the next clip well the
[40:01.120 --> 40:06.760]  next clip is and I think this is kind of interesting this is from a Dr. Hoffman
[40:06.760 --> 40:14.040]  and he's talking about the US having an unbroken string of defeats I think it's
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.360]  safe to say that the United States has now nearly an unbroken string of
[40:18.360 --> 40:23.040]  frustration and fighting insurgencies over the fast for the past four decades
[40:23.040 --> 40:28.560]  beginning certainly with Vietnam in the 1960s continuing with El Salvador in the
[40:28.560 --> 40:32.200]  1980s especially during the first five or six years of our now they want to start
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.160]  a war with American people that's culminating for the Iraqis budding and
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.440]  doing rock the response to insurgency against TX had said and just to
[40:41.440 --> 40:45.840]  emphasize this repeated must focus on the political as well as the military
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.800]  dimension so again he info war to the political exactly but the things are
[40:50.800 --> 40:53.920]  top professors by the way that's a top Georgetown professor and this is a guy
[40:53.920 --> 40:56.920]  from the Rand Corporation he spent a long time at the Rand Corporation he's
[40:56.920 --> 41:00.840]  talking essentially about America's had an unbroken string of defeats and Rand
[41:00.840 --> 41:04.520]  Corporation came up with a plan to occupy America with military forces yes
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.520]  yes it's the national stability system the good thing is is that they
[41:08.520 --> 41:13.600]  understand that they haven't won any of these counterinsurgency wars they
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.480]  haven't won any of the co-intel programs and they are not winning with high tech
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.480]  weaponry and that's one of the other things that this Marine Colonel Hames
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.600]  was talking about he said low-tech usually wins and you don't have to have
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.080]  air superiority to win that's what they've they've seen they're always
[41:31.080 --> 41:34.840]  saying that the globalist can take us over it's the opposite your experience
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.840]  big well the scary thing is for once you know yesterday being on the other side
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.240]  of the other fence in a sense you know I when I came in per se I was on the dark
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.840]  side you know and I was taught to look and treat people like just objects you
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.120]  know when you know when someone came to me I didn't care about any kind of
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.520]  personal problems they had they were just a being that was in front of me and I
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.680]  didn't care what they said and just ignore them pushing aside and I had my
[42:02.680 --> 42:08.600]  mission to complete it was crazy being on that other side yesterday and being a
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.840]  victim of that I mean it's a it's a scary thing to see that you've got these
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.120]  guys with this kind of power that don't even look at you like you even exist in
[42:18.120 --> 42:24.200]  any kind of way and you're just some just flesh and bone and then they can just
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.320]  do whatever they want and they're training for a total treason mission to
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.120]  overthrow America and take our guns steadily they're doing it steadily they
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.440]  don't want to do it all and these guys all know what they're doing these rank

[42:40.080 --> 42:44.080]  right total contempt for any transparency they don't want to snow anything

[47:16.280 --> 47:20.520]  here to build the big guns
[47:20.520 --> 47:28.640]  here to build the best planes. That's Bob Dylan bringing us in. Joe Biggs is with us
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.760]  David Knight our reporters I'm Alex Jones your host second hour coming up
[47:32.760 --> 47:36.920]  jam-packed as well with Jacarie Jackson Leigh Ann McAdoo Joe Biggs has got some
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.040]  reports we're going to premiere here on the radio where you go out and talk to
[47:41.040 --> 47:44.600]  folks about you know can the average US citizen answer any questions off the
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.040]  citizenship test there's a reason we've gotten in this bad position and that
[47:48.040 --> 47:51.440]  these brand corporation people and Georgetown professors and Marine Corps
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.160]  officers can just sit around talking about anybody that wants freedom like
[47:55.160 --> 47:58.760]  their trash and now we're the corporate board you will be assimilated it's all
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.400]  over but I want to play this clip here this is Larry Graf wall just died last
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.520]  year highly decorated Green Beret Vietnam came back infiltrated for the FBI
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.200]  this is all confirmed in court weathermen admitted it he helped convict them
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.320]  bombing police stations and stuff and they he was in the meetings where they
[48:17.320 --> 48:22.040]  said we're gonna put 50 million mainly rural conservatives in FEMA camps and
[48:22.040 --> 48:27.920]  then we're going to kill 25 million of them now you just heard earlier the
[48:27.920 --> 48:30.720]  clip where they said anybody that's a true believer who won't accept what we
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.800]  want who won't accept total control got to be killed well here's what the
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.200]  communists had to say and then you understand how much trouble we're in
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.480]  and what this takeover is all about and they felt that this counter-revolution
[48:45.480 --> 48:51.640]  could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education
[48:51.640 --> 48:58.600]  centers in the Southwest where we would take all the people who needed to be
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.520]  re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.000]  going to be I asked well what is going to happen to those people that we can't
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.120]  re-educate better die hard cap capitalists and the reply was that they'd
[49:15.120 --> 49:20.320]  have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further they estimated that
[49:20.320 --> 49:26.080]  they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers and
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.920]  when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people I want you to imagine
[49:31.920 --> 49:40.240]  sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees from
[49:40.240 --> 49:47.000]  Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.560]  figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.240]  they were dead serious you're not gonna make jokes about Michelle Obama and
[49:57.240 --> 50:00.440]  Barack Obama and stuff and you know say they're goofy or whatever quite
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.200]  frankly I don't care what Barack Obama does in his private life I don't like
[50:03.200 --> 50:06.080]  the fact that he calls gun owners conservatives and Christians bitter
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.200]  clingers who they're going to defeat these people have a beef with us staff
[50:10.200 --> 50:13.800]  sergeant bigs what is your take on seeing the Marine Corps officers talk
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.400]  like that and then flipping it back to the communists talking like that it's
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.200]  something that's just been steadily building up you know that they keep
[50:21.200 --> 50:23.920]  releasing these documents and these commanders are pushing out these
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.320]  directives to the lower chain commanders at you know battalion levels to watch
[50:28.320 --> 50:31.880]  for these soldiers who have these true that are true believers you know
[50:31.880 --> 50:38.520]  patriots who collect guns and who go shooting and who you know talk about the
[50:38.520 --> 50:42.080]  Constitution and who are very pro-American these are the ones that
[50:42.080 --> 50:46.680]  they want to look for those are the ones that get flagged per se and are
[50:46.680 --> 50:50.320]  watched close we're now being identified as the enemy yes and it's
[50:50.320 --> 50:54.000]  ridiculous it's a preparatory phase what about the last document that came out
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.440]  where it said Americans opposed to a socialist New World Order I just don't
[50:58.440 --> 51:02.240]  get I mean I joined because I thought it was good to be a patriot and your dad
[51:02.240 --> 51:05.400]  was in the army my dad was in the Marine Corps Marine Corps yeah you know what
[51:05.400 --> 51:08.480]  you know I joined because I wanted to be a patriot I want to do something for my
[51:08.480 --> 51:13.520]  country and now it's been flipped that me doing that is evil and now the
[51:13.520 --> 51:19.240]  government wants to track me and put me on no fly list and you know take my
[51:19.240 --> 51:22.000]  rights from less because they're done with you now they got robots coming out
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.720]  yeah they're scared that I know a lot of the stuff back there you know they
[51:24.720 --> 51:29.040]  don't want me talking about the things that I've seen how the DEA you know have
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.000]  us guard certain you know heroin crop fields and you know burn down some
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.600]  other ones you know and pick and take these people these little areas and
[51:36.600 --> 51:40.480]  have them tortured they don't like that and they're mad that we see this and we
[51:40.480 --> 51:44.400]  get teed off about it and we speak out and now we're labeled a terrorist I
[51:44.400 --> 51:48.800]  mean it's scary and by the way you know you're in a major escort right up with
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.680]  the late Michael Hastings show a lot of this stuff's documented on record of
[51:52.680 --> 51:55.920]  your new listener about Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs we only got about six seven
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.120]  minutes left in this hour David Knight let's get to some more of these clips
[51:59.120 --> 52:04.800]  well Alex we've got one from a Colonel who is talking about low-tech wins and
[52:04.800 --> 52:08.600]  this is also the same Colonel who said that true believers have to be eliminated
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.080]  with their Muslim Christian or Marines and listen to what he says because I
[52:12.080 --> 52:17.880]  think this is something that we can can look at and and take some hope in character
[52:17.880 --> 52:21.880]  of the war never changes so what's the enduring characteristics of insurgency
[52:21.880 --> 52:26.400]  the first and most important is that it is political in nature not military
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.800]  everybody understands the West's critical vulnerability is our political will
[52:30.800 --> 52:34.680]  and one of the interesting aspects with our love of technology is that pretty
[52:34.680 --> 52:40.040]  regularly the low technology side wins the argument that no one has ever won a
[52:40.040 --> 52:46.440]  war without air superiority is not quite true they're protracted think decades
[52:46.440 --> 52:50.200]  and this is another problem we really have in the US we really want to think a
[52:50.200 --> 52:54.760]  long war is three or four years the Chinese fought for 27 the Vietnamese
[52:54.760 --> 53:00.920]  for 30 the Palestinians have been at it since 1968 and this war that is coming
[53:00.920 --> 53:05.480]  towards us is something that's been planned by the globalist for century or
[53:05.480 --> 53:09.160]  longer right we've talked about this where this is coming from it is a very
[53:09.160 --> 53:12.760]  long protracted gradual thing because they're using their lessons from other
[53:12.760 --> 53:16.400]  countries and phrasing it like it's the West in America no it's the global
[53:16.400 --> 53:20.600] ist hijacking America well this technology is taking war from being
[53:20.600 --> 53:25.160]  personal and making it non-personal you know I'm saying it when you go and you
[53:25.160 --> 53:29.240]  stab someone you look in their eyes you see their eyes dilate that's a personal
[53:29.240 --> 53:33.360]  horrific experience now we have all these drones and you push a button and
[53:33.360 --> 53:36.960]  you know and David was telling me a story about a kid who flew
[53:36.960 --> 53:40.280]  drones he was going through a simulator and he killed a kid and in effect and
[53:40.280 --> 53:44.080]  you wanted to talk about it you know they're given pilots who fly these
[53:44.080 --> 53:50.080]  drones purple hearts for carpal tunnel syndrome this is ridiculous when you
[53:50.080 --> 53:54.160]  when you take war and you make it not personal anymore that's when it runs
[53:54.160 --> 54:00.040]  rampant I mean no one it's easy to sit in Washington and have these millions of
[54:00.040 --> 54:03.040]  people killed but you wouldn't be for war so much if you've been blown up in
[54:03.040 --> 54:09.720]  armored vehicles like you have yeah it's just I find it repulsive that we're it's
[54:09.720 --> 54:13.840]  just it's even hard to put in words you know Alex I see people over and over
[54:13.840 --> 54:17.600]  again to look at something the government is doing to say how could they be
[54:17.600 --> 54:21.600]  that wasteful or why don't our schools teach Johnny to read and write they
[54:21.600 --> 54:24.520]  don't understand what the real purpose of the schools are and they don't
[54:24.520 --> 54:28.520]  understand it's to suppress you being a free thinker and and and having ideas
[54:28.520 --> 54:32.080]  they're saying that if ideas are bulletproof and you hold on to something
[54:32.080 --> 54:35.920]  that's evil in and of itself that you're even a person that you even have
[54:35.920 --> 54:40.160]  things you stand for you've got to stand for something or you fall for anything
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.000]  well I guess Aaron Tippett has to be eliminated because he sung that country
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.080]  song well in Vietnam too though if someone went against the norm they would
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.880]  just shoot them they'd pick up an enemy weapon shoot them in the back and blame
[54:52.880 --> 54:57.440]  it on that it's the same thing with Pat Tillman if you don't believe what they
[54:57.440 --> 55:03.920]  want you to go along with you're dead but meanwhile it's not like you're even
[55:03.920 --> 55:06.640]  dead in some emergency situation where your country's been overrun and that's
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.320]  war the globalists are going to screw our way of life seven ways to Sunday we
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.520]  don't want to go where they're taking us well I hope people are going to wake up
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.240]  to this because the analogy I was going to use with education was for the longest
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.280]  time people didn't really understand these the nature of why they were
[55:23.280 --> 55:26.720]  creating these government schools as a social engineering thing now they're
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.120]  seeing it pretty clearly when you've got the story that you covered this last
[55:30.120 --> 55:34.800]  week about them glorifying homosexual relationships for very very young
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.160]  children how they're applauding it it was like this sick kind of Sesame Street
[55:38.160 --> 55:41.880]  situation now they're seeing it with Common Core they're starting to get an
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.040]  idea that they really don't want to teach Johnny to read and write that the
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.040]  institution isn't fundamentally broken that it's doing exactly what it was
[55:50.040 --> 55:54.560]  designed to do and that's what we have to get people to understand about these
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.800]  asymmetric warfare centers and the training that's going on against the
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.240]  American people they're doing exactly what they're they're planning to do and
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.360]  we need to understand where this is headed and people just aren't paying
[56:06.360 --> 56:09.200]  attention unfortunately I mean we see that's right we've got a couple more
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.200]  clips you want to get to those actually yeah I kind of I didn't think we're
[56:14.200 --> 56:16.840]  going to play all these well there's so many tell us about some of the other
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.480]  clips when you've been watching this well we've got over and over again we have
[56:21.480 --> 56:26.480]  dr. John Esposito we've got also the lieutenant the colonel full colonel
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.960]  retired Haynes they're talking about how this is politically motivated how this
[56:31.960 --> 56:37.000]  is motivated by people who are actually some of the more some of the better
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  educated more optimistic people in the society yeah that's why Pol Pot targeted
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.600]  people that can read exactly we're good people exactly as we don't like their
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.360]  sickening takeover so we've got to be eliminated this one here this radicals
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.480]  are politically motivated guys if you can play this one this is from dr. John
[56:52.480 --> 56:55.840]  Esposito and of course he's a professor of religion and international affairs and
[56:55.840 --> 57:01.000]  they took a survey of a billion Muslims to see who were the guys that were
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.560]  radicals who are the potential radicals and here's what they found when you
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.120]  actually look at the moderates and the potential radicals there's very little
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.000]  difference when it comes to issues of religion and when you look at potential
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  radicals often in terms of a significant number of them they tend to be better
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  educated they actually tend to be more optimistic but they feel more intensely
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.120]  concerns about America's role in particular and the West's role more
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.680]  generally we're out of time guys great job the point is being a human having
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.960]  values period and not something you can just overwrite like a disc that's what's

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.600]  this country because they have the moral high ground they're the progressives
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  they're the liberals why you gotta raise taxes on the middle class or you hate

[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:43.340]  worldwide Sunday original transmission the 18th day of May 2014 now we're gonna
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.740]  go to a piece that our very own jacari Jackson has been four wars nightly news
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:54.860]  weeknights at seven put together what Ted Cruz's Obama report missed well Ted
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.780]  Cruz got into a lot of it but he didn't bring up stuff like five billion and
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.780]  counting for the Obamacare website it's like a cylindra payoff to his political
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.860]  buddies and a bunch of former White House officials that run the website oh
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.900]  yeah five billion for a website that's impeachable right there because it's to
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.740]  people that work for him I mean this is just happening out in the open or what
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.020]  about Joe Biden son after the West over through the Ukrainian government taking
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:22.340]  over the gas company there or what about Obama releasing last week 36,000
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.500]  illegal aliens who had violent crime records aggravated assault felons
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:33.180]  rapist child rapist bank robbers this is the lawlessness and look if the
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.420]  Republicans are in power doing stuff like this I'll be against them but I've
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.460]  never seen anything like what's happening with the Obamanoids it's a
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:47.900]  serious serious serious situation so here is that report breaking down what
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:53.740]  Ted Cruz missed in his report on hair Obama then we'll be back after the break
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:59.180]  with a ton of news that I haven't even gotten to yet stay with us senator Ted
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.500]  Cruz of Texas has released a report detailing the abuses by the Obama
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.580]  administration the list is well compiled and includes things like misguiding the
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:12.340]  press on Benghazi as well as ordering Boeing to fire 1,000 employees in South
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:17.140]  Carolina as good as the report is here are 10 items that it doesn't include
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.340]  number 10 the White House ignoring petitions they encourage citizens to
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.980]  file now there are petitions that request the building of a functioning
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.860]  Death Star but those are contrasted by very practical request to label GMOs
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.700]  number nine wasteful spending surrounding the affectionately labeled
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:40.180]  Obama phone program Baltimore City resident Monique Crawford has plenty of
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.380]  cell phones I have about like six of my personnel and a few more at home each
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.540]  and every one of these phones work at home I know I have about 30 and all I'm
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:54.540]  on but how did she manage to amass such a cellular jackpot how long did it take
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.940]  you to get all these phones five ten minutes to get this one just now I
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:02.220]  walked out was this one just now well partly thanks to you that's because
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:07.180]  anyone who pays a cell phone bill also subsidizes the phones filling up Monique's
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:13.020]  purse courtesy of a charge buried in your monthly bill called a universal access
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.660]  fee number eight denying a Christian family's request for asylum while
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:21.900]  granting driver's licenses to undocumented California workers who can
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:27.140]  sneak past Border Patrol number seven refusing to debate climate change while
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.540]  intentionally bankrupting the coal industry so if somebody wants to build a
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.620]  coal-powered plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:40.940]  going to be charged a huge sum energy prices double greenhouse gas bankrupting
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:45.620]  America number six the half-baked so-called investigation into the
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:50.260]  murder of sill team six if you so much care mr. Jones and they gave you a book
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:54.820]  with no way I was with my mom yesterday she said you lucky their lucky
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.940]  grandpa ain't alive he'd be going right through the front doors of that white
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:03.660]  ass at the Obama you know we need some answers here somebody has to be out of
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.980]  countable I just don't want to hear was a bad plan lucky shot on Apple I need
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.580]  somebody to go to jail this is murder this is murder mr. Jones my son knew
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.660]  in June somebody was setting them up but he didn't take somebody on his own side
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.100]  number five blaming the side for chemical weapons attacks when there is
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:27.300]  video evidence of Syrian rebels carrying out at least one attack yesterday the
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:31.700]  United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.980]  responsible for this attack on its own people you got a business you didn't
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.660]  build that intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:46.700]  chemical weapons launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.380]  and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place number four
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:56.180]  never shutting down Guantanamo Bay where human rights violations continue to
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.500]  take place I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo and I will
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.700]  follow through on that I've said repeatedly that America doesn't torture
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:11.020]  and I'm gonna make sure that we don't torture those are those are part and
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:19.620]  parcel of an effort to regain America's moral stature in the world number three
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.580]  telling his former press secretary to act as if the drone program never existed
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.060]  when I went through the process of becoming press secretary one of the
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.900]  things one of the first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:37.300]  the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists and so I would
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.300]  get a question like that and literally I couldn't tell you what major asked
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.900]  because once I figured out it was about the drone program I realized I'm not
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.580]  supposed to talk about number two blatantly targeting the second
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:53.420]  amendment what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:15:01.220]  we reduce the violence generally part of it is seeing if we can get an assault
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:05.820]  weapons ban reintroduced but part of it is also looking at other sources of the
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.460]  violence because frankly in my hometown of Chicago there's an awful lot of
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.340]  violence and they're not using AK-47s they're using cheap handguns and number
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:19.380]  one lying to America's face if you've got health care already then you can keep
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.860]  your plan if you are satisfied with it if you like the plan you have you can
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.180]  keep it I intend to keep this promised if you like your health care plan you'll
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.900]  be able to keep your health care plan you like your plan and your doctor you
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:35.100]  can keep them you'll be able to keep your health care plan if you like your plan
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.180]  you keep your plan you like your doctor you like your plan you can keep your
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:43.080]  doctor you can keep your plan you like your current insurance you keep that
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.280]  insurance. Period. Much like senator Cruz we can't include all the abuses
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.980]  because we simply don't have enough time to go through them all but you can find
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:56.060]  and all these and much more on infowars.com.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.620]  That's right folks, we'll be right back
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:58.460]  after this break.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.300]  Stay with us.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.380]  General, what do you think about the FBI
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.620]  saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.500]  about a potential courthood situation?
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.900]  The police are shoving people,
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.900]  shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.580]  Here we go folks, I'm being a sergeant.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.820]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites,
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.620]  documentary films, or the nightly news,
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.860]  info wars is the tip of the spear.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.740]  Is this another false flight stage attack
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.780]  to take our civil liberties
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.140]  to promote Homeland Security?
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.900]  Sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.940]  It's up to us to set brush fires
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.820]  in the minds of men and women everywhere,
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.940]  and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.340]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.020]  or accused of using chemical weapons
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.220]  against the so-called rebels.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.300]  What we see now is a war against reality,
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.700]  it's a war against the truth.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.820]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.340]  become members of prisonplanet.tv

[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.420]  The globalist social engineers
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.420]  are not just targeting us with propaganda,
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.860]  they are manipulating our genetics.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.380]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.940]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.420]  and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.700]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.860]  pharmacists, and others, we have developed
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.740]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO,
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.860]  organic super male vitality formula
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.460]  sourced from powerful organic herbs

[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.820]  Super male vitality was developed

[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.700]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.700]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.340]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.980]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.620]  had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.900]  What are the health effects
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.260]  of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.540]  It's forced medical treatment
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.260]  without the consent of residents.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.700]  My friend's water filtration
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.740]  is one of the most basic actions you can take
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.100]  to protect you and your family
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.820]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.060]  On average, the county says
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.780]  it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.900]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.180]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.700]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:37.260]  hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.780]  All right, it is in teeths and coffins and waters
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.060]  and breads and toothpaste.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.780]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.260]  The establishment's not gonna do it.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.620]  It's time to take action.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.500]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.220]  From the water table to our soils,
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.700]  to the atmosphere itself,
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:07.260]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.540]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.100]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.860]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.340]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.060]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.340]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.860]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.420]  linked to numerous conditions.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.780]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.820]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.700]  When I began to research these statistics,
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.220]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.540]  in order to combat the toxic environment
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.980]  that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.740]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.460]  and manufactured in the USA,
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.980]  the new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleanse is here
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.340]  in a convenient spray bottle
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.700]  that can be brought with you throughout
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.900]  any toxic environment.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.980]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com

[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:04.500]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:08.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.940]  Network.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:15.220]  The Answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.260]  What's going on in our world
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.860]  as we sit here on this Sunday afternoon
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.260]  broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.060]  A few minutes we'll look at
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.060]  Leanne McAdoo's report from InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.180]  Just when you think occultic imagery
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.460]  and all the weird satanic rituals on national television
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.060]  couldn't get any more in your face,
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:56.660]  a new science proves that vampires and satanists
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.500]  have been saying for years.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.860]  Blood from the young is the secret to eternal life.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.140]  This is really weird what's coming up with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.900]  Just how this useful blood will be acquired, however,
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.500]  remains to be seen.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.620]  That is coming up.
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:16.220]  But I tell you, all this technology has a wind in it.
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:19.140]  There's a wind on down the road, my friends.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:22.540]  And there's a wind on down the road.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.540]  Our shadows talla, that are so, there is a lady.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.340]  There was a lady we all know.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.220]  Who shines bright light?
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.380]  Who shines bright light and wants to shine.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.740]  We're gonna be breaking it all down,
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.580]  coming up here in just a few minutes
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:46.980]  on this original Worldwide Sunday Transmission.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.100]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.900]  Please don't forget that we return
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.260]  to the airwaves, ladies and gentlemen, weekdays,
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.500]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central,
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.700]  and the news sites are infowars.com,
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.180]  prismplanet.com, and prismplanet.tv.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.180]  You know, I already talked about five billion
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.980]  and counting for Obamacare website
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.940]  to all his insiders and buddies.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.100]  But I'll tell you the good news.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.620]  I've got some good news here for you.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.260]  Politico last, I guess it was Thursday,
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.020]  I saw this article, but I wanted to go back over,
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.620]  kind of a weekend review, looking forward to the next week.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.460]  The headline was Drudge National Review Spur.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.580]  I always pronounce this wrong.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.380]  Do you say sassy or you say sassy?
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.260]  It's sassy, that's Swiss.
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.420]  Drudge National Review Spur's sass win.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.900]  The Drudge Report National Review both deserve
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.580]  a share of the credit for Republican Ben Sasse victory
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.020]  in last Tuesday's Nebraska Senate primary victory.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:46.860]  And it goes on.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.540]  He was a Tea Party candidate that the GOP had been attacking,
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.720]  just like they attacked Ted Cruz and they attacked Rand Paul.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.180]  And just like the Republican leadership
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.060]  was trying to prop up Obamacare and go after the Tea Party
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.780]  because they're basically just part of the Democratic Party.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.540]  But because new independent real media is now bigger
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.180]  than old dinosaur whore media,
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.700]  sure they got a lot of perfume on them
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.220]  and a lot of lipstick, it's still a pig.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.420]  He was able to get elected.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.900]  Now I'm not saying it's a panacea
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.700]  or not elected one of the primary.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.020]  I'm not saying it's a panacea,
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.580]  but whoever the establishment's attacking,
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.420]  you better believe if somebody we should be supporting
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.620]  because it doesn't fit into their grand plan.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.620]  Now continuing, speaking of grand plan,
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.900]  look, demographically, the United States population
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.760]  has 1.3 children for every two adults.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.660]  So we needed immigrants to come here.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.540]  But we've got seven plus billion people
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.020]  that wanna come here worldwide.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.460]  There's only 300 million people in this country.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.820]  We've got close to seven billion that wanna come here.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.540]  We should want skilled workers.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.260]  People that don't come here and get on welfare
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.780]  and become socialist day one to vote for gun control
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.380]  is some right of passage.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.860]  And last week, this really caught people's attention.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.820]  That's a good thing.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:02.380]  The release of 36,000 illegal alien criminals,
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.540]  but not criminals because they were here illegally.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:09.820]  No, aggravated felons, rape, robbery, arson,
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.380]  and Obama ordered them release.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.660]  It just shows the total lawlessness,
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.220]  while meanwhile, as these murders, rapists, drug dealers
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.420]  are turned loose by DHS.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.700]  I saw an article earlier this week
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.820]  in the Associated Press where the DHS
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.700]  is raiding swap meets around the country
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:30.700]  looking for counterfeit goods and going after garage sales.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.460]  So they wanna shut down lemonade stands
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.860]  and shut down little girls selling mistletoe
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.500]  at the Christmas parade,
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.500]  but they do not want us to go after the corruption
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.660]  in government.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.540]  Just when you thought a cult worship
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.580]  couldn't get more mainstream,
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.140]  the Illuminati's media is now actively promoting
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:53.900]  the use of young blood in the quest to live forever.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:55.300]  Well, scientists have apparently found a way
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.340]  to reverse the effects of aging.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.780]  Now, this one sounds like something out of the movies,
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:03.620]  but young blood could be the key to reversing aging.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.980]  Some are calling it vampire therapy.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.420]  Others see it, potentially, as the fountain of youth.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.660]  It was something across between vampire and Frankenstein
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.100]  where they took two animals
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.620]  and they put them together for four weeks
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:17.940]  called parabiosis.
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:20.940]  Ah, imagine if you could turn back the clock,
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:25.140]  five, 10, even 15 years, and reverse the effects of aging.
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.260]  It's just got a baby and baby blood.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.980]  It's a fascinating study, actually.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:29.420]  It's so fascinating.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.340]  Indeed, fascinating.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.740]  What once was reserved for gothic novels
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.180]  is now confirmed by scientists.
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.660]  They found that young blood actually recharges the brain,
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.100]  forms new blood vessels,
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.980]  and improves memory and learning.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.500]  So far, the findings pertain
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.500]  to a particular strain of mice,
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.380]  but if results can be replicated in other strains,
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.660]  human trials won't be far off.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.020]  And the beauty business is already using blood
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.060]  to give that youthful glow.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.380]  Ever the trendsetter, Kim Kardashian,
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.220]  got a vampire facial.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.740]  The gruesome procedure involves the reinjection
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.140]  of the patient's own blood platelets back into the skin
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.820]  in an effort to rejuvenate.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.500]  It's all vanity, it'll all backfire.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.060]  The skin looks better.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:11.900]  No.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.660]  Maybe now she can try it with baby North's blood.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:15.540]  Now, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.500]  I am open to the thought of looking
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.420]  and feeling 15 years younger,
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.140]  but nobody is explaining
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.660]  who's gonna be supplying the baby's blood.
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.460]  Will we begin breeding humans
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.620]  simply for their ability to donate blood?
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:28.460]  That's already going on.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.300]  The value of a child's life
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.220]  has already diminished in some circles
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.740]  to know more than their useful byproducts.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.540]  An energy plant in Oregon burns
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:38.700]  aborted babies from Canada to generate electricity.
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:39.540]  There you go.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.180]  And aborted babies are used to heat hospitals in the UK.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.860]  Their life force used in a waste to energy program.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.780]  And one woman even posted a video
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.660]  of her abortion on YouTube
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.060]  in her narcissistic pursuit of fame.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:54.300]  I just wanna share my story.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.300]  But what strikes me about this new science
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.220]  is how the belief that the fountain of youth
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.500]  can be tapped with young blood has been around forever.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.420]  Throughout history,
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:05.540]  cultures across the globe have extolled
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.500]  the properties of youthful blood.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.100]  Children are sacrificed
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.340]  and the blood of young warriors was drunk by the victors.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.420]  Lady Bathory was rumored to bathe
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.420]  in the blood of virgins to preserve her youthful looks.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.020]  And of course, there's vampires who live forever
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.540]  by draining the blood of their victims.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.380]  Is that Joe Biden?
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.540]  And as story goes,
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:27.060]  vamps find baby's blood the most rejuvenating.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:30.460]  Some admit drinking blood for the energy they receive.
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.580]  I get irritable without it.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.420]  I get angry.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:36.580]  I don't wanna leave my house.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.660]  I want my blood.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:38.980]  But she's not welfare.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.820]  Trendy, just ask Keshia, the queen of a cult pop.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.460]  And Satanists exalt the power found
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.220]  in the life force of children.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.900]  Details of the history of child sacrifice
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.580]  are written about in bloodlines of the Illuminati
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.380]  by Fritz Springmeier.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.700]  A baby must be sacrificed to Satan
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.500]  in exchange for power.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:01.500]  Springmeier notes how it's not the family name itself
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.700]  that holds the power for the Illuminati,
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.620]  but the very occultic blood pulsing through their veins.
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.500]  Hence all the intermarrying between these families
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.740]  to keep the potency of their bloodline pure.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.220]  Youthful life force is wildly attractive to the powerful
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.020]  who find covert ways to feed their insatiable thirst.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:23.260]  The Franklin coverup reveals one of the biggest
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.740]  pedophile scandals in the history of the USA.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.180]  Boy prostitutes 15 years old and younger
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:33.100]  were taking midnight tours of the White House.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.620]  And across the pond, BBC host Jimmy Savile
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:41.100]  was found to be involved in a child sex ring for VIPs.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.980]  Interesting to note, Savile's good buddy Prince Charles
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:48.100]  is a direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler,
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.100]  who you might know by his other name, Dracula.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.660]  Incredible report by Leanne McAdoo.

[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.980]  that can be added to both your home cabinet

[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.740]  The new info wars life silver bullet colloidal silver

[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.260]  into a two ounce bottle and it's not recommended
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.980]  for extended continual use.
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.140]  This is not a low grade formula.

[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.820]  The football, the basketball.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.620]  Alert, security alert.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.500]  This is homeland security analysis.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.380]  Info wars building independent media operation.
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:16.220]  You let the worst people get controlled
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.380]  and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.020]  Prime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.900]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:28.260]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars.
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:32.100]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theory.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:35.060]  The targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.020]  They are never going to stop.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.300]  They're never going to deviate from their program
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.140]  until we stop them.

[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.380]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:55.940]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.460]  Intellectually, it's because you can fail it.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:01.700]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:04.820]  out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:09.340]  bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:11.300]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.300]  Fluoride.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:17.540]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.660]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.820]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.820]  and the results are on record, reports documented.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:30.580]  A 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.060]  been deficient in iodine.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.180]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:38.380]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.820]  was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.420]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine

[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.820]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.380]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.140]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.820]  had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:09.260]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.420]  and our drinking water?
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.540]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.420]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.420]  you can take to protect you and your family
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:21.060]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.820]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate,
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:25.820]  at least once a week.
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.540]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.820]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.220]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.820]  hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:38.220]  All right, it is in teats and coffees and waters
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:39.820]  and breads and toothpaste.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.420]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.020]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.220]  It's time to take action.
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.220]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.420]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:17.420]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:23.420]  Truth is stranger than fiction,
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.420]  and we're going to talk a little bit more about that
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.420]  in just one moment.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.420]  But I tell you, that report for InfoWars Nightly News last week
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:33.420]  by Leanne McAdoo that I'd like to place some of on the weekday show
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.420]  and also the Sunday show is just so powerful,
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.420]  and it's all mainstream media clips.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:42.420]  This is stuff we talked about, you know, 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.420]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:47.420]  I was just a political libertarian researcher.
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:50.420]  Who continued to try to find out what was really driving
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.420]  the move towards a police state, towards an authoritarian system.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:57.420]  And really, you got about one out of 100 people
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:00.420]  that's a true psychopath, maybe one out of 20 that's a sociopath.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:02.420]  Those are raw numbers. They vary.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:06.420]  And they build civilizations of control over the rest of us
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.420]  that aren't stupid or weak.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.420]  We're just naive because we're not evil.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.420]  And they build these psychopathic world systems.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.420]  You can archetypally call it vampiric.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.420]  You can archetypally call it vampirism, whatever you want.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.420]  But they sell this idea that the blood of babies,
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:23.420]  the blood of the youth is going to empower you.
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:25.420]  And a lot of rich people get blood.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.420]  Give them my young donors, use it as a therapy.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.420]  And as long as it's free will, that's fine.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.420]  It's just that so much that we've talked about
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:34.420]  is now becoming mainstream because it's so widespread
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.420]  they can't hide it anymore.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.420]  By the way, if you actually look at the estrogen mimicry
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:43.420]  and the chemicals and things put in the food and water to dumb us down,
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.420]  the answer to this is just eating organic, purified water
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:49.420]  and getting exercise and being healthy.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.420]  That's a lot better than drinking baby's blood, I'm here to tell you.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.420]  But just a crass plug here, as G. Gordon-Luddy used to say,
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:59.420]  crass commercial message, crass commercial message.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.420]  We have great products at InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.420]  like fluoride shield that is nascent iodine,
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:11.420]  proprietary type with five other key ingredients.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:14.420]  Zeolites, organic, fulvic acid,
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:17.420]  Chilogy, organic, cilantro,
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.420]  that together, chelate and pull the toxic heavy metals out of your body.
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:24.420]  You can get fluoride shield developed by Dr. Everett Group
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:26.420]  and others at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.420]  and support the broadcast while you're doing it.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.420]  You can get the super male vitality,
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.420]  I'm going to take a little shot of it,
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:34.420]  I haven't taken this since this morning, right now,
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.420]  that has eight concentrated organic herbs
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:39.420]  that give me better libido, better focus,
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.420]  better workout, I've lost a lot of weight.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:46.420]  And I chalk it up to super male vitality
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.420]  and changing my diet.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:50.420]  So InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.420]  Now, shifting gears,
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.420]  I want to play this special report
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.420]  filed by Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.420]  of course, Esquire fame reporting on some of his combat exploits
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:08.420]  with the late, great Rolling Stone
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:10.420]  reporter Michael Hastings.
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:13.420]  He now works for InfoWars and he's put together
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.420]  this report dealing with DARPA's move
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:19.420]  to brain ship the population and not just the military
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:21.420]  and he went out and talked to some folks
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.420]  on the street about that about a week ago.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:25.420]  In fact, it might have even been a week and a half ago,
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.420]  this report was on the nightly news.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:27.420]  Let me see the data.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.420]  Yeah, no, this was not this Friday,
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:30.420]  but the Friday before last.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.420]  So eight, nine days ago, I guess it's the 18th now
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.420]  on this original transmission.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.420]  But here is the headline today.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.420]  Ex DARPA director and Google exec pushes microchipping
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.420]  human beings.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.420]  Here's another one on defense one.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.420]  Now the military is going to build robots
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.420]  that have morals.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.420]  Yes, they decide autonomously when to kill
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.420]  or not kill and well, you know that they'll do
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.420]  what the new order needs them to.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.420]  Meanwhile, we're all being killed by little robots
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:02.420]  that we hold up to our heads all day
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.420]  that in their own studies,
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:06.420]  they admit vibrate the DNA in your body like microwave
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:09.420]  heat up water and causes massive brain cancer increases.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:14.420]  And here is the London Telegraph intensive mobile
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.420]  phone users are at higher risk of brain cancer.
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.420]  Study says people who use their cell phones
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.420]  more than 15 hours each month.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.420]  My gosh, that sounds like regular users found to be
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.420]  two to three times higher risk of developing glaucoma.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:33.420]  And how do you pronounce that Mino Minami?
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]  I don't know how to pronounce that.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:35.420]  How do you pronounce that guys?
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.420]  You see that?
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:39.420]  M-E-N-I-N-G-I-O-M-A.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.420]  I already have one.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.420]  I can't read this.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.420]  Mino Gynoma tumors.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.420]  Am I saying that right?
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.420]  So people who use mobile phones intensely
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.420]  appear to have a higher risk of developing
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.420]  certain types of brain cancer.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.420]  French scientists have said,
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:55.420]  reviving questions about phone safety.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:58.420]  Well, I mean, it's a microwave system.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.420]  We know what's going on.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.420]  So we're killing ourselves to live,
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.420]  as the Ozzy Osbourne song says.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.420]  It's an incredibly serious issue.
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:13.420]  And we need to be honest about this.
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.420]  It's like cigarettes.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:17.420]  Everybody's brought up smoking them in the last few hundred years.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:21.420]  So it's a conspiracy theory to say that it gives you cancer.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.420]  Once you get used to something or acclimated
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.420]  or almost evolve to accept it,
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.420]  even if it's killing you, you go along with it.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.420]  Bottom line, use hands free.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.420]  Bottom line, don't hold it up your head.
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.420]  Even the contract you sign to get a cell phone says that, folks.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:38.420]  This is a bigger health crisis than cigarettes.
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.420]  Many top scientists say, research it for yourself.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:43.420]  Look up cell phone dangers online.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.420]  Find out for yourself.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:46.420]  There are thousands of studies saying
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.420]  it will kill you better than a hammer.
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:51.420]  Now, here is our next report with Sergeant Big,
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:56.420]  Staff Sergeant, looking at brain chips the Pentagon is pushing.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:27.420]  How would you know if someone stole your mind?
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:35.420]  Right now, President Obama, you ever heard of DARPA?
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:36.420]  No, I have not.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:39.420]  Okay, DARPA is a military agency that we kind of have.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.420]  It's a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.420]  You can go to DARPA.mil and see it.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:45.420]  It's like CIA, all that stuff.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:49.420]  They built a lot of the secret military stuff, robots and all that stuff.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:52.420]  So right now, President Obama has given them $100 million
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.420]  in what he calls a brain initiative to help restore lost memory
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:58.420]  on soldiers who have had traumatic brain injury.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.420]  You think that's a good idea?
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.420]  Yeah, we think that's a good idea.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.420]  The brain initiative will change that by giving scientists
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:09.420]  the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.420]  Two plus two equals five.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:13.420]  And better understand how we think and how we learn
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.420]  and how we remember.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.420]  I didn't know nothing about that.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.420]  It's been all over the news, CNN, Fox, all over.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.420]  I mean, it's even on DARPA's website.
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.420]  I'm sorry, I don't do the news because the news is full of crap.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:28.420]  Okay, well, that's what I understand that.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.420]  I'm just trying to get an honest opinion.
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.420]  I mean, do you think that's a good idea?
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.420]  That if they could help you restore memory,
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.420]  I mean, I myself, I have traumatic brain injury.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.420]  Well, yeah, if they could help a soldier, yeah, of course.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:41.420]  So it's a good idea for them to implant something like that
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.420]  to help restore the memory.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.420]  Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.420]  Right now, President Bobba has what he's calling the brain initiative.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.420]  And what that's going to do is help restore memory
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.420]  and soldiers that have a traumatic brain injury.
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:56.420]  Do you think that's a good idea to help restore memory
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.420]  that's been lost in the community?
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.420]  You've heard of DARPA, right?
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.420]  DARPA?
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:04.420]  The guys that make all the cool robots and all that stuff
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.420]  for the military?
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.420]  Oh, okay.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:08.420]  Okay, so what they want to do is build a chip.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:12.420]  They'll insert your brain and help you restore memory.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:14.420]  That's a bit much to me.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.420]  That's kind of weird.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.420]  I mean, but what if we could cure racism with it too, though?
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.420]  I mean, we could take some of those races,
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.420]  alter that and put that in the chip
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420]  and then take the racism away.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.420]  That'd cure everything from the world.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.420]  Nah.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:26.420]  You got it.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:28.420]  Somebody wants to be a racist, let him be a racist.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:31.420]  You think it'd be a good idea for the government
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.420]  to implant something into you to help you remember that stuff?
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.420]  Like a microchip?
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:36.420]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:37.420]  You mean you think that would be good?
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.420]  See how mainstream this is now?
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:40.420]  Do they have this technology to do that?
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.420]  Yes.
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.420]  Oh.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.420]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.420]  Do they have any detrimental side effects?
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.420]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.420]  You're not for that?
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:48.420]  No.
[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:49.420]  I'm for it.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:50.420]  If you want it.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:51.420]  Just the government.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:52.420]  But I'm just asking.
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.420]  Can you know it?
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:56.420]  Do you think it's a good idea that some people could have that restored?
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.420]  Man.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.420]  No.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:02.420]  Oh, is he going to be the first puppet to get one?
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:03.420]  You know that's not going to happen.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:05.420]  He's going to use them as soldiers like he always does.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.420]  Look at my leader.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.420]  Well, he's their leader.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.420]  I thought he was supposed to lead by example.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:14.420]  In the budget I will send to Congress next week.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:20.420]  I will propose a significant investment by the National Institutes of Health, DARPA,
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:24.420]  and the National Science Foundation to help get this project off.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:26.420]  All they're doing is rolling out what they already developed.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.420]  I'm directing my bioethics commission to make sure all of the research is being done in a responsible way.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:35.420]  Oh, the bioethics commission says euthanasia is good and fantasized.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:42.420]  Including leading companies and foundations and research institutions to tap the nation's brightest minds.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.420]  We're going to make it so sick we've got to have brain chips to survive.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.420]  That's the plan.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.420]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.420]  Stay with us.
