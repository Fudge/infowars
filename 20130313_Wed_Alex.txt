[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.400 --> 00:38.640]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.640 --> 00:47.560]  It is Wednesday, the 13th day of March, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going
[00:47.560 --> 00:53.760]  to be live here for the next three hours. And George Norie, I've seen the numbers. Trade
[00:53.760 --> 01:00.000]  publications vary, but the second most listened to show in this country is not Sean Hannity.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.320]  And it is not, certainly, Glenn Beck, it is George Norie. And I find him to be a very
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.120]  interesting individual, and he's really helped us get the word out over the years.
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.360]  And I wanted to get him on about the nature of reality and where he sees humanity going
[01:15.360 --> 01:23.120]  and the times that he sees ahead. Because it was George now, ten years ago, who started
[01:23.120 --> 01:31.320]  putting me on Coast to Coast AM for full shows, three hours. And nowadays, to talk about the
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.960]  New World Order and prison camps and checkpoints and drones and surveillance grids and deadly
[01:36.960 --> 01:40.200]  vaccines, that's pretty much passe.
[01:40.200 --> 01:47.280]  I tuned into two different shows on 590 yesterday, and I tuned into WOAI in San Antonio while
[01:47.280 --> 01:53.840]  I was out driving to work and driving back yesterday and doing some errands. Every show
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.720]  was saying there's a police state takeover, the government runs Al-Qaeda, we're in deep
[01:58.720 --> 02:05.680]  trouble. I mean, I tuned in and heard Jeff Ward, the former NFL kicker and UT football
[02:05.680 --> 02:06.680]  star.
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.040]  I know him, we're friends. But the point is, he's more of a mainline libertarian, kind
[02:11.040 --> 02:17.680]  of thinks I'm far out there. We worked out for a while at the same gym. He was on the
[02:17.680 --> 02:25.200]  air just going, yeah, yeah, government runs Al-Qaeda. And I heard The Morning Show saying
[02:25.200 --> 02:31.040]  it. And this is without it being on Drudge Report, which most radio shows go and get
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.220]  their news from.
[02:32.220 --> 02:38.480]  This was without even being on Infowars. It was not even a meme in the media. And I heard
[02:38.480 --> 02:46.520]  three shows yesterday. And when you see a chain reaction like that, and I see that more
[02:46.520 --> 02:54.360]  and more, or something out of the ether. Well, I haven't called Jeff, but I'll guarantee
[02:54.360 --> 02:59.800]  you that all three of the shows, WAI and the two 590 shows, heard my Sunday show.
[02:59.800 --> 03:03.560]  Where I talked about it for about an hour and a half of the two hours, and quoted Muhammad
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.880]  Carr as I was saying, the US runs Al-Qaeda, Taliban, they're blowing up stuff. Bradley
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.480]  Manning is basically coming out with a new leaked tape saying similar things. We listen
[03:13.480 --> 03:17.040]  to the whole thing.
[03:17.040 --> 03:26.420]  There are mainstream news articles, Fox News, questions, former US military now fighting
[03:26.420 --> 03:30.160]  for Al-Qaeda. And they said, why do you fight for Al-Qaeda? And he says the US plays both
[03:30.160 --> 03:38.480]  sides too. The guy's definitely deep cover CIA or a useful idiot operative. The point
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.040]  is I've just been pointing out what is there and what is admitted.
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.200]  In the first place, other than my own platform that was still, it was already pretty big
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.240]  size 10 years ago, but maybe 20% of what it is now. The first place that had the courage
[03:54.240 --> 04:01.060]  to let me go on the air for three hours, sometimes, every other month, and lay out evidence was
[04:01.060 --> 04:02.060]  George Norrie.
[04:02.060 --> 04:06.660]  So I salute him, real trailblazer, he's joining us in the second hour. And then we've got
[04:06.660 --> 04:12.080]  James O'Keefe, another trailblazer, that's who I admire as trailblazers. Project Veritas
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.040]  brought down a curtain, what's that, 6 billion a year? They were using the muscle to take
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.720]  over the city, so the Obama administration brought down a bunch of other tyrants.
[04:20.720 --> 04:23.520]  They've gone into all these police departments and have the cops saying, no, you should have
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.660]  no guns, get a dog. That's the new meme, while they have guns, and they laugh on tape and
[04:29.660 --> 04:36.020]  say that. I mean, just bizarre fruitcakes. And we're gonna be airing that, they're coming
[04:36.020 --> 04:42.680]  on. Man, the police state news I've got on the other side of this break will just show
[04:42.680 --> 04:48.780]  you how we are seeing, like Wile E. Coyote sees a rabbit and he sees it on a spit all
[04:48.780 --> 04:55.860]  dripping with juices and gravy. That's how we're now seen by more and more of the government.
[04:55.860 --> 05:02.760]  I mean, look out, they're eating out our substance.
[05:02.760 --> 05:09.040]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[06:03.080 --> 06:09.040]  lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The
[06:09.040 --> 06:14.680]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.820]  to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness

[08:03.280 --> 08:09.520]  you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.760]  to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:12.760 --> 08:20.040]  You will remember going back about four years ago, we began to get Homeland Security internal
[08:20.040 --> 08:27.920]  documents and publish them from state police, federal marshals, FBI and others where they
[08:27.920 --> 08:34.440]  were already telling them the number one terror threat is returning veterans, gun owners,
[08:34.440 --> 08:43.360]  libertarians, constitutionalist, land rights activist, end the fetters, Ron Paul supporters.
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.080]  They said that is the threat, that is who you'll prepare for war with. And they've taught
[08:48.080 --> 08:53.420]  every police department in America that takes federal funds for four years that they will
[08:53.420 --> 08:58.320]  face US Army and Marines and Navy personnel.
[08:58.320 --> 09:06.080]  Veterans will bomb them with IEDs. Now, we can open the phones up, the cops will all
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.040]  call in and tell you they've been trained for that. That's been in the news after we
[09:09.040 --> 09:14.660]  broke it. People couldn't believe it, couldn't believe it for four or five days when we first
[09:14.660 --> 09:20.940]  broke the MIAC, then not just the state level report, the federal master report and others.
[09:20.940 --> 09:26.400]  And since then, there's over 100 FBI manuals and flyers given to every business you can
[09:26.400 --> 09:34.520]  imagine. From animal husbandry to tattoos, from barbershops to clothiers, you name it,
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.400]  saying blue jeans, cell phones, a sign of terrorism, but the number one sign, and it
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.900]  says it in the manuals, but I'm about to show you one right now.
[09:44.900 --> 09:52.960]  Not a manual, LA Times, they say being white is the sign of terror. Then two years ago,
[09:52.960 --> 10:00.000]  and the story went viral, we wrote an article because we saw someone had posted internal
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.880]  DHS training videos on YouTube. And later, DHS posted the very ones, people didn't think
[10:05.880 --> 10:11.360]  they were real at first, showing them patrolling highways, roads, grocery stores, malls, sporting
[10:11.360 --> 10:13.720]  events.
[10:13.720 --> 10:19.640]  Now ladies and gentlemen, last week, and I told you it was a big deal, the Southern Poverty
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.400]  Law Center that is the mouthpiece of the Justice Department. I mean, they ran the informants
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.760]  that ran Ellaheem City, that ran McVeigh. And they came and said, there's about to be
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.360]  a terror attack by the right wing, take their rights, and then the building blew up.
[10:33.360 --> 10:40.160]  They have crystal balls. No, no, there's no framing going on, they care. Even though the
[10:40.160 --> 10:46.000]  same deputy director of the time was involved in Oklahoma City is now the Attorney General
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.120]  Eric Holder, who ran Fast and Furious, false flag, staged event, inside job, black op,
[10:52.120 --> 11:01.440]  Reichstag event. Government sponsored terror, Operation Northwoods, Operation Gladigo, Operation
[11:01.440 --> 11:05.240]  Ajax, search all these terms I'm throwing out.
[11:05.240 --> 11:12.560]  And he went on slimeball, Mark Potok went on and said, we're putting out another red
[11:12.560 --> 11:22.720]  alert, the new threat is white gun owners, they're going to attack. And in their new
[11:22.720 --> 11:27.160]  report and in their letter, and what the letter sourced was their report, guess who's at the
[11:27.160 --> 11:34.000]  top of the list, A-L-E-X, A-N-D-E-R, J-O-N-E-S.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  And what does that spell? Alexander Jones. Who is that? You bet. Now these are known
[11:41.000 --> 11:49.360]  White House toads, operatives on record, media matters, all of it on record, government funding,
[11:49.360 --> 11:54.880]  government bailout, government stimulus money. Do you understand? Pray for us. We have the
[11:54.880 --> 12:02.360]  White House run system saying Alex Jones is the new bin Laden.
[12:02.360 --> 12:09.440]  And you know who else they say is evil? Anybody who is right of Mao Tse Tung. And again, left
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.900]  right isn't really real, that's a controlled paradigm. But within the right, there is at
[12:13.900 --> 12:18.720]  least lip service to Second Amendment, Bill of Rights, Constitution, private property,
[12:18.720 --> 12:21.120]  family, religious rights.
[12:21.120 --> 12:27.560]  And so they are assaulting anyone who doesn't call for an end of male and female marriage,
[12:27.560 --> 12:32.120]  and for world population reduction and death panels and total communism. If you don't endorse
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.720]  total evil, you are a devil. Now, you see the, I mean, I was on a big Dallas station
[12:37.720 --> 12:45.120]  yesterday, it's a CNN affiliate, Wall Street Shuffle, highly rated show up there in Dallas.
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.280]  And the guy was like, no, I went and looked it up, I called the company, I checked that
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.520]  that's one of the biggest manufacturers, if not the biggest manufacturer in the country
[12:51.520 --> 12:52.840]  of paper targets.
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.840]  They did do a $2 million contract for Homeland Security that requested. The people had done
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.520]  interviews, we broke it, people couldn't believe it, but they've done interviews. They admit
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.880]  yes, they apologize, Homeland Security, asked for the tactical response stuff of five-year-old
[13:05.880 --> 13:12.080]  kids to shoot, and old women and men and people in the shower, paper targets.
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.400]  And he said, everybody I know, including congressmen that come on my show, cannot believe it, and
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.040]  they won't even say there's 2 billion bullets, even though that's admitted. And he went and
[13:20.040 --> 13:26.760]  checked it, and it was true. That's what we're talking about here. And the LA Times says,
[13:26.760 --> 13:32.760]  if you believe in any of this, you are a quote, white cell, a terror cell.
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.760]  I'm gonna read it in about ten seconds. Now, how long ago did I tell you? Behind the scenes,
[13:38.760 --> 13:45.720]  the military, the police, arms build up, prepping for door-to-door gun confiscation. Military
[13:45.720 --> 13:51.920]  training in Arcadia, Iowa, military training in Dallas, Texas, military training in Miami,
[13:51.920 --> 13:56.200]  military training in Minneapolis, St. Paul, military training in LA, military training.
[13:56.200 --> 14:01.460]  And the military's called in, and it's in the Army Times, and it's in the Army manuals,
[14:01.460 --> 14:07.480]  type in gun confiscation in new Army manual 2010. You'll get army.mil gun confiscation,
[14:07.480 --> 14:11.880]  how to process us with our social security numbers, how to take over the radio and TV
[14:11.880 --> 14:13.840]  stations, not just by remote control.
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.760]  The military will occupy them, the power plants, the city hall, and they're gonna take our
[14:18.760 --> 14:29.560]  guns. And so this unprecedented insanity is going on, and they're saying it doesn't exist,
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.920]  knowing the dumb down masses, including members of Congress, will just say, well, nine out
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.080]  of ten articles conservatively say it doesn't exist, Politico, you name it, said there is
[14:41.080 --> 14:42.080]  no bullets.
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.800]  They bought no bullets. They bought 200,000 bullets, is what they said. And then this
[14:45.800 --> 14:51.880]  guy Alex Jones and Sarah Palin, they say it's two billion and they're insane. It was an
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.400]  anonymous posting on a website. They don't say what, it's all lies. I mean, it's all
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.000]  lies, FedBiz.gov, public, all of it, over two billion.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.640]  I was saying 1.6 billion to three weeks ago, Breitbart actually counted it all up and they
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.960]  had the listing, over two billion. They're buying 2,700 armored vehicles last year, big
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.840]  giant ones. I've seen them on the road in Austin. They say federal police, they're for
[15:13.840 --> 15:14.840]  here.
[15:14.840 --> 15:20.440]  And they're telling you it doesn't exist, while telling people now in newspapers all
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.440]  over the country. When I saw this LA Times this morning, I went and looked, there are
[15:24.440 --> 15:32.400]  similar articles in AP, Reuters, it's everywhere. Let me show TV viewers, radio listeners, let
[15:32.400 --> 15:34.120]  me direct you to just go to this.
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.080]  It's up on infowars.com. I'm gonna have Kurt Nemo do another article about this. He wrote
[15:37.080 --> 15:43.800]  about this last week when the letter linking to the sources, and there it is, Alex Jones.
[15:43.800 --> 15:51.280]  King daddy, they say I'm numero uno terrorist. I'm a terrorist, ladies and gentlemen, because
[15:51.280 --> 15:56.520]  I point out the megabanks have taken over America, run Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and
[15:56.520 --> 15:58.680]  are supporting them and aiding them.
[15:58.680 --> 16:02.320]  And our government grows the opium and runs Al-Qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan. That's
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.360]  all coming out now. Of course, I'm the terrorist. Pray for me, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not
[16:07.360 --> 16:13.640]  afraid. I'm just afraid I won't finish my work if they do kill me. And that's in God's
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.640]  hands.
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.980]  But let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, you better get the word out like
[16:17.980 --> 16:22.280]  your life depends on it. Because I'm telling you, the shadow government, I've seen all
[16:22.280 --> 16:27.600]  these preparations before Oklahoma City before, and I've seen them before 9-11. And I've seen
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.040]  them now. They've got four or five, what is it, five TV shows now where the founding fathers
[16:33.040 --> 16:38.360]  are terrorists, where returning veterans are secretly Al-Qaeda.
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.240]  They're using their own CIA operatives that are joining Al-Qaeda to put them on Fox News
[16:42.240 --> 16:46.280]  to kind of blur the lines. Well, there are veterans joining Al-Qaeda. Yeah, fighting
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.880]  for the globalist. But they're gonna say that there's three different West Point and Army
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.560]  War College reports last year and a half saying the Tea Party's gonna link up with Al-Qaeda.
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.480]  Anybody in the Tea Party knows it's total Islamophobia land.
[17:01.480 --> 17:05.000]  So I mean, that's just asinine. It's like saying Malcolm X is gonna join the Ku Klux
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.360]  Klan or something, okay? But they don't care cuz the TV heads are all watching Simulants
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.040]  right now. Where every show they're watching, the lady that won't vaccine her kids is a
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.040]  child molester.
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.880]  The guy that won't vaccine his kids is gonna nerve gas the city. The guy that's a Ron Paul
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.960]  supporter is a meth head. Every show, demon messages, demonizing liberty, getting it ready
[17:27.960 --> 17:34.280]  as Simulants for the public. They've got all these movies coming out where militias attack
[17:34.280 --> 17:41.240]  the White House. So they can stage a false flag, have it be incredibly immoral what happens,
[17:41.240 --> 17:45.600]  blow up a nursery like Oklahoma City, whatever, and then blame it on us and say, see, we told
[17:45.600 --> 17:46.600]  you so.
[17:46.600 --> 17:53.160]  And they are moving into fire zone. The Death Star is cleared of fire in five minutes. I
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.240]  mean, politically speaking, five seconds. It is coming around, to use the Star Wars
[17:57.240 --> 18:03.520]  analogy, coming around Yavin and is about to be cleared of fire, okay? I mean, the Death
[18:03.520 --> 18:09.280]  Star is coming around. And if you're not in your X-wing out there right now fighting every
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.600]  day to expose these murdering terrorists, they're going to bring in the red terror.
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.540]  They're panicked, they're scared, they know we've got the initiative and this is history
[18:18.540 --> 18:29.560]  happening right now. The Death Star is cleared of fire in five seconds. That means any minute
[18:29.560 --> 18:35.240]  now, any time, we're in a death struggle to back them off, to expose them so they don't
[18:35.240 --> 18:38.320]  pull it off and they hold back and don't do it.
[18:38.320 --> 18:41.560]  And then when they do do it, if they do do it, we're gonna really be able to deal with
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.600]  them. Because people now know, we got people everywhere watching. The minute they blow
[18:46.600 --> 18:54.040]  something up, folks, everyone should carry cameras on them at all times, okay? At all
[18:54.040 --> 18:55.040]  times.
[18:55.040 --> 19:03.440]  Now let me show you what's in the LA Times. Told you this was coming. My God. I mean,
[19:03.440 --> 19:08.180]  peril from patriots, the US needs to keep a close watch on the growing threat of home
[19:08.180 --> 19:12.880]  grown extremist groups. Now it gets worse. Look at who they show as the extremist. Only
[19:12.880 --> 19:16.120]  criminals and government want unarmed public.
[19:16.120 --> 19:20.480]  What part of shall not be infringed, you don't understand. Repeal and negate. Now it gets
[19:20.480 --> 19:25.200]  worse. First they say you're radical. Then they say, there are an increasing frightening
[19:25.200 --> 19:33.600]  numbers of cells, it's cells, of angry men in the United States preparing for combat
[19:33.600 --> 19:41.400]  with the US government. They're usually heavily armed, blinded by intractable hatred. You
[19:41.400 --> 19:45.960]  mean wide awake to your evil and we know who you are. Often motivated by religious zeal.
[19:45.960 --> 19:52.180]  They're not jihadist. They are white. They are white, right wing Americans. They've now
[19:52.180 --> 19:58.160]  announced white men are terrorists. That's the headline, Kurt Nemo. LA Times announces
[19:58.160 --> 20:01.440]  white men are terrorists.
[20:01.440 --> 20:06.680]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,

[22:31.360 --> 22:35.880]  ever wondered why banks stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've
[22:35.880 --> 22:40.520]  been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold
[22:40.520 --> 22:45.240]  for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

[24:13.760 --> 24:18.480]  In our article that we posted last week breaking down the SPLC saying that the right wing terrorists
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.400]  were about to attack. You can go watch the video. Poe talks on with Matthews and Matthews
[24:23.400 --> 24:28.200]  goes, Obama is the most perfect president ever, the most perfect person. That's a quote.
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.520]  The only reason not to like him is he's black. Let's talk about these racist hate groups
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.640]  and they're, well, one of them is We Are Change, which is not liberal or conservative. It's
[24:37.640 --> 24:38.640]  kind of constitutional.
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.800]  There was a big critic of Bush, I mean, and it's totally peaceful. But they're scared
[24:43.800 --> 24:50.080]  of real reporters going out and asking questions and they're listed by the SPLC. Anybody who's
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.880]  awake to the global takeover, a foreign group of banks took us over and it's divide and
[24:55.880 --> 25:00.960]  conquer. The city of Austin, it paid $15,000 through an art group, let's put it up on screen
[25:00.960 --> 25:10.240]  for viewers, for a billboard that said, no, it's up on that computer right there.
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.280]  I pulled it up during the break. It's the article from yesterday. There it is. Ariba,
[25:15.280 --> 25:20.360]  my people, or up my people, stand up my people. And it shows the Mexican flag on the middle
[25:20.360 --> 25:28.360]  of a heart with people pouring across the Mexico border into Texas. Rise up my people.
[25:28.360 --> 25:34.600]  So you have a call, and this is liberation theology, funded by government. And it's not
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.160]  just this government, it's other governments, state governments, county governments fund
[25:38.160 --> 25:42.760]  this stuff. Judge rules, hey, kids can't wear American flags in school. That's upsetting.
[25:42.760 --> 25:46.560]  That's racist, even though they're Hispanic. And you're like, that's got to be a joke,
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.080]  but it's not a joke. And then Americans that knew they were coming for our guns are out
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.080]  buying guns.
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.920]  I've been to the gun show. It's every race, color, Asian, Hispanic, black, white, you
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.640]  name it. They don't want us unifying around property rights, Second Amendment, family
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.860]  rights, national sovereignty, low taxes, being able to accrue wealth. They want us all fighting
[26:05.860 --> 26:13.240]  with each other. And so that's what FEMA teaches, and it predates Obama, but it's accelerated.
[26:13.240 --> 26:19.360]  There will be a war where anyone that is anti gun confiscation is a racist white person
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.040]  who is to be killed. And they brainwash police so bad. This has been going on for a long
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.240]  time that I saw a 1999 Discovery Channel inside the LAPD show.
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.860]  I played the clip here many years ago. Somebody could find it, please find it again and send
[26:31.860 --> 26:36.640]  it to us. We'll play it again. I've been able to find it. I taped it off TV on VHS and played
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.720]  it in my own studio back when I was running my own show in 99. And a veteran has died
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.600]  of a heart attack, been dead three days. They go, look at his horrible NRA sticker.
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.140]  If the cops actually say this, he's horrible, this is in LA. And they go in, the guns are
[26:51.140 --> 26:54.480]  all legal, and the cops are going, well, I'm gonna take this one, I'm gonna take that one.
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.580]  And they make fun of his dead stinking body and go, what a piece of trash this gun owner
[26:59.580 --> 27:04.420]  with guns on their hips. And you see wherever the globalists are in control, LA, Chicago,
[27:04.420 --> 27:09.260]  New York, we've got video that's coming up with Project Veritas and James O'Keefe.
[27:09.260 --> 27:14.800]  They have cop after cop after cop after cop after cop after cop who look like total mind
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.740]  numbed cross-eyed goons. The weird thing is about like pro gun cops always look tough
[27:19.740 --> 27:23.960]  and smart and well-spoken. I mean, it's true, whether they're black, white, doesn't matter.
[27:23.960 --> 27:30.500]  And then you show the anti-gun cops, you don't need no gun, you get the dog. I mean, wait
[27:30.500 --> 27:35.720]  till I play this. They all look like they've had lobotomies, I'm not kidding, they look
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.280]  like they've been run over.
[27:37.280 --> 27:43.380]  You know, I mean, I'm sorry for handicapped people, but my point is that I was in New
[27:43.380 --> 27:46.560]  York when they had National Guard running checkpoints with machine guns a few years
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.920]  ago. And Rob Jacobson was with me, we ran into unit after unit that were made up as
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.220]  some kind of weird covert test of people that I know by the way they looked and talked had
[27:57.220 --> 28:01.040]  chromosomal disorders, okay?
[28:01.040 --> 28:06.420]  And that's why, in fact, people won't believe this, type in police with over 100 IQ not
[28:06.420 --> 28:10.520]  hired nationwide. It's been this way for 30 years, it's public, lawsuits have been won
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.640]  over it, they still keep doing it. They want the dumbest people they can get. And if that
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.320]  means they've got to get people who are mildly retarded, they will do it.
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.880]  And I just feel sorry for these people. I mean, it's like, you don't need a gun, get
[28:25.880 --> 28:33.560]  a doggy. And I'm just like, whoa, it hurts my heart. It hurts my heart to know they're
[28:33.560 --> 28:39.400]  building a giant army of idiots. And ladies and gentlemen, I just read to you from the
[28:39.400 --> 28:45.200]  LA Times, cells of white gun owners, white men are the terrorists.
[28:45.200 --> 28:51.160]  There's a frightening development. They're blinded by hate. No, we're blinded. We're
[28:51.160 --> 28:57.040]  blinded. No, no, you're blinded with lies and propaganda. We're wide awake. And so they
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.920]  wanna make it like, well, only white people are for the Second Amendment. And that's what
[29:00.920 --> 29:04.320]  they sell, liberation theology, that they teach all the Hispanics they're trying to
[29:04.320 --> 29:05.320]  make citizens.
[29:05.320 --> 29:08.080]  That it's part of you getting government welfare and being part of it that we're gonna take
[29:08.080 --> 29:13.500]  the guns. And they teach inner city blacks that. And you see the inner city mayors and
[29:13.500 --> 29:19.360]  people lined up to ban all guns. You've heard them just ban them all. And see, it's not
[29:19.360 --> 29:24.080]  your skin color. It's that you've been under globalist mind control. And now you racially
[29:24.080 --> 29:26.440]  identify with having your guns taken.
[29:26.440 --> 29:30.880]  You racially identify with being on food stamps. You racially identify with the government
[29:30.880 --> 29:36.720]  as your mommy, when it's got a poison mammary gland down there dangling in your face filled
[29:36.720 --> 29:42.640]  with cyanide. But you're like, no, I'm gonna drink it. And I'm like, no, it's bad for you.
[29:42.640 --> 29:48.160]  Just wake up. This is unprecedented. And there's more. But I told you, white al-Qaeda, get
[29:48.160 --> 29:50.200]  ready. They're gonna start blowing stuff up and blaming us.
[29:50.200 --> 30:01.240]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:13.200 --> 33:20.560]  and blood, muscle and blood and skin and bones. A mind that's weak and a back that's strong.
[33:20.560 --> 33:28.120]  You load 16 tons. What do you get? Another day older and deeper in depth. St. Peter,
[33:28.120 --> 33:36.000]  don't you call me cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store. Monday through
[33:36.000 --> 33:46.760]  Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. You know, during the break I was going down to the coffee
[33:46.760 --> 33:56.360]  room to get a cup of coffee. And I was just thinking about it was hitting me that I was
[33:56.360 --> 33:58.160]  almost pinching myself.
[33:58.160 --> 34:07.800]  Well, it wasn't almost. I was kind of scratching my leg and thinking, is this real? I've seen
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.300]  the training films, the secret preparation. We broke it. Then we saw the proliferation
[34:14.300 --> 34:19.660]  of training videos where every one of the terrorists in something like 15 Homeland Security
[34:19.660 --> 34:26.480]  training videos that are in Paul Watson's article, DHS prepares for the new terror threat
[34:26.480 --> 34:31.520]  White Al Qaeda. I'll pull up the exact headline. You guys pull up White Al Qaeda in fallwars.com.
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.480]  There's a bunch of articles. I want to give people the actual headlines from about a year
[34:35.480 --> 34:37.540]  and a half, two years ago.
[34:37.540 --> 34:43.640]  And to see the all the training films where no one who's white is good. Men, women, you
[34:43.640 --> 34:47.720]  name it, they're all terrorists. And then it's the minorities who are really the majority
[34:47.720 --> 34:55.600]  black Hispanic Asian who are reporting them. And it is the best looking business people
[34:55.600 --> 34:57.120]  too that are all terrorists.
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.520]  They're clearly branding to a skill set of people that they want to feed off of. And
[35:02.520 --> 35:11.200]  I have articles where a woman in New Jersey at a public meeting quoted the Constitution
[35:11.200 --> 35:15.540]  and they arrested her and said it was threatening and took her guns. And I have copies of the
[35:15.540 --> 35:20.760]  arrest warrant because they came to her house later and took her guns and I've got the guns
[35:20.760 --> 35:26.160]  they confiscated. And the weird statements by the police of we didn't like her raising
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.240]  her voice and just the bizarreness and then we can't hand out magazines in downtown Austin
[35:32.240 --> 35:43.320]  until we go threaten to sue and have a demonstration.
[35:43.320 --> 35:48.880]  It's blowing me away that we've broken all this and by the way, I'm not particularly
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.280]  happy about that. Do you think I'm happy about being on the ADL and southern property law
[35:54.280 --> 36:00.960]  site that are both government fronts? It's come out on record, involved in very serious
[36:00.960 --> 36:04.120]  black ops, very serious dangerous groups.
[36:04.120 --> 36:10.520]  Do you think it's fun to have these mercenaries walking around posing as non-threatening liberals
[36:10.520 --> 36:14.480]  when they're vicious and dangerous? Do you think it's fun to have them breathing down
[36:14.480 --> 36:20.840]  my neck and knowing they train all the local police and give all these community awards?
[36:20.840 --> 36:26.160]  Napoleon said, it's incredible how men will just throw themselves onto bayonets for little
[36:26.160 --> 36:33.080]  pieces of metal and ribbons. And they treat the troops like garbage afterwards. It's the
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.320]  same thing ADL, others handing out these stupid awards to manipulate everybody when they're
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.240]  an anti-civil rights group and saying I'm the number one threat.
[36:41.240 --> 36:50.940]  I'm the big demon. I'm the devil. You think that's fun? Pray for us is all I can say because
[36:50.940 --> 36:59.160]  we are the canary in the coal mine and these people are vicious. And I told you over and
[36:59.160 --> 37:08.880]  over and over and over again. I wonder why the office is calling me. Hello? You know
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.480]  the office just called me? Who is this? It's one of my children. My children are here at
[37:14.480 --> 37:15.480]  work today.
[37:15.480 --> 37:18.840]  So they went in and used an office phone to call my cell phone. I was like, why is work
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.200]  calling me? I know the sound of shuffling of my children on the other one. They know
[37:23.200 --> 37:30.000]  it's me. Man, I just don't even know what to do anymore. I know the globalists are criminal.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.760]  I know they run Al-Qaeda. It's on record. It's public now. I know they're spiking the
[37:34.760 --> 37:40.000]  food in the water with anthropogenic systems. I know they're putting binary systems in.
[37:40.000 --> 37:52.840]  Do you know what anthropogenic bioweapons are? Do you know what? There it is. DHS takes
[37:52.840 --> 37:58.200]  seriously claims militias collaborate with Al-Qaeda on bio attack. Yeah, that's a curtain
[37:58.200 --> 38:05.320]  of article from 2009 and links to Washington Times. The newer ones are white Al-Qaeda here.
[38:05.320 --> 38:16.520]  I'll do it. WhiteAl-Qaedainfowars.com. Yeah, there it is. Big Sis, latest terrorist, more
[38:16.520 --> 38:24.560]  white Americans.
[38:24.560 --> 38:27.560]  And my kids are in the control room. I'm gonna have to send them home. It's becoming a major
[38:27.560 --> 38:30.720]  distraction. Call my wife, have them come get them. They're not doing what I told them,
[38:30.720 --> 38:37.200]  so they gotta go. Call her and have them gotten out of here. Okay, anyways, continuing with
[38:37.200 --> 38:47.180]  what I was breaking down here, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:47.180 --> 39:06.040]  America is basically dead right now. America has basically rolled over to tyranny. America
[39:06.040 --> 39:11.020]  right now is putting up with anything. And if we don't get up and realize what's happening
[39:11.020 --> 39:21.320]  to us, everything is going to collapse. And that's the plan. You have to understand they
[39:21.320 --> 39:22.780]  wanna collapse self-care.
[39:22.780 --> 39:26.960]  They wanna collapse confidence in the government and cause a revolt. They've got the whole
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.520]  thing planned out as one fail swoop because they know the gun culture, the liberty culture
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.380]  is growing. They know Congress has a 9% approval rating. So they're gonna run hoaxes that everyone
[39:36.380 --> 39:41.400]  loves Obama, and that he's been endorsed, and that his agenda is loved, and that everyone
[39:41.400 --> 39:46.640]  cares about him, and that everyone wants socialism when it's all a lie.
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.480]  And they know no one's buying that, and they know they've committed all these crimes. And
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.560]  Fast and Furious didn't work for them, and they got caught doing the underwear bombing,
[39:56.560 --> 40:00.040]  and they've been caught running Al-Qaeda. And everyone, not just here, but all over
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.960]  the world is calling the globalist on it as they take down Europe and the United States.
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.600]  These are foreign, they're not even foreign, they're global above the law banks. And they
[40:10.600 --> 40:16.320]  are training police, and that's why they want them dumber and dumber because smart cops
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.000]  absolutely see through snake FEMA and Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL operatives coming
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  in.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.680]  We've got the training videos, I've put them in films like Road to Tyranny, where they
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.720]  sit around bad mouthing America and saying Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are
[40:29.720 --> 40:34.280]  bad and gun owners are bad and veterans are bad. And the cops sit there and go, well,
[40:34.280 --> 40:40.000]  this is treason. But don't worry, they're just kicking them out and bringing in goons,
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.040]  ladies and gentlemen, cuz here's the deal.
[40:42.040 --> 40:47.440]  They have to bring in dumb goons, because even smart criminals like Liberty, generally
[40:47.440 --> 40:50.880]  of their low level, because they understand down the road they're gonna be oppressed by
[40:50.880 --> 40:57.480]  it. Even smart low level predators don't wanna lose all their rights, even though they are
[40:57.480 --> 41:01.720]  sitting in the command position, cuz they know that they'll be in another position down
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.400]  the road.
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.600]  And so they're going with childlike people in code enforcement, police everywhere, who
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.840]  talk like children, who act like children. And it's like a fun role playing and they're
[41:17.840 --> 41:21.900]  the boss. It reminds me of my five year old daughter when she's being bossy, it's the
[41:21.900 --> 41:23.200]  exact same thing.
[41:23.200 --> 41:28.000]  And they're sitting there, they have no embarrassment, they have no honor, they have no connection
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.080]  to reality. Then you've got criminal, hardcore psychopaths who relish it and have an instinct
[41:33.080 --> 41:39.280]  for domination, like Mayor Bloomberg, like people like Obama. And so if you tuned in
[41:39.280 --> 41:48.880]  for the first time here, ladies and gentlemen, You've gotta understand that they've got the
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.600]  movies, the TV shows, the dramas, that's the final phase.
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.840]  First they do the training that the new terrorist is white people. Do you understand Kurt Nimmo's
[41:57.840 --> 42:02.320]  writing an article right now off this? They say in the second line, in the second small
[42:02.320 --> 42:10.240]  paragraph of the LA Times that there are cells of terrorists and they're all white. And notice
[42:10.240 --> 42:14.160]  they don't say they're white supremacists, they say whites.
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.120]  So that immediately makes blacks, Hispanics and others that have been taught all whites
[42:18.120 --> 42:23.160]  are bad and evil. You have to do that to then create the break. So it's the minorities becoming
[42:23.160 --> 42:27.040]  the new police force, that's been done in England. They brought in people from foreign
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.320]  countries, Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, you name it, who are, I've had members of parliament
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.160]  on who are now the majority of the police forces everywhere.
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.040]  They can't even hardly speak English. I've been there and experienced it. It's a total
[42:38.040 --> 42:43.840]  act of domination. Yeah, there's the quote, they're not jihadist. They are white right
[42:43.840 --> 42:50.240]  wing Americans, nearly all with an obsessive attachment to guns, who may represent a greater
[42:50.240 --> 42:53.840]  danger to the lives of American civilians than international terrorists. See, the flipping
[42:53.840 --> 43:00.880]  is now happening. And they don't uncloak until they fire.
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.440]  And I've been telling you this for four years, all the behind the scenes, white Al Qaeda,
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.800]  white terrorists, white Americans, all gun owners are terrorists. And I told you that's
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.920]  all gonna be denied. And they did write articles saying I was insane, it didn't exist. That's
[43:13.920 --> 43:18.840]  all gonna be denied, to use another science fiction analogy, until the Klingon warbird
[43:18.840 --> 43:20.080]  uncloaks.
[43:20.080 --> 43:25.160]  Because it's got to uncloak to fire and folks, it's uncloaking right now. I mean, shields
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.880]  have got to be up. You've got to be running around like a chicken with your head cut off
[43:28.880 --> 43:34.320]  calling all talk radio, calling Washington, calling Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL.
[43:34.320 --> 43:40.140]  You know, I did this two months before 9-11 on July 25th. I said call the White House,
[43:40.140 --> 43:43.360]  they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and they're gonna blame it on bin Laden. You
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.600]  don't know about that, just search Alex Jones prediction 9-11. By the way, we just found
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.240]  a larger clip of it and posted on the site the other day at warehouses, videos, and tapes
[43:53.240 --> 43:54.240]  back there.
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.760]  Jimmy Vaughn on record saw it two months before when it was live. He's on record. Well, here
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.600]  I am on record before this time. And you heard it here four years ago, you heard it here
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.920]  yesterday, you heard it here today. But I told you, when they start running TV shows
[44:08.920 --> 44:15.160]  and movies, that'll be right before they then actually go, it's not just fantasy, it's real.
[44:15.160 --> 44:19.280]  The white people are all terrorists, gun owners are all terrorists, to have a purge, they
[44:19.280 --> 44:27.600]  just uncloaked. I bet if you go to YouTube, you can actually find a, just type in Klingon
[44:27.600 --> 44:31.800]  uncloaks cuz I'm not a huge Star Trek fan, but some of them are entertaining, especially
[44:31.800 --> 44:32.920]  the new one's pretty good actually.
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.800]  But uncloaking, cuz it's got a energy field around it, it can't fire through its own energy
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.760]  field, its invisibility field, it has to uncloak to fire. And folks, I mean, I'm sitting here
[44:42.760 --> 44:47.560]  looking and the new order just completely uncloaked. I saw their signature historically,
[44:47.560 --> 44:48.560]  I knew what they were doing.
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.120]  I told you, okay, they're swinging around, they're coming in, they're gonna move right
[44:52.120 --> 44:56.720]  up in on us and they're gonna fire. And folks, it's all happening, A through Z, they're now
[44:56.720 --> 45:01.000]  clicking into Z, the tumblers are falling into place. They're getting ready to run their
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.960]  black op teams to blow stuff up or God knows what, mass shootings, you name it, right now.
[45:06.960 --> 45:11.000]  I bet they've even got the anchors, cuz these people are black op commanders, people like
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.920]  I saw when I finally went public, it was a couple days before July 25th, I taped it,
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.000]  can't find the tape, hard ball, had Hart Rudman committee heads on it.
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.800]  Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, and they were celebrating together and they said there's
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.440]  gonna be big events, big buildings, that's all I can tell you. Things are gonna change,
[45:30.440 --> 45:36.040]  they were euphoric, it was a demonic celebration, no one knew what they were seeing. They said
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.520]  things are gonna change, there's gonna be troops in America, I guess I gotta tell you,
[45:39.520 --> 45:41.280]  big changes are coming.
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.880]  Of course, they were the ones that said America will be attacked a few months before in their
[45:44.880 --> 45:49.200]  Hart Rudman Commission. I have clips of that in my film Road to Tyranny, where they say,
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.520]  we predicted an attack on the homeland, we're gonna make lemonade out of lemons, we're gonna
[45:53.520 --> 45:54.520]  have this Pax Americana.
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.720]  It was like the left arm of the right arm of the Peenack document that said a Pearl
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.800]  Harbor event, 3,000 dead Americans. It actually says that, written by Dick Cheney, September
[46:04.800 --> 46:10.360]  20th, 2000, public document will help us set up this world empire, this American empire.
[46:10.360 --> 46:14.120]  But it's really a banker empire, they just tell the generals and people, you understand
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.120]  gambits. You send in 100 special forces to bring in the enemy to show their numbers,
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.320]  the special forces get killed, you send in 50,000 troops to wipe out the enemy, you would
[46:23.320 --> 46:25.160]  have lost probably 20,000 troops.
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.640]  What's better to lose 100 or 20,000? For America and for liberty, we're gonna blow up these
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.480]  towers, but so that we can defeat the Muslim threat. And it was only top people at NORAD
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.920]  and they were in on it, that much is clear. Well, I guess we gotta kill 3,000 Americans.
[46:40.920 --> 46:46.080]  I don't even know how they estimated that Cheney said around 3,000 like Pearl Harbor.
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.680]  And then how they had 3,000 in the towers that day, man, that's wild. I guess they just
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.840]  kind of like guessing what dice you're gonna roll next.
[46:54.840 --> 47:01.600]  And so I saw that, and I saw that Publix demon celebration, cuz criminals like to brag. And
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.440]  I saw that demon celebration, and he said, thank you for sharing this with me, this is
[47:06.440 --> 47:12.340]  incredible, Chris Matthews said. And it was all code, no one but one in a million would
[47:12.340 --> 47:13.840]  even know what they were talking about.
[47:13.840 --> 47:19.040]  And I went, my God, cuz I'd seen, here's Bin Laden, he's gonna attack you. What do you
[47:19.040 --> 47:23.760]  do when he attacks? Get my rights up, Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill. They had him
[47:23.760 --> 47:27.120]  drink Kool-Aid hundreds of times in drills under orange before it really had the poison
[47:27.120 --> 47:28.120]  in it.
[47:28.120 --> 47:36.400]  All the movies, the TV shows, Taliban's blowing up the Buddhist temples and statues. My gosh,
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.600]  they're bringing drugs in, my gosh, they're gonna attack, they're gonna attack. Rand Corporation
[47:40.600 --> 47:44.380]  documents, yeah, there'll be a big attack soon, that'll be used to transform America
[47:44.380 --> 47:46.080]  and put the military over every city.
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.480]  And I was reading all these things, I mean, they operate uncloaked for those that know
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.800]  what they're doing, and then they hit us. And you're like, how dare you say that? Well,
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.160]  I mean, now Karzai, their own minions come out and said it. They've run al-Qaeda in Taliban,
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.360]  Fox News is admitting it, they've put an Iron Dome missile shield up over Israel while Obama's
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.600]  there because they're afraid al-Qaeda, they put in Syria, will launch chemical weapons
[48:09.600 --> 48:10.600]  on them.
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.500]  The same al-Qaeda we told you six months ago had stolen chemical weapons from Assad with
[48:15.500 --> 48:19.800]  US and NATO help and had gotten them and was gonna false flag. They did videos killing
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.640]  dogs with it, new videos, where they're gonna false flag Assad with the chemicals. I mean,
[48:25.640 --> 48:30.760]  you realize the magnitude, and listen, we're in the fight, the fact that I'm on the air,
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.800]  the fact that I'm on all these AM and FM stations.
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.760]  The fact that we're able to talk about this shows there's still good people in government,
[48:37.760 --> 48:41.160]  there's still good people in corporate world, there's still good people in the military
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.880]  and police. But man, listen, you gotta understand, this is so heavy, I could barely talk ten
[48:45.880 --> 48:56.000]  minutes ago. This is so big, I mean, this is real, you're getting 99.8% accuracy right
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.080]  now.
[48:57.080 --> 49:01.180]  Because I've thought about this, looked at this, I'm not saying I'm perfect, and it's
[49:01.180 --> 49:06.880]  not hard once you know it. Folks, it's happening, okay? Do you understand that? They did Oklahoma
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.840]  City, they did 9-11, they did Gulf of Tonkin, they had Northwoods, they did Operation Ajax,
[49:12.840 --> 49:17.320]  they did the NATO option, it's all declassified.
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.380]  It's all hiding in plain view. They had all these officers go public and say Muhammad
[49:21.380 --> 49:24.360]  Atta and four others trained at the Defense Language School, the head of the school went
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.100]  public and they started court-martialing him for violating national security. You ask,
[49:29.100 --> 49:30.100]  how would they do something?
[49:30.100 --> 49:37.660]  How'd they keep Manhattan Project secret for four years with 120,000 people involved? Do
[49:37.660 --> 49:43.600]  you understand this isn't American government, it's a criminal command hijack over the government.
[49:43.600 --> 49:50.240]  We are in red level emergency, they have uncloaked. They are now rolling in newspapers everywhere
[49:50.240 --> 50:00.120]  saying whites are terrorist cells and are going to attack the government trying to institute
[50:00.120 --> 50:01.800]  a race war.
[50:01.800 --> 50:07.060]  While government in every major city funds billboards saying LA is now Mexico, Austin
[50:07.060 --> 50:13.280]  is Mexico, Hispanics rise up against the gringos. I mean, incredible program so that now that
[50:13.280 --> 50:19.040]  it's time, minorities who are the majority, are the majority in most areas don't go, well,
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.400]  I want the Second Amendment, I want proper rights. No, I'm with the government.
[50:21.400 --> 50:26.080]  Oh, really, the whites are terrorists. Well, I'll turn my guns in to show them whites while
[50:26.080 --> 50:33.680]  you're giving up your entire future.

[50:38.240 --> 50:44.000]  Folks, I know what's going to happen next. You wonder why I break down and cry sometimes?
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.520]  I think they're going to nuke a city. That's what my gut tells me. Thousands of points
[50:47.520 --> 50:51.680]  of analysis there. Obama and his controllers are looking at detonating a low yield nuclear
[50:51.680 --> 50:55.920]  weapon in a city and blaming us. And they're going to kill me hours after it happens. We'll

[53:09.560 --> 53:13.840]  Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time

[54:14.640 --> 54:18.520]  What happened right at the end of the last segment was the guys flashed DrudgeReport.com
[54:18.520 --> 54:24.720]  up and clicked on the top story in the middle column. And it just made me have another flashback
[54:24.720 --> 54:28.920]  to the stack of police state news I have that I haven't even gotten into, and it like hit
[54:28.920 --> 54:34.720]  me. See, that happens now. When I see some horrible piece of news, some horrible tyranny,
[54:34.720 --> 54:37.600]  you know, you say you don't like the county tax assessor and that we're being robbed and
[54:37.600 --> 54:40.960]  the government's a tyranny, and they come arrest you and say that's a threat and take
[54:40.960 --> 54:51.600]  your guns. It's like having your stomach punched. I'm not like, I'm happy. I get to expose the
[54:51.600 --> 54:57.400]  tyrants. It's like, my gosh, it's getting worse. I wish I wasn't right. I mean, look
[54:57.400 --> 55:01.720]  at the type of news I have here, LA Times, whites are terrorists, period. Being white
[55:01.720 --> 55:02.720]  is terrorist.
[55:02.720 --> 55:09.160]  See, it's all race politics, unbelievable. And see, that'll force whites to become completely
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.000]  racial, just like you do in the prisons, so that everybody's at each other's throats and
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.360]  the government's the referee. See the master plan? Man faces five years in prison for releasing
[55:18.360 --> 55:24.520]  balloons on beach as romantic gesture. And this is in the local Florida papers, and they're
[55:24.520 --> 55:27.040]  reporting it like it's a good thing.
[55:27.040 --> 55:34.320]  He's charged with a felony. The trooper arrested Bransfield and charged him with polluting
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.720]  to harm humans, animals, plants, and everything else living under the Florida air and water
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.320]  pollution control act. I told you, folks, in Europe, it's already like this in Australia,
[55:43.320 --> 55:48.320]  five, ten years in prison, if your kid drops a battery out of a toy and a neighbor finds
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.120]  it, they get huge pieces of the money.
[55:50.120 --> 55:57.560]  This fact's already happening here, and you go to jail. And not all the cops are just
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.740]  totally dumb. A lot of them are savage and evil. And the local newspapers, this is from
[56:02.740 --> 56:09.440]  Natural News up at Infowars.com. Naturalnews.com, they break down the highway patrol, saw him
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.840]  release a couple balloons with hearts as she walked out into the parking lot as a love
[56:15.840 --> 56:16.840]  gesture.
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.880]  And that's it, buddy, you're going to jail. And your guns are gone. See, that's the thing,
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.640]  you gotta get rid of the 68 gun control act, cuz real criminals, violent criminals are
[56:26.640 --> 56:41.560]  always gonna have guns. But now, felonies are releasing balloons. He released them for
[56:41.560 --> 56:43.320]  Shakana Baxter, his girlfriend.
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.440]  Well, you don't do that, by the way, I've done that. Politicians do that, city fairs
[56:47.440 --> 56:53.360]  do that. It doesn't matter, it's all to be selectively enforced. It gets better. Homeless
[56:53.360 --> 56:59.840]  Houston veterans cited for dumpster diving in search for food. The guy was getting apples
[56:59.840 --> 57:00.840]  out of the trash can.
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.520]  You don't go to a grocery store and get stuff to be thrown in a landfill, bud. New Jersey
[57:04.520 --> 57:08.760]  woman arrested for reciting constitution at tax meeting. And I have the arrest warrant
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.980]  and the guns confiscated. I have the actual printouts. In fact, show folks a document
[57:13.980 --> 57:20.600]  camera this. Thank you, gentlemen. Complaint summons and the seized property receipt. Her
[57:20.600 --> 57:26.720]  firearms, her ammo, everything.
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.240]  California sees those guns of owners as lose right to keep arms. People that were getting
[57:31.240 --> 57:35.400]  a divorce, people that had been depressed at one time. Just your guns are gone, that's
[57:35.400 --> 57:38.920]  Bloomberg, very, very proud of that. Government ammunition stockpiling story breaks through
[57:38.920 --> 57:41.840]  media censorship, goes mainstream.
[57:41.840 --> 57:47.480]  More than 20 new studies showing fluoride brain damages and causes cancer. Why is it
[57:47.480 --> 57:53.480]  still in our water? Another important article. So why are we still drinking fluoride? That's
[57:53.480 --> 57:58.080]  just some of the police state news. We got George Norie coming up of coast to coast AM
[57:58.080 --> 58:01.720]  heard on almost, I don't know, what is it, 500, 600 stations, I don't know, around the
[58:01.720 --> 58:02.720]  country.
[58:02.720 --> 58:08.540]  George Norie is coming up. I want to talk to him about a host of issues today. And we've
[58:08.540 --> 58:12.360]  got all the other news. Why doesn't Obama drone strike this terrorist? Because the administration
[58:12.360 --> 58:15.960]  is backing terrorists in Syria, asked by Fox News.
[58:15.960 --> 58:30.960]  He is. He smoked them. Then we got some. Yeah, about 10, 20. We're going to play more of
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.240]  that later. Al Qaeda publicly now on TV, working with the government. We'll be back. They're
[58:35.240 --> 58:42.240]  just throwing your face. Al Qaeda is good. Lights are bad. Al Qaeda. Good. All lights
[58:42.240 --> 58:43.240]  bad.
[58:43.240 --> 58:51.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[59:31.300 --> 59:36.360]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the

[59:54.040 --> 01:00:08.560]  Aging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.680]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:21.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:41.240]  All right, George Norrie of Coast to Coast AM. I wanted to get him on about the state
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.120]  of the world. Just talk about how crazy everything's gotten. He'll be joining us for the balance
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.840]  of the hour in the next segment.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.120]  Do that back up from where you played that. Why doesn't Obama drone strike this terrorist?
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.640]  Because the administration is backing terrorists in Syria. Let me read this article to people.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.640]  Since the Obama administration seems so keen to entrench its authority to kill Americans
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:09.280]  deemed terrorist on foreign soil, why has it failed to drone strike former US Army soldier
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:18.920]  Eric Haroun, is that how you pronounce it? H-A-R-R-O-U-N, who is now fighting with the
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.000]  al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group Jabhat al-Nasr in Syria.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.600]  The question is rhetorical because the answer is already known. He will not be targeted
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.720]  because he is fighting on the same side as the terrorist-led FSA insurgents, which the
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.040]  Obama administration has backed to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. It's billions.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:46.840]  He's a US-trained soldier turned Muslim warrior. He's a CIA deep infiltrator. Man, I tell you
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.200]  what, boy. He's a US-trained soldier turned Muslim warrior who moves between America and
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.920]  countries where the winds of the Arab Spring blow.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.280]  He's allowed to move into America, but they've tried to keep me from flying before. And I'm
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.600]  the big terrorist, Southern Poverty Law Center says. Fighting alongside jihadists and American-hating
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.840]  terrorists while celebrating his bloody exploits on YouTube videos, reports Fox News.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.320]  And he goes on to say, when questioned as how he feels about fighting alongside al-Qaeda
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.680]  terrorists, he responded, the US plays both sides too. No, the US is run and captured
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.960]  by mega bank crime syndicate technocracy. And the US that's controlled doesn't play
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:33.720]  both sides, it runs all the major sides, up to three or four sides, full spectrum dominance
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.760]  to create the wars as the excuse to have war for war's sake, to destroy civilization, to
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.280]  wreck products, to wreck things, to pull down.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:48.640]  Agenda 21 soft kills us financially, industrially. They use real wrecking balls in Libya and
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:57.360]  Syria and Iraq. In Africa, they turn off the power, kill development. But don't worry,
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.280]  they run all the cultural centers to keep the black people close. Keep your friends
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.720]  close, your enemies even closer. Keep the Hispanics close, have some more aspartame,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.400]  we're gonna saw your legs off next week.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:18.240]  But we paid for a billboard saying up with Hispanics, La Reconquista. And then LA Times
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:25.920]  comes out and says the number one terrorist, it's the biggest threat now. See, I told you
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.720]  behind the scenes it was the number one threat, al-Qaeda is not a problem, it's white people.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.000]  You're like, I don't believe those documents. Now it's LA Times. Well, the Justice Department
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.840]  documents say the whites are about to strike. They're not white supremacists, it's just
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.200]  whites are terrorists.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.760]  And see, Jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no lean. So between the
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.880]  two of them, they lick the platter clean. You get whites, Hispanics, blacks, everybody
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.880]  loves to hate somebody, humans are all humans. The Arabs are the devil, the Arabs are the
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.400]  demon. They're parking lot them, nuke them, kill them all, blah, blah, blah. Except the
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.160]  Patriot Act, the police state, the NDAA, the New World Order, it's for the Muslims.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.680]  And then now, it's not for them, it's for white people. Isn't that fun, Hispanics?
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:22.280]  La Infosura, La Reconquista, the takeover. That's right, Los Angeles isn't. California,
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.280]  Los Mexico, all paid for by government, all government telling you this, all government
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280]  pushing this.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.960]  Oh, it's fun, it's cute. Yeah, the whites, where'd they go? Oh, they're terrorists, yay,
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:40.960]  kill them. Last parking lot, the whites. It was all gun owners that did the Sandy Hook
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.480]  shoot. It was all whites that'll do the next bombing. And they're saying that they wanna
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.560]  race war.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.200]  They wanna force whites into being racially identified in their own group. They wanna
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.560]  force everyone in their own little prison group. It's prison management, prison planet,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:01.480]  prison control. They got the right wing to call with all the Arabs?
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.960]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:11.040]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions

[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:08.360]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:18.840]  Security begins with hometown security. It seems apparent that our citizens are staying
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:26.240]  off the streets, which may make scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:35.360]  To recap those revisions, women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets,
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:44.360]  but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points. The big
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:56.800]  score, anyone, any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100 points. As always, how fast
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:08.280]  you move determines how long you've lived. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:16.440]  It's Alex Jones. Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm Central,
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:24.040]  we are here live. We have of course the weeknight 7 o'clock Central Infowars Nightly News. The
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.420]  websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, streaming video of the daytime radio show
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:35.460]  at prisonplanet.tv. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we've had a lot of breaking news, incredible
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.200]  economic news, incredible police state news.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.520]  I wanted to get George Norrie, one of the biggest radio talk show host obviously in
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.320]  the world, 16 million listeners or more a week just on his radio show. Of course he
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.840]  has TV shows, you name it, on multiple networks from time to time off and on. He's doing another
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.560]  web TV show. I wanna talk about all that today and I wanted to get him on because as I said
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:07.840]  at the start of the last hour, he was the first really big media person who had a mega
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.480]  audience cuz most big shows on TV have two, three million viewers now.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.200]  I mean, they worship Bill O'Reilly with three million viewers. George Norrie has six, seven,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.160]  eight, nine million a night, 16 plus million a week. He was one of the first really big
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.800]  media outlets to let me come on for just hours because I had documentation and he's a what,
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.720]  is it three time Emmy Award winner for news. He's a long term newsman himself for decades,
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  Navy veteran.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.000]  And he's on AM and FM all over the country and Canada, XM satellite, listen to all over
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.560]  the world on premier radio networks. And he again has had almost 38, 39 years or more
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:52.200]  broadcasting experience, coast to coast am.com, one word, coast to coast am.com, one word.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.560]  But I remember getting on and talking about the arms build up, the police state, the preparations
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.120]  for war of the American people because this has been going on for a long time.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.040]  Now the $2 million of targets of small children to be used as targets in no hesitation for
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.320]  Homeland Security. The 2 billion bullets are admitted, the domestic drones, the secret
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.520]  arrest, all of it. What we talk about and what George helped Trailblaze is now becoming
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]  more and more mainstream.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.200]  So before we get into the big picture, where he sees humanity going, will humanity survive?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.880]  What's our greatest threats? What's our greatest assets? I wanna read him this from the LA
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.080]  Times and Kurt Nemo's doing an article right now on this at mfallwars.com. Los Angeles
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.040]  Time, peril from patriots, we told you this was coming.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.200]  I've told him this in the last year, probably five times on the show. The US needs to keep
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:47.440]  a close watch on the growing threat of homegrown extremist. They are increasingly frightened
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.840]  numbers, cells of angry men, terrorists in the United States preparing for combat with
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.160]  the US government.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.260]  They're unusually or usually heavily armed and blinded by an intractable hatred. No,
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.920]  we know bad guys run the government, often motivated by religious zeal. They are not
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.920]  jihadist, they are white, right wing Americans, nearly all that obsessive attachment to guns.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.080]  They would never even say about Muslims, they are predominantly Arab. But it's okay to say
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.160]  that about whites. Now I've seen the internal documents, and this goes on and on, which
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.560]  are now public, that they say the new threat will be gun owning libertarian conservatives
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560]  returning veterans.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.600]  We broke that four years ago, people couldn't believe it. Coast to Coast saw the documents,
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:36.080]  confirmed it was real, had me on about it. But the point here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.640]  to understand is that they're now going public with what an internal training program has
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.800]  been. And they do that right before, the Southern Bobby Law Center, that's basically a Justice
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.680]  Department front, that's come out, is saying there's gonna be terror attacks, and we're
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680]  gonna do it.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.080]  And I'm listening to the report. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't even get a speeding ticket
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.680]  every few years, I have no criminal record. I stole beer out of somebody's golf cart a
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.840]  few times on the golf course growing up as a kid, grab a few beers with you and your
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.340]  buddies, ha ha ha when you're 15. But no, here they are saying that we're terrorists
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:13.040]  because we believe they're coming for our guns when they said they wanna ban our guns.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040]  They're trying to cause a civil war, as I've said. George Norrie, out of the gates, I wanna
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.080]  get your take on that. And then what you think's front and center on the radar, because as
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.440]  the polls come out that record numbers of people don't trust the government, over 70%,
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:33.520]  9% approval rating for Congress, 92% major polls say JFK was killed by the government
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.520]  or elements of it.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.800]  I mean, they can't say we're all terrorists. And who could get away with saying whites
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.400]  are inherently terrorists? George Norrie of coast to coast am.com.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.120]  Alex, how are you, my friend? I'm great, thanks for missing some sleep to be on with us.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.920]  That's okay, anytime you call, I'm there for you, you know that?
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.640]  Well, thank you, brother. These are strange times, aren't they?
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.560]  I can't even believe this is happening, it's like a movie.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:07.120]  There is a paranoia out there with government where they think, and that LA Times article
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:14.760]  you just read is paramount to that, they think everyone is out to get them. They have missed
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:21.080]  the boat. What people are trying to do now, the fact that people wanna keep and retain
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:28.320]  their guns and everything else is we wanna make sure we do not get involved with a tyrannical
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:35.200]  state, a tyrannical government. We're not the paranoid ones, they are. We're not about
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:43.080]  attack government, that's ludicrous. But what we are trying to do across America is simply
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:50.080]  defend ourselves. When we read stories that Homeland Security is buying billions of rounds
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:58.480]  of ammunition, tanks, putting up drones that can fire on Americans at will, you don't think
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.040]  we need to get upset about that? Something's going on. The bigger question, Alex, that
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.920]  you've been looking at and addressing over these years is why is it coming down so fast?
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.120]  Doesn't it seem like they feel as if they're out of time and they've gotta do this tomorrow?
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.880]  Absolutely, and it's like the Emperor's New Clothes, it's waking everybody up. I listened
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.680]  to three talk radio shows yesterday, mainline ones that have even been critical of me in
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.280]  the past. And I thought it was George Norrier or Alex Jones. They were saying, drones, takeover,
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:37.120]  the government runs Al-Qaeda or elements of it. I mean, it seems like an awakening's happening
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.520]  and I think the system's panicking.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:45.040]  There's an epiphany going on. If we would talk about this during the World War II era,
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:52.600]  the era of my father, where we have to question anything about government, anything, he would
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:58.680]  have said, you're nuts, you're crazy, there's no way. Things have changed dramatically now.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:05.080]  It's the other way around. Now you cannot even say anything right about government because
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.240]  they've done everything wrong. They screw everything up that they touch. Listen, I have
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.720]  said all along, I spent nine years in the Navy. I love United States. I'm not the kind
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.680]  of guy to pick up and leave. I could if I wanted to. I've got the resources to do that.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.800]  I could do coast to coast from any place in the world. We just hook up broadcast lines
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800]  and there we are.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.800]  You could be on a mountaintop in Switzerland.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.440]  Yeah, I could be any place. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to stay in the United
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  States and I'm going to try to make this right with people like you and with dedicated, hard
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]  working Americans.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.280]  And by the way, you are civil defense. We all are. And so many people I talk to are
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.920]  deciding to stay here and rough it out because we love this country. The government isn't
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.960]  America. We the people are America.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.360]  I'm not leaving. And let's keep in mind there are lots of people in government who are dedicated
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:01.240]  great Americans. So when we talk about this, this issue, this problem, we're not talking
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:07.040]  about all of them. However, there's a finite group of them who have the power, who have
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.680]  the resources. They're the ones that are kicking this thing into high gear. It's almost as
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.280]  if the Illuminati, those people who have always been striving from a one world government
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:25.400]  have basically told them they're underlings. Go for it right now. Do it. I mean, what is
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:32.080]  the reason? What is the reason for Homeland Security to buy tanks? Can anybody tell us
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.920]  that?
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:42.240]  2,700 giant wheeled strikers that can handle rocket attacks in large mines. I mean, these
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.880]  are these are wheeled heavy battle tanks.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:53.240]  I mean, what does logic tell you when you hear that they're buying 2000 plus tanks and
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:18:00.320]  they're going to use them here in the United States? One of two things are happening. One,
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:08.000]  they're afraid of an invasion from a foreign source or two, they're afraid of Americans.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.880]  I think they're afraid of us.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:15.480]  Well, we know that exactly because of now the memos coming out where they had Politico
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.080]  say that I made it up. There's no bullets when it's federal purchase orders that are
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:27.120]  in AP, Reuters and Forbes. Here's a new one, info.wars.com. Dem group labels talk of DHS
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.200]  bullet buying extreme and says it's terrorist basically to bring it up.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:39.360]  New Jersey woman arrested for reciting constitution at tax meeting. That's linked up at drudgereport.com.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:46.040]  You're right, George. I mean, this is a insanity that is basically starting to break out. Do
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.720]  you think they're trying to start something or overcompensating?
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:55.360]  Well, that's a good question, Alex. I was kicking around the possibility last night
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:01.080]  that if we lived in the perfect world, a utopia where everybody got along, everybody cared
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.200]  about each other. There was no battles. There were no wars. There was no terrorism. What
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.880]  would happen? And yes, it's true that there are people that hate our guts as Americans.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.080]  Yes, it is true that there are terrorists out there who are funded by other people and
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.400]  other groups who want to just simply disrupt things. But by and large, if all of them went
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:29.200]  away, I'm convinced that the industrial military complex would create episodes in order to
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.520]  keep the thing going. And that's what's so upsetting. You know, if we had peace with
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:44.360]  the Palestinians and the Israelis and everyone was happy, I'm still convinced someplace somewhere
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:51.200]  this group of one world government fanatics would create an issue just to go ahead and
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.480]  attack and do something. Now, you know, my views on 9-11.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.080]  Absolutely. Hold on. Stay there, George. We got to go to break. Come back with those on
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.880]  the other side. This is very important. Nothing is more American than Diamond Gusset jeans.

[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.400]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.640]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.760]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.200]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.520]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.520]  monetary system. Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:05.160]  That's 800-686-2237. We've lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.400]  of our doors have deadbolts. They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.240]  in about five minutes. The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:20.060]  with our TV, jewelry and my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family had been home? The police
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:25.640]  officers said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts alone
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:30.840]  don't stop intruders. The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.000]  that would actually stop an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.280]  your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins. I was surprised at how little Easy Armor costs,

[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.600]  George Inari, who when he took over Coast to Coast AM for Mart Bell, who's a legend
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:14.920]  and an amazing broadcaster, had about 400 affiliates, now has 500, it's 500 in what?
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.920]  How many affiliates, George?
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.920]  564, Alex.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.920]  564, CoastToCoastAM.com. George, you were finishing up with your statement about 9-11.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.920]  I mean, more than ever, what do you make of Mohamed Karzai, who we know is not a good
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.880]  guy, but put in by the West? He says criminal elements of the government are running Taliban,
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.120]  basically Al-Qaeda, to blow stuff up as a pretext to stay there.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:41.680]  Well, we caught British SAS in Iraq dressed up like Sunni shooting Shiites to start a
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:47.920]  civil war in Basra. It's everything we've talked about, criminal elements wanting the
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.640]  wars to continue. And people always spin it. Jones is saying Bush had a plunger like Wylie
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:58.040]  Coyote blowing up the towers. No, what I'm saying is the globalists need Al-Qaeda to
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.560]  menace us into submission. What do you say about all that?
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.560]  Well, there is no question that the globalists need events. They need controversy. They need
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:14.120]  chaos in order to deliver the goods to the people they represent. And that's what's going
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:20.680]  on. I mean, Karzai, of course, this guy was a plant that used to work for the oil company,
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.720]  Unical. He's not a good guy. He's not a supporter of America. But we plugged him in there anyway.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.680]  But you know, he sees what's happening. I mean, he's not happy with negotiations with
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:37.520]  the Taliban trying to work things out in Afghanistan. You know why? Because for him, it's greed.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.080]  He doesn't want to lose his power position. We as a nation, you know what? We're trying
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.040]  to put the right people in. But the problem is they're all crooks. They're all cronies.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.360]  I mean, what dictator isn't running his country and putting billions of dollars in his own
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.800]  bank account? You know, whether it's food money or anything that's sent into that country
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.040]  to help the people, the dictator takes most of it.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.640]  Well, that leads us to Hugo Chavez. Dr. Paul Kirk-Roberts, who I respect, is saying the
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:12.640]  guy was a hero. Just because the West is corrupt and bad doesn't mean then taking small family
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.800]  farms away or businesses and redistributing things and following Fidel Castro. I mean,
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.280]  I'm sorry. I don't think that communism is cool.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.160]  No, not at all. I don't see Hugo Chavez as a hero. This is what he did. He came in and
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.160]  he started doing some of the things for the poor people. Brilliant. If you want the masses
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.400]  to like you, you help out the poor.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.800]  I agree. He did some good stuff up front. Castro did the same thing. We could talk about
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:45.400]  that in a moment. But Hugo Chavez butchered and killed his opposition. He wasn't a nice
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:51.240]  guy. He reportedly has $2 billion in his bank account. And he was begging for doctors to
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.440]  make sure that he never died. I mean, you know, let's face it. Let's call it the way
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.880]  it is. I mean, he was not a fan of the United States. And, you know, he wanted to hold on
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.280]  to power for the rest of his life. And he's doing his thing. Now, you know, here's the
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.840]  big difference. What's the difference between a Hugo Chavez who wants to be in there for
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:17.400]  life and make a lot of money for the people who are running Saudi Arabia, okay? The Al
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.680]  Saudis. The big difference is the Al Saudis play the game with us, even though under the
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:29.080]  table some of them will finance terrorism and everything else. Chavez did not. And that's
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:36.000]  where it comes down to. Whether you're the Shah of Iran or the Emirate of Kuwait or whomever,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.200]  if you play ball with the big country, you're gonna stay in power and you're gonna be there.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.200]  If you don't, if you pick the other side, they're gonna get you out one way or another.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.320]  And I think that's what happened.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.080]  But now it's changing where the Arab Spring from Tunisia right through Libya, all of it,
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.800]  the West, NATO was in there starting all those. That was not spontaneous. And they're putting
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.960]  Al Qaeda in while telling us give our rights up because of Al Qaeda.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:11.560]  Look, this planet is topsy turvy. I don't think you or I have ever been in a time period
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:18.680]  where the world, the world was so upset about everything. I mean, all you gotta do is go
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:25.320]  outside and talk to people. Nobody's happy. Everybody's upset. They're all confused. I
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.880]  mean, this is this is happening time and time again. And it's not the Democratic administration.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:38.280]  People weren't happy with the Republican administration. People generally just don't trust government
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.240]  anymore. And that's the problem. There's too much greed out there, Alex. There's too much
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:50.560]  money to be made that these people are just running amok doing whatever they have to do.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.520]  That's why voices like you and what we do on Coast to Coast are critical to try to get
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.860]  at least people to listen up. I mean, I remember originally you were on the terrorist watch
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.360]  list, right?
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.120]  You were on that watch list about, you know, when it first came out about Americans to
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:13.000]  watch. I mean, how ludicrous can it be? I mean, you're merely calling it the way you
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  see it.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.920]  Well, it's done as an intimidation against the American people. It's done as an intimidation
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.160]  so people say you better not say anything or they'll do something to you. And then you
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:27.520]  give in to the tyranny. And pretty soon you're in the Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany. George
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.080]  Norrie is our guest. I want to look farther afield when we come back and get into the
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.360]  economic meltdown that George has been covering for, I don't know, 12 years on Coast to Coast
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.800]  or even longer before that with his other radio show and what all his guests are telling
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.080]  him what he thinks is happening and and then look into the stars.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.120]  Where does he think humanity is going? What does his gut tell him about our destiny? And
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.480]  then some of your phone calls? I'll give that number out. We're on the march. The Empire's

[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.160]  over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:11.160]  sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact that
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:15.540]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:21.640]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.840]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:32.520]  out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:37.520]  Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got

[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:09.520]  saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says fool me once.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:18.480]  Shame on shame on you. Fool me, we can't get fooled again. He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:28.200]  And it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:37.600]  By the way, we were told that Obama had a total mandate for socialism, government run
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:43.240]  healthcare to take our guns because he was elected. And that he was just the most popular
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.680]  thing since sliced bread. Obama approval drops as Americans take a dimmer view of his economic
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.680]  policies.
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:54.020]  Yeah, I won't raise taxes on poor people. How do you like all those new healthcare taxes,
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:58.200]  that new payroll tax? We're gonna get George Norrie's take on that. And then the larger
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.440]  world where all this is going. First off, the new issue, the March issue has been out
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.460]  for about, I don't know, 12 days or so.

[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.720]  And spread the word about the broadcast, spread the word about infowars.com, about the syndicated
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.520]  show. And spread the word about people like George Norie and coastacostam.com. What, midnight
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.920]  to 4 AM central, and I guess that would be Pacific 10 to 2, at coastacostam.com. Those
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.700]  people that will tell the truth or will have other views on, who aren't stagnant, who aren't
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:53.800]  just reading off a teleprompter, who aren't a stuffed suit, who are real, who aren't going
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.600]  off just some globalist agenda, but are real people.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.880]  That's growing, that's exploding. George, I wanna get into Obama's approval rating,
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:06.720]  and where you see all that going in the economy, and the move to disarm the people while they
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.320]  deny it. And then I wanna get into the bigger picture and where you see things are going.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:15.960]  But I've thrown out a bunch of questions here. What's front and center on your radar? In
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.360]  fact, tell me about, cuz I've seen clips of it, and I wish I had time to watch it, I listen
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.860]  to the show.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:25.640]  Tell me about, cuz you've done hit TV shows on sci-fi, you've done them other places,
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.260]  on top of doing three, four hours of radio a day. But tell us, the listeners, about the
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:34.080]  new TV show you've been doing for a while that I just keep seeing buzz about.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.040]  I'm having a lot of fun with that. There's a company publicly held, Alex, called Guium.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:45.840]  And they produce specialized videos and programs that are in the yoga, meditation, alternative
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.640]  medicine. And the chairman of the board is just a fan of Coast to Coast, and he loves
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:37:00.400]  it. He went out and bought the entire DVD business from Universal, by Vindi Entertainment.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]  Wow.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.880]  And he owns it. And now he's saying to himself, gee, what do I do with it? So he went to one
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:12.560]  of his producers who knows us and said, let's develop a program with George and see what
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:20.080]  we can do. So I flew to Denver, we cut a deal, and it's on weekly. The television show is
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:27.500]  called Beyond Belief, and it hosts people and guests, much like Coast to Coast. You'll
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:34.080]  be on it. And it's done before a live audience. So it gives me an opportunity to do a lot
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.280]  of television, which of course is what I did a long time ago. And I'm having a great time
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.960]  doing that. We fly up to Denver one weekend a month, take four shows, and then they air
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:53.200]  them on Fridays at 7 p.m. Eastern time. And it's an internet-based program. It's a subscription-based
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.200]  show.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.800]  Well, that's the future. That's what I've been doing for, well, 10 years with that,
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.400]  with subscription, or 11 years as a Glenn Beck's doing. And how many Emmys have you
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.400]  won for News?
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.400]  Three.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.400]  Three.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.240]  And so there's a link. The company's offering people 10 days free to take a look at this.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:18.440]  So it's worth it. It's giamtv.com slash George. Let me spell it for you, Alex. G-A-I-A-M-T-V.com
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.240]  slash George. Or you can simply go to coast to coastam.com, click hosts at the top of
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.160]  the page, and then the TV icon opens up and there's a link there. But I'm having a great
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.080]  time doing it. It's fun. But, you know, I'm also doing speeches all around the country.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.920]  This Saturday, I'm going to be in Edison, New Jersey. People are interested in that.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:44.200]  Just go to my calendar schedule on our website and come on out and see me. I think it is
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.280]  so important, Alex, so critical, as you know, to be in the public's eye, to meet them face
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:55.860]  to face, to talk with them, to find out what they like, what they don't. That's how I pick
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:02.040]  up my stories for Coast to Coast. You go out there and talk to real people about real issues
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.680]  and they tell you what it's like. They tell you, you know what, things are tough for me.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:11.620]  I can't pay my electric bill. I can't do this. I can't do that. We don't feel that. We don't
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:16.320]  get to it. Those people who are employed and working and paying their bills, they don't
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:23.240]  see the pain and the anguish that is happening. But it's increasing. And it is increasing.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:27.040]  So we have devoted ourselves and I did want to say that we're going to set up a foundation
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.880]  if and when we get to a certain subscriber level with the TV show. I'm giving it back
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.760]  to people. I'm giving it back to Coast to Coast listeners. I get emails from people
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:41.680]  who write in and say, look, I don't have enough money for food. I'm not on the food stamp
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:48.080]  program. I can't pay my electric bill. You know, they want 200 bucks. They want 300 bucks.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:54.740]  I'm going to set up a foundation and have that administered and it'll be a 503 and then
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.460]  just be able to help people that way, because if I'll take the profits from the show and
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:04.160]  do that, it's a great idea. Look, bottom line, I can see the real degeneration in the economy
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.960]  across the board, you know, with relatives, you name it. And then they just keep saying
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.400]  the economy is great. The economy is wonderful. Everything's fine. You're a conspiracy theorist
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.760]  if you think, you know, that the recession didn't end five years ago.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.120]  Where do you see this going? The meltdown in Europe, the paramilitary gear up. They're
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:28.920]  clearly getting ready for a collapse. And I think they're going to use the a civil war
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.440]  they try to start as the thing they're going to blame for the collapse when the collapse
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.880]  is the private Federal Reserve and the agenda. Twenty one. What do you think's happening
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:41.280]  with the economy and all the guests you talk to? Where do you see that going, George?
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:49.040]  I am amazed, simply amazed at the perception that things are going well. The stock market
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:56.240]  is booming ahead at record levels and retail sales up today compared to a month ago. You
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:02.040]  know, people are, you know, happy days are here again. It's unbelievable. But we're being
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:07.920]  propped up by this, you know, fiat form of currency, which means there's nothing back
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.560]  again, or the Federal Reserve just continues to pump billions of dollars a month into the
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.480]  system to just keep this going. The problem is, and I don't know when it will happen.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.800]  I'm already seeing the inflation tick up. It's got to pick up the energy. And, you know,
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.360]  it may not affect us in the next year or two, but I got to tell you, eventually somebody's
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.200]  going to have to pay the piper. And you just can't keep doing this this way. I mean, it's
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:42.400]  almost as if these politicians say, all I want to do is make things seem OK until I'm
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.840]  out of office. And then it's the next guy's problem or the next guy's problem. You know,
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.920]  this mess started with the Bush administration. It's in it with the Obama administration.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:00.200]  It'll be in it with the next group that comes in in 2016. I mean, it's endless, but it's
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:08.920]  a worldwide situation. And that is why I believe Homeland Security and other organizations
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:16.760]  are getting ready for the possibility of civil disturbance. And they're just concerned that
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.320]  the people will go ballistic and they don't know how to handle it.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.120]  Absolutely. Folks, here's the toll free number. Just a few calls for George Nori of Coast
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.920]  to Coast AM Dotcom, the big national host. They have some also great weekend shows there.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.920]  Eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two three
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.980]  one for any questions or comments you have for George Nori. Eight hundred two five nine
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:46.600]  ninety two thirty one. And, you know, George, it's not that I dislike celebrities. I just
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.960]  don't care about meeting somebody just because they're in movies.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.520]  If I don't like their movies or I don't think they're an interesting person, I don't care
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.880]  about meeting them. I mean, for me to talk to a lawyer yesterday who you've interviewed
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.280]  quite a bit, who's beaten the FDA dragon slayer, who's beaten them seven times. Jonathan, you
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.760]  were done. Yes. When nobody else can. That's a celebrity to me. But somebody who's a trailblazer
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.480]  like you that, you know, Coast to Coast maybe had 10 percent political news.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:16.360]  You made it about 50 percent, in my estimation, and hardcore patriot news. I mean, that's
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.200]  a big thing. I remember you were the only one opposing the Model States Health Emergency
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.720]  Powers Act on big national radio. And really, I can say your show helped kill forced inoculation
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]  of the American people.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.840]  A lot of folks see that the establishment's not going to admit who's been hurting them
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:36.280]  and who's been holding them back. And again, I've got to say we were already growing in
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.700]  a very fast metric, reaching people. But you know, most people are egomaniacs and talk
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.500]  radio and media. You're not you're into the info.
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.000]  And so I want to say, George, you're a real guy and I've had a chance to eat dinner with
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.460]  you, hang out quite a few times. You and Tom Dannheiser, the whole crew. You're just a
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:58.300]  real guy. And, you know, I admire what you've done. And I'm a fan of you. So it's really
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:00.760]  that simple. So I appreciate all you've done for Liberty.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.160]  Well, it's just critical. You know, Alex, all I want, all I want is the truth to be
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:11.600]  known to people. You know, we can handle the truth. I was watching Beyond the Sea with
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:17.440]  Kevin Spacey. He was playing the part of Bobby Darin, who I'm now into. I mean, I never liked
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.620]  this music when I was a kid. But now, you know, I think it's great. The poor guy died
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:26.980]  at 37. It's crazy how your taste changes. Yeah, it's absolutely. But, you know, his
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:31.440]  his pseudo mother in the movie was talking to the doctor because he had rheumatic fever
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:37.280]  when he was a kid. And she said, you tell me the truth. You can never go wrong with
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:43.080]  the truth. And that is so true. I mean, we are tough people. Just don't lie to us. Tell
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:49.160]  us the way it is. You know, if the economy is a shambled, let's make adjustments. Let's
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:56.120]  fix what we need to fix. Let's move on. Whatever it is, don't lie to us. Tell us the truth.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.000]  We'll respect you more that way. And let's get this country rolling again.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.820]  I agree. But we have such a predatory establishment where the worst of the worst get in. A lot
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:11.560]  of these globalists enjoy being nasty and dirty and lying. And they're destroying their
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.960]  own nest. I mean, they already run things. It's just like Hitler turning east into Russia
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:21.120]  or Napoleon. They're going to go a bridge too far. Remember the movie Eyes Wide Shut?
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.120]  Yes. Stanley Coover, he died before he finished it. You've got to watch it three or four times
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.920]  before it makes any sense to you. That's right. Now, people who listen to you and listen to
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:36.720]  us will probably understand it pretty quick. But the bottom line with that movie is that
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:43.720]  the elitists, they simply don't care about us. You know, they have what they want. They've
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:47.800]  got mansions all over the world. If they think there's going to be a problem in the United
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.960]  States, they'll pick up and they'll move off to some other country.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.920]  They've got 10 private jets with valets and butlers waiting. I mean, I've had a chance
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.400]  to be behind the scenes in Hollywood some. I know you have too. People just have jets
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.520]  with butlers on them. You know what? When I go on speaking engagements,
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:09.920]  the person will say, well, Mr. Norie, we can't afford to fly first class. I said, I don't
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.000]  fly first class. I go coach. I want to sit back there. I want to just enjoy myself. You
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.880]  know, I fly Southwest Airlines most of the time. I get in line with my boarding pass
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.820]  number. And you know, that's just the way it is. And you know, the elitists, they do
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:32.480]  have their private jets and their yachts and all their things. And they are so insulated
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:37.520]  from the real world. They don't. For those that don't know, the reason they
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.240]  don't even see us as humans, they show up. There's a giant, you know, 20 million, 50
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.200]  million, 100 million dollar yacht. There's three, four checks or whatever they're into
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.280]  model level waiting like a can of peanuts on the table.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.720]  I mean, that's how it's seen. And they're just totally disconnected from us when we
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.000]  supply and produce all this. And the scientific developments are most of them are made in
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.260]  little workshops still. And it's, it's, I mean, really it has let them eat cake like
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:04.260]  Marie Antoinette.
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:10.000]  That's so true. So true. And so the bottom line here for all of us is we need to stay
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.840]  together as a group and getting back to that LA Times article, which is how you started
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:22.380]  this interview. We are not trying to disrupt the flow of this nation by any means. All
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:28.560]  we want is fairness and truth. We want what our founding fathers created from the get
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.800]  go.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:37.240]  Don't play around with Constitution. Don't screw up our lives. Back off. Go away. You
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.280]  know, you want to move to that island. Go ahead. But leave us alone so we can run this
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:50.480]  country and make it the great country it always has been. And let's just build a planet that
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:56.520]  is just so, you know, I get so frustrated. You know, we could solve the nation.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:01.680]  We have so much potential, but the evil people don't want potential because real potential
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:08.440]  threatens them. They want a gamed stage, tilted tables. Inside always wins. I want to go to
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:13.640]  break and take a few calls in the short segment after that with George Norrie. But George,
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.240]  where do you see humanity going? What does your gut tell you about humans future? I mean,
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.240]  will we destroy ourselves?
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.480]  I don't think we're going to destroy ourselves, Alex, but I'm going to tell you this. It's
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:30.640]  going to be one bumpy roller coaster ride. We are going to have ups and downs. And if
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.480]  you're not strapped in, you're going to fall out and you've got to be careful. Exactly.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.680]  And then we're strapping in because government's been strapping in. And then they say we're
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.720]  kooks for food and guns while they're getting seed vaults, giant food bunkers, weapons.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.720]  That was just two thousand seven hundred tanks they ordered last month. They've ordered tens
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:54.160]  of thousands of them. They've deployed them. I've confirmed it with the military. Absolutely.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:49:00.760]  Let's get these kids off of these prescription pharmaceutical mood altering drugs, because
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:06.000]  that is creating most of these problems. Again, you're one of the only national host or the
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.080]  only other than myself who I've seen fighting. Well, I got more and more. Michael Savage
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.680]  has been talking about it. You've been talking about aspartame, all of what you think about
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.120]  all the big studies coming out, even in CBS News that, OK, aspartame does brain damage
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.440]  and give you type two diabetes.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.440]  I mean, it's just everything we've talked about is now being admitted. So now we're
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.240]  not just kooks now. We're terrorists. George, right out of the drinking water, get rid of
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:35.040]  MSG, get rid of aspartame. And you know what? That's what we've been pounding away at all
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.560]  these years. And we're being vindicated. Studies are coming out now, as you just said, that
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.800]  are showing and proving that this stuff is not good for you.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:49.440]  But the human body wasn't made to put this junk in it. Sounds like an extremist talk
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.840]  to me. You're saying the government and industry would do something to hurt us. That sounds
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.920]  like terror talk to me, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL and L.A. Times.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:05.040]  Today, the FDA has now said the antibiotic, the Z-Pax, erythromycin, not good for you,
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.960]  causes heart problems in a lot of people.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  Oh.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.360]  I mean, how does this stuff come to market? And then they tell us.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.800]  You know, I never take antibiotics, but I got a chest thing that I couldn't shake a
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:21.240]  few months ago and they gave me a Z-Pak. And I'm not kidding. I told my dad this. I said,
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.860]  my heart was beating funny one day. I was having trouble breathing. And he said it might
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:29.560]  be the antibiotics. I didn't know about the Z-Pak. What are they saying?
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:34.080]  Yeah, they are saying that it could cause heart arrhythmia and heart rhythm problems.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.200]  And they're issuing warnings.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.280]  See, I didn't even know that, what it was doing. And I just told you what it did. Can
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  you believe that?
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280]  Yeah, that's scary. That's scary.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.160]  Because, you know, a few times I've had like 10 cups of coffee in a day. And then my heart,
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.960]  you know, does that a few times that's happened. Well, this is what that did. And I'd had one
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.040]  cup of coffee. And I was like, what is this? And it happened the next day. And I threw
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.780]  the package in the trash. I didn't finish all the pills. A few calls straight ahead
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:02.000]  with George Norie of Coast2CoastAM.com.

[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:33.780]  I don't know. They're not really considered men. Because you talk about them, they almost
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:36.540]  want to hide under their bed when they hear the truth. And those people are useless to
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.620]  us. But the people who listen to both of your shows are the people who are going to pretty
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:44.220]  much try to save this country because we're all slowly being put under house arrest. I
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:48.160]  mean, you could see it very simply by, you know, one president, President Bush, starts
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.220]  out with artificial oil shortages, shuts down the refineries, and then the prices of fuel
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:56.340]  goes up. And the next president fits in, and now he's creating energy shortages. Our next
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.980]  president that comes in after Obama will create food shortages. But before then, before the
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:03.860]  food shortages, they need to take our guns away. Because if you touch our food, we're
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:05.740]  going to come after you. So they're going to start...
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:09.580]  Wow, you just said it all, and they are shutting down our coal power plants. When China gets
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:11.060]  to have them, great points. George?
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:16.220]  Well, there's no doubt. I mean, look, this whole thing has been manipulated since the
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:21.380]  get-go, and they're going to continue to do that. But I do not believe they're going to
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:26.380]  be able to come and get our guns. I mean, they have created an issue with the Second
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.900]  Amendment, and they're going to have a difficult time trying to change that. It doesn't mean
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:34.140]  they're going to not try. Believe me, they are going to try. They're going to start with
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.180]  the assault weapons and everything else and try to ease their way in.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:44.500]  But the caller's absolutely right, Bob, is absolutely right, that if things go awry,
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.020]  that's what they want to be prepared for. That's why I think Homeland Security is buying
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:56.060]  2,000 tanks and billions around the dam, because they think, my God, if there's an Arab Spring,
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:57.420]  what if there's an American Spring?
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:01.860]  And they want to deny that it's happening, which is another military tactic, but in their
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:07.460]  internal documents and now public, what about the racism of Homeland Security saying white
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:12.820]  men are the problem? I mean, they actually say that, and the LA Times echoes it. I mean,
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:17.060]  that's even shocking me. I mean, I knew the new Al Qaeda was, quote, white Christian gun
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:21.460]  owners trying to make it a white thing to own guns, but everybody I know wants guns.
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:26.500]  Yeah, there's a simple solution to this, which they don't seem to understand. Go back to
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:31.640]  the Constitution and you'll see everybody calm and peaceful again.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:37.300]  And everybody has rights. Sebastian wants to ask you a question. Real quick, Sebastian.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.620]  I wanted to ask you, what do you think about China arming up their cells with a bunch of
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:48.860]  drones and how the U.S. now is, you know, arming itself with drones to, you know, watch
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:49.860]  us?
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.660]  Oh, you know, we've talked about that. As a matter of fact, our program tomorrow night
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:58.620]  on Coast to Coast will be on ammunition and drones. So make sure you're part of that.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:03.980]  I mean, it's ludicrous. I mean, they just think they need to be everywhere.
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:08.860]  Now, George, Politico and Media Matters says there is no bullets or tanks and that we're
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:09.860]  insane.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:16.020]  All they got to do is go on the Web site and look at all the articles that are out there
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:17.020]  time and time again.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:21.020]  No, I mean, obviously they're lying to us. That's what I'm saying. It's over the top.
[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.420]  I want to ask you about that. We come back in one minute. Why do they think they can
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:28.220]  lie with impunity? It's discrediting them. And we'll take a few more calls. Thank you,
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.380]  Sebastian. We're going to talk to Roy, Catherine and Kim. We're going to jam in three more
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:34.340]  and then George is gone to get some shout out before his show tonight.
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:40.780]  Then a big news blitz at another special guest. The police say, get a dog, no guns.

[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:24.740]  Texas, Alex Jones. All right, we're going to move quick because we're almost out of
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:31.020]  time with George Nori. But briefly, George, it's like Gibbs said two weeks ago, oh, I
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:35.980]  was told a lie about a drone program overseas that was admitted program. It was like Wizard
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:40.580]  of Oz, he said. Why do they think they're going to get away with just insane cuckoo
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:44.660]  lying? You know what? It's the old deny, deny, deny.
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:49.100]  You know, there's always things. There was a comedy where a guy was in bed with another
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:54.580]  woman. His wife comes in screaming at him. What are you doing in bed with her? And with
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:59.540]  her, you know, lying right next to him, he said, there's nobody here. That's gaslighting.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:04.380]  You know, and that's the name of the game. Just simply deny, deny, deny. And people will
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:09.340]  just go away. That's their theory. The problem is people aren't going to go away anymore.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:15.340]  People are too smart. It's a weird trick. I'm getting sick of it.
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:21.580]  Roy in Montana, you're on the air. Go ahead. I just was wondering what George's thought
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:26.940]  was on Planet X. What his gut was, if it's disinfo or did he think it's real? You know,
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:30.580]  with all the dead scientists, I don't know what he'd think.
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:35.580]  I think there is an extra body in our solar system somewhere out there.
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:39.420]  There's a bunch of them in the Kuiper Belt. Yeah, there's no doubt. But this Planet X
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:45.540]  that people have talked about for years is probably there. And you know, Zechariah Stitch
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:50.660]  and the late Zechariah Stitch and his work called The Twelfth Planet, his theory was
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:56.580]  that this elliptical orbit of this planet is 3,600 years, comes by and plays havoc with
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:02.460]  us, whether it causes the flood of Noah and other catastrophes. But I do believe there
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:08.620]  is an object out there. I don't know why astronomers haven't found it yet when they are finding
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:14.340]  with Kepler all kinds of Earth-like planets beyond our own solar system. But I think something's
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:18.700]  there. Well, what about all the crazy meteors blowing
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:21.540]  up over Russia and Florida and everything else? Man, that's wild.
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:25.020]  Oh, we're right in the middle of a swap. I mean, there's no question about it. We're
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:32.140]  in the middle of a swarm of asteroids and meteors. And let's hope to God we don't get
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:36.940]  hit with one of them because, Alex, had that meteor that became a meteorite over Russia
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:43.700]  exploded a little closer to the planet, those 1,100 people who were injured all would have
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:45.700]  been dead. Oh, absolutely. Probably more.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:48.980]  And then it would have been flat. Absolutely, real fast. Catherine in New York,
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:51.380]  you're on the air with George Norie. Hello.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:55.780]  Hi. Hi, I just wanted to address what George just
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:03:02.480]  said previously about the elite just being so isolated. And I just think that we really
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.620]  need to call a spade a spade, and even Gerald Cilente has said it, and just call them what
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:12.220]  they are. These people have a serious addiction problem.
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.100]  And I mean- They're power junkies. That's what Gerald
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:18.260]  Cilente calls them. I mean, I was so glad to hear him say it and
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:23.400]  put it in those terms because that's exactly what they are. And I just think that we need
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:33.180]  to really drive that home. And a serious intervention needs to happen. And the people really need
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:40.520]  to step up and totally intervene. I mean, I just hope enough of us are prepared to do
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:44.300]  what it takes. Absolutely. Thank you so much for those words.
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:49.820]  Thank you so much, Alex. They're bored with life. So the only thing left for them is the
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:53.580]  manipulation of human mind. You're right. One quick final question. We
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:56.740]  got one minute. Ken in Minnesota, ask your question.
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:03.300]  Gentlemen, honored to speak with you both. One quick question. When can we have our day,
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:09.180]  our march, the Patriot March in Washington DC, or let alone Minneapolis, Minnesota, Los
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:12.740]  Angeles, New York? Sure. When should the Patriots stand up? George
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:17.820]  Norrie? They should stand up right now and do it peacefully
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:23.100]  and let the planet know we're as mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:28.460]  Exactly. If people support my show, your show, my prison planet.tv show, your TV show, if
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:33.340]  you support the alternative, it will become the new dominant system. Vote with your dollars,
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:38.060]  your mind. There's more than one way to fight. The system wants us to have a physical confrontation
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:42.380]  because they can win that. They don't want us to have a velvet revolution. George Norrie,
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:46.460]  I'll be listening tonight, coast to coast AM on the manmade weather changes. Thanks
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.780]  for spending time with us. Thanks, Alex, always.
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:52.500]  I'll see you during the break, George. All right, folks, we're going to come right back
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:56.820]  with a news blitz, your phone calls, then a special guest. I'm not kidding, I got video.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:05:01.180]  The police all over the country say, buy a dog, turn in your guns. We'll be back.
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:06.540]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:12.180]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:17.340]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:44.460]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:51.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:55.340]  We just had syndicated radio host, George Norrie, on from coast to coast AM. He was
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:59.780]  on for a little over an hour. He had to go. We have callers who obviously wanted to talk
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:03.420]  to Norrie. If you still want to talk to me, that's fine. If not, hang up. The toll free
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:17.020]  number to join us is 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. We had scheduled the Project Veritas who put
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:21.380]  together a video of police in all these departments saying, no, you shouldn't be able to own guns,
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:22.460]  get a dog.
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:26.860]  And then O'Keefe, I'm told, is under the weather so we're gonna see if we're gonna have one
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:32.220]  of his other cohorts on the broadcast coming up here in about 30 minutes. But regardless,
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:38.500]  we're gonna play that video slash audio for everyone here. Also, white smoke rises over
[02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:42.540]  Vatican, a new pope has been elected.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:49.820]  Let's fade up Fox News here whenever we get a chance to do that. And we will be breaking
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:58.660]  more of that down here today as that unfolds. Now, continuing with news, there is some pretty
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:07.500]  incredible stuff going on and happening up at infoawards.com. The Democrat group labels
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:11.620]  talk of DHS bullet buys as extremist.
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:15.860]  Fade back up the new pope being chosen. I wonder if he'll bizarrely just resign and
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:21.340]  disappear. The Vatican is being blackmailed with sex scandals, which is why you're not
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:25.580]  even let into it now unless you can be blackmailed. Undoubtedly, you've got all these cardinals
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:30.420]  raining. This is all part of the new order takeover. The royal family of England with
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:33.940]  the Jimmy Savelle child sex ring thing.
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:40.780]  They're being blackmailed by the mega banks. This is amazing. White smoke rises over Vatican
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:47.100]  as new pope has been elected. And they're gonna announce any moment now. And look, everybody's
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:50.720]  out there got their flags from their country. Like, will it be a Mexican pope? Will it be
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.180]  a US pope? Will it be a Filipino pope? Will it be a Russian pope? Will it be just on and
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:11:06.380]  all? Will it be an Italian pope? It was like a football game. And John Bowne just said,
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:11.220]  the happiness of the folks live in Rome, as they now know, as the world does, that we
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.540]  have a new pope.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.660]  And then the old guy flies off in a helicopter to his castle. Like, no discussion of why
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:25.220]  he's been elected. The master of liturgical ceremonies enters the Sistine Chapel. The
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:31.540]  senior cardinal will ask of the newly elected pope, do you accept your election as supreme
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:32.540]  pontiff?
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:36.380]  At least they're not crying like when Kim Jong-il died.
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:42.420]  What name do you wish to be called? The information will be entered on a formal document. It is
[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:46.740]  at that point that the white smoke pours out of the Sistine Chapel chimney and the bells
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:52.740]  of St. Peter's toll. So we believe that has happened and the cardinal who has been elected
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:58.740]  has accepted the position. The new pope, we believe at this moment, is changing into his
[02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:05.380]  papal white cassock. And one by one, we believe the cardinals right now would be approaching
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:14.100]  him to swear their obedience. Moments from now, we will meet the new pope and you will
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:19.420]  hear the announcement, Habemus Papam, Latin for we have a pope, and he will be introduced
[02:12:19.420 --> 02:12:28.300]  to the world in Latin and deliver his first words as pope. It will happen moments from
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:33.780]  now. As you can hear, they have official business to take care of inside the Vatican, but the
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:40.820]  celebration goes on outside in St. Peter's Square. And look at the smiles on the folks'
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.580]  faces as they continue to celebrate. We're going to pause for one moment to let our Fox
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:58.980]  stations join us. Oh, they've got the signs up. Viva papa. I'm Shepard Smith. It's 12
[02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:04.340]  minutes past seven. Oh my gosh. And tonight we have a pope, the white smoke. We have a
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:10.660]  pope. Sistine Chapel just about three, maybe four minutes ago. And by the thousands people
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:14.100]  in St. Peter's Square as the bells rang overhead.
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:19.260]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're getting live coverage here. Just just tell me as soon
[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:25.100]  as they announce who it is and we'll we'll cover some of it there for all the listeners
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:31.980]  out there in radio land. Let's go to some phone calls right now so I can reset my brain
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:38.140]  before I get back into all this other news. Let's talk to Teresa in Oregon. You're on
[02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:42.180]  the air, Teresa. Hello. Good day. Greetings. This is an honor
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:47.820]  to talk to a fellow info warrior. My question is, do you think the media in the form of
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:51.100]  radio talk show hosts are revealing their true identities?
[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:58.220]  I'm not sure. Oh, I'm sorry. They're openly relieved that
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:05.180]  Rand Paul stood up for everybody and he stood there for 13 hours and just stood up for the
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:10.460]  American people all week. I've been hearing, you know, people just really thankful that
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:13.180]  he's there standing up for us and talking about.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:19.100]  Well, I got to say, I know Rand Paul. He's a real guy. He was not going to run for Senate.
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:23.660]  I'm not saying that I got him to, but I off the air said you will end up winning. You
[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:29.100]  will. And he's he's even said that on air that I pushed him and others did. And as long
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:34.700]  as he doesn't allow all the political sycophants, because even if you hire libertarian politicos,
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:38.300]  the way it works is there's some sycophantic ones.
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:42.500]  I mean, my gosh, he's filled the Daily Caller people and I'm not bashing them. They do some
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:46.980]  good work. But I mean, Tucker Carlson has blown up and just said that I'm evil, I'm
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:56.160]  bad and you flipped out. And but I mean, overall, I like Rand Paul. He is doing the right thing.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:02.220]  He's real and he's certainly a lot better than Jeb Bush or Jeb Bush's nephew running
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:06.260]  for Texas ag commissioner to end up being president.
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:14.180]  He certainly is is real and his dad's a great person. And the system is really scared of
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:19.780]  him, but he's really maneuvered well and is very articulate and very well spoken. And
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:24.180]  the more hardcore he gets, the more popular he'll get because we're facing hardcore tyranny.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:28.500]  But you're saying our talk show host showing their real identity. I have been listening
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.420]  to a lot of the big mainline talk shows. I'm too busy doing my own nightly news and research
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:33.420]  and things around here.
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:37.120]  I listen to some talk radio in the morning and the afternoon, but mainly local radio
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:41.220]  to see what they're up to. And then I see compilations online of what other people have
[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:49.840]  been covering. But I mean, are other mainline talk show hosts now supporting Rand Paul who
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:54.860]  they demonized a few years ago during the election?
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:16:00.380]  I hear Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, Shepard Smith, of course, Judge Andrew
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:07.300]  Napolitano and Lee Dobbs. But just there was no other talk for a whole week after that.
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.660]  And I was just really impressed just listening to people that I thought were mainstream conservatives
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:17.820]  say, well, I am an independent and this does mean a lot to the American people.
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:21.140]  Sure, sure, ma'am, let me explain to you what's happened. And of course, I was aware of what
[02:16:21.140 --> 02:16:26.720]  you just mentioned cuz I saw the articles about it, I just didn't watch it. The Republicans
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:32.820]  tried to beat Rand Paul in Kentucky in the primary, they ran a big pro New World Order
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:33.820]  guy.
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:37.640]  When they couldn't win, Rand was smart and went and said, hey, let's be friends and they
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.780]  ended up beating the Democrat. He's one of the only good people in the Senate now. And
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:48.900]  what's happened is they do focus groups, they have real internal polls, they have data mining
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:53.020]  data. They don't get mainline polls, they get data mining data, like Forbes did a few
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:58.060]  months ago and said the data mining shows gun control is unbelievably unpopular, record
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:16:59.640]  gun ownership.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:03.020]  People don't trust the government, they don't trust the system, Theresa. So let me answer
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:10.380]  your question, I appreciate your call. What's happened is, I mean, Glenn Beck, who I have
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:15.060]  monitored some, at least seen clips, he's like, I don't like the Republicans, I'm a
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:21.180]  libertarian now, I love Ron Paul, I love Rand Paul, they're the only ones I like, I join
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.180]  them.
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:25.980]  Because they know there's been a total awakening with libertarians and conservatives, that
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:30.700]  Mitt Romney was New World Order and all the rest of it. And so, but also with the left,
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:35.660]  they don't support Obama, the data mining, the polls show that. Here's Obama approval
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:41.060]  drops at Washington Post. They're having to admit it cuz they're hoax that he has everybody
[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:46.100]  absolutely unified behind him, that has fallen apart.
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:55.180]  That has gone the way of the goonie bird. So when all these guys come out and endorse
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:18:01.500]  Rand Paul now, it's because they realize that's really what's popular. And who is Rand Paul?
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:06.000]  He's talking about bullets, he's talking about tanks, he's talking about drones, he's talking
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.740]  about TSA, he's talking about NSA, he's talking about tyranny, he's talking about all these
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.740]  illegal wars.
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:20.400]  He is a creature of his father and a creature of the liberty movement and a creature of
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:25.140]  this show and a creature of himself, a liberty lover. I'm a creature of it, you're a creature
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:31.020]  of it. And so we are winning. I mean, look at the LA Times, they're growing fast, they're
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:36.380]  dangerous, they're cells, they're terrorists, they're white. That's why they go, if you
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:37.380]  don't like socialism, you're racist.
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:39.260]  You don't want to turn your guns and you're racist. You're like, what does it have to
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:46.640]  do intellectually? Shut up, racist. They are desperate just to try to get the minorities
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:51.600]  who are the majority now in most states and under the age of 15, everywhere, to not buy
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.300]  into liberty, Second Amendment, private property, family. Which the Latin Americans and Mexicans
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:19:01.520]  will totally buy into, historically, if you look at the cultures. They're desperate to
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.500]  create that division now.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:09.140]  So they're like, white people are evil, LA Times, whites are terrorists. I mean, can
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:15.440]  you imagine if they said blacks are terrorists or Hispanics are terrorists? And it's the
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:19.700]  perfect double back and they've been planning it before Obama, the social engineers. I told
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:23.380]  you this was going on before Obama got in, it's just accelerated. I mean, look at this
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:29.140]  LA Times article, if you just join me. Peril from patriots, and it says they say things
[02:19:29.140 --> 02:19:32.940]  like only criminals in government want unarmed public.
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:37.940]  What part of shall not be infringed, do you not understand? Repeal and negate. And it
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:42.460]  goes on, they're intractable hatred, often motivated by religious zeal. They're not jihadist.
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:47.880]  They are white, right wing Americans, nearly all with an obsessive attachment to guns who
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:53.740]  may resent a greater danger to the lives of American civilians than international terrorists.
[02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:58.540]  And then they break it down. The right wingers are going to blow stuff up. You know who really
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:01.540]  is going to do it, don't you? And blame us. You know.
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:07.860]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:53.220]  and their program of global eugenics, dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.

[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:06.260]  Quantitative easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:11.260]  China getting out of U.S. treasuries. At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national
[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:17.580]  debt was at 11 trillion gold trading around $850 per ounce. Close to 2012, the national
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:23.600]  debt exceeded 16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce. The 20 trillion threshold
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:28.380]  for the national debt is inevitable. Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for
[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:33.500]  spending its stimulus. What's worse, a printing press to finance. A hundred years ago, we
[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:38.180]  had a gold standard to limit this madness but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.

[02:23:57.020 --> 02:24:14.140]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live. They have still not announced who the new pope
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:19.020]  is, the white spokesman coming out. They'll build the anticipation with all the showmanship
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:23.300]  and announce it. When are they saying they're going to announce who the new pope is? Because
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:29.220]  I'm actually interested. I want to know politically what that means. That'll be a big deal.
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:33.660]  And the time they think they'll probably come out on the balcony is somewhere around 45
[02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:37.980]  minutes. They're asking that you don't hold them to that too closely. But somewhere-
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:41.060]  All right, we'll have analysis on this by the end of the show today or on the nightly
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:46.540]  news tonight, 7 o'clock central. Thanks for holding. Let's talk to Caleb in Oregon. You
[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:48.540]  want to talk about drones? Go ahead.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:55.580]  Hi, Alex. It's a pleasure to talk to you and George as well, even though he's not on anymore.
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:25:02.180]  I listened to both your guys' shows religiously and thank you both for all the hard work that
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:08.420]  you're doing. These are very interesting times we're living in. And I just wanted to say,
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:16.380]  I have two of the most beautiful girls and I'm going to do anything to fight for their
[02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:23.500]  lives, their freedom. And I'm from Southern Oregon here. Another thing I just wanted to
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:27.820]  bring up, I know you've talked about it in the past and George has talked about it on
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:36.980]  his show and John B. Wells about John Nieveski. And he was a good friend of mine. And with
[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:44.060]  his passing, it was a lot of very fishy things surrounding his death and right around the
[02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:54.580]  same time with FPS Russia as well. And just really sad what's going on with the way, you
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:59.820]  know, we've got to worry about drones and it's impossible to find any ammo and all these
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:10.020]  things. It's just, it's kind of disheartening, but the way that you guys put the information
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:17.980]  out for all of us and it keeps it very positive and makes me want to continue on doing what
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:18.980]  I'm doing.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:23.940]  Well, thank you, brother. Look, look, the reason we're in crisis is the world is waking
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:31.740]  up to the globalist and all the corruption in every major institution. That's why history
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:36.860]  is being molded right now. A key jump point, kind of like when you aim an arrow and draw
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:41.940]  it back and then about to let it loose, we're at that critical time that will decide where
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:44.060]  the projectile goes.
[02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:50.120]  And so please don't thank me. We're all in this together. I work so hard because I know
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:55.080]  we're affecting history for the better. And I know that it's not just evil in the world.
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:00.220]  There is good in the world and there's competing forces. And so we have to animate the forces
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:07.420]  of good in the animating contest of liberty. I appreciate you calling. I mean, look at
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:09.220]  this type of news that's breaking.
[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:14.700]  You asked to let spy agencies scour American's finances. This is out of the Chicago Tribune.
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:20.180]  Folks, they've already been doing this for decades illegally. They already have, that's
[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:28.940]  when they say, we're going to fill out a suspicious persons or transaction report because you
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:31.820]  got out money out of the bank.
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:36.340]  They just want you to know you're being watched there and getting you ready for it. The government
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:40.100]  is the one that gives out the passcodes. They're the ones that have the data dumps, the social
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:43.480]  security numbers. They give the illegals the fake social security numbers. I mean, that's
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.120]  all come out. We're run by criminals.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:51.740]  And it has nothing to do with Al-Qaeda. The whole war on terror, as I warned you for the
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:58.420]  last 11 years, is about gun owners, constitutionalist, returning veterans. And now, and I already
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:03.220]  saw this in the training stuff two years ago, and I told you, white Al-Qaeda, and they're
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:06.580]  now announcing whites are terrorists.
[02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:10.860]  And whites will probably show up to local prisons and ask to be put in prisons and ask
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:14.900]  for the state to work their kids to death in slave camps. I mean, the average American
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:19.340]  rather than, I mean, whites know they're bad. Whites know they're the ultimate evil on Earth.
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:22.940]  Whites are the source of all evil, the media tells us that.
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:28.220]  And so this is a good thing that the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and LA Times and
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:32.520]  a bunch of the publications are saying, whites are terrorists. I could read the quote for
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:39.060]  you again, period. I agree with that. I mean, whites are the evil, and I think that's totally
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:43.540]  reasonable. And there are 2 billion bullets, but there aren't. And the armored vehicles,
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:48.640]  the aspartame, giving people type 2 diabetes and killing tens of thousands a year, very
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:49.640]  loving and liberal.
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.980]  I wanna join the Southern Poverty Law Center. I think you guys are awesome. You did a great
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:59.260]  job at Oklahoma City with the Elohim City white supremacy compound you had your informants
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:03.100]  over. And then when federal informants tried to blow the whistle, you had them arrested.
[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:07.220]  Man, you're really nice. I know you're liberals. It's not like I'm fake camouflage. You're
[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:12.300]  not really hardcore mercenaries or anything. You're not really banker intelligence operatives
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:13.300]  or anything.
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:19.140]  You're just little liberals that wanna help everybody and fund ethnic uprisings by Hispanics
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:24.780]  and others. You're just really nice people. And you're now telling us gun owners are terrorists,
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:29.460]  period. And whites are terrorists. And I don't think that's a big deal. I'm sure Fox News
[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:33.020]  will come out and say, how isn't it funny they're saying whites are terrorists. It's
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:34.020]  all a joke.
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:39.180]  They'll play the part of the right wing and make a joke out of it and talk about stuff
[02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:44.060]  like that. So we're gonna play a clip coming up of police saying, you don't need to own

[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:13.020]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:18.900]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and

[02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:12.380]  through our television sets. Even when the set is turned off, look around the environment
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:19.780]  we live in. Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons and methane have increased since 1958. Earth
[02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:26.980]  is being privatized. They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere. We are like
[02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:34.980]  a natural resource to them. To keep the planet, move on to another. They want benign indifference.
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:43.980]  They want us drugging. We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are is livestock.
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:49.980]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:58.980]  consciousness that resembles sleep. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:19.980]  Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:26.980]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:35.980]  right now dealing with the LA Times headline. Peril from Patriots, LA Times announces white
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:42.980]  men are terrorists. And they just say being white inherently is terrorism. I read the
[02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:51.980]  quote over and over again. It is unbelievable and I told you forever that this was coming.
[02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:55.980]  In fact, Kurt did a great job on this article. But you asked him to add the links from two
[02:34:55.980 --> 02:35:02.980]  years ago and a year ago. All our headlines about white al-Qaeda, the new threat. Here's
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:06.980]  some of them. Domestic terrorist as big a threat as al-Qaeda, says FBI. But see, that
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:10.980]  isn't the exact articles where I saw their internal training manuals and videos where
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:12.980]  every terrorist is a white guy.
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:16.980]  And then the minorities are reporting them. I mean, it's like the Arabs complain saying
[02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:21.980]  all the terror ads say Arabs are the terrorists. Well, now it's saying whites inherently are
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:25.980]  terrorists. And I've told you this was coming, now it's been announced. Incredible racial
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:33.980]  division, incredible leftist divide and conquer tactic, unbelievable. Now the folks that brought
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:40.980]  down ACORN, the people that have gone to Eric Holder's house, so many other incredible exploits
[02:35:40.980 --> 02:35:47.980]  in fighting tyranny joins us after this video clip that we're gonna be playing.
[02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:52.980]  The whole video is at theprojectveritas.org and on their YouTube channel. There's a whole
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:55.980]  bunch of videos up there, but we're gonna play a few minutes of this. Then we have our
[02:35:55.980 --> 02:36:02.980]  own clip of Michael Moore a few weeks ago talking to Luke Rudalski. He's saying now,
[02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:06.980]  release the photos of the dead kids, but not the dead kids killed by drones, cuz Obama's
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:09.980]  a peacenik, so those drones are good.
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:14.980]  And he says, don't have a gun, get a dog. This is a guy who has up to five, six bodyguards
[02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:18.980]  that I've seen with him, who've been arrested carrying guns in illegal areas, and he owns
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:24.980]  guns. He has guns to protect his 50 million bucks and his family, but you don't get to
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:29.980]  have a gun. Bloomberg has bodyguards and guns, but you can't. I mean, they're just disgusting
[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.980]  mobsters, they're not liberals.
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:35.980]  So we'll play a few minutes of this, this is in police stations. We'll talk about the
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:42.980]  cities, where this happened, they have it all listed with Daniel Francisco, executive
[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:46.980]  director of Project Veritas. But first, let's go ahead and go to some of this audio and
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:49.980]  video.
[02:36:49.980 --> 02:36:57.980]  If somebody breaks into my home in this town of Bronxville, okay, will the police department
[02:36:57.980 --> 02:37:00.980]  be there to protect me from that?
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:02.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:06.980]  But what happens between the time I call 911 and you get there?
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:09.980]  Takes a couple minutes to get there.
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.980]  Okay, in the two minutes, though?
[02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:12.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:13.980]  What do I do?
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.980]  In the two minutes, what do you do?
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:22.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:23.980]  That's a good question.
[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:27.980]  Okay, but basically, it's just in that two minutes, I'm on my own.
[02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:31.980]  Yeah. Look on the internet, how do you get a gun from it?
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:33.980]  Okay, how long does it take to get?
[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:34.980]  In New York?
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:34.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:35.980]  About a year.
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:36.980]  A year?
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:37.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:37.980 --> 02:37:41.980]  So in that year, between the time I move here and the time I get one-
[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:42.980]  And they'll never give it to you.
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:44.980]  That two minutes, I'm still on my own.
[02:37:44.980 --> 02:37:45.980]  Yeah.
[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:51.980]  Pretty much between the time I make the call or the time the burglar alarm goes in until
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:55.980]  the time the police show up, we're on our own?
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:56.980]  Mm-hmm.
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:37:57.980]  Okay.
[02:37:57.980 --> 02:37:58.980]  And that's any citizen.
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:04.980]  Between the time 911 is called and the time the police department shows up, we're pretty
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:06.980]  much on our own.
[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:07.980]  Yes.
[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:08.980]  Okay.
[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:09.980]  Unless you have a dog.
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:16.980]  It's 2013, it's United States of America, you lock your doors and you hope nothing happens.
[02:38:16.980 --> 02:38:18.980]  You're on your own.
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:20.980]  And that's the truth.
[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:23.980]  That's why we have call boxes.
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:30.980]  That's why we have safe zones.
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:34.980]  That's why we have the whistles.
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:39.980]  Hit pause.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:44.620]  Project Veritas.com, folks, that is a state rep in Colorado, as you know, they're banning
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:48.220]  guns all over the place.
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:54.420]  Senate panel passes two gun control measures, registration, all sorts of garbage.
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:59.460]  That's the US Senate, that's AP on that front.
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:06.220]  All this is going on and they got a state rep up there with a bow tie who's got bodyguards
[02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:12.900]  and everything else and armed guards protecting him saying, stop at a call box, use a payphone,
[02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:13.900]  use a whistle.
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:17.340]  And by the way, in England, they arrest you for defending yourself.
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:21.540]  Now, I'm not gonna play it all of it, it's just amazing.
[02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:23.400]  There's even more of it, it just goes on and on.
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:28.300]  But let's go ahead and go to another clip of Luke Rudowski talking to Michael Moore
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:30.340]  a few weeks ago who said, get a dog.
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:35.700]  Now, remember, I've been there when his bodyguards in New York, I tried to walk up and ask him
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:40.380]  a question politely, rammed their elbows into me and I ran my elbow back into that guy.
[02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:42.940]  And they were packing heat, you could see it bulging under their jackets.
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:46.060]  And it's come out, they do have permits in New York.
[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:48.700]  They're gonna have guns, you don't chump.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:50.260]  Let's go to that clip of Michael Moore.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:53.940]  But should we have a gun to defend ourselves since criminals always find a way to have
[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:55.160]  guns like in Mexico?
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:56.740]  That's the argument that's being made.
[02:39:56.740 --> 02:40:02.620]  I think if somebody really believes they need a gun to protect themselves, they should have
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:03.620]  the right to do that.
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:08.300]  But I can show you the statistics that by having a gun in the house, how many more times
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:13.020]  likely someone in the house is likely to be harmed by that gun or use that gun to-
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:14.020]  That's not true.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:15.660]  It's much, much higher.
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:21.120]  And if you are worried about your safety, get a dog.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:22.120]  So it's double speak.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.960]  Yeah, I think you should have that right cuz he's actually got it.
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.100]  But you gotta jump through 1,000 hoops, he knows it's selective, but get a dog.
[02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:34.700]  Well, you got guns, bud, those weren't dogs in New York that tried to rough me up.
[02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:36.740]  That's in my film Martial Law.
[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:41.100]  Joining us is Daniel Francisco, executive director of Project Veritas.
[02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:44.140]  Remember, they're the folks that dressed up like pimps that went in and said, we're gonna
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:46.020]  run little kids in here for sex slavery.
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:47.940]  We wanna work with the government.
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:48.940]  Well, that's great.
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:49.940]  Yeah, we wanna help you out with that.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:50.940]  Remember all that?
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:58.900]  And he'd go to office after office after office with James O'Keefe and others, and they would
[02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:01.780]  say the same thing.
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:03.020]  Because that's what this is.
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:05.980]  The Democratic Party is a bunch of street mafia.
[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:10.180]  Now, the Republicans are big global mega mafia, and so are the top Democrats.
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:14.380]  But I mean, we're in trouble, ladies and gentlemen, we're in trouble.
[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:15.700]  And they're gonna totally steal everything.
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:18.420]  The globalists are gonna collapse this society.
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:21.980]  If we don't turn this around, joining us is Daniel Francisco.
[02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:26.620]  Tell us about this latest initiative and give us a heads up of what you've already got in
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:27.620]  the can but isn't out yet.
[02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:31.780]  I know you can't talk about stuff you haven't done yet to give the enemy a heads up, but
[02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:35.840]  tell us about this project dealing with the Second Amendment and the incredible hypocrisy
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:36.840]  discovered.
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:39.100]  And where are some of these towns and cities that you're going to?
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:43.540]  I know it says on the screen, but for radio listeners, TV viewers on prisonplanet.tv and
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:44.700]  the Nightly News can see it.
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:48.460]  But for people out there, people out there listening on the radio who can't get to your
[02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:53.540]  website yet, they will, I'm sure when they get home today, or will link to it on m4wars.com,
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:59.820]  break down these police saying get a dog when they're sitting there packing heat to protect
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:00.820]  themselves.
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:03.820]  Absolutely, and thanks for having me on.
[02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:08.620]  So we focused on three states in this investigation, New Jersey, New York, which is actually our
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:09.620]  home turf.
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:13.460]  We live in New Jersey and work out of New York State, but also North Carolina, and they're
[02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:15.940]  all kind of local to the New York City metropolitan area.
[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:20.020]  Some of the places we went to were actually physically in New York City, which have their
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:24.660]  own sets of draconian gun laws on another level, completely different from those of
[02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:26.820]  the state of New York.
[02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:30.980]  The main focus of this video that I want to transcend is this is not an attack on law
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:31.980]  enforcement.
[02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:34.060]  This is not an attack on police officers.
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:39.900]  And sadly, when we're having this debate after the tragedy of Newtown, there's a lot of disinformation
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:42.980]  out there, specifically in the Northeast, where when you talk to people up here, it's
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:46.260]  not like talking to a Texan or someone from Arizona.
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:50.380]  They literally, and when I say they, I don't just mean the populace, you're politicians,
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:53.300]  you can go up to your state representatives and ask them about a firearm and they'll tell
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:56.420]  you, I've never held one in my life, but I don't want them around here.
[02:42:56.420 --> 02:43:01.540]  They literally will tell you this to their face without even as much as a smirk.
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:05.060]  They literally believe that guns have no place in society up here.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:08.700]  So the important thing about this video is it's not an attack on police, it's something
[02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:11.220]  to demonstrate a simple reality of life.
[02:43:11.220 --> 02:43:14.980]  The police may protect you, the Supreme Court even says they don't have to protect you,
[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:19.980]  but they may protect you, but it's a physical reality that they cannot be everywhere at
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:20.980]  all.
[02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:21.980]  You have a right to protect yourself.
[02:43:21.980 --> 02:43:26.220]  Well, you've got a few of them that are really goonie in there, though, and we need to point
[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:31.500]  out bad cops in the system trying to bring them in, but it's funny you say that.
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:35.700]  My parents have had friends from college and stuff that they knew who were from New York
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:41.580]  and stuff at their house before, and they've walked through a hallway and seen a shotgun
[02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:46.140]  case and literally sort of hyperventilating saying I can't be in this house.
[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:51.220]  I have seen that, but when they see a cop with a gun, they feel good.
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:55.420]  And so I think part of this is culture clash, is culture shock.
[02:43:55.420 --> 02:44:00.940]  You're right, they think guns are like dragons or demons or the thing from the movie Alien
[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:02.580]  with Sigourney Weaver.
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:07.420]  They believe that they are like 100-foot blood-drinking cobras and are scared to death of them in
[02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:08.420]  the hands of citizens.
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:12.060]  And here's the irony, and this is the most laughable part.
[02:44:12.060 --> 02:44:16.620]  While you're right, the culture is not here, the same people that would hyperventilate
[02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:20.620]  at the sight of a piece of iron or wood, they walk every day through the streets of New
[02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:24.460]  York City brushing shoulders of people illegally carrying guns every day.
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:29.820]  If you think that New Jersey, I'm sorry, that New York City and Chicago and Washington,
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:33.700]  D.C. have the highest gun murder rates and you think that's an accident, I mean, I don't
[02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:34.700]  know where your mind is.
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:35.820]  There's a reason why it's so.
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:40.860]  So it's not that they don't want to realize that the guns are there, but they are.
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:41.860]  It's a reality.
[02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:45.700]  The question is, do you want it to be by law-abiding citizens who have good intentions or do you
[02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:50.140]  want to legislate it to a point where even the law-abiding citizens here just give up?
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:51.140]  What is the answer?
[02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:53.300]  I mean, what's winning is converting people.
[02:44:53.300 --> 02:44:57.980]  If you can take someone out and get them to shoot, they are now Second Amendment forever.
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:44:58.980]  Everyone knows that.
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:02.740]  The system is panicking because gun ownership is growing despite the fake polls, record
[02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:03.740]  sales.
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:06.020]  Liberals, I all know, have been buying guns for 10 years.
[02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:09.140]  Why do you think they're counter-striking against the Second Amendment so hard right
[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:10.140]  now?
[02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:15.580]  I've stopped, honestly, I've stopped trying to rationalize it because I attend a lot of,
[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:19.300]  I live in New Jersey, and I attend a lot of these public forums.
[02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:23.140]  There's currently 24 gun control bills that just passed out of our legislature in one
[02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:24.140]  hearing.
[02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:27.960]  And it's a shocking thing because when Chris Christie tries to work with these same legislators
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:34.100]  on a tax cut or on curbing some union benefits or whatever it may be for their state initiatives,
[02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:38.100]  they will block everything, they will clog up the arteries of that legislature so that
[02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.100]  nothing happens.
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:45.180]  But in one day, this is what they told the New Jersey voters, they pushed through 24
[02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:48.740]  gun control bills, some of which are shocking if I were to tell you some of the details.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.220]  It gives someone in Texas a heart attack.
[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:54.340]  They pushed through 24 bills and then said, we're going to pass these bills and after
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:58.180]  we vote on them, we're going to give you the opportunity to testify on them.
[02:45:58.180 --> 02:46:00.540]  So that's the kind of mentality we have up here.
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:03.840]  We're going to pass the rules, and then you guys can have a discussion about it even though
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:06.740]  it's not going to affect anything in any way.
[02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:10.500]  It's absolutely a culture war, it's a culture issue, specifically to the people that live
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:11.500]  up here.
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:12.500]  Well, you're right.
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:18.940]  I mean, you guys have been doing some amazing things and obviously all the videos up on
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:22.220]  your site, but when you're talking to these police and they're like, well, in today's
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:24.980]  day and age, just hide in your house or get a dog.
[02:46:24.980 --> 02:46:28.940]  I mean, did you guys say to them, well, why do you have a gun to protect yourself or do
[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:30.220]  you have a gun at home?
[02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:32.260]  Oh, but they're the government, so it's okay.
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:33.660]  I mean, did you ask those questions?
[02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:37.340]  Well, here's the funny thing, because there's some things we didn't show in the video and
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:42.100]  that's because of just for time purposes and content.
[02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:44.340]  These officers, and again, this is no fault of their own.
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:46.580]  This is just the reality that's put in front of them.
[02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:51.580]  What we didn't show is that we've asked them multiple times, what do we do when X happens?
[02:46:51.580 --> 02:46:53.700]  And they go, oh, you should call 911.
[02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:57.220]  And then we said, okay, but what about if someone's breaking down my door and you know,
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:58.220]  they're trying to rob me?
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:46:59.220]  Oh, just call 911.
[02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:04.060]  Well, I get that, you know, we're going to call 911, but in the time between, you know,
[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:06.060]  you get that, well, you got to call the police.
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:09.940]  It took in some of these instances, speaking to these police officers five times to repeat
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:13.540]  the same question before they understood even the concept that we were saying, look, we've
[02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:15.100]  established that you're on your way.
[02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:17.340]  How do I defend myself?
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:22.300]  And that's when you get these inexplicable explanations, like throw some ammonia at him,
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:23.620]  throw some bleach at him, get a-
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.620]  Well, listen, let me just say something here.
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:29.740]  People, you know, you see these houses that say we don't dial 911, you see these signs
[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:32.820]  outside houses and they don't get robbed.
[02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:37.000]  If somebody's breaking in my house or somebody came to my office trying to mass shooting,
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.040]  I'm not going to waste time calling 911 until I've killed them.
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.000]  I'm going to get the gun, I'm going to go like a robot, and I'm going to instinctively
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.900]  shoot another center of mass from as best a cover as I can get.
[02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:50.940]  And it's just automatic.
[02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:56.540]  So you know, my issue is almost calling 911 is a cop out.
[02:47:56.540 --> 02:48:01.000]  I mean, if I see people mugging a woman out front my house or out front my office, I'm
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.420]  going out there with a firearm.
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:07.900]  I mean, I think that's the problem with 911 is that sure, you can call that for the police.
[02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:10.820]  You know, if somebody's cows are out in the road and you can't get ahold of them, but
[02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:11.820]  you don't.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:16.340]  I mean, you know, I saved a woman who was choking once at a La Madeline restaurant.
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:20.500]  I came out of the bathroom, my wife and six month old son, and then she goes, that lady's
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:21.500]  been choking about 30 seconds.
[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:22.500]  You want to do something?
[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:26.380]  And I'd been trained in the, you know, how much maneuver basic swim team class we took
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:27.380]  with the fire department.
[02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:30.860]  And I went over and say the lady, but at first they were trying to stop me.
[02:48:30.860 --> 02:48:31.860]  She's turning blue.
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:37.100]  She's, you know, about to pass out and she coughs out all this big piece of bread.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:39.460]  And they were going dial 911, dial 911.
[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:43.500]  It sounded like parrots in a tree just saying dial 911.
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:44.500]  And then are you an expert?
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:45.500]  Wait, don't, don't.
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:49.720]  I mean, they didn't want me to save her because they couldn't imagine a fellow slave.
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:54.980]  They have such low opinions of themselves that I, a fellow slave at 13, took a one day
[02:48:54.980 --> 02:48:58.980]  course at the Rockwall fire department on how to do a Heimlich maneuver on adults and
[02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:05.380]  children and basic first aid and resuscitation.
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:09.180]  And then I was a hero after I saved her and then I got out of there because I figured
[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:11.900]  they'd probably sue me or something if I broke one of her ribs.
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:12.900]  Go ahead.
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:16.100]  This is, this is the mentality of the Northeast.
[02:49:16.100 --> 02:49:20.420]  I can tell you one story that I was on another show once and the host had explained to me
[02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:24.460]  in North Jersey, uh, someone was sleeping and it was, you know, middle of the night
[02:49:24.460 --> 02:49:28.380]  and an intruder had broken through her window, had some sort of a billy club or some sort
[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:35.300]  of a crowbar, uh, got into the house and her dog woke up and bought and a bit this guy,
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:39.980]  the guy ended up suing the homeowner and one in the state of New Jersey for whatever injury
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:40.980]  he saw.
[02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:41.980]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:42.980]  This dog.
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:43.980]  Yeah.
[02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:47.500]  You know, I mean they've had robbers fall through skylights and sue people.
[02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:48.500]  Absolutely.
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:51.460]  In New Jersey, again, I keep mentioning New Jersey cause that's where I'm from and that's
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:52.940]  where I'm most familiar with the laws.
[02:49:52.940 --> 02:49:58.620]  The laws appear, favor criminals, they make our jails a revolving door and they hurt law
[02:49:58.620 --> 02:49:59.620]  abiders.
[02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:00.980]  And this video is a perfect example.
[02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:04.580]  We go up and we contradict what our very own vice president is telling us.
[02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:07.780]  We go up and said, you know, Joe Biden is saying, if there's a problem, all you need
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:11.540]  to do is tell your wife to take a double barrel shotgun and fire two blasts out the door.
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:15.140]  Well one, now you're out of ammo because you just emptied yourself, which is tactically
[02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:16.140]  stupid.
[02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:17.140]  But two, it's illegal.
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:18.940]  And we said, let's go to NYPD.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:22.140]  Let's get their words out of their mouths when they don't know they're being recorded.
[02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:23.140]  What are they going to tell us?
[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:28.020]  And the truth is in the video, these people will tell us explicitly, if you do that, we
[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:29.020]  will arrest you.
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:30.020]  That's right.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:33.220]  Firing off target is, is reckless.
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.820]  It's only legal to kill the person.
[02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:35.820]  Exactly.
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:36.820]  Exactly.
[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:37.820]  Oh yeah.
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.700]  If I shoot at somebody, it's not going to be warning shots.
[02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:44.860]  I mean, you know, if somebody's robbed my car, I'm going to say, get down on the ground.
[02:50:44.860 --> 02:50:46.180]  And then I probably will let them run off.
[02:50:46.180 --> 02:50:47.700]  So I don't want the trouble of a dead body.
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:48.700]  Well, who knows?
[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:51.780]  I mean, if the person turns at me or acts aggressive, you're dead.
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:53.060]  I mean, it's done.
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:54.900]  I'll kill you in 10 seconds.
[02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:55.900]  Okay.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:57.900]  We're going to come right back and talk more about this.
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:58.900]  It's very important.
[02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:02.260]  The gelding of America.
[02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:06.020]  If you're listening, you know, your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:09.340]  If you're listening, you know, the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:12.100]  You know, gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:03.780]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.120]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:12.060]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will
[02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:13.060]  shock you.
[02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:19.260]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:21.740]  valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:25.420]  Ninety-seven percent of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:30.100]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought and the sad truth is that you may not survive
[02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:34.620]  without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:38.540]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for
[02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:40.140]  you and your family.
[02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:46.300]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:47.660]  You'll be shocked.
[02:52:47.660 --> 02:52:51.260]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.860]  in the last three months.
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:58.460]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:58.460 --> 02:53:01.060]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:03.420]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:07.060]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them.
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:11.200]  If they are to be used to create new proteins in your body, just like a bricklayer cannot
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:15.660]  use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or
[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:18.580]  twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:23.240]  Using your body in undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:27.340]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:32.500]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated
[02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:35.500]  and most proteins you consume are heated.
[02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:39.380]  With our True Cool process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:40.380]  My name is Daniel.
[02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:41.380]  I'm 34 years old.
[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:45.340]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:48.820]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:50.460]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:54.420]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase
[02:53:54.420 --> 02:53:55.420]  in my potency.
[02:53:55.420 --> 02:53:59.900]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:06.060]  Well, that's James O'Keeffe on.
[02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:11.700]  I'm Alex Jones, your host of the Veritas Project or theprojectveritas.org.
[02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:17.140]  We've got Daniel Francisco, the executive director, on with us.
[02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:22.220]  Wow, what do you make of New Jersey woman arrested for citing Constitution at tax meeting?
[02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:23.900]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:54:23.900 --> 02:54:25.460]  It's at Infowars.com story.
[02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:29.540]  And I went and looked at the arrest warrant, the gun confiscation, and they said she was
[02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:33.400]  very frightening that they'd never been yelled at before.
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:38.940]  So now yelling, that's probably, it was frightening that she said, no, you can't come in my house
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:42.940]  for a home inspection to raise the property taxes, and she raised her voice.
[02:54:42.940 --> 02:54:46.660]  And then they also claim it another thing, she said, don't come in my house, I've got
[02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:47.660]  a gun.
[02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:48.660]  Well, that's it.
[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:51.220]  They've taken her guns, and that's the end of it.
[02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:53.660]  Like I said, Alex, this doesn't shock us anymore.
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.660]  This is part and parcel for the Garden State.
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:59.500]  Like I said, you speak to these legislators, to them, guns are foreign.
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:01.780]  It's something that those rednecks have down south.
[02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:05.540]  They don't understand any practical application for it whatsoever, to them, they're purely
[02:55:05.540 --> 02:55:06.540]  killing machines.
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:08.420]  So this doesn't shock me at all.
[02:55:08.420 --> 02:55:12.620]  I mean, this is one of many stories that happen in New Jersey every day.
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:16.180]  So they're victims to all the highest crime in the country, cuz they've taken the guns,
[02:55:16.180 --> 02:55:18.600]  Chicago, New York, New Jersey areas.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:22.580]  And they just can't get why they're living under siege, because they've chopped their
[02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:23.580]  testicles off.
[02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:28.020]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what we're talking about.
[02:55:28.020 --> 02:55:30.540]  That's a colorful way to put it, it's absolutely correct.
[02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:33.140]  Could it become a new Garden State law?
[02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:39.380]  Like the pumpkin head state that perhaps, because men are bad, that everyone be castrated
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:41.340]  at age five in New Jersey?
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:43.140]  Perhaps a bill should be introduced in New Jersey.
[02:55:43.140 --> 02:55:48.460]  I'll give you a case, I don't wanna bore you guys with the laws, but it bears repeating
[02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:52.700]  because a lot of people don't see that this is where the gun battle is already gone when
[02:55:52.700 --> 02:55:55.940]  down south people are talking about much more simpler terms.
[02:55:55.940 --> 02:55:59.620]  There was a bill whose language stated that in New Jersey they wanted to push through
[02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:00.620]  this measure.
[02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:04.860]  I know it was changed since the last time it was in assembly, but it stated that the
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:08.220]  police, when you applied for a gun permit, and in New Jersey, let me clarify, you have
[02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:11.300]  to apply for a permit first to be able to even buy guns.
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:14.940]  Then every subsequent handgun you wanna buy, you need to go through a separate background
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:17.980]  check and reapply for that every single time you purchase.
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:20.900]  And every single time you do that, it can take up to a year, depending on whatever the
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:21.900]  period is.
[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:26.140]  What about a background check to even have manhood, I mean?
[02:56:26.140 --> 02:56:27.140]  Exactly.
[02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:31.260]  You can literally wait over a year in the state of New Jersey just to get your first
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:32.260]  gun.
[02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:33.260]  Well, you don't even get them most of the time.
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:34.260]  I see them refuse them.
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:38.180]  I mean, I know people who've been refused stuff for misdemeanors.
[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:45.340]  Well, at least then you could sort of make the statist argument that doubts because that
[02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:46.740]  person is some form of a criminal.
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.060]  We don't need to go that far, Alex.
[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.900]  You can have a perfectly clean record, and if the chief doesn't like your face, he just
[02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:52.900]  doesn't sign off on it.
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:56.380]  Oh, no, no, no, no, listen, it's worse than makes them arbitrary guns.
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:56:59.980]  Did you see the guy in Florida who released some heart balloons, and he's been charged
[02:56:59.980 --> 02:57:03.540]  and arrested with a felony, and they're saying for hurting the earth?
[02:57:03.540 --> 02:57:08.300]  I didn't hear about that, but here's one instance in New Jersey that is infuriating.
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:13.140]  They will say, one of these bills stated, the police officer, when you make application
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:17.940]  for the permit, has to come in your home, they have to inspect the entire house top
[02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:21.940]  to bottom to make sure that your home is fit for a firearm, and then they have to interview
[02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:24.100]  everyone in your family to make sure you have the medical capacity to-
[02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:29.940]  Yeah, by the way, that bill just got shot down because it was, quote, too extreme in
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:32.780]  Washington state, and people thought it was a joke.
[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:34.380]  That's already happening in other states.
[02:57:34.380 --> 02:57:36.900]  It's not a joke, but that's the important thing.
[02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:37.900]  This isn't a dream.
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:41.060]  This isn't, we're not conjuring up some sort of strange story.
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:43.100]  This is the reality of what we deal with in New Jersey.
[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:46.540]  Yeah, what do you make of them saying there are no two billion bullets, there are no armored
[02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:50.340]  vehicles, and we don't want your guns when they're on record saying they want a total
[02:57:50.340 --> 02:57:52.860]  ban of civilian firearm ownership?
[02:57:52.860 --> 02:57:58.540]  Of course, and like we said before, these same politicians making those calls, they
[02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:00.140]  don't know anything about the guns.
[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:04.340]  We have a state senator here named Loretta Weinberg, this was her attitude, she told
[02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:07.100]  me, I don't know anything about guns, but I don't want them in front of me, and when
[02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:11.980]  we debated her on this in a forum, she actually said, you shouldn't be, this was a bill for
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:16.260]  obligating a certain level of training for a certain type of firearm, this was her mentality,
[02:58:16.260 --> 02:58:17.260]  her statist mentality.
[02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:22.740]  You should be thanking me that I'm purporting this law because I will create a cottage industry
[02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:23.740]  for your business.
[02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:24.740]  You see their mentality?
[02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:30.820]  It's that the state is there to create these, sort of this magic wand over the free market
[02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:31.820]  to create businesses.
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:36.660]  Tell you what, stay there, we're going into overdrive, the LA Times announces white men
[02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:39.260]  are terrorists, literally, Infowars.com.

[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:26.460]  Better watch what you talk about, bud.
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:28.900]  Being pro-biller rights is an act of terror.
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:35.940]  When you saw the SLPC and the LA Times and AP, they say if you talk about the two billion
[03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:38.500]  bullets, you're part of a white supremacist cell.
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:41.980]  In fact, just being white's an act of terror.
[03:00:41.980 --> 03:00:47.660]  That's right, LA Times announces white men are the terrorists, and I say good.
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:52.860]  And since I'm McGruff, the crime dog, I happen to be white, I got a white spot.
[03:00:52.860 --> 03:00:53.860]  You know what?
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:01:00.020]  I'm reporting to a local forced labor FEMA camp to show everybody that I can be trusted.
[03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:04.660]  Help take a bite out of the Second Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights.
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:08.180]  John Wayne and George Washington are trash.
[03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:10.260]  Sovietism is good.
[03:01:10.260 --> 03:01:13.580]  That's right, Mao Tse Tung's who I like.
[03:01:13.580 --> 03:01:16.180]  Help take a bite out of liberty.
[03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:19.140]  This message brought to you by DHS and Mr. Napolitano.
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:23.260]  All right, folks, we had that little Homeland Security announcement, all part of the Fairness
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:24.460]  Doctrine.
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:27.620]  Going back in the four minutes of this little overdrive segment, we were gonna have James
[03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:31.060]  O'Keefe on, but hey, I'm glad we got his associate on, he's even more wound up.
[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:35.340]  Daniel Francisco, executive director of Project Veritas, they're the guys that brought down
[03:01:35.340 --> 03:01:37.060]  Acorn and everything else.
[03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:43.460]  When you talk about effective, these guys are really something, well, sexy when it comes
[03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:44.460]  to liberty.
[03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:45.460]  I mean, they are awesome.
[03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:47.740]  Like a 50 cal is a sexy thing.
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:51.580]  I like good things and we salute you, Daniel.
[03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:55.300]  In closing, in the four minutes, three minutes we've got left, other points you'd like to
[03:01:55.300 --> 03:01:56.840]  add about what's coming up?
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:02:01.060]  You've got some big things in the hopper, you can't tell us too much to alert the enemy,
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:02.060]  but tell us.
[03:02:02.060 --> 03:02:04.860]  No, but we can tease, we could always tease a little bit.
[03:02:04.860 --> 03:02:09.900]  I can tell you for sure that the issue of Second Amendment rights, that is gonna continue
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:11.220]  to be a focus in our work.
[03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:15.060]  So you can rest assured there's gonna be some more videos along the same vein, but with
[03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:16.060]  different targets.
[03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:21.020]  We're gonna go to a more, let's say, popular culture angle of the gun control debate.
[03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:23.860]  Another two of the biggest ones that we're gonna also continue going into the summer
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:27.900]  is gonna be the healthcare bill and doubly so entitlements.
[03:02:27.900 --> 03:02:30.820]  We're getting a lot of tips that we get from our supporters.
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:34.940]  A lot of people, even in government, start to tip off Project Veritas, which I think
[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:37.060]  is a good testament to our legitimacy.
[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:41.060]  But people are starting to tell us, hey, in my state, there's this organization that's
[03:02:41.060 --> 03:02:45.540]  wasting money doing this, there's this organization doing that, and we're starting to take that
[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:50.920]  together and go after the entitlement culture in this country and go after the new healthcare
[03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:54.220]  bill and some of the things that are gonna be going along when that legislation comes
[03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:55.220]  forth.
[03:02:55.220 --> 03:02:58.540]  So, Second Amendment entitlements, healthcare, be on the lookout for that.
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:03.040]  You can go to our website and see our past videos at projectveritas.com.
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:08.000]  And as always, we're a completely non-profit organization, so any donations that your listeners
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.780]  are willing to give up to us, we'll give you a fantastic product.
[03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:14.400]  We'll show you things that the mainstream media will never, never touch.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:16.140]  You are definitely the Black Arrow.
[03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:23.980]  Remember, that's the arrow they fire into Smog's soft patch in The End of the Hobbit?
[03:03:23.980 --> 03:03:25.500]  I'm not a big Jared Tolcott fan.
[03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:30.220]  I've never seen the movies, but that's from the Lord of the Rings series, right?
[03:03:30.220 --> 03:03:32.740]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a fan of it just cuz it's art types.
[03:03:32.740 --> 03:03:35.060]  It's a little cheesy, obviously, but as a book, it's good.
[03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:37.780]  But no, I mean, the Black Arrow, it's very effective.
[03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:43.220]  Like I said, the reason we exist is because there's a demand for what we do.
[03:03:43.220 --> 03:03:45.100]  There's a vacuum in the market of media.
[03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:48.500]  If people don't wanna go up and ask direct questions to the representatives, to their
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:54.980]  law enforcement, to these non-profits in DC, to legislators and lobbyists, that vacuum
[03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:55.980]  is gonna be met.
[03:03:55.980 --> 03:03:56.980]  And right now, that's met with us.
[03:03:56.980 --> 03:04:01.380]  So as long as people believe in our mission, we'll be there on the front lines.
[03:04:01.380 --> 03:04:02.380]  Well said.
[03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:03.380]  Well said.
[03:04:03.380 --> 03:04:04.380]  We got about 30 seconds left.
[03:04:04.380 --> 03:04:06.020]  Anything else you think that should be added here?
[03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:08.900]  Do you think we're winning the fight with the Second Amendment or losing it, or is it
[03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:11.260]  50-50 right now in the middle of the battle?
[03:04:11.260 --> 03:04:16.460]  Like I said, I think this is a cultural and geographical war, so I think it depends on
[03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:17.460]  where you are.
[03:04:17.460 --> 03:04:20.540]  You have states signing legislation saying they're not gonna recognize any new federal
[03:04:20.540 --> 03:04:21.540]  laws, which is a good thing.
[03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:24.960]  But then you have states like New Jersey saying that they have to, you dig at a prescription
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.740]  from a doctor before you get a gun.
[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:31.580]  So I think it's both ends of the, we're getting both sides of the argument here, it just depends
[03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:32.580]  on where you are.
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:35.100]  Hey, I love most of the people I meet from up north, but when I meet a lot of them, they
[03:04:35.100 --> 03:04:39.060]  think we ride horses to work and we don't have buildings in Texas.
[03:04:39.060 --> 03:04:40.060]  We got NASA.
[03:04:40.060 --> 03:04:43.220]  I mean, I just don't, we've gotta inform people in the Northeast.
[03:04:43.220 --> 03:04:48.180]  We've got, I mean, a lot of people from there, they'll come from Karenese, so they think
[03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:52.220]  it's normal to move from North Korea to North Jersey.
[03:04:52.220 --> 03:04:56.380]  God bless you, sir, Daniel Francisco, we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[03:04:56.380 --> 03:04:57.540]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:27.300]  All right, false flag news coming up in retransmo right now.
