[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:34.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones no it's not your
[00:34.160 --> 00:46.160]  imagination it's not a trick of the eyes or of the ears things are accelerating the news is
[00:46.160 --> 00:56.040]  intensifying tyranny is rearing its head in bizarre almost black satirical ways that are
[00:56.040 --> 01:05.040]  so ridiculous you have to pinch yourself when you witness the ruling criminal elite the elite
[01:05.040 --> 01:14.720]  parasite deceivers openly engaging in the types of crimes that they are expanding against the
[01:14.720 --> 01:22.040]  people of the United States and the world they're counting on ignorance of the general public to
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.240]  be able to get away with this they believe in their actuaries in their psychological warfare
[01:27.240 --> 01:34.960]  breakdowns in their assessment of humanity that they're going to get away with it at least they
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.200]  did in the past now they're becoming more and more frightened and they're fully committed
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.800]  they're going to prison if they don't complete their drive down the field to bring us into a
[01:45.800 --> 01:55.040]  worldwide technotronic high-tech police state enslavement grid which is only the means to the
[01:55.040 --> 02:02.200]  end of world population reduction the criminals see the world as a Valhalla that they have
[02:02.200 --> 02:07.960]  rightfully stolen through cunning and fraud that they believe is an attribute and now they want
[02:07.960 --> 02:17.160]  the general public sterilized and then basically phased out for the globalist parasites enjoyment
[02:17.160 --> 02:24.240]  now we come back from break I am going to attempt in the first 30 minutes ahead of a
[02:24.240 --> 02:32.920]  surprise guest joining us to go over just the surface of the incredible news I'm about to get
[02:32.920 --> 02:39.600]  into and then later throughout the next two hours after that guest leaves us breaking it all down
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.080]  now what happens almost every time I say I'm going to do this is I say I'm going to just
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.640]  redo the headlines and then I start reading a headline or two and then boom I get to a story
[02:48.640 --> 02:56.200]  and then start a breakdown rant on that subject but we'll see if I succeed I probably won't
[02:56.200 --> 03:02.960]  let's see in the next minute and a half before we go to break if I can do it Saudis slash oil
[03:02.960 --> 03:11.400]  output say market oversupplied it's hard to not comment on that but I will later hold on it's hard
[03:11.400 --> 03:22.200]  oversupplied are you watching what's happened to oil prices you know what this means okay I'm not
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.680]  going to comment on that to later cables reveal State Department CIA NGOs fermented Syrian unrest

[08:10.440 --> 08:16.960]  well the dollar is sliding the euro is sliding every major currency is being devalued by
[08:16.960 --> 08:23.960]  the private central banking cartels ahead of their new solution an open corporate private
[08:23.960 --> 08:30.960]  world government that you pay your vat taxes to your sales taxes your carbon taxes to all
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.240]  of that announced again by one of the top generals of the new world order george soros admitted
[08:36.240 --> 08:41.640]  Rothschild agent we're gonna be going over all of that today here's the london telegraph
[08:41.640 --> 08:48.680]  headline we view silver as gold on steroids silver is better bet than gold in the current
[08:48.680 --> 08:56.600]  precious metals bull run and has been described as gold on steroids by many of the top analyst
[08:56.600 --> 09:02.080]  we're going to be going over that report a little bit later in the broadcast gold ran
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.400]  up to its all time record one dollar under fifteen hundred and then it dropped a couple
[09:08.400 --> 09:13.480]  bucks on profit taking and the establishment media ran out and said it's over for gold
[09:13.480 --> 09:19.000]  it's over dump it dump it now it's it's over and then it'll drop a few more dollars than
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.680]  a week or two or maybe even in a few days it'll run up past fifteen and then it'll drop
[09:23.680 --> 09:30.200]  below fifteen then it'll run up to fifteen sixteen and then it'll go back down a few
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.120]  dollars if you watch the eleven year graph it's going straight up but they're counting
[09:35.120 --> 09:43.640]  on the public only operating out of short term short term thought processes that's that's
[09:43.640 --> 09:48.880]  basically what happens when you deal with a population brainwashed and brought up and
[09:48.880 --> 09:58.200]  conditioned on limited attention spans but gold ran right up to just shy of fifteen hundred
[09:58.200 --> 10:08.560]  dollars an ounce today before dropping down a couple more dollars and right now it said
[10:08.560 --> 10:14.720]  what is it right now we pull up the exact numbers because it was just it was just refreshing
[10:14.720 --> 10:24.200]  on me there gold is now fourteen hundred and ninety three dollars so it's dropped about
[10:24.200 --> 10:30.880]  five and a half dollars since it's a high earlier today silver is also continuing to
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.680]  go up we're gonna be breaking that down okay let me just do it this way we got a surprise
[10:36.680 --> 10:49.520]  guest scheduled here in about twenty two minutes from now every day and no you're not imagining
[10:49.520 --> 10:57.080]  you're not paranoid the news is getting crazier things are getting wilder all sorts of destabilizing
[10:57.080 --> 11:05.520]  events are occurring the world is entering a political period of flux as the evil mastermind
[11:05.520 --> 11:12.840]  v.i. lennon once said there are times in history when more happens in a year that happened
[11:12.840 --> 11:20.280]  in the previous hundred and the globalist are on freezing the political system from
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.200]  the status quo so that they can reorder it that's just like a blacksmith will take iron
[11:27.200 --> 11:32.200]  or steel and heat it up wide hot and beat it into the shape the new shape that they're
[11:32.200 --> 11:41.320]  wanting to achieve the exact same thing is now happening here in our nation but it's
[11:41.320 --> 11:51.120]  also happening across the world and so this new system is being formed and it's a progression
[11:51.120 --> 12:06.800]  of the old system but it's a step deeper into the control of this criminal class so the
[12:06.800 --> 12:21.360]  news that we're seeing is earth shaking the Saudi slash oil output say market is oversupplied
[12:21.360 --> 12:28.880]  if the general public had any understanding of economic reality and how opac works and
[12:28.880 --> 12:36.880]  what's happening with oil prices going up they would know that that statement is almost
[12:36.880 --> 12:46.720]  entirely fraudulent there's one vein of truth to it but what this signifies is that generally
[12:46.720 --> 12:55.000]  the Saudis when there is global destabilization and when the dollar is in trouble the Saudis
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.400]  will increase output and will lower the prices that they're selling oil at they have limited
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.200]  control over the price because that tends to be set by what the overall output is but
[13:10.200 --> 13:19.640]  the magnitude of that statement this is only going to send oil prices up up up up up up
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.280]  up but more than that it signifies that the last month we've seen the Saudi royal family
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.600]  run to the Russians we've seen the Saudi royal family run to the Chinese we've seen the Saudi
[13:29.600 --> 13:35.760]  royal family meet with secretary defense gates and openly talk about western plots with inside
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.720]  their country the Saudis now have all the WikiLeaks documents and the state department statements
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.800]  that they are destabilizing the Middle East and North Africa by design that is the globalist
[13:46.800 --> 13:52.480]  that already have taken over our country many decades ago and the Saudis know that they're
[13:52.480 --> 14:01.080]  being double crossed and they are changing their 30 plus year agreement to basically
[14:01.080 --> 14:11.360]  supply inexpensive oil to the west and in turn the the Saudis would then invest much
[14:11.360 --> 14:17.560]  of their profits in UST bills to prop the dollar up as the world reserve currency and
[14:17.560 --> 14:25.840]  the west would then not allow massive oil field and gas development in North America
[14:25.840 --> 14:36.240]  particularly in Alaska that would challenge the Saudi combine or oligopoly it's it's
[14:36.240 --> 14:43.680]  it's not really a monopoly it's a cartel working together so it's an oligopoly so major global
[14:43.680 --> 14:50.800]  political realignments are now taking place massive realignments are taking place the
[14:50.800 --> 14:59.400]  Saudis buying announcing are going to slash output are playing total guts ball with the
[14:59.400 --> 15:06.200]  Anglo-American establishment out of desperation I don't like the Saudi royal family very corrupt
[15:06.200 --> 15:10.880]  very wicked the point is they made a deal with the globalist in the early 70s they made
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.120]  a deal with the British when they were put into power more than a hundred years ago it's
[15:15.120 --> 15:19.280]  all historical mainline history they were just better one tribes at the British intelligence
[15:19.280 --> 15:24.840]  gave weapons to and they carved up the country with a region and created three countries
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.720]  out of it and put one tribe a particularly violent better ones into power known as the
[15:30.720 --> 15:36.560]  Saudis the house of Saud hence Saudi Arabia it'd be like a British intelligence funded
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.400]  some warlord here in the US if a civil war would have gone the way the British wanted
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.840]  and be more sophisticated folks that doesn't mean I'm for what Lincoln did the history
[15:46.840 --> 15:52.480]  is British intel came in manipulated reasonable grievances in the south over unfair tariffs
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.200]  that's what it was really all about nothing to do with slaves and got the south to get
[15:57.200 --> 16:01.480]  into a war and then the British didn't supply him and it came out later this is mainline
[16:01.480 --> 16:04.320]  history as well if you want to look it up that the British were intending to then break
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.880]  up the south control western expansion and basically put warlords in control who were
[16:09.880 --> 16:15.440]  British vassals over those new areas in the British were going to get the 70% of the United
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.960]  States that hadn't been colonized yet again over half was there than the south so you're
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.680]  talking over 70% with the south and the west that was the plan what were the British doing
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.000]  all over the world at the time going in and dividing ribs against each other it's a it's
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.360]  a management model how does a little bitty country with a royal family running it dominate
[16:35.360 --> 16:44.080]  50 plus percent of the land on the planet up until even the 1930s subterfuge manipulation
[16:44.080 --> 16:52.240]  scientific study of control I've already digressed the point is the British intelligence minions
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.000]  of the house of sod are now running to the Russians publicly I'm getting chills right
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.560]  now this is so big whoa we're seeing massive realignment right now we're seeing massive
[17:01.560 --> 17:07.480]  world changes the likes of which most of us have never seen if you lived if you were alive
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.600]  during world war two you saw things as bigger bigger but we're going into things they're
[17:11.600 --> 17:17.680]  going to be bigger than world war two financially economically societally culturally geopolitically
[17:17.680 --> 17:24.080]  and perhaps militarily whoa just got chills again whoa just got them again I mean I'm
[17:24.080 --> 17:32.640]  having full-on chills right now see ladies and gentlemen when you when you study geopolitical
[17:32.640 --> 17:42.600]  developments and you see this type of stuff happening it's hardcore it's super hardcore
[17:42.600 --> 17:51.520]  do you have any idea what this means added to all the other information we have this
[17:51.520 --> 17:56.560]  means the Saudis are definitely flailing around and know that the globalist are about to try
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.280]  to overthrow them exactly as our big oil company exec Intel sources have confirmed I mean we
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.760]  told you through our sources six plus months ago all this was going to happen exactly as
[18:07.760 --> 18:15.800]  it's happened Tarpoli in Obama deception out two years ago more than two years ago March
[18:15.800 --> 18:21.480]  of 2009 laid out the destabilization the Middle East how they would do kamikaze states how
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.080]  they would then invade North Africa through Africa I mean because the globalist have laid
[18:26.080 --> 18:32.840]  it all out that's what's so frustrating about this and see I haven't even gotten into the
[18:32.840 --> 18:43.000]  rest of the economic stack I haven't gotten into the S&P announcement standard and pores
[18:43.000 --> 18:52.200]  has cut US ratings outlook to negative and are signaling signaling that they may get
[18:52.200 --> 18:59.200]  rid of the US triple A whoa just got chills again and I'm sorry to be announcing this
[18:59.200 --> 19:05.000]  but I'm you've gone to the edge of a cliff and you're looking over a thousand foot cliff
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.800]  if you get those chills that that's instincts you you got a hardwired computer brain and
[19:13.800 --> 19:17.720]  it'd be kind of like if you were camping in Colorado and we're out there cooking bacon
[19:17.720 --> 19:20.800]  and eggs and you look over in the grizzly bear comes walking out of the woods you're
[19:20.800 --> 19:26.520]  going to get chills chills are endorphins adrenaline your body get that air into your
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.520]  lungs that whoa this is dangerous we'll see I intellectually understand what this means
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.920]  globally and what this means to me individually so when I consciously look at this news I
[19:37.920 --> 19:44.520]  mean it's like a grizzly bear just walked in the room whoa I mean I am in combat mode
[19:44.520 --> 19:50.240]  I'm hiring a kite right now folks on endorphin and I'm just being honest with you for those

[24:40.080 --> 24:45.920]  around the world do not allow to be developed namely the united states government that parts true
[24:46.480 --> 24:50.240]  and the big oil companies that came out in the associated press in 2001
[24:50.240 --> 24:56.400]  did meet in 1995 and 96 to buy up most of the refineries and close them
[24:57.120 --> 25:03.360]  to create an artificial bottleneck corporations are into monopolies that's where the big wealth
[25:03.360 --> 25:10.640]  is made as the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty j Rockefeller said competition is a sin
[25:10.640 --> 25:18.880]  and that's what the new world order is about shutting down the globalist competition
[25:20.640 --> 25:27.040]  owning both sides of the political debate limiting the debate but the reason i am beside
[25:27.040 --> 25:35.120]  myself with just amazing just total amazement is that it's one thing to intellectually know
[25:35.120 --> 25:40.080]  that we're in a world government and it's expanding but to be getting deeper and deeper into it
[25:40.080 --> 25:46.160]  and to have our predictions come true exactly as we broke down and to see the globalist
[25:46.160 --> 25:52.000]  continuing their program and world government and the phase out of the dollar accelerating and what
[25:52.000 --> 26:00.080]  that's going to mean to this country what that's going to mean to the world and these open criminal
[26:00.080 --> 26:08.400]  private central banks in throning themselves even more publicly and posing as the saviors
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.520]  if the public had any basic understanding they would know what an outrageous satirical joke
[26:15.520 --> 26:23.760]  this is this would be like hitler being the judge at nurenberg i mean it's that ridiculous it'd be
[26:23.760 --> 26:35.440]  like john goddy being anti-italian mafia in new york i mean it's it's like a fish not
[26:35.440 --> 26:45.520]  not liking the water it's like a bird not liking the sky it's it's it's so ridiculous well i mean
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.160]  i was thinking about this morning and i've talked about this a lot but george soros gave a 60 minute
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.560]  interview he's given other ones and he says yeah i helped round up and arrest people and sent them
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.240]  to the death camps and it was one of the best times in my life and if i didn't do it somebody else
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.960]  would have done it and help form who i am and all these liberal groups go you're so wonderful
[27:04.960 --> 27:11.840]  you were a nazi collaborator in the local jewish councils that helped round up everybody
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.800]  oh my gosh you're so wonderful and if you talk bad about him you're anti-semitic it's like
[27:18.800 --> 27:25.920]  he is the most slimy worm-like demonic horrid creature who revels remember three years ago
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.800]  is that people are losing their houses everything's falling apart the dollar's going down we're going
[27:30.800 --> 27:37.200]  into deep debt the banks are getting trillions he says i'm having a great crisis it's just the
[27:37.200 --> 27:46.640]  over the topness of them it's so in your face and i talked to these so-called liberal writers that
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.640]  work for soros who for media matters and others that call me up and they just make they make
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.280]  giggling jokes and say george soros is great and i go but what about this they just giggle at you
[27:57.280 --> 28:04.320]  you they mean these are not liberals these are military men cadres trained in deception
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.800]  who know what they're doing same thing with bill o'reilly same thing with sean hannity
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.400]  same thing with glenn beck he's a trained cadre to control the right-wing arm of resistance
[28:15.040 --> 28:21.440]  and they know full well when you're talking to them there's no morals to them that's a joke
[28:21.440 --> 28:28.480]  it's all about being shark like and deceptive and to them it's just hey this is my camouflage i
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.760]  say i'm liberal and so the torture is good the wars are good the secret arrested are good
[28:33.760 --> 28:40.640]  the poison and the water is good and they buy into the delusion just so they get some
[28:41.760 --> 28:48.320]  money from the new world order that's why going back 10 11 12 years ago off and on when i was
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.960]  offered big syndication deals by some of the big syndicators and they said but we're going to make
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.640]  it easy for you'll have all the producers you'll just come in and cover what we want bring that
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.560]  same passion that you have where you just come to the radio with people but and i was told this
[29:02.560 --> 29:07.040]  repeatedly it must be a script they follow do you want to be on this crusade that's going nowhere
[29:07.040 --> 29:13.120]  or do you want to be a star and i said i want to be on the crusade for liberty i mean you can only
[29:13.120 --> 29:19.360]  use so much money possessions are like a curse you can only have so many people say they're a
[29:19.360 --> 29:23.600]  fan and buy you lunch and it's it's great it means you're reaching people but it's it's actually a
[29:23.600 --> 29:32.080]  prison see without ever selling out without ever joining the new world order everywhere i go i can't
[29:32.080 --> 29:38.480]  even now do anything without people coming up and talking to me which is fine and it's a symbol of
[29:38.480 --> 29:48.480]  how much success we've had but still sell my soul for that no thank you i might sell my soul not to

[33:25.440 --> 33:32.240]  into a modern police state the biggest signpost i've seen yet is not chicago school districts
[33:32.240 --> 33:37.920]  saying parents can't pack their children's school lunches because they're not trusted no it's not
[33:37.920 --> 33:43.040]  even the face scanning cameras going up on street corners or even the military now engaged in domestic
[33:43.040 --> 33:49.360]  law enforcement it's got to be the tsa of these radiation baking scanners and the groping that
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.880]  goes on and i've seen all these headlines girl six frisked by security guards at us airport
[33:55.440 --> 34:01.120]  well i tend to agree with what i saw last night with roland river when he pointed out this is not
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.880]  frisking this is an assault and i've had district attorneys on from san francisco and other places
[34:06.880 --> 34:13.600]  that say if they saw things like what happened to little anna that they would charge the tsa
[34:14.720 --> 34:23.920]  minion with sexual assault joining us via video skype is selena drexel the mother of anna
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.920]  drexel a little six-year-old who politely went through that ordeal but then broke down crying
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.400]  afterwards and of course dr todd rexel was also traveling with his wife selena drexel and their
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.080]  other children and joining us via video skype from bowling green kentucky is selena drexel
[34:40.080 --> 34:45.200]  selena thank you for coming on i think you're like well so much has happened and i've seen
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.200]  other tv interviews and radio interviews you've done where they basically ask the questions
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.880]  out of the gates before i ask my questions uh what do you what are you most concerned with
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.480]  the ordeal that you and your family went through and why why are you giving interviews to the media
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.200]  well the reason that the message that we're trying to get out is that this has to stop
[35:05.920 --> 35:10.240]  you know preferably for everybody with with the groping but especially for children
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.960]  because you know that i want to believe that the tsa you know in theory would be well intentioned
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.760]  to try to keep passengers safe while they're you know in the course of a two or three hour flight
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.360]  but i'm interested in keeping children safe when they're on the ground as well
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.880]  and the methods that they have been placed right now are setting kids up to be vulnerable to child
[35:30.880 --> 35:36.720]  predators who would take advantage of a child who's then been conditioned to ignore that feeling of
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.960]  wrongness that uneasy feeling you get when someone's touching you in an inappropriate manner
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.960]  you know if you have frequent flyer children that are then conditioned to accept this
[35:44.960 --> 35:49.680]  you're setting them up to be vulnerable to child predators and it has to stop
[35:49.680 --> 35:57.120]  well i remember seeing reports a few months ago with top child psychologist going on the news and
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.000]  saying this is training children that authority figures can molest them and governor jesse ventura
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.960]  has had them grab his genitals through the pants ron paul has talked about them squeezing his genitals
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.680]  i've had guessed on where they've stuck their hands into their pants and squeeze their underwear
[36:13.680 --> 36:21.040]  i mean a sworn police officer can't randomly do that at a park uh how can these federal
[36:21.040 --> 36:25.360]  minimum wage people uh do this i mean the sky's the limit if they get away with this
[36:26.320 --> 36:30.240]  i don't know i don't remember signing anything when i bought my ticket saying that i was giving
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.080]  up my constitutional rights and certainly not that of my children and so i'm not sure how this is
[36:34.080 --> 36:41.200]  allowed well mrs drexel i don't go to the doctor a lot for checkups because i don't frankly like
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.920]  the doctor will do in the things they do uh in the few checkups i've had i can't imagine what it's
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.280]  like for a six-year-old girl i mean i i have an six-year-old daughter i have a three-year-old
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.160]  daughter and they're both very spunky and smart and outgoing but when they're around strangers
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.040]  they don't know especially authority figures and uniforms and things they tend to hang on to my leg
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.560]  and get behind me that's just normal instinct i i i don't think my daughters would have held up as
[37:08.560 --> 37:16.800]  well uh as your daughter did i mean i and i as soon as they began to whimper and cry i i would
[37:16.800 --> 37:21.760]  probably do what any mammal would do when it's young is under attack i would attack and then i'd
[37:21.760 --> 37:27.440]  be charged as some type of terrorist well it's pretty hard to keep my cool but uh the supervisor
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.600]  you don't see on the camera i was was reasonably intimidating and uh well he was intimidating
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.280]  to me and let me know that you know there would be a big deal if i made a fuss so if you didn't
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.040]  load on the cattle car there was going to be a problem but we know at the end of the cattle
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.640]  train historically is where the real problems begin better to fight here on the platform at the
[37:48.640 --> 37:54.480]  trains now now you mentioned that on abc but they basically cut in over you specifically talk about
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.400]  because 90 of communication is non-verbal tell us about the non-verbal bowing up that you went
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.560]  through i've been through that as well uh where they let you know if you cause trouble i mean
[38:04.560 --> 38:11.520]  take your time describe what you saw well then the female agents uh that were ushering folks
[38:11.520 --> 38:18.720]  through the scanners um that i i've been through through a lot of tsa procedures i've been i were
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.880]  frequent flyers we travel you know four or five times a year is what i consider to be you know
[38:22.880 --> 38:30.160]  reasonably frequent and in most other cities that we've been in the tsa has has been reasonably
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.960]  you know accommodating you know yes we know we have to do this you know and they're reasonably
[38:34.960 --> 38:44.640]  polite um this particular crew was fairly aggressive and intimidating um you know i i did ask questions
[38:44.640 --> 38:50.880]  i did request alternates and was refused and not given any information the tsa supervisor
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.840]  was sitting behind a desk and you know overseeing this and i i recognized that he was the one in
[38:57.840 --> 39:04.640]  charge and protested to him off camera um both before and after the video started rolling uh and
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.840]  was refused and and he let me know he physically got into my personal space you know he was you
[39:09.840 --> 39:14.320]  know maybe six foot tall i don't know how tall he was he was he's a lot bigger than i was uh and
[39:14.960 --> 39:22.080]  let me know that you know just don't so well that's why none of my children have flown now my wife
[39:22.080 --> 39:29.360]  is not uh flown since all of this because not just myself but my wife i don't think would have the
[39:29.360 --> 39:36.000]  control that you did and and we commend your control because you shot the video you exposed what they
[39:36.000 --> 39:45.040]  were doing um and and you know to have them get in your space uh uh describe how he got in your
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.600]  space and exactly how he was looking at you for folks that uh are out there listening well he
[39:51.600 --> 39:58.000]  didn't he didn't use profanity or anything like that i mean he was you know technically professional
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.200]  but in a in a police you know i'm in control type of you know demeanor and so it's i'm not particularly
[40:05.200 --> 40:09.760]  angry with this crew i think they were following the instructions that they'd be given it's the
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.360]  instructions that i have a problem with it's the fact that we're even doing this at all
[40:13.360 --> 40:18.240]  is what i have a problem with and i would like to get changed but specifically then i mean is it
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.880]  accurate to say he did that kind of sticking his chest out arms out getting in your space
[40:23.440 --> 40:30.000]  kind of like a drill sergeant i mean how did he bow up to you sure exactly yeah just classic get on
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.360]  the cattle car shut up uh meanwhile uh i hear a child on the video it looks like separate from
[40:35.360 --> 40:40.880]  your daughter saying i don't want him to touch me i don't want him to touch my clothes uh was that
[40:40.880 --> 40:47.200]  some of your other children or someone else's children right um the video picks up about halfway
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.280]  through the process i went through the pat down first i was actually given a lighter version of
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.760]  the pat down than anna was given um when i managed to get my phone back and hand it over to todd he
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.520]  was also holding the two-year-old who you hear on the video um trying to manage all the other you
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.960]  know our our belongings that were coming through the conveyor belt other passengers were shoving it
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.320]  on the floor shoving it aside being in new orleans i was concerned about theft um you know trying to
[41:14.320 --> 41:18.560]  make sure that you know not only is my daughter safe my other two children are taking care of
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.240]  plus no one's running off with our with our stuff and so it was fairly chaotic i think we managed it
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.720]  you know reasonably well that is uh caroline my youngest you hear on the video and it's kind of
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.360]  comical some of the the news agencies have attributed her statements to anna um you know and i don't
[41:35.360 --> 41:38.640]  you know maybe it's because i'm a parent i don't particularly think that a two-year-old sounds the
[41:38.640 --> 41:46.800]  same as a six-year-old um she was saying she didn't want them to take her clothes but uh then she
[41:46.800 --> 41:52.000]  changed the subject and wanted to use the iphone to play angry birds and then uh the third comment
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.760]  that she made she wanted her shoes back because they had you know we had made her give up her shoes
[41:55.760 --> 41:59.680]  to go through the go through the uh inspection and she wanted those back and so those are the
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.320]  comments that you hear her making anna only said yes ma'am a couple of times and and pretty much was
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.480]  doing what she was told well ma'am this is we've studied it this is social engineering social
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.120]  conditioning that we're basically all criminals the government can do whatever it wants it's a
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.120]  federal power grab violating the ninth and tenth amendment to have unsworn federal officers much
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.720]  less sworn i mean just a few years ago the fbi had to get permission to come into your town or
[42:26.720 --> 42:32.560]  county now they're running most of the investigations uh same thing with with this new federal bureaucracy
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.920]  were you aware that the tsa is now running highway checkpoints and checkpoints at train
[42:37.920 --> 42:44.320]  stations and bus stations i am now i know that now i didn't know that before and i i take responsibility
[42:44.320 --> 42:50.000]  for not educating myself before we went on this trip you know i i was used to the you know the
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.360]  previous processes i had heard about or you know had heard about the new naked scanners that they
[42:55.360 --> 43:00.240]  were doing but i thought that they would use those only if they couldn't use you know some other
[43:00.240 --> 43:06.240]  technology or if they were profiling someone and and thought that they needed to to take an extra
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.960]  look as far as pat downs for children i had heard that there was an age limit of 13 and up um it's
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.200]  not clear to me you know it's been a few days since this has happened and i've tried to do some
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.840]  some online research to find out exactly what the rule is and i don't think it's just so you know
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.600]  they told the washington post right in november of last year and put on their own tsa website
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.800]  that children under 12 would not be given enhanced pat down in fact let's put that headline up
[43:32.800 --> 43:40.080]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers we also then wrote an article about it tsa caught lying about pat downs
[43:40.080 --> 43:46.720]  of children so yes they're constantly changing their story if you go back to november of last
[43:46.720 --> 43:53.920]  year ma'am this all started in the media when one of my crew members michelle went to colorada to ski
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.600]  with her eight-year-old daughter and her year and a half-year-old daughter with their family
[43:58.400 --> 44:04.880]  on their way back a man groped her and squeezed her private parts and everything and tried to go
[44:04.880 --> 44:11.360]  in the lifespan then the man tried to grop the eight-year-old and the year old she demanded a woman
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.400]  but but still i mean if a if a if a man gropes you and sexually assaults you or a woman does
[44:16.400 --> 44:23.280]  what's the i mean a person's a person uh there's the us today article uh from last year no enhanced
[44:23.280 --> 44:28.800]  pat downs for kids tsa says so this is all psychological warfare i saw governor rich head
[44:28.800 --> 44:34.240]  of homeland security eight years ago say their plan was to finally have worker id cards nationwide
[44:34.240 --> 44:42.000]  tsa will be in every mall highway uh federal toll roads uh and that they're just conditioning us
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.600]  to line up and basically be stripped searched and and this is what authoritarians always do in
[44:47.600 --> 44:53.440]  communist china in russia and nazi germany they they first have you show papers then they teach
[44:53.440 --> 45:00.480]  you to put their hands on you and uh the tsa themselves uh agents are fired if they have
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.920]  radiation concerns from the scanners they're fired if they don't want to do this uh the groping so
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.720]  they're creating cadres of people that will carry this out and the reason i'm you're basically trying
[45:10.720 --> 45:15.680]  to fill you in on this is you're very influential obviously now doing these interviews and if you
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.400]  haven't seen the info that i just covered i'd love to send you the historical uh evidence
[45:21.920 --> 45:26.160]  yeah i'd love to i'd love to get any more that i could get yeah i'll i'll also mention that
[45:26.160 --> 45:32.160]  they're not changing gloves in between pat downs oh they're not changing gloves they don't they
[45:32.160 --> 45:38.400]  didn't change gloves between the last uh folks that went through and us now watching the video
[45:38.400 --> 45:44.640]  it looks like that they're doing the uh into the waistband into the pants did that happen to your
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.960]  daughter anna it did they they touched her underwear but but let me clarify i i don't want to insult
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.000]  you know the the feelings of or invalidate the experience of anyone who has truly been sexually
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.200]  molested or assaulted i don't think that that's exactly what happened here i think they did go too
[46:03.200 --> 46:10.160]  far but to to equate you know a child being physically molested or you know sodomized or
[46:10.160 --> 46:16.560]  something horrifying i don't equate the two what i'm trying to to get across is to prevent that
[46:16.560 --> 46:21.680]  you know from being possible by by delivering a consistent message for kids that hands off always
[46:22.800 --> 46:29.360]  but that is the i mean i've had district attorneys on here on the broadcast uh from big cities like
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.040]  san francisco and they've pointed out that that if you touch someone on the outside of their pants
[46:35.040 --> 46:41.120]  and touch their genitals it's a misdemeanor and if you go inside the pants it is a sexual assault
[46:41.120 --> 46:51.040]  felony and so uh i mean all the time we see maybe so then but um you know we my husband is a
[46:51.040 --> 46:59.760]  gynecologist by trade and he would say that there's a difference well certainly um you wind up in a
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.480]  cattle car and what happened to anna would would be considerably different you know but it doesn't
[47:04.480 --> 47:09.040]  it doesn't minimize the fact that this is completely wrong to do to sure sure here's my point let's
[47:09.040 --> 47:13.360]  say hypothetically you're walking through a grocery store parking lot at 10 o'clock at night
[47:13.920 --> 47:19.040]  uh you're picking up some groceries and a man runs up in the night and grabs your breast
[47:19.600 --> 47:24.880]  he would get a felony conviction for that and spend about five years in prison and so sure they do
[47:24.880 --> 47:30.000]  it under the official umbrella my only issue is that's how nazi germany got going because they
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.120]  were in uniforms they thought it was okay to work people to death and strip search them and march them
[47:35.120 --> 47:44.320]  into showers yeah that that may you know that may be true yes why do you think then uh they're doing
[47:44.320 --> 47:49.360]  this i mean is it political correctness that if the terrorists are supposedly from the middle east
[47:49.360 --> 47:54.240]  but but we uh you know don't uh strip search them because you know some people are being taken
[47:54.240 --> 48:00.080]  behind closed doors and being being strip searched well i'm not sure that that we can say that the
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.440]  terrorists are exclusively exclusively from the middle east you know we found american citizens
[48:05.440 --> 48:11.840]  that have you know gone overseas to train or you know had other ideologies that that you know set
[48:11.840 --> 48:18.800]  them up for for being internal uh terrorists if you will and this is this is a type of people that
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.320]  value value their own no higher than a firecracker you know that you know they'll blow themselves up
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.400]  sure but hypothetically hypothetically i or anybody else could go attack a shopping mall
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.840]  right now you could do that i mean do we set up checkpoints i mean do we set it up outside your
[48:35.840 --> 48:42.800]  door down the street i mean no amount of tyranny can ever keep us safe no and we're never going to
[48:42.800 --> 48:48.880]  be able to eliminate risk and i don't think we want to i mean sure it would be it would be nice to
[48:48.880 --> 48:55.360]  not have to worry about things but the state of you know a police state to avoid all possible
[48:56.160 --> 49:00.560]  wackos it's not realistic and it's not the country that i want to live in well sure exactly because
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.080]  historically it is government police states that kill and enslave more people than any ted bundy
[49:06.080 --> 49:10.640]  ever could dream of i mean our founders told us the big danger is a government that tells you
[49:10.640 --> 49:16.560]  we're going to take your rights away for for security you better run well i think i think
[49:16.560 --> 49:23.040]  a big danger also is people that sit by and do nothing and accept it you mean people that that
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.840]  basically go along with this sure well that's why we want to commend you for what you've done now
[49:27.840 --> 49:33.200]  did i hear correctly when you were on abc news that they also told you not to videotape no they
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.560]  never told me not to videotape i was taking a risk by videotaping it and had they told me not to
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.760]  you know i probably wouldn't but they never said not to but i mean you you you have a right i mean
[49:43.760 --> 49:49.040]  they're all surveilling you with cameras they can't say for security reasons you can't videotape them
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.160]  also i want to cover this point and we're going to break here if i keep it just a few more minutes
[49:54.160 --> 50:02.960]  but but but please try to start answering this uh what type of precedent does it set though that
[50:02.960 --> 50:09.280]  if they're going to be groping us now what could happen in the future i can only speculate as to
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.040]  what's going to happen in the future i would i would you know prefer that it stopped now when
[50:13.040 --> 50:21.520]  we head back in the other direction what where are you going from here well i'm i'm investigating
[50:21.520 --> 50:28.800]  what our options are right now um in terms of making the tsa accountable to their own you know
[50:28.800 --> 50:35.520]  published standards so i'm i'm i'm currently investigating options right now i've not rolled
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.520]  anything out selena drexel the mother of little anna who went through this ordeal we're going to
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.600]  break for just a couple minutes i'd like to spend a few more minutes with you on the other side if

[54:10.480 --> 54:15.200]  selena drexel mother of little anna is our guest for another four or five minutes
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.760]  how did your daughter take this i heard reports that she broke down crying after the ordeal i i
[54:23.760 --> 54:30.320]  think my daughters would break down crying right there on the spot um and as a tough girl she uh
[54:30.320 --> 54:34.160]  she stood there and took it and she knew mom was right there and wouldn't let anything you know
[54:34.160 --> 54:39.680]  horrible you know even further happened to her so she was she was okay to you know as long as i
[54:39.680 --> 54:44.400]  was standing there and she did break down right afterward you know thinking that she had done
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.000]  something wrong um you know once we got on the plane you know we had a lot of explaining to do
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.480]  you know you know why does mom always say don't let anyone touch you and then now now we've done
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.600]  this you know now we now it's okay when in fact i said no it's not okay you're right to feel this way
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.200]  you're right to feel violated um you're you know it is not okay for anyone to touch you like this
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.480]  and you know mommy's going to try to do something about this um trying to explain this also to a
[55:10.480 --> 55:14.240]  to a nine-year-old that this is what happened to your sister and this is what's you know this
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.480]  is what you saw and this is why we feel it was wrong you know we we did a lot of you know a lot of
[55:18.480 --> 55:25.600]  talking uh on on the plane you know but after after was over you know after you know we got home
[55:25.600 --> 55:30.720]  she got back into her normal routine you know she's moved on she's okay but she's you know she's not
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.400]  sitting in a dark room while rocking back and forth in the corner that's well that's certainly
[55:34.400 --> 55:40.720]  good news it's not her nature but we need to get a class action lawsuit going so this this uh you
[55:40.720 --> 55:47.040]  know type of abuse stops right my concern is this you obviously are having a measured response
[55:47.040 --> 55:52.880]  a lot of other americans are basically having stock home syndrome and i know you sound like a very
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.480]  educated person you know what that is but for those that don't people get abused so they make excuses
[55:58.480 --> 56:03.200]  for why it's happening and that's what the social engineers are counting on to basically set the
[56:03.200 --> 56:08.000]  precedent that government can give us forced inoculations government have you heard about
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.560]  i'm taking baby's blood secretly at birth now for 40 years in the us no i've not heard of that and
[56:14.560 --> 56:19.360]  and in my husband's line of work delivering babies i just he hasn't heard about either well see now
[56:19.360 --> 56:25.520]  they tell him it's going to the health department for a blood test okay yes but it's actually going
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.040]  so it does go to the state i you know the heel stick that they do uh within 24 hours of birth
[56:31.040 --> 56:36.000]  that does go for uh that does go to the state well all i'm saying is find out how deep the
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.040]  rabbit hole goes i got secret documents 15 years ago where it really goes cold springs harbour
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.040]  eugenics lab and it does have dual uses but uh i just wanted you to go look it up it's in the
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.960]  associated press now that it's actually being sold to industry my issue is there's a lot of
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.800]  power grabbing going on that most people aren't aware of even who work professionally around it
[56:58.800 --> 57:06.400]  in closing my concern is if you say no to their groping they then throw you out but then claim you
[57:06.400 --> 57:12.880]  you refuse the screening and find you for $11,000 uh so i mean that's really scary what's your view
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.320]  on that well i'd like to see him collect that from as many people that you know as would refuse it
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.240]  i just i don't think it's constitutional and i just i think it would get thrown out i would i would
[57:22.240 --> 57:28.640]  hope that it would selena to protect other people you don't sound like a litigious person
[57:28.640 --> 57:34.800]  but to protect other people i think you might want to look uh at a uh civil rights violation
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.560]  lawsuit uh or visit with the district attorney of the county where this happened because i've had
[57:40.560 --> 57:44.560]  several district attorneys on who say they would charge people for what they did to your daughter
[57:44.560 --> 57:50.080]  i think it's important to uh go ahead and go after these people so that they don't continue to do it
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.600]  right and like i said i'm not ruled out any options um what i would really
[57:55.600 --> 58:01.440]  like to see um you know attacking the tsa is i think only going to put them on the defensive
[58:01.440 --> 58:07.440]  and have them dig their heels and even further i would really ultimately like to see uh other
[58:07.440 --> 58:13.040]  groups work with the tsa to develop screening procedures that are acceptable once they would
[58:13.040 --> 58:20.000]  be endorsed by parents um other you know special special populations like the disabled well selena
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.440]  just to be clear though because i know you're a reasonable person so you're trying to be reasonable
[58:23.440 --> 58:28.800]  the tsa follows orders we have continuity of agenda all over the western world this is happening
[58:28.800 --> 58:34.640]  this is an agenda uh and they don't want to be reasonable we really appreciate you spending
[58:34.640 --> 58:39.120]  time with us god bless you a lot of great points and everybody you know cares about you and your
[58:39.120 --> 58:48.080]  family god bless this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:51.600 --> 58:55.600]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[58:55.600 --> 59:00.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[59:01.120 --> 59:06.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've determined its influence
[59:06.000 --> 59:12.000]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[59:12.000 --> 59:18.480]  of us as american citizens to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[59:18.480 --> 59:24.880]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[59:24.880 --> 59:29.840]  government kim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[59:29.840 --> 59:34.560]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[59:34.560 --> 59:42.160]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.400]  leave the united states here in the next few weeks syndicated columnist journalist
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:48.320]  because of direct threats that have been issued to him via the white house through a major media
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.280]  outlet a embassy and a foreign government he's been told directly they're coming after him and i
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.280]  wanted to go over why they're coming after him but also he's got a lot of new intel on what's
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.720]  happening things flaring back up in iraq what's happening in north africa what's happening in
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.160]  the middle east that is all coming up with wane madson joining us via video skype coming up in
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.560]  the next segment then after he leaves us i'm going to spend the balance of the broadcast
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.240]  taking your calls and getting to the big news now there are two reports today that integrate
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:27.760]  together and i'll also bring this up to madson saudi slash oil output say market oversupply
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:35.040]  now you already see oil prices on average pushing four dollars a gallon here in the united states
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.280]  it's uh what seven and a half euros or so on average in europe meanwhile standard and pours
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:56.160]  cuts us ratings outlook to negative the dollar is in terminal decline right now by design
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:03.920]  and that ties in to breton woods to and with george soros and and the bankers have set up
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:10.480]  up and they're on record doing it so we're going to be going over that today and what a dollar
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:18.320]  implosion means and what it signifies to have the saudi arabians now coming out and rushing
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.360]  to the russians the chinese begging for help realizing that the west has double crossed the
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.600]  middle east by trying to now foment rebellions in countries they're friendly towards and countries
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.000]  that they've been enemies with like mua marca daffy though they made a deal with him six years
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.160]  to basically patch up uh their uh their little agreement amongst uh thieves and criminals
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:49.040]  there is no honor among thieves and that's certainly being evidenced amongst these king rats
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:57.920]  fighting with each other so huge huge developments happening right now and this is the absolute
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:05.680]  crowning proof that the globalist are orchestrating the unrest in the middle east north africa
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.640]  though wiki leaks is now confirming that uh and that's an establishment rag right there
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.200]  you know leaking machine they put out some real stuff to get credibility but you also
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.600]  have the state department admitting it you have alberi admitting it i mean it's been admitted
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.480]  going back two months ago with the whole egypt situation that this is western run but when we
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:31.200]  say western we mean the corrupt banking elites that have grown so fat and powerful off of the
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:40.320]  wealth of the western civilization and western intellect and western work work ethic so america
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.960]  and europe gets the blame for the empire but we don't get the spoils let's be clear about that
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:54.240]  and donald trump is now speaking to those spoils and saying we deserve the oil money as if americans
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.360]  are going to get a check in the mail no americans pay for the war we pay for it with money and blood
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.240]  and our name being demonized because it isn't any legal corrupt war in in iraq namely
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.920]  and then the big mega banks get to finance the reconstruction and the big mega oil companies
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.800]  they get to go in and get the oil and sell it to us at four dollars a gallon so donald trump buddy you
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:26.720]  and the uh kleptocrats in wall street are getting the money and so it's this childlike sound bites
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.480]  kind of like um sarah paleon going we need people that'll fight in washington fight to cut the
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:39.760]  deficit fight to cut welfare we need people in washington to fight like a girl well actually
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:48.400]  they fight like men in washington to lie and steal and to launch new wars they fight against us
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.800]  those are bought and paid for so it's not just we don't we need to donald trump who's slick talking
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:59.520]  in a fight but we know he'll fight he'll uh fight to get socialist health care oh you didn't know
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.760]  he supported that this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar

[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.680]  to chicago from his home in dc spent months tracking down the mafia connections to barack
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.480]  obama a real name barry satara of indonesia he also has been really ferreting out the
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:56.320]  evidence that obama his mother and much of his family didn't just work for the biggest tax-free
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:03.840]  foundations and timothy geithner's dad and the rockefeller foundation but was cia and his entire
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.040]  background has been expunged and carefully hidden he is a globalist manchurian candidate
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:17.040]  it's come out that tony blair uh was mi five and mi six uh connected and was actually an mi six
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.520]  agent uh some of the papers have reported over in england as early as college and of course they had
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:30.400]  a new movie out uh basically with a fictional account of that uh ghostwriter that just came out
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:37.120]  last year uh dealing with that and and of course it's admitted that the globalist uh have these
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.120]  corporate operatives and also government operatives that they uh prepare like george herbert walkerbush
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.880]  became the cia director claiming he never been in the cia in the mid 1970s and then it was
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:55.760]  declassified years later he was in the cia out of college at the end of world war two and of course
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:03.840]  who founded the cia that's also declassified Yale particularly skull and bones which was a private
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.520]  british slash german intelligence agency uh that that recruited the best and brightest of america's
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:18.480]  east coast uh you know kind of an atlantic accented elitist and that formed the core of the cia
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:27.200]  and robert deniro's film the good shepherd very historical uh breaks all of that down and so this
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.920]  fits the bill this is how the shadow state controls things just like in all these third world
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.040]  countries they train for decades people here in the west they dispatch them to lead rebel groups
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.120]  to overthrow the government and then put in their own dictatorship one of the best examples
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:54.800]  is saddam hussein uh young army officer 19 1958 sent and trained in egypt for four years then sent
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.760]  in to commit assassinations and the west made a deal that he was made to head of bath security
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:05.520]  the assassinations would uh stop the attempted assassinations would stop then in 79 the west
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.040]  staged a coup with saddam to put him into power then three years later they gave him 30 plus billion
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.320]  dollars to attack the iranians then in 1990 they told him go ahead we don't care we're going to
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.360]  support you uh in an attack on the coates then they lied and said he was throwing babies out of
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.000]  incubators as a way to then double back and take out their old minion but i'm sorry wane madson

[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.040]  through a major international media source and a foreign embassy uh that the white house wants
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:42.480]  you to know that uh they may have you killed any day wane madson thanks for joining us
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.400]  uh good to be with you alex i would add to that that uh some of those uh the threats have now
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.720]  been confirmed by sources in chicago so they keep continuing the confirmations anyway keep
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:02.080]  continuing uh just to recap it uh tell folks about the specific uh conduits of the threats
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.600]  and then let's get more into obama and his cia background uh that has got them so hopping mad
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:15.120]  well i was told by a um a major media person here for foreign a very large foreign newspaper
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.560]  who's of course met many of these foreign journalists in washington are closely connected
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.680]  to their embassies and within their embassies of course are a lot of intelligence people
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.480]  as a favor he told me that the people at the embassy wanted me to know that uh the white
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.880]  house wanted uh wanted to kill me i mean and i said are you being uh are you being uh uh
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:45.600]  metaphorical here he says no no i mean it so uh that was followed up by a source within the state
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:52.800]  department who basically said the same thing using the word uh the words you're a marked man so
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.960]  those kinds of things i i don't think can be taken lightly especially uh after we've seen
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.640]  so many and i've and i've investigated many of these unexplained uh suspicious deaths like the
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:13.120]  um uh wife of the white house uh uh aid uh ashley turton uh former uh aid of the secretary
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:19.040]  air force jack wheeler found in a landfill in wilmington uh ashley turton burned up in her car
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:25.600]  here and on capitol hill uh and i mean the list goes on and on how many of these suspicious deaths
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.600]  i i've myself investigated it's been said that dc uh hookers are as ubiquitous as water fountains
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:38.080]  i think hitmen are as ubiquitous uh as water fountains as well well yeah i mean look at the
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.600]  history of this town from you know the vince foster case to you know it just goes on and on
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:50.160]  there there's so many and uh many of them have just wound up as cold uh in the cold case files
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.080]  uh of the police so you're leaving because it's a lot easier for them to kill you there i mean they
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.360]  could shoot vince vince foster put the wrong gun in his hand no blood at the scene have hillary
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.160]  cleaning his office with carpet cleaners keeping the police sound i mean they can kill people in
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.680]  plain view there and it's so corrupt uh that uh they can basically ark inside you if they want
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.800]  so you're getting out of there uh just so you're not as easy as a target yeah i mean i mean we had
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:21.680]  it we had uh during a bush administration i think it was uh back in 2003 we had uh two people uh
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.600]  there was swan dives off of major landmarks here in washington uh the state department employee
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.400]  off the roof of the state department and a guy used to be an intelligence official for the cia
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:39.120]  took a swan dive off the watergate uh i mean that both of these were reported as just uh
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.640]  you know unfortunate suicides by the by the washington post which i call the compost um
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.320]  but uh by the way you're not uh how many floors up are you at your condo because i can see that
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:58.480]  it's a foggy day there uh in dc because you're shooting this from out on your balcony it is it
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:06.240]  is foggy uh this is uh 13 stories up not a good number is it uh very lucky but uh but anyway uh
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.040]  at least i could get it i'm assured of getting a decent signal here because the at&t cell towers
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.200]  is literally a few blocks away so um uh that services the pentagon so unless they want to
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.440]  interfere with their own communications they won't interfere with mine that's right we got a
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.000]  better video scott connection with you today but we we hope that before you try to leave town you
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.080]  don't uh try to become a bird and fly off that balcony right there well i'll tell you it's uh
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:38.240]  it's hard to get in this building uh the security here is pretty good uh but uh i've uh
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.360]  uh from the vantage point now over my shoulder you can see the why you you know we've got the
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.000]  washington monument and the and then the white house down below there and it's amazing what you
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.360]  see especially at night with the helicopter traffic flying around i often see obama's marine one uh
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.040]  uh going shooting back and well i was there in dc last we went to some of the restaurants in
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.800]  georgetown at night and there were the cream of american beauties i mean these were truly
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.680]  beautiful women much more beautiful than you than you know you see even on tv and things
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.160]  getting in limos getting in cars secret service saying don't videotape this we'd be sitting there
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.600]  eating dinner trying to you know videotape it as shots of corruption going on i mean are the
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.840]  hookers and the young women of america flocking more to dc than they do to la to be in porn well
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.560]  i think uh we see that with the white annual white house correspondence dinner this kind of nexus
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.320]  between hollywood and washington we get all the celebrities here uh going you know it's a mixture
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.600]  of politics and and and entertainment and uh certainly uh there is a there is sort of an
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.120]  axis between uh washington and hollywood yeah so the globalist not only rob us in washington
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.920]  it's turned into a giant honey trap to suck in all the young women who don't have a future as a
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.600]  professor or a scientist or a doctor but they've got a future uh taking care of uh world leaders
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.440]  and if they ever complain about it they'll just burn up in their car or be hung from the neck
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.240]  until dead because america's run by the good guys wane uh we're about to go to break but let's start
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:12.160]  getting into well specifically did these sources say they're mad about the obama cia connection
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:17.280]  you're ferriting or is that your gut i mean do they let you know what it is that they're upset
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:24.800]  about yeah it's it's basically the cia connection i mean i think uh that is their achilles heel
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.200]  uh they've been dealing with the bursar to get issued for quite some time they seem to have all
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:37.040]  kinds of pad answers for that uh but uh the the the cia connection his mother stanley and dunham
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:42.080]  his grandparents who looked like they actually predated this uh cia and worked for the office
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.240]  of strategic services during world war two the os s well we've got basically a biography of obama
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:55.120]  and his family that's been uh concocted uh by some very good fiction writers of uh i i would assume
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:01.280]  up at langley then we've got his dad who uh had a british intel connection didn't he
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.920]  yeah barack senior of course came to the united states as part of the airlift africa program
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:14.480]  the cia's uh program to influence new leaders of newly independent african countries to compete
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.600]  with the soviets who were doing the same thing at the people's friendship university in mosca
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:27.600]  which later became uh patrice lamumba university and just everybody you look at it just continues
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.880]  with this guy totally hooked in with these intelligence groups and you look at his cabinet
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.640]  now it's all the very same families that were in intelligence at the time with his mommy oh
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.280]  absolutely tem geithner's father worked with the boss for obama's mother very small world isn't it
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.160]  certainly is let's come back and look more into this also get your view on what's happening in

[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.720]  obama pushes chinese style internet id system i got to some of this yesterday but it's one thing
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.680]  to know they've been setting this up to have them openly come out and say you're gonna have to have a
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.760]  government id to surf the web to have a bank account uh and that the government's gonna track
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.080]  everything you do and the government's gonna have the id codes to all of your files uh just
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.960]  incredible by the way since i bring that up before we get back into obama and the cia background
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.680]  formally with the nsa and a computer expert wane madson what do you make of of this incredible new
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:10.720]  chinese style internet id system with the admissions uh that it's going to track everything you do
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:16.560]  and the white house said it's voluntary but even seen at and wired magazine said that's not true
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:23.120]  this is a forced system once they get it in place well yeah this is a typical uh example of what i
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.520]  call a function creep or mission creep the white house is saying well it's to prevent identity theft
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.840]  but uh as we've seen with all these other initiatives from the government in the past
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:42.160]  uh what they say and what they ultimately do uh with these uh these new systems is very invasive
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.400]  and and i would uh i i know that some of my old colleagues from when i worked at epic are on this
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.960]  story and and i agree that uh this is uh this is just like back during the clinton administration
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.760]  when they were pushing this government encryption system called the clipper chip they said oh this
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.600]  is to protect you know protect your uh your electronic funds transfers and things like that
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.320]  yet the government would hold the key and uh there was a huge battle over that and here we
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:18.000]  here we go again uh with another initiative and it looks like uh look i mean you look you look at
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.680]  jen and the poletano the homeland security department and the people at obama has put in these
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:30.640]  uh national security uh positions and all of them every single one of them are are for massive
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.640]  surveillance systems it says in some respects it's actually worse than bush and here here with this
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.680]  internet id here we have an example of an initiative that was never even tried by the previous
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:48.480]  administration and i never thought i'd say that uh obama would be worse than bush in some respects
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.720]  but but he absolutely isn't in many respects freedom of information this new thing with the internet
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.920]  and and count and and and and you know starting at third war where bush had two wars going obama
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.680]  now has three wars going but we know not giving obama an out i mean it's fun to dislike him he
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:11.040]  is a distasteful teleprompter reading a liar it's that the globalist are further down the road
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.560]  for this new global banking empire known as the new world order they're committed they've
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:22.640]  committed so many crimes that they've got to either prevail or they're going to fall and fall hard
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.720]  and so i would imagine whatever new fake republican savior they put in if it's not ron paul if it's
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.320]  donald trump or mit romney people are going to be amazed how bad they are because it's all just a
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:41.760]  continuation it's a continuity of agenda what this construct i think uh runs the risk of they may
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:47.920]  be hit by a ton of bricks and i'm being sort of tongue-in-cheek here bricks being the new uh uh
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:54.640]  a pact of uh brazil russia india china and now south africa uh they are basically if you listen
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.240]  to their government leaders they're saying we are out to stop the western control over international
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.360]  finances through the imf through the world bank through the g20 through the g8 and they're making
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.360]  no bones about it the fact that they don't like the fact that so much international monetary policy
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.560]  is set blocks from the white house at the imf and world bank headquarters they're calling for an end
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.960]  to that and uh and these are burgeoning economies where the us and and britain and france are
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.120]  collapsing economies that's right the west has even lost its will to have children we have a corrupt
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:34.800]  elite who's socially engineered us to be servile and dumb but so we would be more manageable but
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:42.960]  once you do that zombies don't reproduce zombies aren't creative and so the zombie world run by the
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:49.760]  zombie kings of the new world order are trying this last gasp attempt to set up their world empire
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:57.040]  with the senile stumbling soros at the top of it uh openly you know saying how proud he is that he
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:02.960]  helped round up jews as a collaborator i mean these are very very sick people but they've
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:10.640]  got nuclear weapons well they do and you know i mean we look at uh we we look at what the us is
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.160]  doing around the world in this projection of military uh strength the military aggression
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.360]  i've heard no one say wait a minute here we've got a country that has that has no respect for
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.880]  international law uh with weapons of mass destruction uh i haven't heard anyone say well
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.760]  maybe they should be removed from our from these people that stay there way madson i want to have

[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.880]  about supporting us every day by at least spreading the word about the broadcast that's the most
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.520]  important thing that you can do going back to wane madson here for the rest of this segment
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.320]  that i'm getting into financial news and world news this is one of the biggest newsdays most
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.920]  important newsdays i've ever seen we're going to be breaking that down and taking your phone
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.040]  calls in the next hour but wane getting into your view your take the breakdown on what's
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.720]  happening in the middle east we know it's globalist backed but the larger question is why what is
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.200]  the end game wane madson well i i saw what happened in north africa starting in tunisia
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:48.640]  and then in egypt and then spreading to libya now syria uh look we had riots against uh
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.520]  the austerity measures being imposed by the imf in greece we saw general strikes in spain
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:01.440]  and in portugal we saw mass demonstrations in italy this of course these demonstrations
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:08.880]  uh went south on the mediterranean coast they affected tunisia and egypt and now syria and
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:14.880]  what what we're seeing is uh an attempt by from the these latest cables that have been released
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:21.520]  the u.s backing uh the syrian opposition the cia giving them money u.s a i d the soros connected
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:28.480]  ngos just like we saw after after the initial uprising in libya how that what the what these
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.560]  uh elitists are trying to do is ensure a soft landing they want to make sure that whoever
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:42.880]  comes in after qaddafi or a mubarak or banali in tunisia or Assad in syria is somebody they can
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.400]  they can deal with somebody they've nurtured and and here we have in syria uh the fact that the
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.240]  groups that have been funded by the cia and us a id and the ngos have these groups are based in
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.680]  london that reminds me of one almond chalabi uh the iraqi national congress living in the most
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:05.440]  expensive uh neighborhood in london who was being groomed to take over from saddam hussein
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.120]  uh the other thing these countries haven't come i would note mubarak asad and qaddafi
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:18.240]  and banali in tunisia were all covert partners of the cia and its rendition and torture pro
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.760]  program and and now we've basically thrown these guys out and we obviously want to replace them
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:29.840]  with somebody who will keep up this phony war on terrorism and and the other thing i predicted this
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.280]  that these north african rebellions would start heading south into sub-saharan africa we're seeing
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:42.560]  that play out right now massive mutiny underway in burkina faso uh we're seeing uh demonstrations
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.920]  in gabon and in uganda against the u.s supported dictator there so uh we are seeing uh these these
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:40:00.880]  rebellions spread to the south to uh black africa in saudi arabia what's happening in yemen ba rain
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.640]  because our sources inside big oil companies lindsay williams and others six months ago said
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.040]  there's going to be a destabilization of the middle east north africa it's going to lead to 150
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.400]  dollar a barrel oil or more the saudis are going to be double crossed they've invested in the dollar
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.960]  as the world moves away from the dollar uh the west isn't just going to cheat them
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:26.080]  out of their t bills by devaluing them they're also going to basically overthrow them an end
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.680]  of this hundred years of british intelligence officers being the the saudi royal family you
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  know better ones they gave a crown to and some and some machine guns and hangar nades and said
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:43.040]  you're the king since our sources said this six months ago we've seen the saudi's run to
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:50.240]  to uh russia run to china they're openly talking about a double cross normally during an economic
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.400]  uh situation like this they would increase output now they're saying they're going to
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:01.600]  slash output with a sarcastic statement about saying market is oversupplied as oil prices
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:07.280]  surge towards record prices what do you make of all of this and from your research do you have
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.560]  anything that backs that up that there's a plan by the globalist to basically overthrow not just
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:20.800]  friends like mubarak but other seedy sickening inbred scum like the saudi's oh i think uh that's
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.480]  always in the cards uh right now i think the u.s is trying to protect its military interests in
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:33.360]  the gulf region the support we've shown for the uh uh regime in Bahrain where which hosts the u.s uh
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.640]  naval base headquarters of the fifth uh fleet i think right now we're we're trying to shore up
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.360]  those regimes but the deputy chinese foreign minister said something very interesting at the
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:49.120]  brick summit on high non-island in southern china he said that there are other countries who he would
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:57.360]  not name who have asked to join this anti-nato anti-eu anti-us uh new grouping of nations that
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.000]  are basically positioning themselves to pick up the pieces after the collapse of this american
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.360]  empire and i would not be surprised if uh the well the reason he didn't mention the names of the
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.240]  countries i i i would think that maybe saudi arabia could be one of them certainly i would think
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:19.920]  turkey which is a growing uh regional uh power politically and economically is also a country
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:25.200]  that would like to divorce itself from the united states with this new alignment isn't that though
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:30.880]  part of the globalist grand strategy these giant capital pits run by the rockefellers the roth
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.640]  childs the sorrows is because we see their minion geithner two years ago in china and now again
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.520]  two weeks ago saying yes we're looking at something that's an alternative to the dollar
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.800]  we like this and the globalists that have used america are basically done with us now they've
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.400]  run up our credit card they've destroyed our name while carrying out their operations and so now
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.600]  they're basically hedging their bet moving more in an alignment with the brick nations i mean look
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:04.960]  at the look at the the bailout of general motors billions to brazil to build plants billions to
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.280]  eastern europe billions to china i mean the people running washington uh are basically sinking this
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:19.040]  ship and now jumping on the new ship they've outfitted uh the bricks well they may want to join up but
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:24.400]  i i i listened to uh for example the brazilian finance minister the trade minister of south
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.680]  africa they all had the same line basically they don't like the fact the us is flooding the world
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.560]  with cheap dollars they don't like quantitative easing they're blaming the western banks for
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:40.720]  causing the worst economic collapse since the great depression of the 1930s and and it's quite
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:46.240]  clear what they're talking about that they're saying the day where these old white guys sit in
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:52.560]  geneva and london and new york and call the shots and here in washington that those days are over
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:58.800]  and and i think that the mere fact that you know whatever geithner's saying uh he's trying to
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:05.280]  protect himself but i think this is also a cultural thing and uh let's face it i mean these countries
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:12.480]  uh several decades ago were uh third world nations and now they're growing in stature and uh i think
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:19.120]  there's a bit of uh but it was the globalist that passed the tax laws to incentivize moving to those
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:24.320]  countries i mean what i'm pointing out is yeah this has always been part of the larger stratagem
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:30.240]  to bring the us in europe down and then move it into this new system ensure the president of
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.880]  brazil and others they put out rhetoric that's popular it's kind of like elberi saying we'll
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.920]  have war with israel when it's known that he's on this international council with soros and
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.200]  general jones and you know all the rest of them so i mean i'm not disagreeing with you
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:51.360]  but but i mean it's been the globalist that helped put these current elites basically into power
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:56.160]  in the bricks nations you're talking about with the exception of russia now russia is the big wild
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.040]  card what do you see happening with russia well we don't know uh how this presidential election
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:07.520]  is going to play out clearly demetri mid viet of the current president is uh a favorite of these
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:13.840]  western institutions uh they do not like blademy or putin the prime minister so there's talk of maybe
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:19.200]  uh a race between the two but they're supposed to be partners they're being very coy about their
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.640]  future political plans unless they're just trying to play the world for suckers and saying yeah i
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.720]  think that we're going to have a race against one another one in fact putin i think putin is
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:34.560]  very popular in russia and i think putin will probably run for president and be uh and get his
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:39.520]  old job back oh absolutely they're putting on a fake fight he put minyad you have in there to
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.920]  be his placeholder so he can come back later and anybody that buys into the fact that these two are
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:51.760]  fighting with each other uh really uh it hasn't done any geopolitical research i think uh michael
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:56.800]  carlione and the godfather says you know you don't think you could fool carlione with that trick
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:02.960]  well it doesn't take a carlione to know what's going on here all right but i i think what's what
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:09.280]  we're seeing is a is a sort of a uh a realignment of these old structures uh i think uh after the
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.080]  collapse i think the collapse of the american empire is a foregone conclusion we're like
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:20.240]  just like the roman empire that sent its legions out to the periphery as roman itself was collapsing
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.680]  it's a fool's errand uh we're we're striking out at libya we're still we're still sending
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.000]  drones into pakistan when their government said stop we're so we don't care what you what you
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.440]  think we're going to continue to do this is these are the death rows of a dying regime and uh and i
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.800]  think uh uh obviously after the collapse we're going to see a major realignment we're going to see
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.120]  new uh regional powers uh being developed sure when in closing great points when do you see this
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.280]  realignment happening it looks like it may even be starting right now uh with reports of standard
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:47:01.520]  and pours downgrading uh and saying that they don't see a good future for our triple a rating
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:05.360]  they're saying that they now have a negative outlook on the triple a rating in the future
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.360]  and there's even reports in washington about uh there's a move to maybe repute repudiate our
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:18.240]  national debt but uh i i think if any any of that happens what if we're junk bond rated uh
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:24.640]  or there's a repudiation uh we're talking about the end end of this uh this party here uh uh
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:30.240]  that's uh been a party for these wealthy fat cats for so many years well they're certainly
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.360]  setting up a police state to try to suppress us they're certainly doing a rearguard action or
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:41.280]  trying to secure their uh their home base and uh the natives here are getting pretty restless
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.320]  well we saw we saw what happened in the state capitals and it's it's very much in line with
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.520]  what i heard from a former obama administration financial advisor in november he said what'll
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:57.680]  happen in the united states won't be like uh grease or spain or or portugal or iceland it'll be
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:05.120]  more state by state and sure enough we're seeing the states uh cutting back uh implementing austerity
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:10.800]  measures and then the people getting out and and uh you know demonstrating uh and man but notice
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.600]  nothing is ever cut from the banksters of the lion's share of the fake debt the republicans won't
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.280]  talk about it democrats won't talk about it nobody will touch the real authors of our problems they
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:26.320]  want to scapegoat it off onto welfare moms and you could throw all of them into a bottomless pit
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.760]  this problem wouldn't even be handled right it's a kabuki dance what we see between paul ryan and
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.800]  barack obama and geithner this is all for uh consumption this is for the sunday morning
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.360]  talking head shows they do get behind closed doors they know what they're doing and they're
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.160]  and you know they they're practicing what i call financial alchemy you know they're trying to make
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.520]  things out of nothing and uh of course we the we the american people are the last ones to know
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.880]  about this uh what goes on behind closed doors but uh all this all this jacking for position
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:01.920]  with john bainer and and and all these other characters you know uh saying you know we're
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.000]  not going to do it look they didn't shut down the government they won't shut down the government
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.640]  they've got a budget it's gonna it's gonna hurt the the people who are really not in a position
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:16.640]  to be hurt anymore than they already are and uh but uh this is the austerity moves that we saw in
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.120]  europe i was told by this obama official who resigned he said i don't want to i'm never gonna
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.920]  give them any more money again he's a financial contributor but he said in the u.s. it's going
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:32.720]  to be a state by state uh uh uprising uh uh and we've certainly seen that happen and have you now
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:38.800]  seen this have you seen this in closing this chilling propaganda on radio tv about how great
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:44.160]  lincoln was and how the feds may have to come in against the states again and and the states have
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.760]  no rights and if the states try to have any power over their lives uh that that that the feds are
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:54.720]  going to deal with them i mean it looks like they are getting the public ready for some type of john
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:01.120]  warner defense authorization act provision with this 10 member governor council uh to to try to
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.560]  come in here and federalize things well success with centennial of the civil war so we have this
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.240]  robert redford movie out now the conspirators it's getting a lot of attention about uh the plot to
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:20.160]  kill lincoln uh but it should be remembered that the conspirators mary surat and the others were
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:27.440]  tried and uh and found guilty by military commissions so we had military commissions
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:33.280]  passing these sentences that sentences against uh civilians what are they trying to tell us
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.240]  it's incredible and at the same time obama's announcing he'll have secret secret commissions

[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:49.120]  for the triple a rating of the dollar the chinese last week announced that they're going to dump even
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.360]  more dollars and cut back what they're buying the federal reserve is now monetizing over 70% of the
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:01.840]  fake debt the bricks nations are announcing that the dollar is going under the Saudis are running
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:07.440]  to the russians and chinese in fear announcing they're going to cut oil production that'll
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:13.840]  increase prices and obama is in the news saying s and p outlook means nothing he says headline
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:21.200]  obama plays down s and p outlook change they have orchestrated all of this and meanwhile
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.000]  george soros is running around saying he's our savior when he's one of the main honchos
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:30.640]  i mean that'd be like if you pulled up to your house and i was on the roof pouring gasoline on
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:36.560]  it and then i lit it jumped off the roof and ran up and said hey aren't you glad i'm helping you
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:41.040]  with your house and and and if you're in a suit or an old man people would bow down and say thank
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:47.360]  you for burning it down because you talk slow and are an old man uh i mean it it's it's just
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:55.120]  incredible to watch it and you have a gullible decadent public begging to be hurt now my listeners
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:59.440]  though are part of the remnant that's awakening the rest of the population and understand what's
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:05.120]  happening but here's the london telegraph we've used silver as gold on steroids silver is better
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.000]  bet than gold in the current precious metals bull run and has been described as gold on steroids
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.720]  by one manager chad with all of this happening i was actually shaken today not in fear just more in a
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:23.760]  adrenaline rush just instinctive awakening when i saw the soddies cutting oil production
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.280]  with the shot across the bow to the globalist they know we're trying to overthrow them
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:35.440]  that oh there's not enough demand and there's too much oil uh and the s and p announcement
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:43.600]  and then geithner saying friday and then again over the weekend on the news shows if you try to not
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.040]  raise the debt ceiling and if you try to cut anything you're going to cause the default
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.280]  when they're the authors of it going back to clinton getting rid of glass teagle
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.720]  and they're the authors of it and the and stanon and poor said they're lowering our outlook
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.840]  because we're going to raise the debt ceiling they believe and because of the debt so they do it
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.440]  out in the open with the gasoline cans and now they tell us if the fire department pulls up and
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:12.960]  tries to put it out that that's going to cause the house to collapse uh ted anerson well i mean
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.040]  there you go you're you're pretty much spelling it out i mean there are actually two major bond
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:22.160]  rating companies here in the united states one is moody's and the other one is standard and
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.960]  pours of course everybody knows who's standard and pours is because they look at the s and p 500
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:34.720]  which is standard and pours 500 index um alex we can't afford the debt that we have right now at
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.840]  the low interest we have i mean they're looking at a government shutdown right now with the that's
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:44.880]  right i should have technically explained this geithner says we need to lose our triple a rating
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:49.360]  that's going to save us because he's an offshore bankster who wants to rob us more and who holds
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:54.720]  the government hostage when we lose a triple i rating it will double our triple on average
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:00.000]  the interest and then we are completely fried and geithner's telling us it's good yeah he might be
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.720]  telling us that it's good but anybody that has anything else interest bearing out there alex
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:10.000]  is going to crush i mean it's going to destroy portfolios in the bond market in the stock market
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.120]  it's going to be people that are sitting in utilities to have interest now geithner is a criminal
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:22.720]  saboteur holding the country hostage and the general public's going to love it look america
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:28.640]  wants to be judged america hates itself for the 50 million abortions and should and so don't worry
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:34.400]  god is going to let demonic little sniveling elves like geithner literally eat your guts out of your

[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:59.760]  destroy the dollar by design they will then jump around and blame just like smooth hauling we were
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:05.920]  already in depression and they blamed some tariffs after the fact on the depression they'll probably
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.880]  blame the second amendment for the depression they've engineered ted anderson this is big medicine

[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:26.480]  of whoa shaking in in anticipation that it's now arriving it's now happening i mean the geopolitical
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:31.920]  ramifications of this are earth shattering and the average yuppie i talked to says i don't care

[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:48.480]  cardiac arrest and people that say well don't worry it'll cause some more factories to get
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:54.880]  built here yeah after years into the depression it may cause some actual factories but it's a global
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.720]  depression because of global fiat currency coordinated evaluations by the coterie of
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:09.840]  scam artist international bankers with their derivatives fractional reserved poppycock and
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.480]  so it's a global depression then they'll offer their new world government and all these new
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:20.960]  taxes as the solution and most the dumb yuppies led by people like you know the scammer donald

[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.480]  silver is money in the first place the united states is in trouble with this one this is a big
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.960]  big deal and uh to raise the interest rates and to cause the deficit to grow even further because

[02:09:53.280 --> 02:10:02.080]  that's uh bigger than the gdp of most big countries and the cpas have been bought off
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.560]  the federal laws have changed where they're creatures of the irs and so they won't even give
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:11.440]  you your regular write-offs if you don't have a top cpa doing your taxes then they audit you
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.320]  and come after you for stuff that's supposedly able to be written off real tax rate in this country
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:22.320]  is about 45 income tax and there's all the other federal taxes the gas taxes the state taxes the
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:28.880]  income the state income taxes the average american is paying around 50 that's the people you hear in

[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.040]  but you pay it in what everybody passes on to you but you're paying all those other taxes
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:47.280]  people that are paying income taxes oh you're talking 60 70 80 but the ultra rich are completely
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:55.840]  immune and pay almost no tax overseas just like general electric google pay zero or 2.4
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:03.360]  and they're the ones lobbying for the new taxes on you direct taxes like the insurance companies
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.840]  writing the health care law to lower the quality of care to not let doctors practice medicine
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:13.840]  and to force you to get their product and then if you're an insider you pay a payment and it's waived
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:20.880]  I mean that is the greatest form of economic discrimination you can imagine but see we're
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:26.320]  only trained that discrimination is calling somebody a name but real discrimination is
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.960]  unfair playing field and so don't worry blue collar people out there losing your jobs if you
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.880]  really think taking the rich people's money is going to fix things they've done the math on it
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:41.360]  it would pay for three and a half months of the budget if you took all the wealth inside the US
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.960]  of three and a half months but the republicans are putting that number out it's true to a point
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.960]  and we're going back to Ted briefly then your calls here's the big line they're not counting
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:57.520]  the three to four times the wealth of us money offshore that's exempt through the loopholes
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:02.000]  they're not talking about that and they're not talking about the banker bailout money
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.640]  that's in the tens of trillions they're talking about domestic money I mean I heard you people on
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.000]  CNN yesterday going yeah we need to tax these other other you know tv anchors that are making
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.880]  a million bucks a year yeah that'll fix it yeah take all the baseball people money all the movie
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.760]  stars all the guy that owns a car wash down the street or a chain of restaurants the other guy
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:29.360]  living in a big mansion those are nouveau riche they're the blood of a country they buy things
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:35.040]  they spend their money these multi-billionaire globalists that control trillions and assets
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:40.960]  they're all like Scrooge McDuck they want to wreck economies folks get more sophisticated
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:46.160]  or I'm gonna stop ranting because I want to get to Larry JJ Damon chip Skyler and others
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.480]  but going back to Ted Anderson Ted I wanted to get you on and then only had you off about
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:56.720]  a minute because I was ranting I want to put on screen here for people Forbes and this itself
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:03.280]  is a deception the permanent fund that ut has I started looking at it 15 years ago was about
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.880]  30 billion then 50 billion then 80 billion last time I looked not their assets their oil fields
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:15.760]  their land the tax money they get not their pension areas but the actual liquid separate
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:22.080]  cash is over 100 billion bucks richest university in the world now they just raised tuition
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.320]  they're raising parking fees everything because the school is a facade I'm sorry for folks that
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.360]  have been conned by just admit you've been conned the big stadium and all that's a facade that's
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.840]  only a few percentage points of their real business models they're an inside tax-free
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.400]  organization just like all the other globalist ops that's why they promote world government
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.600]  in this whole system they just bought a billion on top of hundreds of millions they bought I
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:53.840]  saw last year we'll put it back on screen Forbes University of Texas endowment holds one billion
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.280]  in gold or five percent of its portfolio they got a lot more than 20 billion bucks but the issue
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.560]  here is what are they doing with that their permanent fund now expanding on that China's
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.480]  buying gold everybody else is buying gold they've been trying to suppress the paper market I've
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:15.520]  gone through this whole rant I want to go to calls but dead briefly we saw gold go way up again
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.800]  today before retreating a little bit still back over $7 tell us where silver is and then briefly
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:24.480]  because you buy it when it's lower but then it sells out as it keeps going up you've got
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:28.560]  gold and silver at the lower price from when it was lower folks can get in a time machine
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:34.240]  but they've got to call you and get involved now and do what the gangsters that run UT and what
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:40.720]  Muammar Gaddafi knows and what all these people know gold and silver is the king even a Soros
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.840]  admitted the world is moving away from the dollar with oil gold and silver already operating as the
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:51.520]  new world reserve currency beating the dollar Ted Anderson yeah well you're right about that I mean
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:57.440]  people that have half a brain can figure out that the United States is printing way way way too much
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:05.040]  money to and and we're inflating the the monetary system by so much that you have to diversify
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:10.000]  yourself with gold and silver it's not even a choice anymore that's why you're seeing major
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.520]  countries doing this and it doesn't surprise me a bit to see some of the big portfolios out there
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:20.480]  doing it and the small people should be doing it too and they are you know a lot of people are
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.440]  ordering your videos right now in books and that kind of stuff and getting free silver dollars with
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.120]  them or however that's right you get three silver dollars well that's that's over a hundred and
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:35.520]  twenty dollar value you know the lowest prices free shipping and three films obama deception
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:42.080]  fall the republican game of sixty dollar value so that's basically 70 plus dollars off and you're
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:47.680]  getting the silver dollars at a price nobody else can offer now those were 110 they went to 115
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:53.280]  where are they now Ted still holding about 115 even though silver's up a bunch more um they'll
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:59.280]  have to go up and I I'm just it Alex I don't want to raise the price I I can lose money for a while
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.840]  I want to get your videos out of people's hands get people to pass them out get some silver into
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:09.680]  people's hands too I mean if people can't knows that once because he's a free market capitalist
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:14.800]  not an inside baseball guy like Soros he actually lives in the real free market and and and placed
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.920]  by the tilted deck Ted knows once you hold golden silver in your paw you're going to realize that
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:26.080]  paper is garbage the physical is king and so this is a lost leader the complaining and moaning by
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:29.760]  the brokers and I don't blame them they don't make any money on this even the tiny amount that they
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:34.160]  normally do on the other great deals but but Ted what are some of the other golden silver deals
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.440]  because silver's great they're calling what do they call silver in the London Telegraph today
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.360]  they call it gold on steroids yeah gold on steroids but what are some of the other silver
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.440]  offers that are smoking and gold offers you've got because when folks call the regular deals are
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.240]  great but these are the specific awesome deals yeah well for instance like the walking liberty
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:17:00.400]  half dollar right now 20 and 61 cents we also have the survival bags of dimes Alex it's 32 now
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:07.840]  32 regular dimes that you carry in your pocket equals one pre 1964 dime which means that the
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:14.080]  silver price has gone up so much that it all takes 32 dimes to buy one and that number keeps on
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:20.320]  growing about six months ago it was 26 dimes to buy one so that's where it's going the trend
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.040]  isn't changing there's so many good buys out there right now Alice I just think the survival
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:30.320]  bag of dimes people need to have stuff that they can use for barter I don't think people realize
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  that we're we're heading toward the kind of collision that could bring our entire society down
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:42.880]  and just to the effort to buy food like they had back in the German Weimar Republic is just going
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:47.520]  to be you know you bring in a wheelbarrow full of currency and the grocer is going to want the
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:52.880]  wheelbarrow that's why I'm freaked out I've studied history you studied it in every case when you get
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:58.080]  to this point or even close it ends up in total battle and total depression and where they're
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.120]  just easing it into it but using propaganda to make most folks not know why they're not doing
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:07.520]  well and make them feel like they're by themselves and that everybody else is doing great this is a
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.240]  giant deception and the best bet out there and nothing's a silver bullet but the closest you
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.240]  get to a silver bullet for economic problems is gold and silver and silver is the you know
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:25.760]  poor man's gold and it's turning out to be a better investment overall 800 686 2237
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:32.880]  800 686 2237 folks that's why I'm so freaked out every day I wish I was wrong
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:36.720]  every day I wish the globalists weren't doing this every day I want to be proven wrong but
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:42.320]  we're not this is by design and the slime bag crooks are doing this to us and they don't want
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:47.680]  you to have silver and gold because they're busy buying it all up for themselves 800 686
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:52.320]  2237 Ted thanks for spending time with us yeah thanks for having me up Alex and you know what if
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:56.320]  people buy these videos you might eat for three weeks your whole family because you have three
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.480]  silver dollars I mean you can't beat it well I mean look at how much money people have made by
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:05.360]  getting these and and whatever the coin of the realm is in the future this just freezes the inflation
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:09.920]  that you cash it in for whenever you're ready for whatever the other currency is but more and more
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:14.320]  the elites are saying it's going to be gold and silver because they've done concerted global
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.760]  devaluation they're going to have this new global sdr bandcore this is all announced that's
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:24.160]  partially gold and silver backed well if it's partially gold and silver backed and it's going
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.520]  to be the new coin of the realm imagine what the real backing system is going to be worth Ted thank
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:34.080]  you so much yeah thanks for having me up Alex and folks when I talk about hordes of people
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.720]  under government control robbing the middle class that's what the globalist plan to do

[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.160]  weapon against the middle class saying get the rich man and the bankers will sit offshore laughing

[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:49.840]  can't it's a total sick joke so we're going to be going over that more on the 431 billion now
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:55.840]  a year that america spend on cpa's she only in america do they make a Byzantine tax system you
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:00.880]  can't figure out paid to the private federal reserve if you go to 30 cpa's you'll get 30 different
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:06.880]  answers and in the last five years they put all the cpa's under new federal regulations where
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:12.160]  they're liable not just use so they won't give you any of the exemptions and basically just
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:17.360]  hand all your money over to the irs and if you don't pay them to do this then the irs will come
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:22.560]  out at you and make stuff up and pay for the federal reserve all right i said i get to that later
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:35.200]  431 billion dollars that's quite a payoff to this criminal class see the globalist are masters
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:42.080]  at helping people make money out of crime out of fraud just like the banksters openly gave the word
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:50.160]  for the realtors and the appraisers to have people lie on their forms
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.800]  it's all a system of fraud and it benefits the globalist not you or i larry in michigan
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:06.800]  than jj damon chipp skyler and others you're on the air larry good to talk to you yeah good to
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:12.960]  talk to you alex a couple things i'll try to be quick i know you're awful busy but i'd like to see
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:19.920]  you do uh expose on the southern poverty law center i mean what's to know i mean that's a
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.760]  completely anti-american anti-free speech deceptive pathetic group that says that if you have silver or
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:32.800]  gold you know at your own uh you know company that that that that you create it's totally legal uh
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:38.800]  that you're a terrorist i mean i mean these people are basically the soviet red army well yeah and
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:44.880]  you know years ago i guess that guy that runs that uh was in some kind of devious sexual deal too
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:51.680]  you know well that is that is in his divorce uh and but for me that's not even the issue uh
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:59.360]  uh the issue is it came out in lawsuits where the fbi released one document blacked out part of it
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.520]  and then the lawsuits years later in another state they released the same document with the other
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:11.280]  area blacked out so uh the lawyer that was involved jesse trying to do could combine the two and find
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.200]  out what was going on and it was the fbi atf and southern poverty law center running elaheem city
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:23.040]  not infiltrating the white supremacist running it and when uh well carol howe one of their informants
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:27.440]  tried to expose the plan to go ahead with the bombing they indicted her and uh you know the
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:33.440]  rest of the story so i mean they're look they're a very sinister organization okay number two point
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:39.440]  uh you know i remember years ago i'm old enough uh i remember john kennedy being on television
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:45.680]  saying it is essential to the security of the united states that we drill for oil in alaska
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:53.360]  and we spent billions of dollars putting a pipeline up there and 85 percent of that goes to japan
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:59.040]  that's right because everything is a rigged game we live in an engineered society globally
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:06.000]  they have standardized rules on light bulb wattage the toilet sizes it's all on tobacco rules
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.560]  and everything's been standardized and you tell the average yuppie hey there's a global infrastructure
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:16.160]  global standardization that's admitted they go no there's not no one's in power over me
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.760]  there's nothing going on and when it's all admitted and it's global standardization
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:31.360]  by a group of abject criminals well i agree with you um you know but you you when you listen to the
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.480]  media on tv you know that nothing like that will ever come out you know
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.920]  well more and more it comes out they go hey we're looking at studies to put

[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:22.800]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:28.240]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:33.600]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:38.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.640]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power

[02:32:54.480 --> 02:33:10.400]  go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:30.160]  she said i've had a coming to me but i wanted it that way
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:38.400]  i think that any of us could love it so i took what i could get
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:52.560]  yeah you ain't seen nothing yet and that's a double-edged sword
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:58.800]  you ain't seen nothing yet from the globalist and you ain't seen nothing yet from the american
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:04.480]  people and free humanity worldwide we did our job to expose them while they were positioning
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.680]  this thing and getting it ready and and and stealing from us and now they're making their big move
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.760]  and they think they've got the momentum and the power of the corporate media they don't
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:21.360]  i mean look at this fox news headline treasury sticks to us economy outlook despite s and p's
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:28.880]  negative outlook so the treasury is sticking by saying the economy's great despite staring
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:33.680]  in poor's negative outlook saying that they believe the us is going to lose this triple A rating
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:39.600]  which will then pay geithner and the roth childs and the rock of fellers and george soros more money
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:46.320]  what did soros say last week he came out and he said oh uh america can take on more debt
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.960]  we need to raise taxes what does the fellow reserve every time i turn around we need to
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:58.640]  raise taxes oh yes we need to raise taxes on the rich they mean your neighbor making a quarter
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:05.040]  mill a year not their money tax free offshore again i will continue to repeat this
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:12.640]  i will continue like a broken record because when the public is starting to get it i heard
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:18.960]  michael savage talking about the ultra rich creating socialism to rob the people versus
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:25.520]  the new barish i've heard other local hosts now doing it and finally they're getting it
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.760]  if we get this out there liberals will wake up conservatives will wake up game over
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:40.320]  mainline republicans are let's take all the money away from anybody that makes over 125
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:45.680]  thousand individually quarter million a couple that's the rich and the poor liberals you know
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:51.040]  making 30 000 a year or whatever they're like okay take it from them you could take all their money
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:56.000]  and you would only run the country for three and a half months now the republicans tell the truth on
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.880]  that front but they don't talk about the quadrillions in fake derivatives they don't talk about the tens
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:07.680]  of trillions we've paid to back it up they don't talk about devos three months ago calling for 100
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:17.120]  trillion more of western world's tax money and so it's very simple and that's why i get so frustrated
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:22.320]  and and sometimes people think i'm exaggerating or i'm saying something that sounds wild i rarely
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:28.880]  exaggerate generally when things come out later it's worse than what i said like a few weeks ago i
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:37.760]  said that taxes cost 50 billion a year to file turns out that my memory failed i looked it up
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:44.560]  this morning and i was wrong it was 50 billion a year just for texans to file income taxes
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:50.720]  in an actuary that was done last year it's now nationwide 431 billion the federal government
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:56.000]  the commerce department admit that's in an article today called the 30 cent tax premium
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:04.480]  wall street journal not 50 billion see sometimes even my brain i'm going your calls
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:11.600]  cannot get around these numbers nine times out of 10 folks it's worse than what i'm saying do you get me
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:18.240]  when i tell you the so-called liberals that run this country literally want red terror
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:23.920]  reeducation camps that's what they promote and the republicans are getting conservatives to buy
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.520]  into it thinking it's for the strong man of the overseas muslim the whole thing was set up from
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:35.920]  the beginning for the american people and now it's all admitted it's for gun owners libertarians
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:42.160]  landowners returning veterans get it through your head treason came to america look if you got on a
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:48.640]  plane walked on board saw the captain copilot get you know they take off suddenly guys jump up
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:54.480]  say they're hijacking the plane uh they put on the captain's uniforms do you then salute them and
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:38:01.120]  believe it they're the real captain no the people running this country have taken it over and hijacked
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:08.240]  it they're illegitimate they're crooks to cops and military you better get that through your head
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:13.200]  and it's not just obama all right i'm going to your calls it's just that to simplify this
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:20.720]  tim geithner wants us bankrupt they want us to lose our credit rating they want to damage the
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:26.160]  dollar so they can launch the new global bandcore currency that's digital that controls all the other
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:32.320]  currencies they admit this just two weeks ago at the last meeting at breton woods too and in all
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:37.760]  their reports two years ago geithner at an economic conference said they're looking at how to get
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:44.560]  rid of the dollar their traders they get power while they leveraged out the dollar now they're
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:50.480]  going to get power on the other side of it they're ruthless they play both sides or all three or four
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:58.720]  sides people always ask what i'm drinking in these green bottles it's topochico mineral water from
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:04.400]  mexico with a twist of line people think i'm drinking beer on air this is uh this is topochico
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:11.200]  ladies and gentlemen whatever i'm done ranting it's just to see him say if anybody doesn't raise
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:17.600]  the debt ceiling or if you don't increase taxes you're going to cause a default they already
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:23.440]  defaulted the vast majority of the treasury bills are not being bought the soddies are
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:28.080]  cutting output they're openly saying they're being cheated like we told you six months ago
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:35.760]  it's begun it's begun and i cannot watch these criminals on tv the willing whores in the mainstream
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:42.880]  media selling us out anymore i'm not a hero for telling the truth i've got survival instinct
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:47.840]  luke dobs isn't a hero he's a smart economic guy of course he tells you the same thing i'm telling
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:54.720]  you ron paul is telling you the same thing it's true it's facts we know what's going on it's ridiculous
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:01.680]  it's like watching cops give an armed escort to bank robbers of course i'm hopping mad i'm done with it
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:08.960]  and then the bank robbers have a pr firm that goes around demonizing those of us that know
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.120]  what's really going on all right i'm done i'm done i'm done nothing but calls till the end
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:22.240]  damon in south carolina you're on the air then jay jay go ahead damon thanks for taking my call
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:26.480]  alex i got back from the former soviet union republica bella roose about a month ago after
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:32.320]  visiting with my wife's family over there my wife this explosion that took place last week i found
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:36.880]  it very interesting i read an article that uh you know lucas sankos managed to keep his debt
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:41.840]  situation under control for the longest time and then all of a sudden now he's taken a multi
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:46.800]  billion dollar loan from russia and uh very curious that uh he didn't go to the imf or the
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:52.160]  world bank so the george soros is for his money he went to russia well why do you think liby is
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:57.920]  getting overthrown he buys gold he made a deal to be peaceful so they send an al-qaeda to overthrow
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:03.360]  the country yep so they go in and blow up a subway station kill a bunch of people wound countless others
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:07.840]  and make them all think that it's like some opposition party to the president
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:14.560]  well i i've looked some into that and you know we're not completely sure it couldn't have been
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:20.400]  the government forces that did that too i'd say from studying at eight nine times out of ten
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.840]  terror attacks are usually whoever's in power from hitler firebombing the rice tag to starting
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:33.680]  world war two with poland attacking his own military base at gliwitz but uh the globalist uh do fund
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:39.920]  some of the muslim extremist groups in the caucuses to basically try to destabilize the region
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:45.360]  and so it could be that as well well the thing is lucas sanko won like 80 of the vote last uh
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.480]  year in the winter time and which was ridiculous but um changing from subject quickly cleaning
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  other people on the college for sure one thing i live in south carolina florid south carolina
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:59.600]  we have a sheriff here who is a federalized goon who has all his boys come out and do uh
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:05.440]  illegal unconstitutional checkpoints all over the county every week i've gotten three of them
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:11.040]  in the last two months and it is ridiculous well the state had to pass a law and courts ruled in
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:17.440]  texas they couldn't do it but up until 11 years ago when they stopped doing it i ran into three
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.920]  or four checkpoints and the cops pulled me over and want to search my car and i'm like this is
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:28.080]  illegal and no i don't use your products leave me alone and they said get out we're searching it
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:31.360]  and i said okay i'm going to sue you all individually and they said all right get back in your car and
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.920]  go cops you are destroying america you're not stopping drugs they're shipped in by the government
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:44.640]  and now the state of texas is getting federal lobbying money to put in dwi checkpoints that's
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:49.840]  just their nose under the tent flap we do not need checkpoints here the only place you can have
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.480]  checkpoints is on the border and now it's come out what we already knew last month that obama
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:01.120]  orders the border patrol to not arrest illegals except for small quota times for photo ops well
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:06.560]  i already know that i mean i've been run into buying illegal alien what was it 10 years ago
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:11.840]  and when the cops came the cops said oh i didn't have any id uh you got insurance just pay for it
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:16.960]  if i ran into somebody didn't have insurance i'll guarantee i'd at least get a ticket i mean that's
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.520]  what i'm tired of i'm tired because the cops follow their orders and the system wants the
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:26.960]  illegals here when i got pulled over on friday night the deputy sheriff he was like license i'm
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:31.200]  like what's this about he's like license registration check so i gave it to him and he looked at me
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.640]  he's like you upset i had the wife and kids in the car and i was going to go off on him about
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.560]  this being a constitutional whatnot but i didn't need him make an example out of me in front of
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:41.200]  my wife and kids but i'll tell you what we're getting out of here i don't know where we're
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.240]  going to go but this is a ridiculous man they had a dozen deputy sheriffs just standing in the middle
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:49.760]  of one of the main roads they're pulling people over and the majority of people they're pulling
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:54.960]  over all like oh thanks for keeping us safe now the tsa this is an angle i hadn't covered
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.640]  all over the country they're not just running checkpoints they'll have one tsa agent or two or
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:05.840]  three training the local mjtf multiple jurisdiction goon force again training us to
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:10.240]  they're universalizing the police codes under federal control they're mixing them all together
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:16.960]  under threat fusion centers and and and the big angle here is tsa is going out and training police
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:25.680]  to start the groping so next oh and to take blood i forgot that part and so what's happening here is
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:31.200]  they are turning them into a federal goon force and all i could say is go to the county commissioners
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:36.640]  go to the city council complain about it follow lawsuit you know i never told this story because
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:44.800]  i wanted to see what was going to happen afterwards uh you know obviously uh i did go through a border
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:52.880]  uh and they were of a another country with my family and they and without telling me suddenly
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:59.440]  my daughter was being groped and i completely blew up started screaming in a total commander voice
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:05.200]  but i mean only the real you never heard it on the radio folks i mean just like the it was
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:11.760]  it and and they had like 20 security people and i basically stood there and and and you know climbed
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:15.840]  up on the chair and told them how it was and then walked right through but the point is i cannot
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.360]  travel now because because they didn't tell me they were doing all of a sudden they were grabbing
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:23.760]  one of my daughters and it was just boom it was over and then that's what i'm telling you
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:31.120]  is i can't handle it anymore and and and i want to travel i want to go places i can't because i
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:38.320]  can't do it i've still got enough basic instinct to not allow that i appreciate your call oh finish
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.280]  up uh damon so so he kind of noticing your eyes you weren't loving the tyranny enough and he said
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:50.720]  you got a problem there boy what did he say to you damon he said basically he was like you
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:55.520]  have said about something and i was like yeah i am and then he was like what's it about and i just
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:59.760]  let it go because i knew i mean he had 11 goons back in a moment don't worry the bankers are
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:04.160]  going to take everything he's got and the the government's poisoning his kids and he loves it
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:08.240]  you know what stinks alex is that i call my representative chris crawford who's a representative
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:13.440]  florins and philip love who's also the representative from that area and they came back to me and
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:19.040]  we're like he kenny boon the sheriff whatever he gets off the people you know if he gets a legal
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.920]  traffic stop or you know finds drug money so he gets to keep 50 so he's helped keeping your taxes
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:29.840]  down by running those checkpoints that's the that's the state representatives in columbia south
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:34.400]  carolina chris crawford philip love that's what their comeback is on this they they don't even see
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:40.160]  that it's unconstitutional violating the rights of the people oh they all know look every real cop
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:46.320]  i've talked to and i'm talking i've talked to old uh famous detectives and la and people they all
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.560]  know 9 11's an inside job they all know who ships the drugs and the government's been caught hundreds
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:56.240]  of times it's just a complete joke it's their chicken feed like a deer feeder they put out
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:01.120]  as an excuse to have open season on everybody i appreciate your call jj in new jersey you're on

[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:12.240]  i'm getting tired of it i hear you i hear you and i was just thinking you're talking about the tsa the
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:19.280]  police um agents and the ordered police um you know turning into tsa agents i'm just wondering
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:24.960]  about all the layoffs now i'm in new jersey and they're having you know seven layoffs in my town and
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:31.920]  paterson 120 newark at all bunch and camden i mean the crimes were the crimes weigh up but yet

[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:43.520]  officers into tsa agents just what your thoughts on that no they they're already uh most sheriff's
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:50.880]  departments have deputized their people's auxiliary batf gun grabbers uh the uh they're all over the
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:58.640]  country training local police in gropings and i was wondering i was watching jesse ventured
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:05.120]  the conspiracy theory a couple episodes that 2012 episode and the draining the great lakes i don't
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.840]  know if you've seen those episodes yeah i've seen them okay and he's talking about the underground
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:15.920]  bunkers and then as far as the water being in new uh new blue oil i just was wondering what your
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.880]  thoughts and all that are well i mean i've seen the water episode i'm in it um it's the water
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:27.600]  episode is totally accurate the 2012 is accurate about the government cog bunkers but uh it's
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:32.880]  speculation about what's going to happen in 2012 i don't think anything but financial meltdown uh
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.640]  i don't know about comments and earthquakes though that started maybe i'm wrong maybe the
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:41.840]  minds do something i just go off what i can prove but um that's powerful info i appreciate your
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:47.440]  calls yeah jay let's talk to chip and washington chip you're on the air how you doing sir i'm all
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.000]  right i've been a listener for about 10 years about after 9 11 i knew something wasn't right so
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.360]  i found you doing research i'm a listen to you every day ever since i want to thank you for
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:59.680]  everything you've done i'm a veteran and i live up here in seattle and it's hard to wake people up
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.120]  because they're all on the trance but anyway i have two important issues i'd like to talk about
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:08.320]  uh one of them being uh mature kaku i don't know if you've ever heard of him he co-founded the string
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:14.000]  theory yes i know yes he's a physicist yeah so anyway i found one of his videos a couple weeks
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.560]  ago and i've been trying to get through to talk to you about it um he talks about how when they
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:23.040]  look in outer space we're looking for different types of civilizations tier one tier two tier three
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:27.680]  and they said that within 100 years we'll be able to go to the next tier but to do that they have
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:32.720]  to be able to get all the resources in the world funnel in the one place um if you youtube it it's
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.760]  mature kaku talks about a new world order it's about four minutes and 48 seconds long yeah we
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:45.120]  need to play that i've seen it uh yeah i've seen it also a video from fox last week where they say
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:50.960]  the tsa's got to put their hands down our pants for a new world order and and i've also got another
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:56.080]  one uh where the the physicists are saying we've got to get rid of the general public that are
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:01.280]  basically maggots is the term they use so we can go to the next human level that's what all the
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:07.440]  transhumanist leaders the modern eugenicists say is that they've got to get rid of us before they go
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:11.840]  to the next level right and you know when it gets to the when it gets to the part where he says that
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:15.680]  we're the terrorist because we're the ones that believe in 9 11 we're the ones keeping them from
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:21.200]  going to tier one it it kind of hit me hard i'm like i'm a marine coveteran how am i a terrorist
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:26.800]  but when i watched that video it made perfect sense sir they say they are the enlightened ones
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:31.520]  the fact that they're able to get the scam over means that we deserve to be killed this is their
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:36.000]  religion all they talk about is the one world government and then they're going to release
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.280]  the bio weapons and kill almost everybody i mean that's their stated goal and the new york
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:46.000]  magazine makes a joke out of it even though i can source every bit of it that's what i'm telling you
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.400]  sir that once they've got this kill grid in place they're going to gas us like cockroaches do you
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:54.880]  understand that oh i believe it i believe i got one other point real quick i'd stay there we're

[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:23.200]  to get off into all this there are near earth collisions there are collisions with the earth
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:29.280]  but a planet or even a big comment sir there's so many amateur astronomers they're usually the ones
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:35.680]  that find tiny asteroids and things they're the ones that find new stuff in the kuiper belt i i i
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:42.000]  i just i heard all this in 2000 2001 i just don't put a lot of stock in it uh you know that that
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.440]  there's something hidden but i appreciate your call chip and we just talked to chip schuyler
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:53.440]  in texas you're on the air hey alex pleasure talking with you the silver dollar i got for

[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:09.360]  like making money but i'm visiting from california here in austin i promise we will i won't mess up
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:16.960]  the place hey you're welcome here you've done a great job identifying the ground floor of the
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:22.400]  capstone on the illuminati pyramid and my research into the identity of the eye of the capstone
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.960]  leads to organized religion in rome and i was shocked to find out that the symbols of roman
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.160]  fascism are displayed in the halls of congress on capitol hill right behind the podium where the
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:37.200]  speaker resides that's true that well the fasci the fasci the bundled sticks meaning the people
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:44.240]  as slaves with the ax heads the hatchets on top uh has been put in the u.s senate uh more than 50 years
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:50.480]  ago and uh it is true that the you know the roman catholic church was involved helping set up the
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:55.280]  euro and there's no doubt is part of the new world order but from my research all the major
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:00.000]  religious institutions have basically joined with the new world order or joined with sauron
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:04.880]  now you've had guests like to hoard Maxwell on your show discussing this but not often and i'm
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:10.000]  curious do you consider this like aliens and flying softers they can't really be proven it's
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:16.160]  kind of no i just no no i i i have always covered the vatican and when the different
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.720]  popes have called for a new world order and things it's just that i try to not get into a bash fest
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:26.240]  of catholics or protestants or jews or muslims uh you know it's like the muslim brotherhood is
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:29.920]  british intelligence but i'm not trying to have a fight with all muslims and there are a lot of
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:35.200]  great catholics i know and and and and then also some of the people that bash catholics all day
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:39.920]  they say catholics are the only part of the new world order and then they lie and say you know
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:45.440]  i'm catholic and all this stuff which wouldn't be overall bad if i was but i'm a protestant
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.560]  and come from a famous protestant texas family uh you know who raised colonel travis his son
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.680]  i mean it's all on record my family came here as part of protestant proselytizers on both sides
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.600]  that's what most of the texans uh came here for and and so you know i i i do know the catholic
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:07.120]  church is involved in a lot of corrupt things it's just that i don't i don't then especially when i
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:13.360]  get attacked by kind of the catholics are evil cult and they lie about me then sometimes i almost
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:18.800]  even shy away because i don't like to be made you know to obsess on things and and and talk about
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:22.720]  things of people you know we're driving it all the time it's the same thing with israel i mean
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:27.680]  israel has very corrupt globalist leadership and i'm against what they're doing but at the
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:32.560]  same time i don't hate jews you see what i'm saying and most of the white supremacist groups are fed
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:37.520]  run and that's come out so it's it's like i'm just here about basic ideas of liberty and freedom
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:40.640]  whoever's running it we can then deal with them we'll be right back with more calls

[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:03.760]  with you many years ago in austin texas at the protest at the department of public safety
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:10.880]  uh driver's license office on lamar that was 14 years ago yes sir and i was very proud to be there
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:17.520]  and i'm still here uh anyway i'm up in north texas now i want to uh let people know what's
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:25.680]  going on up here uh you're probably aware of it but uh all up and down 377 and uh on 35 they have
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:33.040]  done it right up here near argyle and vinton which is where i'm at uh they have like these generators
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:41.440]  sitting next to highway points with big spotlights on them uh they have police officers uh in both
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:49.040]  marked and unmarked vehicles from all different towns they're also putting cable dividers down
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.160]  all the highways so you can't get off the road and go the opposite direction and it's all and
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:59.680]  they're using the new highway funds to put in a federal police force lock down grid uh for
[03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:07.520]  the blockading of cities that's actually admitted yes and they are they brought in more of these uh
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:14.560]  highway uh so-called dividers and they are soft piling them in different uh little island areas
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:22.560]  between the uh intersections of the highways uh they've been pulling people over uh once in a while
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:28.640]  one of the officers we were coming back from the grocery store or not and stepped right in front of
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:36.560]  us and i didn't stop i went around it and now they're sitting down there uh on and off they stopped
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:41.920]  recently but what i thought was very interesting that these were police officers from all these
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:49.280]  different little towns no no it's mj tf going under threat fusion centers and all over the country
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:55.440]  they're announcing that officers won't respond to well in one case of oakland 34 crimes including
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:00.320]  burglary and things like that that they're only going to focus on raising money and now i've never
[03:03:00.320 --> 03:03:06.560]  seen so many cops writing tickets in austin it's a time of great great merriment and they lie to
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:11.200]  the cops and say budgets are down we got to do this to you know get money in all that money
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:15.760]  goes offshore no amount of squeezing is going to save america cops but you'll find out it doesn't
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:25.120]  matter one other thing we'll attach on uh mr jones is uh regarding churches uh i am um
