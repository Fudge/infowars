[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:34.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.240 --> 00:42.600]  this happens sometimes a piece of information comes out that is so important
[00:42.600 --> 00:51.520]  so powerful that I am unable to even address it on air because I don't feel
[00:51.520 --> 00:58.160]  competent to be able to cover every facet and nuance of it and fully get
[00:58.160 --> 01:07.880]  across to you just how devastatingly evil it is I was unable to sleep last
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.800]  night neither was Aaron Dykes he stayed up all night long to put together what
[01:12.800 --> 01:20.120]  we're gonna premiere here on the radio and at prison planet TV in 32 minutes
[01:20.120 --> 01:27.440]  from now but I have had no sleep I'm not complaining I'm a little bit dingy
[01:27.440 --> 01:34.600]  sometimes things like this get me so wound up and so upset that I want I'm
[01:34.600 --> 01:44.840]  unable to sleep and all of the news I have in front of me symbolizes ramifications
[01:44.840 --> 01:53.080]  that are so important to the future of our species and bottom line I just don't
[01:53.080 --> 01:56.880]  want the bad things that are happening and that are going to happen to our
[01:56.880 --> 02:04.560]  species to unfold I genuinely care about people I genuinely care about myself I
[02:04.560 --> 02:09.640]  see the best in people but I also see the worst see one-dimensional thinking
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.680]  would be oh he sees the glass is half empty or half full now I see it as half
[02:13.680 --> 02:25.680]  empty and half full and of course all of us see it as both ways as well but we're
[02:25.680 --> 02:33.520]  taught to see things at a very limited level and that's the great crime in this
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.080]  giant social engineering experiment is that the globalists have stated that
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.600]  they're attempting to dumb us down to limit people's horizons to clutter the
[02:43.600 --> 02:49.000]  educational process where people become just frustrated and stunted it's all a
[02:49.000 --> 02:58.920]  direct program a blueprint and the more I learn about it the more fundamentally
[02:58.920 --> 03:09.400]  freaked out I get and the more disgusted with the new world order I get and the
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.960]  more determined I am that we beat these people and we beat them starting at home
[03:13.960 --> 03:19.880]  with ourselves because we're all human and we all have faults but the globalist
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.400]  at the top understand how humans operate they study human behavior and they use
[03:25.400 --> 03:30.600]  all that information to make us as weak and pathetic as possible so that we're
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.800]  not in the game of life so that we're not on the field so that we can just be
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.960]  run over and in the process the globalist even though they try to stay
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.800]  sequestered from the general public through classism and statism and
[03:44.800 --> 03:52.200]  snobbery they're hurting themselves as well because what comes around goes
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.880]  around there is such a thing as you reap what you sow I don't believe in some
[03:55.880 --> 04:02.280]  type of spiritual you know magic karma but but certainly the concept of karma
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.960]  itself is absolutely true you reap what you sow what you do goes out into the
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.640]  world and bounces back on to you I do know though in the spiritual fundamentals
[04:14.640 --> 04:19.520]  of you reap what you sow that is what the seeds you throw out onto the dirt
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.440]  well that's the type of plants you get back you must judge a tree by its fruits
[04:24.440 --> 04:32.080]  and we worked on this video Aaron worked on it all night long I was up all
[04:32.080 --> 04:39.800]  night doing research and now here I am it's almost a form of self medicating
[04:39.800 --> 04:47.680]  to not sleep sometimes and get exhausted because then the pain and anguish that
[04:47.680 --> 04:55.720]  you have it isn't as painful because you're dulled by the exhaustion but we've
[04:55.720 --> 05:01.280]  got very special information coming up stay with us folks you've heard us talk

[06:02.680 --> 06:07.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.040 --> 06:11.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.200 --> 06:15.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.240 --> 06:19.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.120 --> 06:23.320]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.320 --> 06:27.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.640 --> 06:31.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.840]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.800]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[06:42.800 --> 06:46.840]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[06:59.880 --> 07:04.880]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[07:04.880 --> 07:09.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.420]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[07:13.420 --> 07:18.080]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[07:18.080 --> 07:22.680]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[07:22.680 --> 07:27.040]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.320]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[07:32.320 --> 07:36.640]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[07:36.640 --> 07:40.120]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[07:40.120 --> 07:45.360]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[07:45.360 --> 07:51.040]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.440]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[07:56.440 --> 08:20.200]  prisonplanet.tv he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:20.200 --> 08:27.800]  we are live it is the eighth day of February 2011 thank you for joining us
[08:27.800 --> 08:33.280]  on this live Tuesday edition the last hour of the broadcast the son of Jesse
[08:33.280 --> 08:39.400]  Ventura filmmaker and TV producer in his own right Tyrell Ventura will be
[08:39.400 --> 08:43.440]  joining us to talk about a lot of behind-the-scenes things that went on on
[08:43.440 --> 08:49.160]  the last two seasons of conspiracy theory the censorship his father suing the
[08:49.160 --> 08:55.080]  TSA over the groping and Jesse Ventura is going to give us the first interview
[08:55.080 --> 09:00.320]  or the first day he does interviews when he returns in early April from Mexico
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.640]  he will be on this broadcast first I'm told he's doing I believe good morning
[09:05.640 --> 09:12.360]  America first and then this radio broadcast on that Monday that he has
[09:12.360 --> 09:18.480]  returned to the United States in early April so that is coming up Tyrell
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.480]  Ventura will be joining us Ventura would be on with us but again he's an hour
[09:24.480 --> 09:30.920]  away from a telephone or 45 minutes technically and does not even have phone
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.160]  service there he literally lives in a bungalow on the side of the beach trying
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.920]  to get away from the New World Order I got a lot of news we're going to cover
[09:39.920 --> 09:43.560]  today it's obviously all very important Ron Paul and the Verge of announcing
[09:43.560 --> 09:48.880]  2012 presidential bid that's at prisonplanet.com with Ron Paul statements
[09:48.880 --> 09:56.600]  there also Einstein was right honeybee collapse threatens global food security
[09:56.600 --> 10:01.800]  we're also going to get into the big developments in Egypt there's been some
[10:01.800 --> 10:07.160]  major changes Egypt proclaims power transfer plan protesters are wary and
[10:07.160 --> 10:14.120]  this report that I meant to get to yesterday is extremely concerning new
[10:14.120 --> 10:19.720]  research raises hopes and quest to find universal flu vaccine now these are a
[10:19.720 --> 10:24.400]  new class of so-called vaccines and I've had experts in vaccine development on
[10:24.400 --> 10:28.400]  biologists and medical doctors who were very concerned about this entire new
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.800]  class of vaccines I really wouldn't even call them vaccines but the media is
[10:32.800 --> 10:36.680]  calling them vaccines setting the precedent to push whatever they want on
[10:36.680 --> 10:44.560]  you through a needle but these are in the similar class to live virus vaccines
[10:44.560 --> 10:52.320]  where they say oh this vaccine will cure you will cure you of drug addiction
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.720]  why they got a vaccine they're trying to get approved for alcoholism they've got
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.720]  a vaccine to stop you from using cocaine they've got a vaccine for nicotine
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.560]  that's in tobacco and they admit in these different classes you know I've
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.960]  dubbed them brain eating vaccines that and it's in all the mainstream literature
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.880]  they admit oh it goes in and it attacks the receptors of the brain and creates
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.360]  plaques in those receptors to where the body cannot upload the opiates that are
[11:21.360 --> 11:28.440]  in the heroin or the chemicals that are in the cocaine that mimic natural
[11:28.440 --> 11:33.960]  endorphins I mean when we get a link up on the drugs report and I know we're
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.560]  gonna get an additional million readers or so to an article I get an adrenaline
[11:37.560 --> 11:41.400]  rush and we do high fives when your football team wins if you're into that
[11:41.400 --> 11:45.720]  simulated tribal combat you get an adrenaline rush but more than that it
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.840]  releases chemicals naturally out of glands in your brain that make you feel
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.600]  euphoric well these different classes of vaccines will actually go in and
[11:57.600 --> 12:10.080]  destroy your capability to have natural brain metabolic changes when you hit
[12:10.080 --> 12:13.720]  your second win when you're jogging and it's hard the first three miles that were
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.960]  three miles or whenever you hit your second win boom all the sudden you feel
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.160]  great and it's a lot easier for the next three or four miles and then suddenly
[12:23.160 --> 12:26.320]  you get tired again but if you push through that you'll get a third win if
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.520]  you're really good in a really good shape I'm so out of shape when I jog I
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.000]  never hit my second wind I go about two miles and then you know feel like I'm
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.200]  gonna throw up and got a quit but but back when I was in really good shape
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.040]  at about three miles running fast around the hiking bike trail boom I would hit
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.560]  that second wind and the next three miles was just completely easy so you're
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.160]  always going for that but side issue getting in the end of those descriptions
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.120]  just to cover an article like this I could spend three hours in deep detail
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.800]  documenting all of this information and warning you this particular catch all
[13:06.800 --> 13:15.320]  universal flu vaccine attacks the proteins that are in the influenza a
[13:15.320 --> 13:22.960]  virus now of course the same proteins that are in that virus are in tens of
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.680]  thousands of other viruses that are naturally occurring in your body and
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.480]  your intestines predominantly that are part of your buffer system and part of
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.680]  your health and the tens of thousands of different types of bacteria and your own
[13:35.680 --> 13:42.080]  cells and so imagine the spinoff problems with flesh-eating versions of
[13:42.080 --> 13:49.280]  bacteria that we have just because we've overused antibiotics and now every year
[13:49.280 --> 13:58.160]  there's more and more forms of bacteria that are completely immune to any type
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.520]  of treatment any type of antibiotic and so they're killing people I mean every
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.560]  few days I read about somebody who picks you know a pimple on their leg and two
[14:09.560 --> 14:16.320]  days later they're dead and flesh-eating bacteria has basically devoured much of
[14:16.320 --> 14:23.120]  their body and they admit that is because of antibiotics now that is a
[14:23.120 --> 14:32.040]  low-tech 65 year old technology originally discovered in mold penicillin
[14:32.040 --> 14:39.600]  now they're developing vaccines and getting approval on them that oh if you
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.480]  take this vaccine in our double-blind studies it shows a massive reduction in
[14:44.480 --> 14:50.960]  your desire to snort cocaine or it shows a massive reduction in your desire to
[14:50.960 --> 14:56.560]  smoke cigarettes or chew tobacco but they don't look at what the other effects
[14:56.560 --> 15:01.080]  are see that's looking at it one dimensionally it's just yep this seemed
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.800]  to make people not want to use this particular drug because and there's
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.960]  different variants of them but the virus goes in yet either destroys those
[15:13.960 --> 15:18.520]  receptors in the brain or it creates plaques at those receptors or they have
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.080]  other types where your your body creates an autoimmune response and then
[15:24.080 --> 15:32.160]  destroys whatever particular chemical that the vaccine is targeted towards
[15:32.160 --> 15:41.160]  creating an immunity but the problem is the reason that cigarettes and marijuana
[15:41.160 --> 15:50.640]  cannabis and cocaine and other narcotics make you feel good is because and
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.600]  the reason they're addictive is because they mimic natural processes in the
[15:55.600 --> 16:00.080]  brain and I remember reading about these vaccines that reinsured the brain
[16:00.080 --> 16:03.840]  12 years ago or so and even in the medical journals they were saying well
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.920]  there you know there's concerns about this but but but but now they just sell
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.960]  them saying look we're we're doing tests of these we're rolling these out we're
[16:11.960 --> 16:15.960]  gonna give you an anti-stress vaccine you're not gonna feel bad anymore
[16:15.960 --> 16:22.040]  you're not gonna have anxiety well you you naturally have anxiety over things
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.200]  that you should have anxiety about I have anxiety over the fact that I still
[16:26.200 --> 16:29.880]  eat too much fattening food that I don't exercise enough that I work too hard I
[16:29.880 --> 16:35.480]  have anxiety about having children that I want to live to see have children and
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.560]  that I want to be there to protect and help my children and so I'm really
[16:39.560 --> 16:44.240]  trying to wrestle with myself to stop living the destructive lifestyle I live
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.480]  it's not destructive compared to the general public but I can see it as
[16:47.480 --> 16:52.200]  destructive it was destructive being so upset about the news I'm gonna cover in
[16:52.200 --> 16:56.520]  15 minutes that I was unable to sleep last night my wife got up at two in the
[16:56.520 --> 17:00.040]  morning and said when the dog was barking and said what are you doing and you
[17:00.040 --> 17:03.240]  know I was already took another shower was dressed sitting there at the
[17:03.240 --> 17:07.040]  computer doing research I said I just can't sleep
[17:09.040 --> 17:14.560]  but see that's that's that's Alex Jones going to an extreme of concern about
[17:14.560 --> 17:18.600]  the New World Order at a subconscious level feeling like I've got to defeat
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.640]  this system myself when I can ever do that we can only do it with God's help
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.360]  with divine intervention we've got to have faith do the right thing tell the
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.200]  truth take action and then trust in God all of us together doing little things
[17:32.200 --> 17:38.640]  but getting back to this report here there are so many super technologies
[17:38.640 --> 17:44.560]  super high tech to use a comic book term super science type systems that are
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.880]  being developed and when you realize the globalist are Malthusian and malevolent
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.800]  and that they are trying to deploy these to make us basically emotionalist
[17:56.800 --> 18:03.080]  biological androids that's how the Pentagon describes in their Marshall report
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.640]  Wired Magazine reported on it the headline was Marshall plan a takeoff on
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.320]  the post-World War two plan and and the headline is the Marshall plan in the
[18:12.320 --> 18:15.720]  future it won't be what weapons our troops have but what drugs they're on
[18:15.720 --> 18:22.480]  and we know that they're testing aggression drugs high-tech steroids
[18:22.480 --> 18:29.400]  amnesics on special forces that's been confirmed and and and a lot of other
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.880]  even more dangerous things on them and we know now they're moving and and
[18:33.880 --> 18:39.720]  setting the precedent to deploy things like Gardasil that's caused close to a
[18:39.720 --> 18:44.500]  hundred known deaths and tens of thousands of people to have serious
[18:44.500 --> 18:50.160]  Guillain-Barre type neurological disorders and when the government pushed
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.200]  that on schoolgirls and now on boys they knew in the in the trials it was
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.360]  killing people but see they're setting the precedent to deploy something to
[18:58.360 --> 19:09.320]  kill us out in the open and then just see if they can paper over it oh man and I
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.280]  know I'm all over the map I'm all over the map because it's all interconnected
[19:13.280 --> 19:19.040]  I mean do people realize the chain reactions that have already begun because
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.760]  of genetically modified crops the German studies the British the Chinese
[19:23.760 --> 19:33.320]  studies all show one form of BT corn that grows a natural pesticide in it
[19:33.320 --> 19:36.960]  that is it's a natural fungus in the ground but they put it in the plant at
[19:36.960 --> 19:41.480]  about a thousand times the strength so that any bugs that eat it will die the
[19:41.480 --> 19:47.080]  problem is honey bees are eating the pollen and and they're dying I mean why
[19:47.080 --> 19:50.800]  did the globalist deploy that why are they putting out systems that turn off
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.720]  major proteins in the body not just flu viruses I mean it's like they're trying

[22:11.240 --> 22:14.600]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a
[22:14.600 --> 22:19.280]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[22:19.280 --> 22:24.560]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.080]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[24:04.160 --> 24:17.600]  day after day alone on a hill I know a pilot and a scientific researcher personally for
[24:17.600 --> 24:21.960]  many years and he called me yesterday and said Alex you can go to the Federal
[24:21.960 --> 24:27.560]  maps of the magnetic fields all pilots have them magnetic fields are
[24:27.560 --> 24:34.520]  routinely changing there is nothing to this pole shift and he wrote a report
[24:34.520 --> 24:38.560]  for us yesterday that's going up at info wars dot com in the next 30 minutes or
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.000]  so also at prison planet dot com I'm not sure what headline we're gonna give it
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.400]  yet during the next break I'm gonna go out there and decide what headline to
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.280]  give it that doesn't mean that he's a hundred percent right but I do respect
[24:52.280 --> 24:59.640]  his opinion the media including scientific American and Fox News is
[24:59.640 --> 25:04.800]  hyping it up and saying that it could be a danger and undoubtedly the polls do
[25:04.800 --> 25:10.320]  move around but according to the graphs that we've looked at it's about the same
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.440]  level of movement we've been seeing since measurements in the 1970s so we're
[25:15.440 --> 25:19.120]  gonna be going over that report coming up in the next hour I know it's kind of
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.760]  fun to think planet X is coming to kill us and it's kind of mysterious like
[25:23.760 --> 25:29.000]  thunder the barbarian cartoon in the 70s but and there's all these movies about
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.640]  asteroids hitting us but I don't think in 2012 there's gonna be a big pole
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.160]  shift the globalist are engaged in water a weather modification they brag that
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.080]  they have tectonic weapons which obviously are dangerous to manipulate the
[25:41.080 --> 25:44.400]  earth with the government and other governments have tested nukes in the
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.120]  upper atmosphere and blown holes in the ozone layer a few years after they
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.720]  discovered and confirmed the van Allen radiation belt the US government fired
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.200]  high-powered nuclear missiles into it that's in the Discovery Channel Trinity
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.960]  special with William Shatner film footage of them launching multiple nukes
[26:02.960 --> 26:07.920]  into the van Allen radiation belt quote trying to blow it up so I mean I'm not
[26:07.920 --> 26:13.320]  the real danger is the globalist and and and their cyclotrons and their heavy
[26:13.320 --> 26:19.400]  superconducting super colliders and their the Air Force report seven years ago
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.520]  admitting that they're secretly trying to isolate and develop any matter bombs
[26:23.520 --> 26:29.720]  I mean sure there's some real dangers going on but evidence of a pole shift I
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.600]  really think is a pop culture fad people may get mad at me for that that's my
[26:34.600 --> 26:38.520]  opinion and I'm not sure either we don't know the only constant on this planet
[26:38.520 --> 26:46.280]  has changed now I told you that I learned something yesterday so upsetting
[26:46.280 --> 26:50.640]  because I already had all the pieces and knew it was coming but the
[26:50.640 --> 26:57.520]  announcement of it shook me to my very core and I wanted to disprove all of my
[26:57.520 --> 27:04.920]  previous research that I had done over the years so I spent approximately eight
[27:04.920 --> 27:15.520]  hours last night from midnight to 8 a.m. researching it then I got extremely
[27:15.520 --> 27:19.400]  tired at 8 a.m. went to sleep for 30 minutes which was probably a mistake
[27:19.400 --> 27:22.400]  because now I'm kind of out of it you know and you don't sleep and take a
[27:22.400 --> 27:30.600]  quick nap you do but I confirmed that my analysis was correct because you read
[27:30.600 --> 27:36.800]  these articles in these documents and talk to insiders over the years and then
[27:36.800 --> 27:40.920]  a new development happens confirming all the research you've done but then you
[27:40.920 --> 27:47.280]  say well time tends to muddy things a bit let me spend some time researching
[27:47.280 --> 27:56.760]  this so Paul Watson Kurt Nemo Aaron Dykes and myself as well as Rob do worked
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.680]  late into the evening on the information you're about to see and this
[28:01.680 --> 28:09.000]  video audio for radio listeners was only finished 20 minutes ago and it's not
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.680]  on the internet yet it's not on the Alex Jones channel it's not at prison
[28:11.680 --> 28:19.560]  planet TV we're gonna premiere it when we come back after this break here in a
[28:19.560 --> 28:25.200]  moment and please call your friends and family please tell them to tune in to
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.600]  this information immediately because this is a form of tyranny that no
[28:31.600 --> 28:37.440]  nation has ever had in place and I don't just have all the public admissions I
[28:37.440 --> 28:44.520]  have inside sources that do not wish to be named but you can imagine who they
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.040]  are I have worked inside three separate radio stations for long periods of time
[28:50.040 --> 28:56.520]  here in Austin, Texas and I was told the information by engineers and I was
[28:56.520 --> 29:01.320]  allowed to see the documents and I was allowed to videotape some of the
[29:01.320 --> 29:03.720]  documents
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.680]  man I can't believe it it's so bad they really are getting ready for martial
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.000]  law you need to know that you need to understand this is not a game on this
[29:18.000 --> 29:25.320]  radio show this is not infotainment this is not a joke they are planning
[29:25.320 --> 29:30.640]  hardcore tyranny and we're gonna break it down we come back we're gonna go
[29:30.640 --> 29:34.760]  straight to the video we come out of break slash audio it'll be streaming at
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.520]  prisonplanet.tv for viewers there for radio listeners will be able to hear

[32:10.040 --> 32:13.400]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[32:13.400 --> 32:17.000]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[33:04.800 --> 33:12.000]  devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.480]  tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 in
[33:18.480 --> 33:25.800]  Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones if you are receiving this
[33:25.800 --> 33:30.440]  transmission you are the resistance
[33:33.680 --> 33:42.480]  this is a test of the emergency alert system executive order 10,995 allows the
[33:42.480 --> 33:46.560]  government to seize and control the communication media our nation is at
[33:46.560 --> 33:50.640]  war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred training camps have
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.440]  been struck leaders eliminated plots disrupted and all those involved in the
[33:55.440 --> 33:59.880]  attempted act of terrorism as must know you too will be held to account think
[33:59.880 --> 34:05.280]  about it 15 years ago we allowed the federal government to hardwire emergency
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.040]  takeover systems of all major communications and media in the United
[34:09.040 --> 34:12.600]  States now the federal government's coming out in the open and admitting what
[34:12.600 --> 34:16.080]  was already in their internal documents they're gonna begin having federal
[34:16.080 --> 34:35.680]  break-ins over local news well it's really happening bona fide tyranny is
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.840]  coming to our shores if you look at Egypt you've witnessed how the government
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.760]  has seized control of the TV and radio stations but in the United States the
[34:43.760 --> 34:48.000]  federal government doesn't need to do that because under changes and FCC
[34:48.000 --> 34:57.560]  regulations over television and radio in 1996 EAS emergency systems are put in
[34:57.560 --> 35:02.520]  at the radio or TV towers they're also put in at the national and local cable
[35:02.520 --> 35:08.480]  systems where the federal government puts a box in at the transmission tower
[35:08.480 --> 35:15.040]  where they can flip a switch and shortwave towers nationwide take over
[35:15.040 --> 35:21.200]  those computers and put out an audio signal of whatever message they want I
[35:21.200 --> 35:28.040]  am a radio broadcaster and I remember 15 years ago when this change was made
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.240]  watching the engineer at the radio station where I worked and the station
[35:32.240 --> 35:37.800]  manager literally freaking out they were sent documents that the FCC said were
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.800]  restricted but I was allowed to look at them and I was allowed to videotape them
[35:40.800 --> 35:48.320]  and I put it in my 1999 film police state 2000 well my friends you're looking at a
[35:48.320 --> 35:55.920]  FEMA control box that's right at 98 9 kj fkfm where I work in Austin Texas that
[35:55.920 --> 36:02.160]  my friends can take over the radio station it is radio controlled by a FEMA
[36:02.160 --> 36:08.400]  tower that's right a FEMA tower in New Braunville's Texas it covers almost all
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.240]  of the central part of the state of Texas little teletypes come printing out
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.200]  of the side of the machine weekly and update us in the past it was voluntary
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.040]  now it's mandatory and they can remote control take over the station and in
[36:25.040 --> 36:29.560]  those they told them that in the near future the federal government would
[36:29.560 --> 36:34.520]  routinely seize control their broadcast system not during a plague or a nuclear
[36:34.520 --> 36:41.080]  attack or a war but that they would seize control for routine announcements so it
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.720]  was put in place but it wasn't implemented now president Barack Obama
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.200]  through the FCC has announced today that they are going to begin testing and
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.720]  implementing national announcements with the president giving messages to the
[36:57.720 --> 37:03.080]  public everybody has heard the national emergency alert system radio and TV
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.080]  stations regularly test it to make sure the public is notified in times of
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.800]  peril well that system is overseen by the FCC and now the agency wants to
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.800]  upgrade it by having presidential announcements feed into the alert system
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.680]  it's also looking at how wireless broadband could also enhance EAS but it
[37:20.680 --> 37:26.920]  gets worse eight years ago I was not doing my radio show out of the studio I
[37:26.920 --> 37:30.640]  was doing out of a local talk station I didn't have my own studio then they got
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.520]  new communicates from the FCC telling them that they should prepare in the
[37:35.520 --> 37:44.360]  near future for multiple hours per day of federal break-ins over the local AM
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.480]  station and the same systems and the cable systems broadcast TV talk radio
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.920]  you name it and I went to the station manager and I said please come on my
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.080]  show talk about this and he said no I showed you this stuff in confidence
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.120]  you're not allowed to talk about it you can say you heard about it but not
[38:03.120 --> 38:09.840]  where now since then I've done shows out of another big talk station here in town
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.840]  I've been a guest in many stations around the country over 80 stations now
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.920]  that pick up my syndicated radio show and in the last week I have talked to
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.040]  station owners and managers who are now getting internal communicates from the
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.440]  FCC and they're told it's national security that they're not allowed to
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.600]  talk about it but that they're gonna be more and more government break-ins over
[38:32.600 --> 38:39.480]  radio and TV now I got that news but was trying to figure out what to do with it
[38:39.480 --> 38:45.720]  when today the big announcement comes out and the FCC Obama spokes lady says
[38:45.720 --> 38:49.800]  oh this is no big deal we've always had this in place we're now just gonna
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.880]  implement it well I guess that's true they're executive orders to seize all
[38:53.880 --> 38:57.720]  transportation they're executive orders to put every American into forced
[38:57.720 --> 39:03.320]  labor brigades they're executive orders to take over all the media under
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.040]  nuclear attack under continuity of government the point is now Obama is
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.680]  beginning to implement this before 1996 you had one local station that under an
[39:15.680 --> 39:20.640]  emergency situation would broadcast the EAS alert other stations would tune to
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.960]  that station and carry those emergency alerts no country in the world not
[39:25.960 --> 39:31.720]  communist Russia back during the Soviet Union pre-1991 not Chalcescu's Romania
[39:31.720 --> 39:38.040]  none of them had actual boxes in the radio and TV stations that would take
[39:38.040 --> 39:43.000]  over the entire transmission these are wired in under regulations to the
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.800]  broadcast towers and at the studios everything my lawn I've watched the
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.720]  engineers complain and bitch and moan for years has to be wired through these
[39:51.720 --> 39:56.320]  and it causes all sorts of problems they have to do weekly checks randomly with
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.240]  the federal government test the takeover of the station to make sure it's in
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.120]  place this is happening in America right as we go into a depression right as
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.680]  foreign banks loot our country right as they try to start new wars in the
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.880]  Middle East do you see what's happening but it gets worse FEMA began to put out
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.680]  press releases last year saying you know what we're gonna have digital license
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.240]  plates across the country that have most wanted videos popping up it'll be an
[40:22.240 --> 40:27.360]  LCD screen and we're going to give you government announcements over those you
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.000]  know those billboards we put up for amber alerts with kidnapped little kids now
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.440]  it's gonna be report illegal guns report terrorism they're putting in these
[40:35.440 --> 40:38.960]  giant telescreens at these 9,000 locations Walmart's malls you name it
[40:38.960 --> 40:43.320]  saying don't trust other shoppers don't trust your neighbors only trust big
[40:43.320 --> 40:48.000]  brother only trust the government Napolitano comes and inserts herself
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.920]  at the Super Bowl has the TSA running checkpoints with local trained goons
[40:52.920 --> 40:58.920]  actually doing frisk and feeling people up we're going in to bondage and now in
[40:58.920 --> 41:04.320]  the midst of the accelerating global financial meltdown the White House
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.760]  announces and says oh it's no big deal we've had this on the books for years
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.880]  yeah martial law plans for years we're going to start testing the voice of
[41:13.880 --> 41:19.600]  Obama breaking it on the media and they're announcing that Xbox video games
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.500]  and other systems are going to have government announcements that pop up
[41:22.500 --> 41:26.520]  cast Sunstein the regulations are has said that they want pop-ups on websites
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.000]  they don't agree with with government messages Google's already testing this
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.320]  where it tells you look out going to this site this information has been
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.680]  proven to be wrong the internet kill switch the cyber security takeover it's
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.480]  all happening they've got new FCC rules where all the alarm clocks and
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.580]  televisions have to have hardwired chips in them so they can fire your
[41:47.580 --> 41:51.040]  television or radio up and make you hear announcements in the middle of the
[41:51.040 --> 41:56.280]  night they've also announced in this new press release that oh the FCC and the
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.280]  federal government are going to put in free national broadband that we pay for
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.720]  its taxpayers but it's going to be under our filtered rules in the free
[42:04.720 --> 42:08.960]  broadband in Europe at the bus and train stations guess whose websites are
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.440]  censored info wars.com or prismpana.com what did Google announce two weeks ago
[42:13.440 --> 42:17.320]  that they're going to start censoring and blocking out from their searches
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.120]  content farms like the drudge report and info wars.com that is sites that
[42:22.120 --> 42:27.940]  aggregate news and make comments on news this is a full spectrum takeover of the
[42:27.940 --> 42:32.480]  media in our country this is an attack on free speech this is literal government
[42:32.480 --> 42:38.080]  messages on digital billboards at checkout counters on your license plate
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.800]  on your cell phone on your pop-up video games this is the federal government
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.480]  coming in and forcing their messages directly into the media because the
[42:47.480 --> 42:51.440]  population doesn't buy into their propaganda anymore there has been a
[42:51.440 --> 42:54.960]  continuity of agenda this has been going on for decades they've been setting
[42:54.960 --> 42:59.840]  the system up but now they're rolling it out and that's the message here what
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.720]  does it say about our society this is unbelievable this is the fairness doctrine
[43:04.720 --> 43:12.080]  2.0 this is authoritarian censorship by way of government break-ins with
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.040]  announcements no country's ever done this this is beyond 1984 and it's really
[43:17.040 --> 43:23.280]  happening do people realize the magnitude of this and in America supposed
[43:23.280 --> 43:28.360]  land of freedom I'm getting frantic calls from station owners and managers as
[43:28.360 --> 43:33.480]  they're being told to get ready for all this to happen in the last few weeks and
[43:33.480 --> 43:38.280]  going back eight years ago and going back 15 years ago when I get these
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.560]  documents as they put the system in place the station owners are afraid to
[43:42.560 --> 43:48.760]  speak out the station managers are afraid to speak out why why we need to
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.080]  say no this is a free market free private property society in the name of
[43:53.080 --> 43:57.360]  security the government is hard-wiring everything so they can take it over
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.840]  Egypt anybody this is worse than what happened in Egypt that's what Mubarak
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.200]  did but he didn't have it hardwired he physically had the army go take it over
[44:07.200 --> 44:14.000]  this is as plain as the nose on my face this is brazen naked hardcore scary
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.640]  tyranny and when I saw them announce this even though I knew it was coming for
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.040]  all these years it shook me to my very core and it should shake you when they
[44:22.040 --> 44:25.440]  put tyranny in place they can take the pension funds the veterans death
[44:25.440 --> 44:30.240]  benefits that's already begun they can jack up taxes they can shut down
[44:30.240 --> 44:34.160]  newspapers TV radio the last time this happened was during the Civil War
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.360]  Lincoln did similar things arresting scores of newspaper owners and editors
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.760]  this is here the globalists have committed so many crimes they know
[44:42.760 --> 44:46.240]  they're unpopular with the people they know Congress has an 11% approval
[44:46.240 --> 44:50.680]  rating and so they are moving with the system to force their propaganda onto
[44:50.680 --> 44:54.840]  all private media in this country and it's going to start with little short
[44:54.840 --> 44:59.360]  announcements and it's going to move until huge blocks of programming are
[44:59.360 --> 45:02.920]  openly taken over by the government if we don't have free speech in the first
[45:02.920 --> 45:06.440]  amendment and a free press in this country we have nothing the internet has
[45:06.440 --> 45:10.600]  been a wonderful tool to enlighten and inform and awaken the masses but it's
[45:10.600 --> 45:16.200]  also a double-edged sword created by DARPA electronics computer chips are so
[45:16.200 --> 45:20.840]  cheap everything is being wired for the federal takeover this is announced this
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.440]  is a fact we're entering a time when you're not going to be able to access
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.600]  info wars.com and other alternative sites were already being blocked all over
[45:28.600 --> 45:32.440]  the world they've already got the system in place and that's scary enough but if
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.640]  they send up this trial balloon and we go along with it they are going to
[45:35.640 --> 45:39.040]  implement the full takeover of the media whether you're liberal conservative
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.440]  libertarian communist socialist it doesn't matter atheist Christian all
[45:44.440 --> 45:51.000]  media is under attack we must come together and resist this we must say
[45:51.000 --> 45:57.560]  no to this this is a major canary in the coal mine this is a full spectrum
[45:57.560 --> 46:02.720]  takeover of the media let's not let them pull that switch get the word out to
[46:02.720 --> 46:07.760]  everybody I have been having chills for three hours since this announcement came
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.400]  out I knew the hammer was going to drop but this is so incredible we've got to
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.040]  hang together for the first amendment or we're surely going to hang separate thank
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.520]  you the rest is up to you please spread the word
[46:24.920 --> 46:29.560]  it is now time for radio and TV station owners to stand up to this
[46:29.560 --> 46:34.000]  corruption to this police state takeover of the first amendment and private
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.400]  property and let the system know they are not going to put up with the federal
[46:38.400 --> 46:46.520]  government's takeover of our media system enough is enough enough is enough and
[46:46.520 --> 46:52.320]  that is the 13 minute video that we just showed here for the first time it's
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.800]  not even on the web yet we just streamed it out via prison plenida TV and on our
[46:56.800 --> 47:05.480]  M&FM stations XM and global shortwave I know behind the scenes that station
[47:05.480 --> 47:11.040]  owners have been prepared for this for 15 years now they're being told yes the
[47:11.040 --> 47:15.080]  government is going to go ahead with this there's always industry backlash the
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.720]  government saying they may take hours per day with different break-ins in the
[47:20.720 --> 47:25.320]  middle of a sports broadcast the middle of the news the middle of the weather the
[47:25.320 --> 47:30.920]  middle of my radio show they are at 9000 locations putting the telescreens in
[47:30.920 --> 47:37.360]  and it's not just a politano it's other homeland security messages the TSA
[47:37.360 --> 47:42.240]  obviously has gone from airports to sports stadiums and train stations and
[47:42.240 --> 47:48.120]  that's all been announced this is a full spectrum government takeover of media
[47:48.120 --> 47:53.680]  and let me expand on that here's pop science AP also reported on this this
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.800]  is from 2009 New York State wants to put emergency alerts in your online games
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.120]  which is the way most games are played now is in millions of people at a time
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.760]  hundreds of thousands at a time playing online games and it shows examples of
[48:07.760 --> 48:16.200]  terror threat alerts popping up on your computer screen it continues we have all
[48:16.200 --> 48:19.640]  these different reports here about how they're gonna have billboards all over
[48:19.640 --> 48:24.440]  the place which that's the first rollout at the 800 plus walmarts and then they
[48:24.440 --> 48:31.120]  announced 8000 plus locations mall of America with big screens with government
[48:31.120 --> 48:35.400]  messages with audio forcing you at the checkout counter to spend your time
[48:35.400 --> 48:41.160]  with Janet Napolitano and FEMA and Homeland Security forcing you to listen
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.760]  to them on the radio forcing you over your handheld computer device to get
[48:45.760 --> 48:52.880]  audio and text alerts from them just injecting the fear and then always with
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.800]  this system they started out for Al Qaeda because oh everybody hates Al Qaeda
[48:57.800 --> 49:03.720]  and then next it's illegal guns next it's burning trash in your backyard it's
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.800]  environmental crimes it's the Green Police this is the normalization of a
[49:08.800 --> 49:13.520]  high-tech 1984 society by the way Curt Nimmo did a story on this that just went
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.600]  up the last 20 minutes at info wars.com we're gonna get it posted over at
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.600]  prismplanet.com as well Obama launches total takeover of media and that's also
[49:23.600 --> 49:27.040]  the name of the video we're gonna be posting to YouTube that you just saw
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.880]  and heard here and Nimmo begins the article by saying even the Washington
[49:31.880 --> 49:36.960]  Post describes it like something out of Orwell's 1984 and he has a link to the
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.600]  Washington Post but they're like oh it's fun it's good it's like 1984 it's fun
[49:42.600 --> 49:48.600]  oh there's gonna be telescreens on the highways and in the town squares and in
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.680]  all the shops and these are now going in we're getting the video sent to us of
[49:52.680 --> 49:56.720]  Walmart super centers everywhere at every checkout line just telling you watch
[49:56.720 --> 50:00.640]  out terrorist or everywhere watch out the internet's not safe the
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.560]  announcements that are being played on these systems are also at the YouTube
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.000]  channel of Homeland Security and they've got a whole string of them now saying
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.800]  TSA could not always be here to protect you but we're going to try and then it
[50:12.800 --> 50:17.200]  shows TSA at football games and things just where people are watching screens
[50:17.200 --> 50:22.280]  being prepared again first they prepare you via the television screen what
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.480]  people see as not reality for the physical rollout so we're acclimated to
[50:27.480 --> 50:33.680]  accept it and we've got to get station owners and station managers and others
[50:33.680 --> 50:38.440]  to start saying no to this this is a major trial balloon they're launching
[50:38.440 --> 50:44.080]  and this is about taking over the alternative media the internet everything
[50:44.080 --> 50:52.880]  it's so serious they're really now implementing all these executive orders
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.360]  and things that have been on the books for decades we'll be right back ladies
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.640]  and gentlemen with more on Obama and the launching the total takeover forget

[54:20.280 --> 54:26.080]  show the federal government through the continuity of government systems set up
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.600]  back in the 50s for nuclear war has quietly rolled out a system through
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.680]  cybersecurity already being put in place despite the fact that cybersecurity
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.680]  hasn't been officially passed by Congress and they're admitting that they
[54:38.680 --> 54:44.720]  are hard-wiring government takeover systems into all of the ISPs where they
[54:44.720 --> 54:52.400]  can overlay messages on all websites all cell phones all online cooperative play
[54:52.400 --> 54:57.880]  video games they've already put the systems in as of 15 years ago with the
[54:57.880 --> 55:04.200]  telecommunications act at all broadcast TV cable even though the FCC supposedly
[55:04.200 --> 55:10.400]  not really over that and radio and it doesn't matter if we're on WWCR the
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.760]  big hundred thousand watt shortwave in Tennessee they've got it wired it doesn't
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.920]  matter if we're on 590 a.m. air in Austin they've got it wired and we just accept
[55:19.920 --> 55:27.400]  this and the stations pay their taxes to then have this forced on them it's
[55:27.400 --> 55:32.160]  incredible and previous in 96 they had a government frequency they would tune to
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.440]  during the emergency and one local station would have the takeover box in it
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.680]  and then other stations would tune to that only in case of a nuclear war then
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.000]  they pass the amber alerts which sounds reasonable if there's a missing little
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.040]  girl they'll have billboards digital billboards radio announcements TV
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.520]  announcements but now you see the billboards where I live here in Austin
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.480]  it will say report environmental crimes report illegal guns report terrorist
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.760]  they are using this system and now forcing into those any doubts into the
[56:02.760 --> 56:09.240]  stores into the markets into the malls into the city squares and town squares
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.160]  where you're just bombarded by government media that you pay for with
[56:14.160 --> 56:18.800]  your tax money this is the dream of dictators like Stalin and Hitler and
[56:18.800 --> 56:26.800]  Chalcescu and Pol Pot and Fidel Castro and in classical tyrannies the
[56:26.800 --> 56:30.360]  government controls the media but sometimes the media doesn't do what they
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.760]  want so they send the police or military to the outfit to take it over this is
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.720]  different this is government developing its own news packages and forcing it in
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.920]  to the checkout lines at Walmart and Mall of America forcing it onto your
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.240]  cell phone bombarding you breaking into your life and being able to shut the
[56:49.240 --> 56:52.880]  media off and completely take it over and the federal government now admits
[56:52.880 --> 56:59.520]  the Pentagon has built giant TV studios for just that event and has created arm
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.440]  services television and they've got backup units now through FEMA television
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.280]  to totally take over and now they're getting you ready for it saying yes
[57:08.280 --> 57:11.720]  during an economic emergency remember Bush signed that executive order
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.960]  Obama continued it for any emergency including economic they can seize
[57:15.960 --> 57:20.160]  control of the entire infrastructure and Congress can say nothing for six
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.600]  months remember three years ago when I freaked out when Bush did that and we
[57:24.600 --> 57:27.560]  said I don't know if they're gonna pull full martial law but they're putting
[57:27.560 --> 57:32.360]  troops on the streets running checkpoints TSA Viper teams getting us all
[57:32.360 --> 57:38.000]  acclimated but before they do it they'll start coming out and and and testing
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.240]  it well now the testing is here they could take over five years from now or
[57:43.240 --> 57:49.720]  next month or tomorrow night the point is that sort of Damocles is now hanging
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.600]  over us and this is all run by FEMA now now what did FEMA do and this was on
[57:55.600 --> 58:00.320]  Good Morning America with the county parish sheriff of the New Orleans
[58:00.320 --> 58:05.080]  County that New Orleans is in and he went on TV and broke down and cried and
[58:05.080 --> 58:10.320]  told the truth and he said he had officers who were not allowed by the
[58:10.320 --> 58:16.120]  feds to go in and get their families out of the nursing home and his and the
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.360]  grandmother had a phone working and called the center you coming to get me
[58:20.360 --> 58:22.440]  and they said we're coming to get you we're coming to get you in two days
[58:22.440 --> 58:25.360]  later we come in to get you we're coming to get you they won't let us four
[58:25.360 --> 58:28.880]  days later they go they get her she's dead then he broke down he said FEMA
[58:28.880 --> 58:32.360]  sabotages they came in and cut the communication lines they did it the
[58:32.360 --> 58:36.600]  first night when the storm hit they ran that whole thing just like they want to
[58:36.600 --> 58:41.600]  cut local police lines they've got grids and to take it all over
[58:43.360 --> 58:51.560]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.560 --> 58:55.320]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.320 --> 58:59.080]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.080 --> 59:03.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.600 --> 59:07.160]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.160 --> 59:11.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.480 --> 59:15.880]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.880 --> 59:19.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[59:27.440 --> 59:31.520]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.240]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.240 --> 59:44.760]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.080]  at all the internet hubs all the broadcast TV and radio stations the
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:13.680]  government now announcing that they're gonna start breaking in to broadcast
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:19.880]  with a see something say something DHS with the president with Janet Napolitano
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:25.600]  and others the Soviets didn't try this and they had the technology to break in
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:32.720]  over radio and TV this is unbelievable and it is the opposite of a free society
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:41.480]  and I'd like to open the phones up only only in this hour and I'm gonna cover
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.520]  other news as well but only for station owners or managers or program directors

[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.520]  box what you're not allowed to criticize that they're not gonna be taking

[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:33.960]  stations in the DC slash Maryland Virginia area and basically announced all
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:41.080]  of this yesterday we already had all of the public FEMA admissions here's info
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:48.720]  wars.com from April 11 2005 FEMA test digital alert system here's pop science
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.160]  and New York state wants to put emergency alerts in your online games they've
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.680]  also tried to push FCC regulations that all clock radios have quote weather
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.040]  alerts but really that's a chip receiver where they artificially flip
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.160]  your this is already happening to people people already see I get calls all the
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.560]  time I see it in the news where they're breaking in more and more their people's
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.360]  radios are turning on people are getting messages on their televisions this is
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.360]  all admitted this is this is a total incremental takeover but the total
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.760]  takeover system is in place notice our headline Obama launches total takeover
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:32.360]  of media and the actual headline I gave to Kurt was Obama launches total media
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.600]  takeover system so let's I know Kurt's working from home today let's let's
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.840]  change that headline now that I look at it I was working with him on the story
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.240]  this morning it's Obama launches total media takeover system Obama launches
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.960]  total media takeover system he's launching the media takeover system he's
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:59.120]  not launching the total media takeover I guess technically they are I don't know
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.280]  what headline you think this ought to be Obama launches total media Obama
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.480]  launches total takeover of media or should it be Obama launches total media
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.320]  takeover system because because that's that that's what's happening is they're
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:21.480]  rolling out the total media takeover system right now and again this report

[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.000]  decade ago when DARPA began to announce it but now it's mainstream news so
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.960]  people don't laugh at us about the internet kill switch the Pentagon run
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.800]  kill switch they call it the Obama kill switch shutting the internet off like
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.840]  Egypt did to save the internet and oh we've got to put this in place because
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.080]  of the Stuxnet worm which our own government admits they launched with
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.920]  Israel so our government launches this worm and then says they've got to take
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.880]  the web over because of it they're announcing and it's starting they're
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.840]  going to put hardwired systems inside the chips of your phones they're already
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.600]  in place under the telecommunications act that the phones be compatible with
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.480]  this by 2001 that's now 10 years ago but they announced all this in 1996 and I've
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.560]  been warning people since then your phones your computers your television
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:18.280]  your digital alarm clock your local AM and FM radio stations your local UHF VHF
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:23.240]  cable at the transmission tower or at the transmission point at the cable
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:31.400]  system at the radio station shortwave AM FM digital it doesn't matter under
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.280]  federal regulations since 96 there are hardwired boxes that everything has to
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.920]  go through in case of a nuclear war then they would give you announcements but
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.960]  now they admit they're setting up a top-down system where the president
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.680]  will start making announcements and so will FEMA and Homeland Security you
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.400]  notice it 9,000 locations first it's 846 and then a week later they go no it's
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.160]  9,000 locations now they're saying oh it's actually 16,000 locations I needed
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.320]  to correct that I saw this weekend it's now 16,000 I mean will it be 50,000
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.160]  next it's exponential they're training the clergy response teams we got those
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.360]  secret documents six years ago people didn't believe it even though it had
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.120]  FEMA phone numbers then three years later they put out newscast saying yes
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.600]  we're training your preachers during martial law to tell you to submit to
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.480]  government and to turn your guns in we've had those preachers on we've had
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.280]  the sheriff's son that have carried out the training one of them apologized for
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.920]  it and said he didn't realize how serious it was and now Obama is announcing
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.640]  that he's gonna be on telescreens at Walmart and at malls and at grocery
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.440]  stores and on the side of the highway big digital screens with loudspeakers
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.120]  when you're playing online video games they're gonna be breaking in with
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.000]  messages California is going to test it out with FEMA where you have a digital
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.480]  LCD screen that actually has a tracker system in it as your license plate with
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.560]  government messages that are wirelessly transmitted to it so you see most wanted
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.320]  announcements advertisements to raise money making your car become an
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:08.040]  advertisement and then terror alerts I mean this is beyond 1984 and even the
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.280]  Washington Post describes it like 1984 but says it's a good 1984 that's the
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.880]  first link in Kurt Nemo's article Obama launches total takeover of media total
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:25.480]  takeover of media they're launching the total takeover system to be able to
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.440]  take over media and now seeing if we'll go along with us now I notice we got
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.560]  Ben Sean Chris and others that are station owners managers traffic directors
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.360]  people like that I'm going to get to you and I appreciate you being there I wanted
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.520]  to get a brief report from Aaron Dykes if you want to call in only station
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:54.560]  managers owners engineers especially 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 I want to get
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.440]  your take on this but if there's any doubts in Kurt Nemo's article it is
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.440]  filled with documentation in Aaron Dykes video that he stayed up all night to
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.360]  put together hasn't slept when we saw this announcement by Obama yesterday
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.600]  through federal news radio and they had the spokesman from FEMA on saying yes
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.480]  we've always had this power yeah during a nuclear attack to make these
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.440]  announcements now you're not just going to hear the test the brank brank brank
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.160]  this is an emergency alert system this is only a test this was an actual
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.880]  emergency you would stand by for announcements now you're going to start
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.560]  getting the announcements that there's terrorists everywhere and watch your
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.920]  neighbor and support your dear leader this is the government taking over the
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:40.200]  media forcing its way in and I remember again eight years ago station managers
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.880]  one guy manages a whole string of stations around the country but I they were
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.920]  carrying my show I do my show out of there it wasn't 98 9 it's not 590 I've
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.680]  gotten reports from those as well over the years both places I worked but from
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.480]  this particular station I'm not going to name them people can figure out which
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.400]  one it was of their Austin listeners I was allowed to see the latest stuff and
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.600]  they were freaking out in this meeting going they're telling us to get ready
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.680]  for government announcements in the future but there was industry pressure
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:11.800]  people said this is outrageous so it didn't happen then it's now happening and
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.400]  if we don't scream and yell about this they're going to be able to get away
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.120]  with this but remember anytime they want your cell phone your computer the
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.280]  the newest clock radios the cable that goes into your house everything radio
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.360]  TV broadcast cable all of it the government can flip a switch and take
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.120]  it all over anytime they want and they're saying in the Associated Press in
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.440]  Reuters and Aaron's video has all these articles in it should Obama control the
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.960]  Internet well yes to say that he should total kill switch they may shut the web
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.640]  off to protect it but they're going to incrementally get you trained that it's
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.520]  their right to do it first so we're going to Ben Sean Chris and others who
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:01.600]  work inside radio stations here in just a moment again 1-800-259-9231 to hear
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.760]  from engineers and others but Aaron going over the research last night
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.640]  because we already knew all of this it was the fact that they're now they put
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.920]  it in place already now they're getting the public ready for it what was it
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.120]  like for you to see this information yeah the thing that strikes me the most
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.840]  is the the continuity of agenda behind the whole thing this particular
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.280]  executive order was set up by Bush but Obama gets to implement it but more we
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.760]  see Napolitano and this Homeland Security see something coming out of
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.960]  nowhere but it really integrates with this warning program and from a
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:39.200]  technical standpoint this thing goes off of XML priorities so any priority will
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.640]  override the system either at the local regional or whatever level but now
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.240]  everything's hard-coded but they've watered the terrorism down so vaguely
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.480]  so that it's anything suspicious even when there's no credible you know
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.800]  information that there could be an attempt and they're doing drills with
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.280]  military and police if there's a backfire from a car they lock everything down and
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.520]  they're training us for these lockdowns yeah and if things do go to a full
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.760]  martial law level it's gonna bypass the police right away I've got a report here
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.520]  from Spectra rep and by the way what happened at FEMA what happened at
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.280]  Katrina and I've I've had the local officials on the FEMA came and cut the
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.120]  transmission lines at their radio towers and they had to put armed guards
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.960]  with shotguns and were in standoffs when they repaired it and they wouldn't let
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.320]  the police go in and save people at nursing homes and they wouldn't let
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.440]  people get out over the causeways over the highways they made them stay there
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.720]  as a drill to see if and then they confiscated the guns I mean in fact
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.880]  later we'll play the sheriff from the county that New Orleans is in saying
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.680]  this sorry go ahead no but this November 2010 report about this current
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.280]  installment of alerts mentions how for example a roadside sign may be programmed
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.720]  to wake up if the response is to evacuate but not to wake up if it's for
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.200]  shelter so in other words these amber alert signs are gonna go live whenever
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.160]  they punch the alert and they admitted it was never about the little girl it was
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.640]  over taking all the media over for the little girl no it's about total control
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.280]  and now they admit in this Obama press release he's going to be making
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.720]  announcements at you daily you're not gonna just hear stations that want to
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.960]  carry the presidential address once a week you're gonna have to listen to him
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.040]  you're gonna have to see him and to Polatano when you're at Walmart check
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.120]  outlines yeah it's interesting there's a quote related to Bush's signing in 2006
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:37.440]  this executive order 13407 he says this alert system is in part to ensure that
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.280]  under all conditions the president can communicate with the American people and
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.440]  it's just amazing they're using all the up-to-date technology for a top-down
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.320]  approach they're gonna enter your Xbox and your other video games they're gonna
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.840]  enter your smuggling this is all announced and again Microsoft admitted
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:59.440]  again a decade ago that all of their computers are hardwired in with these
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.000]  government switches and so under the telecommunications act folks when you
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.480]  see that little FCC approval sticker on a radio or on a computer or anything by
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480]  law they make you pay for it when you purchase it you know they make you pay
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.400]  for the cost they have government takeover switches in them so they can
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.600]  also spy on you just like the Tevo and other systems are tracking what you're
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.720]  watching this is hot this is what cyber security is they admit the cyber
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.760]  security act everything is hardwired not just your AM and FM stations but if I
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.960]  don't misunderstand the way things were with this alert system even though they
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.400]  had a local regional FEMA director who could punch that button at all these
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.960]  radio stations they couldn't do that nationwide all in one push before but
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.360]  under this system they totally can right well to be to be technical since
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.080]  96 they can they claim there was the designate for the local FEMA director
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.600]  but the these boxes are shortwave controlled okay now they're trying to
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.520]  force them to put satellite dishes and things and so they have higher quality
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:01.120]  you know media government media but it's a shortwave system breaks in and then a
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.160]  shortwave feed goes out over the system that's one of the systems but the
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.200]  overall point is that it's centralizing into very few hands of people and well
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:15.360]  and they'll also have a local designated FEMA AM and FM so the shortwaves the
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.040]  backup but it breaks in with that but we can have engineers school us on the
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.120]  finer details of this but I mean here we are can you think of a more 1984 system
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:28.200]  and that's what these telescreens are at the 9,000 shopping malls and
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.320]  Walmart's is the rollout to get us used to government they're hanging over us at
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.800]  the checkout line that oh we get government messages now this is normal
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.640]  and it was Walmart who got the universal product code adopted with the Pentagon
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.520]  it's Walmart trying to force RFID 3 right now but the thing is all this
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.680]  stuff fell apart at the seams under Bush I mean that that five or four color
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.400]  alert chart that went from orange to red was a total joke now they're just an
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.600]  enridge admits that that was done these are politically to scare people but but
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.600]  see now they're just going to basically keep us at orange all the time that's
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.040]  why they got rid of it and what are people going to say when it's in their
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.360]  shopping malls and their sports stadiums I mean it's there it's going in it
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.440]  doesn't make sense but I guess people just want to go to the Super Bowl so well
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.800]  Aaron how long till this is up on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube so we can
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.920]  post a special 13 minute report that info wars in prison planet it is now live
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.600]  and it's in the stories too so good job Aaron you you need to go home and get
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.760]  some sleep just to be clear I didn't force Aaron to stay up all night and I
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.720]  was so upset doing research on this I stayed up all night as well great job
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.720]  Aaron thanks Alex thank you so much we're gonna come back go directly to

[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.000]  will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.760]  it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest

[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.600]  Google search term Obama launches total takeover of media let's do the search
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:20.280]  term Obama launches takeover Obama launches takeover put those three words

[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.080]  we're not gonna go to these fine station folks that want to comment on this and
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.080]  give us their take on it Ben from Tennessee what's your view of this all
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:57.080]  right this oh and by the way hello Alex thanks for bringing this topic up EAS has
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:03.800]  been thorn in my side for years I'm a semi-retired broadcast engineer mainly
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.800]  radio youth work at top 10 markets I retired out here to boondocks in
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:14.360]  Tennessee and my one of my main issues with us you know obviously besides the
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.840]  whole takeover issue is for example a radio station that I deal with here in
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:27.120]  town is a 500 watt day timer it's a little roll religious radio barely got
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:32.440]  money to keep the lights on don't okay it's run by and I'm not kidding it's the
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:40.480]  only station in town it's run by an 87 year old Baptist preacher okay and he
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.160]  gets money you know it's the old pay-before-your-pray type of radio
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.920]  you know I mean he'll he puts puts radio preachers on the air spin some
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.960]  gospel music CDs doesn't really have a staff a lot of the thing sadly runs on
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:02.200]  automatic pilot a lot of the time but we I got involved with his EAS system a
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.200]  good while ago mainly because the FCC requires the radio stations to have
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.480]  these otherwise there's a substantial fine if it's not in operation and you
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.680]  gotta do you gotta do weekly test and they're watching to make sure you're
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.920]  complying and their takeover systems in place that that is absolutely correct
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.960]  however he went through a number of contract engineers who were unable to
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.880]  make the darn thing work I mean the system it's it's it's real hinky it's a
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.320]  flawed system overall at least I think from from it from a technical point of
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:45.680]  view however we finally get this thing up and running after an inspector from
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.880]  the federal communications commission walking and saw that it had been
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:57.080]  basically collecting dust in the rack for several years and said hey I'm gonna
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:03.120]  give you you know X number of days to get this thing online or we're gonna
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:09.080]  start finding you thousands of dollars per day for each day it's not on the
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.960]  air by the way communist Russia didn't have this but we do go ahead right
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.560]  exactly so what you've got is is a radio station that a full 500 watt day
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.040]  timer that you know can barely pay its bills you can't even you know you know
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.920]  has no employees the guys barely make it into me and I mean if he if he you know
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:36.320]  he if he blows a piece of equipment you know just a minor slide pot or
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.640]  something on on a board you know he's he's pretty well he pretty well wiped
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:46.240]  out so you look at something like this where he's going to get fined thousands
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.880]  of thousands of dollars for not having this thing in place bang he's off the
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.440]  air and look at how many small independently owned radio stations and
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:01.200]  again I'm talking 250 500 watt am day timers that are not owned no exactly
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.440]  but well great points then we're gonna come back with others we got one minute
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.880]  left though what's your view of them hardwiring the cell phones the
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.000]  computers and now announcing that not only is the takeover system in place
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.120]  they're gonna start commandeering time randomly and making you listen to Barry
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:23.040]  Sataro well again you've got the programming issue you've got a situation
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.920]  where you've got a conservative radio station and and messages they don't want
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.920]  to broadcast and it's you know the airwaves are free at least it should be
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:39.680]  you know what I'm saying yeah this is exactly this is fairness doctrine 2.0
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.560]  oh you know we're just gonna make you listen to us we're gonna make you listen
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.600]  to Cass Sunstein globalism great points been we're gonna talk to more station
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.480]  folks on the other side what a great radio voice that guy had we're on the

[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.800]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.120]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.080]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:21.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.760]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.520]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:50.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.680]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go

[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.560]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.400]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.560]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.320]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.920]  Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.040]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.920]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.760]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the

[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:16.120]  this transmission you are the resistance extremism and defense of liberty is no
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:26.400]  vice okay Sean Chris Richard John Julio everybody calling I guess works in radio
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:32.200]  engineers you name it I don't want to miss the forest for the trees yes EAS is
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.720]  wrong yes it's indentured servitude of the federal government yes stations
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:40.360]  spend incredible amounts of money even big ones fiddling and and yelling and
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:47.760]  yes it's not right but they do it cussing the EAS system but that's not for me
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.080]  even the issue okay sure it's free market it's an issue of liberty on that
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:57.360]  front they are announcing that they're going to force you now to listen to
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.840]  presidential and FEMA and Homeland Security fear mongering reports that
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:09.080]  is out of a science fiction movie of tyranny in every dystopic novel written
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.600]  about a future tyranny the government has telescreens everywhere telling you
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:17.360]  to fear your neighbors and and and and telling you to spy on people I mean it's
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.520]  like they're using 1984 as a handbook and and here's the issue when I'm going
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.160]  to your calls when Obama was super hot when Obama was the savior and had an
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.000]  80 plus percent national approval rating during the end of the campaign in the
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.600]  first month when he got elected when people thought they were gonna get free
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.400]  houses free cars that that he was like a leprechaun you know that was just gonna
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.520]  give them everything they wanted you know the pot of gold at the end of a
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:49.040]  rainbow his videos on YouTube would get 300,000 a million two million views when
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.120]  you go to White House gov videos that are three months old have like two three
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.520]  thousand views his new videos have a couple hundred they can't shovel this
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:01.320]  stuff you go to Homeland Security website unless we link to one of their
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.600]  videos to point out the police state it gets like 300 views in a month no one
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.040]  wants to listen to them no one wants to not even the mind-numbed you know
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.160]  mainline liberals and and for all you liberals out there that are loving this
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.720]  takeover the media and Cass Sunstein calling to arrest people that criticize
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.920]  command-may-global warming and all of this and those are all on record and the
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.320]  FCC diversities are saying we should be like Hugo Chavez and shut down
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.520]  conservative media what do you think's gonna happen when a Republican gets in
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.760]  this this is done by the military industrial complex complex the big banks
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.680]  that have taken our country over this is a system that they put in under
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:44.440]  Clinton that's continued right through with Bush and now Obama and they cite
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.920]  executive orders under nuclear war from the 60s as their pretext in these
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.440]  government documents to do it but the issue is this was all going on under the
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.360]  surface so if you weren't in media and you didn't know engineers and station
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.800]  managers and owners you didn't know about it I put it in my 99 film police
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.280]  state 2000 now they're announcing they're gonna start forcing you to hear
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.240]  these announcements and who who grandstands at the Super Bowl at press
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.360]  conference at the press conference like she's a celebrity up there with movie
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.400]  stars Janet Napolitano saying spy on each other they're forcing their way
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.080]  into our lives like our new pastime is worshipping government and spying on
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.920]  each other because no one wants to listen to them no one buys what they're
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.120]  saying it isn't enough the billion spent for propaganda placement in TV not
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.240]  just ads but messages in the shows it's not enough all the reporters they've
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.400]  bought off remember Armstrong Williams that's the tip of the iceberg getting a
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.920]  quarter million bucks to go around and push stuff for the White House secretly
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.560]  this is full spectrum takeover of the media they're announcing your online
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.640]  video games government messages will be forced on your cell phones everything
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:57.520]  okay enough of me I just wanted to lay that out this is about them making so you
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.240]  choose to tune into this show you choose to tune into the local station because
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.040]  you like what it has to say you get value from it they're forcing you to
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.760]  hear from them and they're putting these systems in with taxpayer money and
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.320]  using coercion to make everybody go along with this and that's not enough
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.080]  for them now with the Walmart checkout line now at the shopping mall checkout
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.720]  line now at the county square now everywhere you're going to be subjected
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.840]  to this I'm gonna be subjected to this orwellian nightmare let's talk to
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.560]  Sean and Ohio then Chris Richard John Julio and others well I gotta move quick
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.280]  because I know you guys are busy Sean in Ohio you're on the air hey how you doing
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.680]  Alex I'm just didn't get any sleep I'm so freaked out about this because it's
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.120]  we know the systems there the fact that they would start rolling it out I mean
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:46.800]  this is red alert crazy yeah I heard you saying you're up all made about it
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.680]  I'm not surprised at all you don't hear that they're gonna start using it for
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.080]  these kind of things I'm working up here like I'm up in Northeast Ohio we get a
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.800]  lot of bad weather up here so when the when there's like a real bad storm
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.680]  coming through you know they'll break through with that the EAS will break
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.000]  through whatever programming's on and you know they'll if your station doesn't
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.040]  have even better feeds and partnerships with the local TV news weather people as
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.560]  if you need their report you know that I mean like two days after a flood
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.400]  they're still popping in saying a flood's coming and again they use
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.560]  reasonable things like floods or kidnapped kids to set the precedent as I
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.600]  said over a decade ago now it's spy on your neighbor sorry go ahead no it's
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.120]  cool yeah that's that's exactly exactly that's really the only good thing that
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.800]  it was for but now I you know I'm not like I said I'm not surprised at all to
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:38.080]  hear them and now that they're gonna start using it to you know say put out
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.960]  these messages to everybody because yeah like the caller before me said if you
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:45.880]  were supposed to log you know once a week at least once a week you know one
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.280]  scheduled test and then they monthly they'll run a test on their own battle
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.440]  just break in to the DJs talking you know but yeah if we don't if we don't
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.800]  schedule those yes is at least once a week you know we'll get fine thousand
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.840]  you know thousand dollars or a couple thousand dollars and we're a small
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.680]  station too you know we don't we only cover by 60 70 mile radius I'd say Sean
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.760]  what do you think of the fact that they have got the nerve now to say they're
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.180]  gonna be breaking in on our cell phones with audio and text messages imagine
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:19.120]  just Obama you're sitting there having dinner and Obama starts telling you about
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.680]  terrorists and you better give all your rights up to him yeah yeah I know that's
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:27.560]  that's the last thing I wanted you know go going through like a big company like
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.400]  Verizon you know it's here if I don't get enough bad shit from them already it's
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.160]  like I said all right I appreciate your call
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.680]  okay let's go ahead and talk to Chris in North Carolina Chris you're on the
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.880]  air go ahead what do you do in the media I'm a program director Alex it's a
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:51.800]  pleasure to talk with you I'm a fairly new listener to your program so I want
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.800]  to thank you for doing what you're doing it got a couple questions for you go
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.480]  ahead now is your program required to air this are you gonna run it absolutely
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.520]  not absolutely not and and and you know why I don't have a broadcast tower on
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:11.400]  top of the facility that I'm in I send it up to a satellite and then FCC
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:17.160]  regulated systems pick it up but yes yes under these architecture they've put
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:24.040]  in all broadband all cell phones all internet websites and they already have
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.680]  this technology will have break-ins and messages or they'll just turn the
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.080]  internet off so no I'm not gonna do anything the FCC says they don't have
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:40.280]  jurisdiction over me but yeah we follow the FCC rules because we already you
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:43.800]  know don't have a pottymouth program again they set the president with oh you
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.600]  can't have cuss words because it sounds reasonable then it's oh you can't bash
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.480]  people politically see and then they set that precedent I know now reading
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.640]  article on radio world it's saying here that all EAS participants have until
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.120]  September 30th of this year to implement cap am I reading that properly that
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.240]  this isn't going to happen before September 30th well there are literally
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.640]  scores of federal agencies all arguing with each other what we know is under
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:16.360]  the 96 telecommunications act that I've been screaming bloody murder over ever
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:22.640]  since it said every cell phone every computer device that receives either
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:28.560]  plugged into the internet or or wireless will have default codes that when
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.080]  they receive this government code that the computer or cell phone device will
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.680]  be taken over it said in the specs that's how we knew it then people couldn't
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.080]  believe it now of course there's newscast all the time going hey the
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.080]  government's listening to you on your phone even when it's off hey the
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.960]  government's using your on-star to listen to you you know they can break in
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.520]  and use that microphone hey there's going to be government announcements on
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:55.640]  your cell phone the FCC is trying to push all the manufacturers of clock
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.560]  radios a radio clock radios to where there's a little chip in there where it
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.680]  automatically turns on for quote weather alerts because all the tornadoes coming
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:13.280]  your way so they have the EAS in place I mean you can go to info wars calm and
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:20.000]  read our article Obama launches total takeover of media and then it links to
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:27.840]  federal radio and federal radio of course is group stations in the DC area
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.960]  FCC presidential emergency alerts to be tested and they have the FCC FEMA
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.240]  spokesperson in a little five minute or so audio clip and we're linked to this
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.480]  up on info wars calm where they talk about how yes in the next few months
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.240]  they are integrating now a top-down system where it's all centrally controlled
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.480]  they could always break in with that but it was before regionally run by FEMA
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.080]  now it's all going to be run out of the White House FEMA homeland security and
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.440]  they announced there that they're going to now begin breaking in with actual
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:06.120]  presidential announcements not just the test announcement that someday you might
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.880]  hear an announcement during an emergency is that clear it very clear the
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.920]  EAS has always kind of been a hassle to me however it's absolutely insane what's
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.800]  going on here but the question is how do you fight it can we fight it what do you
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.840]  do the information is great but what's next how do we fight it man let's put
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:29.240]  our heads together we need to lobby Congress station owners managers we have
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:34.800]  a right broadcasters listeners have a right to our free speech to say we
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.680]  don't like the fact that the FCC has been wanting the fairness doctrine that
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.640]  the FCC saying they have jurisdiction over the internet they've already put
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.080]  the controls in now they just want the legalese done that that that we don't
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.160]  want them politicizing this system that's already unconstitutional and
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:58.240]  and basically using it for political partisan gain and both political
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:02.480]  parties and independence shouldn't be for it and you need to when you go to
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.360]  your North Carolina Association of Broadcasters or your Texas Association
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.840]  of Broadcasters that have a lot of power you guys need to say look let's talk
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.000]  about I mean I'm every station person I've ever talked to is completely angry
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.920]  about this and they did trial balloons two other times telling them get ready
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.760]  for the government to routinely break in with longer announcements and they're
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:29.160]  also talking about in the Senate Jay Rockefeller's talking about government
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:33.360]  controlled cable TV that basically mandates what can be said and done
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.760]  there I mean he said we'd be better off without ever having the internet that
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.960]  he'd like to quote shut down Fox News and MSNBC so we get the word out I mean
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.480]  look you guys have the media what and if you don't use it to save it we're gonna
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.880]  lose it I mean you'll use the First Amendment as they're trying to shut it
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.280]  down because the First Amendment meant to defeat the First Amendment when they
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.760]  tried to get rid of free speech is every corrupt decadent empire always tries
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:08.680]  to do you're right well I I really appreciate all that you do and I'm
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.200]  gonna research this more continue listening to you guys but you know
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.000]  you're great what you do Alex and I really appreciate it Chris you're great
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.160]  and I appreciate your call but I mean I'm not I'm just doing my duty here people
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:23.880]  are always like you're doing such a great job Alex look obviously if the
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:29.600]  government says oh we want you to have a local station wired into FEMA in case
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.560]  there's a nuclear attack you know we're gonna break in with these alerts I mean
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.800]  that's been going on before FEMA existed under COG continuity of government
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:42.840]  it's been going on since the 50s but then the stations tuned to the station
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.600]  and if they tuned in and saw some dictator saying I am your leader turn in
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.520]  your guns you better believe that the other stations would get on and say
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.960]  don't listen to it it's tyranny they don't want to trust you with the power
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.800]  of your own free speech in your own station that's why they make you wire in
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:07.520]  the final chain at the broadcast tower everything through it so it's there and
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.560]  and you know I've got this clip but I'm gonna play it later when Tyrell Ventura
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.880]  is on with it because I want to get the rest of your calls but I have the sheriff
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.080]  from out in Louisiana there in the New Orleans talking about FEMA cutting the
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.920]  police radio tower and then the police came and said the sheriffs why'd you do
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.680]  this we need these radios everybody said oh the police in New Orleans and the
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.600]  county police they just stood down and walked off the job no it turned out FEMA
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:41.320]  as the storm hit ran cell phone jammers that's on record that's mainstream news
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.440]  you can pull it up FEMA ran cell phone jammers during Katrina as it hit
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:53.440]  then they went in with axes and hacked up the police sheriff and police
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:58.200]  department towers they don't want your local government being in place what do
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.760]  you think the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says it says the
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.760]  federal government's preparing for sedition in the states and by governors
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.600]  and Obama has created a 10-member governors council so he can claim the
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.240]  governors are showing control but those 10 appointed governors have the power
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.520]  over the 10 FEMA regions this all it's all covered police state for the rise of
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.360]  FEMA that came out last year we covered this again the whole spectrum you've
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.960]  got to get all the pieces to see it man this is really freaking me out because
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:29.360]  they're announcing now that they're gonna start having these announcements now if
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.000]  we don't go along with they'll back off but we've got to keep fighting Richard
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.280]  in California thanks for holding are you an engineer talk show host of what are
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.400]  you doing right here yeah I'm an engineer I work at a TV station right here in LA
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:49.480]  and I've been there since the old days of the EBS when it was it was an AM
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.400]  receiver tuned to local station here and it was voluntary that we shut our
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.240]  transmitter off and you know let people tune to to the local AM station to get
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:06.720]  all the information but since 96 this EAS thing has become mandatory and here
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.720]  recently within the last I say the last six months or so we've had to keep a
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.800]  log of all those printouts and that thing prints out constantly no little
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.960]  tape that comes out notice yeah no notice though it's always more more more
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.840]  even during the Cold War imminent nuclear war it was voluntary and now oh
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.680]  you got to have it and now by the way we're gonna start making some little
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:36.000]  announcements and at Walmart tell a screen see it's about forcing their way
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.840]  in and they really forced their way in and like I said we have to now keep a
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:48.280]  complete log of it and and the tape that comes out in the 24-hour period is
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.280]  maybe 10 feet long and like I say it's a constant every hour something is
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.280]  printing out now I know working in radio stations that federal box just sits
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:02.160]  there everything wired through it so you know the last piece in the chain and
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.840]  it's just spitting out orders I mean it's incredible and one other thing I'll
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.600]  let you know too is the V chip that they put in the TVs yes they are able to
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.000]  break into your TV with that oh I know that's the 1996 telecommunications act
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.960]  every cell phone every TV in 96 they they said here's the mandate all
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.080]  manufacturers by 2001 it has to be in place a lot of cell phones a lot of
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.720]  TVs had it immediately now everything's got it and that's why they want you on
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.000]  digital TV because if you were still picking up old-fashioned broadcast that
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.800]  meant you had an old you know tube television you liked my mom still got
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.360]  one that you know that we haven't I was a kid in the kitchen she just loves it
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.360]  and it still works but it won't work now because of the digital feed but I mean
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.960]  do you see that the dastardliness of this yeah I see it but like it's like the
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.080]  people around me they're going on it's no big deal I give you one example on

[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.760]  some website and I'm thinking what's going on here maybe she left the
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:20.600]  computer on but we found out that thing was logging itself on hold you over

[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:19.200]  we're gonna put on screen for you for Pennsylvania where the school district
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:25.160]  settled for taking thousands over 30,000 photos and videos of children they
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:33.440]  settled for $610,000 now how did we discover this last year the school came
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.160]  out and called parents and said we've been watching your children and they
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:45.600]  and they said what they said yeah we we we can turn the video camera on and we
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:51.280]  can video them or take still shots of it I remember about seven years ago in
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:58.520]  Tennessee it was headline in the news panic caused when girls basketball team
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.000]  finds camera and shower and the parents were still normal and not brainwashed
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.840]  they went what's going on was a visiting team but the local school was
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.080]  brainwashed because they'd announced it and told everybody you know that was in
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:12.480]  there they said well we have fights sometimes in the showers same thing
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.400]  happened in the capital of California Sacramento that it turned out the police
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.600]  were accessing the bathroom cams folks this is so and and I've had people
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.280]  come to me on the street and say schools aren't watching kids over their
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.840]  laptops you're a liar they won't even search it that will put the headline
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.600]  back on screen Pennsylvania school settles to webcam spy lawsuits for 610k
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.760]  the point is this is all hardwired and everything Google announced five years
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:45.120]  ago that they are now accessing the camera and the microphone connect that
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:50.320]  sold millions of video games from Microsoft the platform has cameras
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.320]  voice recognition and admits they're watching and listening to you in your
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.360]  home it's hooked to the internet but but see it isn't just this EAS system
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.960]  finishing up with Richard then John who legal and on I gotta move quick now
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:06.040]  apologize it just trying to give everybody all the data here of how big
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.480]  this is Richard in California finishing up your point about your
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:15.640]  daughter's laptop getting a hijacked yeah my daughter's laptop Saturday it got
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:22.360]  hijacked somebody kept turning it on and and the some application she downloaded
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:29.120]  for a video chat it kept logging on and you know my daughter wasn't at home and
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.960]  I'm wondering what's going on here don't let your children be on computers
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.840]  unless you're unless you're standing right above them I'm not criticizing you
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:41.160]  I mean they're ubiquitous but you've got a I remember people I remember media 10
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:46.320]  years ago being in my office and laughing at me because all the laptops that
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.920]  had cameras or computers with cameras had sticky tape over them and they were
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:56.960]  like oh the government's watching you oh isn't it funny but now it's all
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.800]  admitted yes I'll admit it you're right you're right and thanks a lot Richard
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:06.760]  thank you God bless you I mean folks this is beyond 1984 they think they've got
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.080]  us now they're putting telescreens in that the shopping mall telling you to
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.880]  watch your neighbors you're walking by there's government announcements saying
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:18.720]  watch people I mean this isn't freedom John in Texas what do you do in the
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:24.120]  media I actually own a hosting company okay so what's your view on all the
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:31.000]  hardwired stuff they're putting in it's scary and it's not good and it goes in
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.240]  with the whole you know non-neutral Internet and just the control they're
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.360]  putting over all you know on top of us and you know we're seeing a lot of
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.240]  consolidation in the market you're seeing you know Verizon and Time Warner
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:48.120]  Telecom buying you know managed service provider cloud computing companies so
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.800]  you know not only are they going to have you know control the transmission but
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.520]  they'll have physical access to the servers that's right they're forcing the
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:58.480]  full integration away from you having your own servers or separate servers to
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:02.720]  giant connoisseur in clouds for those that don't know show that you can't even
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:06.800]  use a computer and physically hold the data yourself to be accessed it's got
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:12.480]  to be in the cloud exactly and you know we're seeing more and more of this but
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.160]  I'm seeing you know bigger companies you know getting into the game even
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.480]  Microsoft and Google themselves you know they're making big cloud plays and now
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.360]  you know of course you're seeing the telecommunication giants doing the same
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:30.560]  thing amazing do you have any other comments John no I mean just you know
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.280]  the dangers of net neutrality you know them being able to control you know

[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:31.440]  to end that neutrality and that means in true free access of the web as we know
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:36.880]  it yeah absolutely and I mean each of what we just saw is a most extreme
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.200]  example of you know what net neutrality or not net neutrality can lead to yeah
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.160]  well the internet to stated plan is to slowly kill the original true web great
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.040]  to hear from you let's talk to Don in New York Don you're on the air hey how
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.640]  are you good thanks for holding what are you doing media I'm a installer

[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.320]  well you know what honestly I've seen it a while back already I've had to put
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:08.440]  them in you know high school stations and in college stations in my area it's
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:14.280]  you know it's nothing new I I totally don't agree with it but you know you
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.240]  know what can you do against it I did want to tell you something about where
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:24.400]  I work now I'm not gonna tell you where it is over the phone but I see I see
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:28.520]  Homeland Security getting involved in a lot of things on a very large level here
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:32.160]  and if you want to call me back I could talk to you sir they've tried to recruit
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:35.840]  my dad and then he thought it was maybe a setup because he's my dad he went and
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.440]  talked to the other dentist and Homeland Security separately had visited him in
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.520]  his home saying spy on your neighbors I mean this they're getting ready for
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.160]  full takeover it's now happening I totally agree with you what I'm saying is
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.400]  I'm a conference room manager and I fortunately or unfortunately get to
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.520]  hear all kinds of stuff at at the company I'm working for and you'd probably
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:58.880]  be interested in some of it but that's up to you well yes sir the problem is
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:03.680]  we've kind of announced it here and I I mean you got to know my it's talking to
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.360]  me on the phone there's probably 10 agencies listening now that you've
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.440]  said it just just I mean obviously they're now saying I've got another
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:14.000]  report here the federal government's announced that if the citizens look at
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.680]  WikiLeaks documents online it's an act of espionage in fact I know that's in

[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.960]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:20.000]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:25.360]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:30.280]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:34.680]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.360]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:47.920]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:15.600]  we have had the FCC diversities are say that the government should censor media
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.800]  in the u.s. like Hugo Chavez we can play that clip for him it's been all over the
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:24.280]  news for a year we've got Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are saying
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.520]  arrest people or at least put a tax on quote conspiracy theories and he went
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:35.040]  on to say like not believing in man-made global warming we've had internal
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.240]  pressure and I've been asked to not get into all the details you know you're
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:40.720]  told things in confidence and then you're asked not to get into it in full
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.080]  detail because of you know confidence as you put been brought into but now
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.360]  Jesse Ventura months ago on the show did say yes it got censored Homeland
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:53.360]  Security pressure on Time Warner the parent company of true TV to not
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:59.400]  re-air the incredible police state show that dealt with FEMA takeover 10 regions
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:05.420]  the FEMA governors the threat fusion centers the whole EAS system and now
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:11.400]  Obama announces yesterday on federal news radio presidential emergency
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:16.680]  alerts to be tested you know that emergency alert hardwired the government
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:19.000]  could take over every station in the country they're announcing they're gonna
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.040]  have forced alerts on your cell phone video alerts on your iPhone or droid
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.320]  break-ins on your computer telescreens at 9,000 locations now going in they're
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.640]  in hundreds of locations already at the checkout line saying watch your
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.120]  neighbors don't trust other shoppers this is right out of the running man that
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:39.640]  Jesse Ventura was in where sorts of acres walking around and seeing
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:44.120]  announcements about report on your parents kids get a bonus you know payment
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:50.160]  from the government it's incredible and joining us for the rest of the hour is
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:55.560]  Tyrell Ventura I talked to Ty over the weekend just about the future of the show
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:58.800]  will there be a third season of conspiracy theory hit show with Jesse
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.720]  Ventura and so he's gonna be talking about that today obviously Jesse is
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:07.000]  gonna be on with us when he first starts doing media when he gets back in
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.800]  early April he'll talk more about the TSA lawsuit the groping I have witnessed
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:18.160]  and I could be a witness and I saw him go in between his legs and in Atlanta
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:21.520]  and he said it got even worse in Minneapolis in another flight he was
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.760]  in that's in his lawsuit so where he Tyrell's here to talk about that as
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:30.560]  well and just all things New World order Tyrell Ventura of course has produced
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.560]  a lot of films on his own other TV programs very accomplished videographer
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:40.160]  you name it and I look forward to working with Tyrell on our own ventures in
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.440]  the future because he's just a very informed interesting guy and so I just
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.520]  wanted to get him back on with us to talk about all of that but dealing with
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:54.360]  censorship there's so many layers of it now for the Tucson shooting tie we saw
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:57.880]  the media trying to blame conservatives liberals the media when the guy was out
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:02.160]  of his mind schizophrenic that's now admitted who hated politics and was
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:06.160]  into the occult and taking hallucinogens every day but we see this
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.120]  full push to tell us to sit down and shut up and don't be angry about what's
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:14.960]  happening yeah and be scared of your neighbor because you know God forbid we
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:20.240]  talk to each other anymore you know you know yeah yeah it's it's it's it's
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:23.920]  frightening it's out there you know but we we know as long as we stay vigilant
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.520]  and aware of it and keep talking about it and hold their feet to fire you know
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.240]  we'll hopefully weather the storm you know even when you talked earlier about
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.320]  the show that got you know never was rebroadcast in the police state show
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.800]  that the thing that I you know you can't really censor something anymore and
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:44.680]  today's world I mean that shows all over the internet and people can see it if
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.640]  they look for it so that's the good news you know the bad news is yeah you know
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.840]  the more forms of communication the more avenues they can to propagandize
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:55.920]  less of a society you know and that's what we got to pay attention to and try
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:01.400]  to try to be able to see through all of their all the propaganda well you there
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.840]  were some groundbreaking episodes I think the second season was even more
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.360]  hardcore than the last but millions of viewers per episode they air these
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:14.120]  things 30 40 times afterwards so we're talking about audiences in the tens of
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:19.760]  millions that police state episode really scared the system and for those
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:23.760]  that don't know what happened as much as you can tell folks I mean I know the
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.600]  full story you know the full story we can't we've been asked to get into all
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.240]  of it or to respond to the congressman who's who's been attacking but I have
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.720]  responded separately because he's been attacking your father and and man and
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.800]  myself and others but as much as you can tell folks about the pressures that
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:44.320]  were exerted well you know it's interesting when we're doing the show
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.400]  and that all went down you know we're putting show out you know week after
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.920]  week so when it happened it kind of happens so quickly that we didn't
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:54.400]  really have time to think about it or pay attention to because we're on to the
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.280]  next show you know once once the show is locked in there you know we we have to
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.720]  you know look at putting the next show on the air so we didn't really have a
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.840]  lot of time to reflect on that because it would have you know damaged our
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:09.040]  ability to make our next show because they can't spend all day worrying because
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:13.200]  you're busy editing these and tweaking them right up to broadcast yeah yeah I
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.320]  mean you know that I mean we want to make sure we get as much good content in
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.680]  there as possible with each show so we're you know we're busting our humps doing
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:24.840]  that you know reflecting on it now it's kind of like I said earlier I mean if
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.320]  anything it brought I mean controversy if anything is good because it brought
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.520]  more attention to the show if they didn't want people to pay attention to
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:37.800]  it they they should have just ignored it you know but you know we upset the
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:44.200]  representative Cohn and Senator Cohn and then he started yelling and
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.840]  hollering to the heavens and then you know just recently we saw the kind of
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:52.520]  hypocritical aspect of him and you know in referring to yelling at people for
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:55.720]  referring to people as Nazis and then he turns around does the same thing and
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.200]  then doesn't see the hypocrisy in it but you know ultimately the show's out there
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.600]  and you can see it which is which is the important thing you know and and it was
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.720]  an amazing show to work on and definitely eye-opening and you know thank
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:12.480]  you again for your help you know and then help you again for your work on the
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:17.040]  show that was very very the great show on my favorites of the year very powerful
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.160]  you know I didn't call you guys and congratulate you on the other episodes
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:23.400]  they were all excellent but remember I called your dad that night I called you
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:27.200]  I called Breverman and I said I said I can't believe this just went on air
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.080]  this is groundbreaking I mean I was doing cartwheels yeah it was it was great
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.800]  it was I mean this whole last season was a great season I mean I was really
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:40.520]  happy with you know you know and let me say this too I was really happy working
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:45.120]  with True TV you know they they've you know gone on a limb for us and put us
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:50.240]  on the air and have been very supportive of us and then you know apart from you
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.960]  know crazy moments like the police state thing or whatever you know they they've
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.560]  really they haven't censored us and they have never you know dictated content
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:01.800]  to us well exactly I mean the head of the network pledged to your dad that
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:04.920]  they've never had censorship and there would be no problem and then this was a
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.240]  wake-up call for them when higher-ups above them with homeland security and
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:13.960]  congressional pressure pulled the episode and I've seen some other interesting
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.560]  things the other more hardcore episodes I've noticed aren't being aired as much
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.960]  so the system I mean you guys have the deathbed confession of E Howard Hunt
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:26.080]  first time on national television I mean you did so much groundbreaking things
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:31.040]  but we should you know try to support and and and contact True TV we're gonna
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:36.120]  give out numbers and websites later and and addresses to put counter pressure
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:40.320]  on to make sure a third season comes up and to try to get police state back on
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:45.720]  the air but tie for those that don't know about the episode encapsulate that
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.240]  episode and what was covered there what you thought was most most disturbing
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:54.840]  about that piece well you saw you saw essentially that the chain of information
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.720]  and how it flows through if government wants to spy on you and then
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:02.480]  ultimately what could happen if the wrong people get in power and then you
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:05.320]  know that's the biggest thing is that you know when you have when you're
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.440]  building FEMA camps you know initially yeah they might be or you know helping
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:13.060]  people in terms of you know natural disaster and things like that but the
[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:17.760]  wording in the bill you know leaves it very open to be at the discretion of
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.440]  the head of Homeland Security and that's a dangerous thing because you know we
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:26.360]  kind of have this this weird feeling that you know every elected person is
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.040]  always a good person you know and that's not true sometimes you know you can
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.720]  have a rotten egg like an A fastball look at history or you can have a whole
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:37.400]  barrel of rotten eggs or bear a whole barrel of it and if you get the wrong
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:41.560]  people in power and you don't and you don't specifically and you leave bills
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:46.200]  especially in terms of building you know camps and things like that and you
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:51.040]  leave them so how do you say lightly worded and so open-ended for what they
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.320]  can be used for in the bill you know that that that's you know that that way
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.320]  leaving the chicken coop open for a fox to come in and eat all the
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.160]  chicken well I mean more than that you show the congressional hearings where
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:06.760]  they admitted these camps will be for citizens you show the mainstream news
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.520]  articles where they said it could be for civil unrest and that's what they're
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:17.240]  drilling and training for I mean so so and the way Cohen tried to deny that the
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:21.920]  bill existed till your dad handed it to him and he goes oh yes I do believe I
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:26.360]  mean he was like a something out of a you know old southern movie or something
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:31.560]  and like you know one of the women shows that these guys I don't think he even
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:35.000]  remembered or even thought of putting it in there and it just shows how Lynn he's
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.120]  a co-sponsor of the bill I think it just shows how very little politicians pay
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.060]  attention to what they're doing out there you know they see a bill oh that
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:46.480]  sounds nice let's push it through not reading the wording of it not reading
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:50.480]  and you know what's behind it and things like that but tie tie you gave them the
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:55.640]  out you gave them the out in the show saying that would that oh I bet he didn't
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.360]  know about it but I mean watching him in the video he'd be you're talking like
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:05.400]  scarlet from the wind he's like oh I do declare now I do remember that bail
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:10.240]  first he's like you mean space aliens are gonna come down and eat midget Governor
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:15.040]  Ventura and he's like no I'm not worried about space aliens I'm I'm worried
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:20.960]  about these camps there's no bail oh wait I do remember this bail now I mean
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:26.440]  he looks so guilty I'm sorry I mean I that's that's you know you put it you
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.560]  know you put it on television and that's what happens you know I mean you know
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:35.840]  you know I mean I you know I've had the show speaks for itself in my opinion I
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:39.800]  and like I said it's one of my favorites because we really hit you know all the
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:45.200]  major elements from the fusion centers to the camps to the very creepy coffins
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:49.760]  and then you know and it was it was a great show to put on the air along with
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:54.400]  all the other fantastic shows we did this last year and well he also said on
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:19:01.200]  how dare them say the government might release a bio weapon how dare them when
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.160]  we have all these admitted secret tests in the syphilis and the atomic soldiers
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.140]  that just came out our government was shooting up kids in Guatemala with
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:14.640]  syphilis I mean how dare him go how dare you Tyrell well you know I mean I
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.360]  think there's people that truly believe that the governments do no wrong in
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.840]  life and so idiotic you know I mean it boggles the mind that people can be
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:29.720]  either so naive or you know when they're caught red-handed doing something
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:33.400]  wrong no no you know they'll forever deny and make counteract you caught me
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:39.840]  red-handed Tyrell you and your wicked father Jesse Ventura all right I'm gonna
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:44.080]  stop tie stay there I want to talk about what some of your favorite episodes

[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:25.560]  imitation and Ventura is giving him the bill and he's just saying space monsters
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:29.320]  are coming down out of big green machines I don't know about them he goes
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:34.120]  I'm not talking about space monsters and he goes here's the bill he goes oh I do
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:39.360]  remember that here it is like me there isn't one FEMA camp of these in the
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.920]  United States right now there are not why is it in that bill what is exactly in
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.160]  the bill it's talks about building FEMA camps doesn't it that particular bill
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:56.120]  that we're talking about I would have I'd like to see the bill isn't this guy a
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:02.960]  co-sponsor of the bill what's the bill number
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:08.040]  city of the weekend built within the United States how can a bill state that
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.760]  there'll be six FEMA camps built in the United States and then I'm being told
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.640]  there are none well I think you know I think I recall now something about this
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:21.560]  and I and if I'm correct I think those are our locations for if there's a
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.040]  disaster like in Katrina think that's what it is it's not any kind of a
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:31.320]  concentration camp or anything to round up citizens thinks that's what it is the
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:35.640]  bill that he co-sponsored says the use of the camps will be determined by the
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:41.000]  secretary of Homeland Security they can come and go as they please they won't be
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  locked no they can go in and out because the place I saw in Texas is locked
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.360]  you can't go in and out of it no comment and it was not probably not being used
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.240]  either for a couple we have films of children playing on the swings and the
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.680]  slides and stuff and this one technically falls under Homeland Security
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:01.840]  well I don't know I haven't been there and I don't know who the children are
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:06.520]  and the children are probably very happy where have not that's enough for Ty this
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:11.320]  is a short segment long one coming up to get into everything but I mean I don't
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:15.640]  know what he's so angry about I mean you guys were very fair with him yeah no we
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:20.360]  were we were you know he's angry because he got caught in the deer in the
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.600]  headlights you know and then he didn't he didn't know you know he didn't know
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:28.720]  what was in his own bill until we had to remind him you know and then you know
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:34.000]  politicians don't exactly like that when you when you when you catch them not
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.280]  prepared and when you catch them you know when you show them for their
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:43.880]  true colors of now twice on the tape exactly twice on the tape tie he talks
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:47.720]  about green monsters coming out of machines did he do that more in the
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:53.200]  full interview I mean that was pretty weird you know I mean we put you know
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.520]  base the bulk of the interview on there and and and you know essentially you
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.000]  know it's just it's you know it gives a back to that simple fact is that you
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.720]  know these a lot of people just refuse to believe that government that their
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.160]  government can do bad things and then that that the people that there can be
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:14.360]  bad people in government and and and give them the tools to be bad they
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.080]  couldn't take advantage of it and really you know rape and pillage the nation if
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:21.520]  they want to I think what really upset them was your dad at the end saying
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:25.440]  think it can't happen here it already has you think you got 50 states we got
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:32.200]  10 FEMA regions run by 10 governors you didn't vote for power power exactly you
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:35.520]  know if they're not afraid to keep it all above board let us you know let the
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.040]  house have transparency in government and let's see what they're doing so that
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:42.800]  way we can be informed populace and then make the votes and then do things
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:46.080]  that count but you know truthfully when it's all sudden done you know this
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.840]  country's run by its corporate handlers and then we don't we don't you know we
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:52.760]  get the we have the illusion of choice and we have the illusion of that but we
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:56.920]  really don't have any choice and then you know it's it we just have to you
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:01.520]  know get that back and then like to get our country back what is your favorite
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:06.360]  episode of the eight episodes my truthful favorite in a storytelling and
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.880]  and and I mean they're all great fantastic you know great information great
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:15.400]  entertainment my true favorite is probably the JFK show yeah you know it
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.920]  it was the one where when we finished you know and then Jesse saw the cut of it
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.880]  before it went to air and then you know that that felt really proud that he he
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:28.960]  could finally have his name on that you know on that on that conspiracy was
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:32.600]  able to present new information and then that you know the ground big breaking
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:36.240]  confession to be Howard Hunt and and you know that's been a lifelong passion of
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:41.840]  his JFK and then for him to be able to put a show out there that stated his
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:47.280]  viewpoints on it and and and stated true you know fact about the case you know
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.240]  that really really really had a lot them in his life and so as a son and also as
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:56.800]  someone working with him to see that kind of good feeling and happiness for
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:00.280]  my dad for being able to put that show together meant a lot and that that's
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:04.760]  probably the most you know the show that impacted me the most this year what's
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:09.760]  your next favorite my next favorite by the police state just because it was so

[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:21.560]  got a feature film coming out that you've directed that has got some major
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:26.360]  New World Order veins in it tell us about that well I didn't direct it I
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.600]  actually had the great honor and pleasure of working with a fantastic
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:32.600]  writer director named Layton Matthew that's right you produced it then I
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:37.040]  forgot yeah yeah I helped him produce it along with Tiffany Conner and then you
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:40.240]  know that he's put together a hell of a great movie we're in post-production
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:44.400]  right now and then it's been a great honor working with him and he's been
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:48.320]  he's a fellow Texan you know comes from my east Texas and we're able to you know
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:52.080]  I get some good visuals out there and then shoot a lot back here in LA and
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.920]  it's coming together really nicely so that's kind of what I've been doing in
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:59.320]  my in my office even when not working on conspiracy theory and like I said it's
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:02.920]  a great honor working with him and watching him you know watching him
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:07.560]  create a hell of a movie I do are we able to talk about the name of the film or
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:11.120]  yeah it's called The Wanderers and you know we're we're just it's been an
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.280]  independent film and we're you know in post-production right now and then
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:18.960]  editing away and then you know having a lot of fun and it's really coming
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:22.280]  together nicely I can't wait for everyone to see it and we have some great
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.920]  great stuff in it we're able to get you know some really good that we have a
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:30.440]  great character in it who's who's a you know fantastic runs a pirate TV
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:35.600]  broadcast and then talks about New World Order and then you know things like
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:39.560]  that and it's a great that's a really great dramatic fantastic show and I
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:42.800]  can't wait for it to get out there into the world and for people to see it and
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:46.920]  you know and for people to take notice of it I think it'll be a great movie so
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.560]  another way through fiction to wake people up exactly yeah I mean you I
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:55.680]  mean you know I think it's the you have to do that you know you can tell an
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:59.520]  entertaining story and also educate people at the same time which is what
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:04.080]  that we as filmmakers try to do which we need a little bit more of I think in
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.320]  filmmaking right now I think it's a little too popcorn a little too crazy
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:12.040]  right now we need we need some really good heartfelt drama that educates us
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:15.280]  and gets us to feel and you know that's why we go to the movies that's why I
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.800]  love this business so much can you tell us a little bit about the plot yeah I
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:24.120]  said roughly about a man who we see at the beginning of the movie and he's
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:29.760]  you know kind of crazed on drugs and then going nuts and the next moment you
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:33.440]  see him in the film and he wakes up in Texas and has no memory of who he is
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.760]  and he finds a brother who doesn't like him and he spends the rest of the movie
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.440]  trying to discover who his old self was and the more he discovers the more he
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:49.800]  dislikes and then is frightened by by who he was in the past and it's a great
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:55.080]  kind of mystery and an adventure and then so then ultimately a really great
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:59.560]  piece about two brothers trying to reconnect with each other and it's gonna
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.480]  be a fun movie I think that people really enjoy it sounds like a little
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:08.600]  mind controls in there maybe you just have to watch the movie and find out and
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:12.160]  when is it gonna start being in film festivals and stuff so folks can see it
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.960]  I really can't say right now like I said we're just finishing up in the middle
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:20.920]  post-production right now but but hopefully you know sometimes summer
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:23.840]  fall that that kind of thing you know as soon as we can get it done and we're
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.680]  all happy with that we'll start putting down with a guy promise me that you and
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.640]  the director you the producer and the director will come on the show and if
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:34.760]  you're in Texas come in studio with us oh we'd love to that'd be a fantastic
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:38.640]  fantastic interview I can't wait for you to see the film now now I want to get
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.200]  into your father in the TSA people really want to hear about that but but
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.240]  finishing up with the future of the show I'm sure you know and I was sent
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:49.160]  internal documents from a cable company it is true there were also orders sent
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:55.560]  out for DVRs to be remotely contacted and to erase the police state episode and
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.320]  now other episodes of the show show a have you heard anything about this
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:04.840]  because talking to you on the phone I forgot to bring this up to you I'm just
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:09.360]  now bringing it up to your live on air really I don't know anything about that
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:13.760]  so it's kind of hard for me to comment on that yeah I mean I know the cycle of
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.200]  television they don't keep things on DVR for too long but but I first time I've
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:21.520]  ever heard about that and it is interesting to look into it yeah but
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:25.560]  we're talking about them remoting in not not not that it's available for you to
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:29.400]  go choose on on-demand they're going into recorded copies and getting rid of
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:34.440]  it yeah I've never heard of that let me give you the headline it's curtain
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:39.280]  MO info wars.com confirmed Ventura's conspiracy theory episodes disappearing
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:45.040]  from DVRs it's a huge internet controversy out there time you know you
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.120]  know what I look at that kind of a badge of honor that means that we're
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:52.680]  scaring the hell out of them we're telling the truth and if they're that
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:58.000]  nervous about it good I guess in a way your your dad's gonna win the bet he
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.520]  didn't believe it was ever gonna make it on air so in a way your dad turns out
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.600]  to be basically right he said I can't believe this is gonna get on air
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:10.320]  probably he didn't believe it was gonna go on air not just the first season but
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:14.760]  he wasn't even sure it completely about the second well I mean hey we got on
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.120]  air and I think one of the big reasons we got on air is because people let
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:21.840]  true TV and let the let them know that they wanted to see it you know the
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.040]  Nielsen system is a very antiquated system and and and so you know us the
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:30.400]  TV companies are big on you know letters and things like that and then you
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:33.600]  know I think that we had such a great response from people after the first
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:37.920]  season you know writing in the true TV and leaving messages on there on the
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.600]  common boards on their website and you know that speaks volumes I mean
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:46.000]  every one letter you know could equal thousand two thousand three thousand five
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:51.200]  thousand people and then that you know that that's simple task dictates a lot
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:54.080]  of programming you know at the end of the day they want ratings and they want
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:57.960]  you know and they want to be able to put out good shows and like I said they're
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:02.240]  a great company and they've been good to us and and have allowed us to put
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:05.600]  things on the air that like yeah we never thought we would say anyone would
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.280]  ever see at the light of day on television basic cable but we have and
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:13.320]  that's because of the viewers and that's because of our audience being so
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:18.000]  dedicated and then and following the show and then then writing the true TV
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.040]  and letting them know that they want to see it again and so please if you want
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.480]  to see us back for a third season do it again you know write in and and let true
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:29.880]  TV know that you want to see see more conspiracy theory well I'm glad you
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:32.800]  brought this up because that's one of the reasons I you know when I called you

[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:01.040]  kind of time off to take a breather and then you know keep our ear to the ground
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.280]  for what potential shows we could do next season and you know hopefully we'll
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:10.040]  hopefully get the green light and start working again you know but that now if
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:13.840]  you know if Jesse can fly I don't know if they'll find out what and that leads
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.160]  me to that next question but I need to stop before we get into your dad in the
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:21.640]  flying because we're also doing something else today not just writing to
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:25.720]  that address not just going to true TV and emailing them we're exposing the
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.080]  open announcement that not just public telescreens saying spy on your
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:32.680]  neighbor but they're now going to use the FEMA takeover boxes and all broadcast
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:39.360]  TV radio and cable to start breaking in with Obama's video and voice on radio
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:43.520]  telling you to basically spy on your neighbors the key article and video that
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:47.040]  we stayed up all night producing that breaks this down Obama launches total
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:56.080]  takeover of media system again Obama launches total takeover of media system
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:02.200]  emergency alert system and it is so important that you get the video and
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:06.720]  all this out to everybody and I only mentioned it for like one minute in the
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:09.360]  last hour and when I've done that before we haven't gotten the number one
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:13.320]  Google search term and I normally need to hammer it for that to happen folks
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.680]  right now type Obama launches takeover into Google over and over again Obama
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:25.680]  launches takeover and let's make that the number one term Obama launches
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:34.360]  takeover that is so important to put that in the search engine also Obama
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:39.720]  takeover media we want to make that the second term on Google Obama takeover
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:44.920]  media and Obama launches takeover those are two separate search terms let's
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.560]  break through the electronic Berlin wall let's expose their attempt to attack
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:52.880]  the media and the alternative media just like we did with the TSA it's admitted
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:55.880]  we launched that it's admitted we've launched so many other things you've
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:59.800]  done it Obama launches takeovers the first search term the second search term
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:04.280]  is Obama takeover media put those in over and over again the three words
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:09.520]  Obama launches takeover is one search term and Obama takeover media is the
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:12.800]  second three words you put in together let's do it together let's make it
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.200]  number one it should be number one of the next three hours tie getting into
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:21.160]  your father now we again appreciate you talking about this I know from flying
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:25.440]  with him he is upset other people are upset it's a carnival atmosphere he's
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.840]  a celebrity people gather around he sat on my show they grab his genitals they
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.720]  go you know you know into his wife I'm gonna say it they're now admitting
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.720]  they're going into other people's pants there's a huge revolt against this he's
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:43.600]  filed a lawsuit and it's got national media attention what can you say about
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:48.080]  that well I can't comment on the lawsuit because it is you know it is a lawsuit
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:51.480]  and things like that I can talk about my own experiences with it which I've I
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:54.400]  have been groped and I've had to go into the microwave machine because they
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:58.720]  didn't even give me the option of being searched you know before and then you
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:02.440]  know it's not fun at all in fact the good thing is the microwave machine
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:10.200]  didn't work on me because I'm too tall happy about that which which you know
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:14.920]  once again shows how idiotic it is but but but no I can't comment directly on
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:19.000]  the lawsuit because it is it is a pending lawsuit and all that I think it
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.640]  speaks for itself and you know hopefully we'll see what happens and then you
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:27.880]  know we'll see where it comes with that but you know you know if we can we can
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:31.920]  you know it works out and it's a good it's a good blow against the system to
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.040]  try to try to get them to make airlines safer without you know invading our
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:41.120]  rights and then then you know it can be done well Ty as you know and I guess we
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:44.000]  talked privately about this so I know the inside baseball and I've you know
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.800]  talked to your dad off air I mean I knew months before they were launching the
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:50.800]  suit they were but he said don't talk about it when I get back I'll talk about
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:54.520]  it and so I guess when he gets back in April obviously he's gonna need to
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:58.400]  respond you know the media tried to spend it all Ventura once publicity I
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.600]  happen to know your dad turns down most big TV interviews he refused to talk to
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:07.040]  the international media on this he he told me when we flew he said I can't do
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:11.440]  this anymore I got to get out of here every time he flies to be groped and
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:15.500]  then to have the view and others make jokes about it and laugh at him and say
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:19.280]  oh he's a man why does he care if somebody grabs his genitals I mean I've
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:22.880]  had Ron Paul on he's angry about it and says they've grabbed his genitals I
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:27.800]  mean this is about government training us to put up with anything exactly you
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:31.800]  know they condition us to accept any kind of form of security no matter how
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:37.040]  invasive and condition us to throw out our bill of rights you know then they
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.520]  win and then you can't have that I mean we if you you have to make that choice
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:46.360]  is it a free society or is it a state-controlled police society and then
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:49.640]  you have you know and I believe this country's a free society and you could
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:53.000]  still have security and be a free society you just have to do it correctly
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:57.920]  and and and then my own personal experiences I I mean come on I had a
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:03.040]  friend of mine who you know as a FBI agent and counterterrorism and he as a
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:06.200]  conceal and carry permit he's walking through and he shows in the conceal and
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:09.640]  carry something because I'm an FBI agent it's okay and so they let him go through
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:13.040]  and then his bag goes through and he has a small Swiss Army knife on his key
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:17.000]  chain in his bag and then it goes to the x-ray and they say I'm sorry sir you
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:20.080]  can't have that that's with Army knife and he's kind of looking at them like
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:25.880]  but I'm carrying a gun I mean it's just ludicrous what what the things that
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.800]  they've set up and then it's the appearance of security and it is it's
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.160]  the conditioning to get us to accept the fact that all our bodies belong to the
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:38.640]  government and then we have no rights over them whatsoever. Four force vaccines
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:42.080]  and everything else but notice in Obama's state of the Union Tide as you
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.240]  catch where he said we're gonna put speed train all over the country high
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:50.240]  speed rail don't worry now you won't have to get pat downs on the rail they're
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.080]  already doing pat downs on rail everyone that went in the Super Bowl got a
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.960]  genital pat down I mean there's nowhere to run or hide from this TSA is now
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:03.160]  setting up checkpoints on highways Ty I just want to commend your father for
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:07.000]  his courage because he loves his privacy as he said on my show he was really
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:11.280]  gonna retire three years ago he wants to ride off into the sunset he's doing
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:16.080]  this for everybody and for his country as a governor as a veteran can I mean can
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:19.760]  you speak to your you know I mean the fact that there we're not we're not
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.760]  we're not publicity hounds we don't do things for publicity we do things
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:28.920]  because we feel as we have to stand up and they're morally right and and and
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:33.480]  nothing about this isn't anything to do with publicity you know my dad's
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:37.480]  always been that way through his whole life but if you see something wrong he
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.920]  speaks about it whether it is whether for good or bad if he believes it's
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:47.080]  wrong he'll go speak out about it and you know I think that's important for us
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.200]  all to do you know and and and you know you have to keep up that constant
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:55.440]  vigilance well talking to him on air and off he just says Alex I want to ride
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:00.240]  off in the sunset but I can't stand this tyranny so he says I I do six eight
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:03.640]  months here fighting it but then I just got to get away from it and just walk
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:08.000]  on the beach I mean and I don't blame him I mean I'm not 60 years old like he
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.720]  is and every day time my instinct says get out of here get out of here but
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:16.160]  there's nowhere to run well if you believe in you love and you love your
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:19.720]  country and you want to change things you have to stay in fight and and and he
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:23.960]  will stay in fight until you know until he physically can't anymore and he will
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:27.160]  continue to speak out against tyranny and speak out against things of this
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:31.120]  nature until until he he finally can kind of hang up the hat and move on and
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:34.920]  and and that's where I guess I'll probably have to pick up the mantle and
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:39.720]  continue speaking out for truth in the works that I do and and then we all have
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:43.960]  to do that as a citizenry and and and and and then we need to follow leaders
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:47.600]  like them and leaders like yourself and other and other people like long palm
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:51.600]  things like that and don't get duped into believing that you know if you join an
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:54.680]  organization that's enough I mean you got you got it you got to stay with
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:58.040]  one you got to educate people we've all got to be leaders ties stay there

[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.480]  station was shut down for like maybe 20 minutes and they got freaked out about it
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.400]  but quickly Alex you talked about FEMA trying down in the president wanting to
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:05.440]  talk to us during national emergencies there's a big exercise coming up in May
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:10.200]  and a whole bunch of FEMA regions including FEMA region 5 in Illinois and
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:15.480]  only 11 getting prepared for earthquakes and you have FEMA here January 20th
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:21.920]  buying loading up on hydrated beverages I hear you Julio I got to go but I'm
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:26.960]  aware of the new NLE national level exercise you cover that the police state
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.440]  episode I think that's what shocked your dad the most is these 10 governors that
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.680]  the states aren't in control yeah no it is pretty pretty frightening when you
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:38.560]  look at it because it's like what you know these people are yeah we elect the
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:42.440]  governors but we didn't elect them to run 10 regions of the country you know
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:45.800]  they should you know and that should be something debated on in Congress that
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.240]  should be a big deal and instead it just kind of slides through and you know
[02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:54.560]  this all started them you know that post 9-11 push and it's been ongoing for
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.320]  for the last you know 50-60 years in this country I would say you know the best
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:02.920]  push to turn as fascist eventually there's no doubt it's happening now I
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:06.880]  mean there's doesn't matter who's in power it can be Democrat or Republican you
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:10.000]  know they're all they're all working for the same corporate masters let's jam in
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.200]  one more than come back a deck a few more with Ty on the other side going into
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:16.400]  the fourth hour let's talk to Corey in California got about a minute and a half
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.280]  Corey all right thanks a lot sir hey I really agree with you Mr. Ventura on the
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:25.040]  stay-in-fight I mean you have to not be scared and you know voice our you know
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:29.720]  the facts and opinions and things of that nature one question I know you have
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:33.680]  a lot of questions about season 30 are there any like possible considerations
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:37.240]  on follow-ups on the previous theories like say for example the BP oil spill
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:40.280]  going back down there and just looking at you know the devastation that's been
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:44.520]  brought there oh yeah we would love I mean you know in the first two seasons
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:48.680]  we didn't really focus on maybe going back to previous conspiracies that we've
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:53.680]  covered but we would love to do that you know especially with BP or especially
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:58.360]  with the police state of the water conspiracy we always keep tabs after
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:02.920]  we air show we always keep tabs on the problem is there's so many new things
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:06.600]  that haven't been covered though yeah I mean as soon as you know we hopefully we
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:10.800]  can get to like four or five seasons or even maybe even the third season you know
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:14.600]  we can get that long of a show and long of a run of her show we definitely would
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:18.760]  love to go back and revisit some stuff oh I've got an idea the tip of the iceberg
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.920]  on some of these things yes how about folks call true TV and email them and
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:27.320]  write them and say put the show out on DVD so people can get it and share it
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.040]  that's a good idea these beyond DVD tie definitely definitely I agree I agree
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:36.600]  all right stay there back in one minute a few final calls with Tyrell Ventura

[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.120]  really want to keep up the hard work is there any chance that another cable TV
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:10.880]  network would pick up the show if True TV decided to drop it well they'd have
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:14.400]  to change the name but yeah Ventura could do another show couldn't he yeah
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:18.480]  he could do another show I guess but you know item right now True TV is not
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:21.760]  giving us any indication that they want to drop it they've been super supportive
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:25.080]  and we've really enjoyed working with them so so as of right now I mean we're
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:29.680]  very happy with where we're at and then and you know I wouldn't even venture to
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:33.120]  even talk about it yeah thanks Rick I love working with True TV they've been
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:36.880]  great but good question yeah they were the first to do it the problem is old

[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:51.040]  air with Tyrell hi Tyrell great show unbelievable that the series got out
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:55.160]  there and I'm glad it did it turned a lot of people out to it I got a few
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:02:01.840]  suggestions of so many conspiracies so little time duplicated uranium fluoride
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.920]  vaccines Cortex all the materials all that stuff is that we you know we we
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:10.920]  every year when we do a show we put together about 30 to 40 different show
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:15.600]  topics and kind of whittle it down from there and then so you know we haven't
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:19.640]  gotten deep into like depleted uranium that but it's a great topic Gulf War
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.080]  syndrome you know is another one I'm really impressed with the shows you
