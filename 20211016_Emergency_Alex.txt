[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  Is FEMA requiring you guys to be vaccinated?
[00:12.560 --> 00:14.000]  All the nurses and doctors from FEMA.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.520]  She goes, oh, no, no, no, it's a choice.
[00:16.520 --> 00:20.960]  I said, I'm sorry, I'm confused.
[00:20.960 --> 00:29.680]  I said, you're going to do the same job in the same building
[00:29.680 --> 00:38.760]  with the same patients treating the same illness as the doctors
[00:38.760 --> 00:42.400]  and the nurses who just were employed at this hospital
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.080]  and left because they were being required by their employer
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.480]  to be vaccinated.
[00:47.480 --> 00:50.760]  Infowars is almost always way ahead of the curve.
[00:50.760 --> 00:53.360]  We are truly next year's news today.
[00:53.360 --> 00:55.680]  And we haven't dropped the ball on this one either.
[00:55.680 --> 00:59.040]  We're amongst the very first to be reporting it.
[00:59.040 --> 01:01.000]  But the fact that this information
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  has been going on for months and that we are just now
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.220]  discovering it shows just how diabolical
[01:07.220 --> 01:09.640]  this globalist takeover is.
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.240]  We know, even USA Today admits it,
[01:12.240 --> 01:19.520]  that $53,000 extra is given to every hospital or medical group
[01:19.520 --> 01:22.560]  that intubates the patient, incentivizing them to send
[01:22.560 --> 01:24.400]  people home when they're first sick,
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.480]  to not give them antibiotics, not give them steroids,
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.000]  not give them ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.280]  So they become deathly ill.
[01:30.280 --> 01:30.920]  They come back.
[01:30.920 --> 01:32.120]  They put them on a ventilator.
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.200]  And then 92% of the time, they end up dying.
[01:36.200 --> 01:39.280]  That's the CDC's, the federal government's own numbers.
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.280]  You've seen all the incentives to not give care and basically
[01:42.280 --> 01:43.600]  kill people.
[01:43.600 --> 01:45.400]  Well, why do you think they've been locking up
[01:45.400 --> 01:47.840]  all the hospitals and all of the nursing homes
[01:47.880 --> 01:50.000]  and bringing COVID patients in to get people sick
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.480]  and make them die, but not letting families in?
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.200]  Because this is all a eugenics depopulation operation.
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.440]  Well, now one of the last big pieces of the puzzle
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.040]  just fell into place.
[02:02.040 --> 02:04.240]  And our own Christy Lee interviewed
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.080]  some of the witnesses yesterday who've
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.640]  experienced it personally.
[02:07.640 --> 02:09.360]  And I looked up the federal guidelines.
[02:09.360 --> 02:11.280]  And lo and behold, it's there.
[02:11.280 --> 02:13.760]  There is not even a regulation or a law
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.920]  making federal employees take the vaccines.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.480]  It's all a giant hoax.
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.600]  There's not a law for the general public as well.
[02:20.600 --> 02:23.920]  And so when FEMA workers are coming in to take over
[02:23.920 --> 02:26.760]  the hospitals, not because they're overwhelmed with COVID,
[02:26.760 --> 02:28.920]  but because hundreds of thousands of nurses
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.040]  have quit over the illegal mandate,
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.920]  they are telling the nurses and doctors
[02:32.920 --> 02:35.680]  they're replacing that they didn't take the shot.
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.480]  And it's their option, their choice.
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.840]  That is absolutely incredible.
[02:41.840 --> 02:44.520]  And it's right there in the fine print in the paperwork
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.040]  on the CDC website.
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.000]  So think about that.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.680]  They use the hospital groups, the corporations,
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.040]  to fire everybody outside of law,
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.200]  claiming they're following a federal law.
[02:54.200 --> 02:57.300]  And then the hospital groups get the billions of dollars
[02:57.300 --> 02:59.920]  of emergency funding when they say that the hospitals
[02:59.920 --> 03:01.960]  are overwhelmed because of COVID patients.
[03:01.960 --> 03:03.640]  They put that law in place last year,
[03:03.640 --> 03:05.080]  over a hundred billion dollars just sitting there
[03:05.080 --> 03:06.360]  waiting to be spent.
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.840]  And then they create the shortfall themselves
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.080]  by running out all the regular nurses and doctors
[03:11.080 --> 03:14.840]  and then bring in FEMA, which again begins to federalize
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.880]  not just what you've seen with the CDC
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.320]  trying to take over housing,
[03:18.320 --> 03:22.080]  but now the CDC taking over the hospital change themselves.
[03:22.080 --> 03:24.240]  True fascism, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24.240 --> 03:27.920]  So this is massive, massive, massive news.
[03:27.920 --> 03:30.520]  And the full report, the full interview is in the war room
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.520]  from Friday, October 15th, 2021 on Band.video.
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.880]  We'll put the link in the description here
[03:38.880 --> 03:40.400]  of this emergency transmission.
[03:40.400 --> 03:41.360]  And here, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:41.360 --> 03:45.160]  is the Saturday evening emergency transmission in full.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.400]  Spread this link now.
[03:46.400 --> 03:47.640]  That's how we fight back.
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.640]  For years now, Justin Trudeau has been a loyal lapdog
[03:57.640 --> 04:00.000]  to the communist Chinese.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.240]  While the people of Canada ceremoniously came together
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.560]  to condemn the CCP's Uyghur genocide,
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.000]  Trudeau's cabinet sent a single member on a Zoom call
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.240]  to officially abstain.
[04:12.240 --> 04:15.360]  When the president of Taiwan was set to be honored
[04:15.360 --> 04:18.360]  by the Halifax International Security Forum
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.440]  for standing strong against China's relentless pressure,
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.120]  the Trudeau administration threatened to end their funding
[04:26.120 --> 04:28.040]  if they went through with it.
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.080]  Trudeau invited the communist Chinese military
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.440]  to conduct winter training in Canada in 2019,
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.920]  less than 200 miles from the US border in upstate New York.
[04:39.920 --> 04:42.200]  The head of the Canadian military caught wind of it
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.200]  from the US Pentagon and called it off,
[04:45.200 --> 04:48.320]  which upset Trudeau, whose chief concern
[04:48.320 --> 04:50.080]  was offending the CCP.
[04:51.280 --> 04:54.440]  Under Trudeau, Canada has been a big player
[04:54.440 --> 04:56.040]  in the COVID hoax.
[04:56.040 --> 05:00.240]  In early 2017, billionaire Barry Sherman,
[05:00.240 --> 05:03.360]  a huge supporter of Trudeau's Liberal Party,
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.320]  was under investigation for shady deals with Trudeau
[05:07.320 --> 05:10.640]  that could have resulted in his company Apotex,
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.400]  the world's largest producer of hydroxychloroquine
[05:14.400 --> 05:17.320]  and Canada's biggest pharmaceutical company,
[05:17.320 --> 05:21.400]  being banned for five years from lobbying the government.
[05:21.400 --> 05:24.680]  Later that year, Sherman and his wife were found hung
[05:24.680 --> 05:27.720]  from railings around their indoor swimming pool
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.120]  with markings from being beaten and tied by their wrists.
[05:32.120 --> 05:34.800]  It was officially ruled a suicide,
[05:34.800 --> 05:37.800]  and along with Sherman, the probe died.
[05:37.800 --> 05:40.480]  Apotex was able to continue doing business
[05:40.480 --> 05:41.920]  with Trudeau's government
[05:41.920 --> 05:44.680]  and went on to provide dangerous drugs
[05:44.680 --> 05:47.440]  as part of their ventilator protocol.
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.120]  And it was at the University of British Columbia
[05:50.120 --> 05:52.000]  where the lipid nanoparticles
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.780]  that make the mRNA shots possible were developed.
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.880]  Trudeau is a natural-born tyrant.
[05:59.880 --> 06:02.480]  After less than 30,000 deaths,
[06:02.480 --> 06:06.000]  0.07% of the population,
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.960]  Justin Trudeau has announced that all federal employees
[06:09.960 --> 06:13.160]  and everyone 12 or older traveling on planes,
[06:13.160 --> 06:17.760]  trains, and cruise ships need to be fully vaccinated.
[06:17.760 --> 06:20.680]  Testing negative will no longer be an option.
[06:20.680 --> 06:23.620]  Testing will no longer be an option.
[06:23.620 --> 06:24.800]  These travel measures,
[06:24.800 --> 06:28.200]  along with mandatory vaccination for federal employees,
[06:28.200 --> 06:31.100]  are some of the strongest in the world.
[06:31.100 --> 06:33.900]  Because when it comes to keeping you and your family safe,
[06:33.900 --> 06:37.180]  when it comes to avoiding lockdowns for everyone,
[06:37.180 --> 06:39.700]  this is no time for half measures.
[06:39.700 --> 06:43.780]  In Ontario, elected representative Rick Nichols refused,
[06:43.780 --> 06:46.540]  but under no circumstances will I,
[06:46.540 --> 06:50.980]  nor should any Ontarian, be forced or coerced
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.140]  to do something against their will, and was fired.
[06:56.600 --> 06:59.640]  Under new health orders in Saskatchewan,
[06:59.640 --> 07:03.500]  the government may now enter into any building on any land
[07:03.500 --> 07:07.120]  without a warrant, and seize property,
[07:07.120 --> 07:09.960]  and they are building isolation centers.
[07:09.960 --> 07:13.360]  Trudeau's government, like most governments in the West,
[07:13.360 --> 07:16.500]  is dragging their people into a hellish reality
[07:16.500 --> 07:20.280]  of forced experimental drugs and a social credit score
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.600]  to police every movement they make
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.500]  for the rest of their lives.
[07:24.500 --> 07:27.840]  The same reality coming to you and your family,
[07:27.840 --> 07:30.460]  so long as humanity does nothing to stop it.
[07:31.360 --> 07:33.800]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.060]  People ask me all the time,
[07:37.060 --> 07:38.780]  Alex, the last three months or so,
[07:38.780 --> 07:42.000]  you've had explosive energy on top of your already
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.120]  very intense level of energy.
[07:44.120 --> 07:45.200]  What's happening?
[07:45.200 --> 07:46.340]  Well, it's the things that are happening
[07:46.340 --> 07:47.960]  in the world right now that's got my blood up,
[07:47.960 --> 07:50.320]  but also I've gotten back in the groove
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.840]  of religiously taking three products every single day.
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.600]  DNA Force Plus, it's back in stock.
[07:56.600 --> 07:59.640]  Also X2, Deep Earth Crystal Iodine,
[07:59.640 --> 08:02.440]  that's essential for your immune system, your whole body.
[08:02.440 --> 08:05.620]  And of course, at nighttime, Down & Out Sleep Aid
[08:05.620 --> 08:08.720]  that makes me have deeper, cleaner, restful sleep
[08:08.720 --> 08:10.540]  that again, boosts my immune system
[08:10.540 --> 08:12.420]  and is good for every cell in my body
[08:12.420 --> 08:13.760]  and great for the spirit.
[08:13.760 --> 08:16.160]  All three of these products are in stock right now.
[08:16.160 --> 08:18.960]  They are 40% off in the case of DNA Force Plus
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.960]  and 50% off for one week only on Survival Shield X2.
[08:22.960 --> 08:24.720]  And yes, until supplies last,
[08:24.720 --> 08:28.640]  we have Down & Out, 50% off at info.restore.com.
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.220]  This is their trifecta.
[08:30.220 --> 08:32.200]  I suggest you check it out and experience
[08:32.200 --> 08:34.440]  what this does for your body today.
[08:34.440 --> 08:36.760]  Often when you get into the real world,
[08:36.760 --> 08:40.320]  the effectiveness of vaccines falls short
[08:40.320 --> 08:42.820]  of the original efficacy.
[08:42.820 --> 08:47.320]  That is not at all the case with the vaccines for COVID-19.
[08:47.320 --> 08:50.960]  So now we have two vaccines that are really quite effective.
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.480]  The mRNA vaccine, highly effective,
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.480]  extraordinarily efficacious, 94 to 95%
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.640]  for mild to moderate disease and virtually 100% efficacious
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.920]  because the real world effectiveness is even more impressive
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.920]  than the results of the clinical trial.
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.040]  ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
[09:50.960 --> 09:53.720]  ["Jingle Bells"]
[10:20.960 --> 10:23.720]  ["Jingle Bells"]
[10:50.960 --> 10:53.720]  ["Jingle Bells"]
[10:58.720 --> 11:01.720]  ["Jingle Bells"]
[11:20.960 --> 11:23.220]  ["Jingle Bells"]
[11:23.220 --> 11:26.000]  Thank you for joining us on another emergency broadcast.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.220]  Basically, every broadcast we engage in now
[11:29.220 --> 11:33.200]  is an emergency because the globalists are making their move
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.360]  ahead of the great culling, the great cataclysm,
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.040]  the great disaster that they are engineering
[11:40.680 --> 11:43.140]  and which during this societal human collapse,
[11:43.140 --> 11:46.520]  they will pose as the saviors and our guardians
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.620]  while they quietly try to smother humanity in its crib.
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.680]  What a thrilling 10 minute, it had everything.
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.520]  We're so happy we're here.
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.520]  It had everything.
[11:58.520 --> 12:01.800]  And the realization once again,
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.580]  the fragility of this planet, the coming catastrophic event
[12:06.580 --> 12:09.320]  and we all have to clean this act up now.
[12:09.320 --> 12:10.220]  Well said.
[12:11.560 --> 12:14.680]  The coming catastrophic event
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.280]  that everybody's been let in on
[12:18.280 --> 12:20.640]  who is at the William Shatner level,
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.080]  the great culling, the bunkers they've built,
[12:23.080 --> 12:24.880]  all the world.
[12:24.880 --> 12:29.360]  That's why AOC, that's why Beto two years ago
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.280]  said by 2030, we'll all be dead
[12:33.280 --> 12:34.560]  and it's the end of the world.
[12:34.560 --> 12:35.840]  Remember that?
[12:35.840 --> 12:37.520]  Now they've been brought in and have been briefed
[12:37.520 --> 12:41.060]  on asteroids they tell them are coming,
[12:41.060 --> 12:42.980]  a pole shift they tell them is coming
[12:42.980 --> 12:45.700]  and that global warming scientists have told them
[12:45.700 --> 12:48.900]  is gonna produce super viruses like airborne Ebola
[12:48.900 --> 12:50.800]  that will kill 90% of the earth
[12:50.800 --> 12:53.980]  but it's human's fault that it's coming.
[12:53.980 --> 12:57.780]  That's the cover story up at the William Shatner AOC level.
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.420]  They're not read into all the plans
[13:00.420 --> 13:02.060]  or how they've cooked up the viruses
[13:02.060 --> 13:03.380]  and how they've already prepared them
[13:03.380 --> 13:05.940]  and how COVID is just a beta test for the real lockdown
[13:05.940 --> 13:07.540]  when they're exterminating all of us.
[13:07.540 --> 13:10.080]  They've not been brought into the Peter Daszak,
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.660]  Anthony Fauci level of it.
[13:12.660 --> 13:15.420]  They've not been brought into the David Rockefeller,
[13:15.420 --> 13:17.580]  Bill Gates, Zbigniew Brzezinski level
[13:18.660 --> 13:21.500]  and the great culling is now beginning.
[13:21.500 --> 13:23.520]  But first they have to train us with a virus
[13:23.520 --> 13:26.500]  that's not that deadly to go into their control,
[13:26.500 --> 13:29.220]  to let them block treatments that are 100%,
[13:29.220 --> 13:31.020]  to let them lock up all people
[13:31.020 --> 13:33.400]  where you can't see them while they quietly kill them,
[13:33.400 --> 13:36.700]  while they test the medical tyranny of the medical system
[13:36.700 --> 13:38.900]  and the police and the military
[13:38.900 --> 13:41.660]  and call out the folks that won't follow the orders
[13:41.660 --> 13:44.780]  and get the army of authoritarians they need.
[13:44.780 --> 13:48.180]  They're building their human armies of oppression
[13:48.180 --> 13:51.060]  and dehumanization and depopulation right now.
[13:51.060 --> 13:53.220]  And of course, gonna augment that with the robots
[13:53.220 --> 13:57.300]  and the drones on the ground air and sea
[13:57.300 --> 13:59.940]  that will follow whatever orders
[13:59.940 --> 14:01.740]  the establishment gives them.
[14:01.740 --> 14:03.620]  So we're gonna be laying all of this out
[14:03.620 --> 14:07.380]  in this emergency Saturday transmission.
[14:07.380 --> 14:09.880]  I wanna talk about some of the positive things happening
[14:09.880 --> 14:12.880]  in the great awakening because evil is making its move
[14:12.880 --> 14:14.140]  and it's planned it for a long time
[14:14.140 --> 14:17.240]  but it doesn't mean it's gonna succeed.
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.020]  In fact, if we simply admit the horror we're facing
[14:20.020 --> 14:23.260]  and research how the globalists roll this out
[14:23.260 --> 14:26.100]  through successive approximation and incrementalism
[14:26.100 --> 14:30.160]  and get the 35,000 foot view outside the box,
[14:31.220 --> 14:32.660]  we will defeat them.
[14:32.660 --> 14:35.180]  But if we don't, I'm gonna lay out
[14:35.180 --> 14:37.140]  what you're gonna be living under very, very soon
[14:37.740 --> 14:40.140]  and remember, I told you 20 plus years ago
[14:40.140 --> 14:42.240]  what you'd be living under by 2021.
[14:43.540 --> 14:45.420]  They told us what they would do by 2021.
[14:45.420 --> 14:48.580]  They would roll out agenda 21 and then agenda 2030.
[14:48.580 --> 14:52.980]  Well, that means a global depopulation of 90%.
[14:52.980 --> 14:55.860]  So the training wheels are coming off.
[14:55.860 --> 14:58.780]  We're going out of beta into operational.
[14:58.780 --> 15:01.640]  And so you can just wait and see
[15:01.640 --> 15:02.760]  if I'm right again this time
[15:02.760 --> 15:05.140]  or you can go read what they're doing
[15:05.140 --> 15:06.680]  and what they're saying.
[15:07.900 --> 15:10.860]  So I'm gonna hit some really serious news here this evening
[15:10.860 --> 15:15.400]  but first I wanna talk about some positive things
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.540]  and some great solutions and the fact that there is hope
[15:19.540 --> 15:21.460]  in the animating contest of liberty.
[15:21.460 --> 15:23.020]  And then I'm gonna hit this.
[15:23.020 --> 15:24.820]  Look at this headline from Zero Hedge
[15:25.920 --> 15:28.900]  and it directly links to a Pentagon paper
[15:28.900 --> 15:31.620]  that is official US government policy
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.560]  and also official NATO policy.
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.560]  This has been adopted as a sixth sphere of warfare.
[15:38.640 --> 15:41.480]  Hacking your brain is what they call it.
[15:41.480 --> 15:43.220]  And they call it full spectrum dominance.
[15:43.220 --> 15:48.040]  They also call it propaganda and mind control
[15:48.040 --> 15:50.080]  on a mass scale.
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.360]  Cognitive warfare, a battle for the brain.
[15:54.360 --> 15:56.660]  This is an actual government document.
[15:58.040 --> 15:59.440]  In fact, I didn't print the document
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.340]  but go ahead and just print it for me guys
[16:01.340 --> 16:03.620]  in a 2020 NATO sponsored study.
[16:03.620 --> 16:05.980]  Let's just read this, a part of this on air
[16:05.980 --> 16:08.340]  because here's the thing.
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.960]  This is all being externalized now
[16:10.960 --> 16:13.020]  because this is 25, 30 years old.
[16:13.020 --> 16:16.300]  This has been implemented a long time ago
[16:16.300 --> 16:19.600]  under George Herbert Walker Bush and then the Clintons.
[16:21.460 --> 16:24.420]  And now it's fully operational right now.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.740]  They're out of beta.
[16:25.740 --> 16:28.820]  The brain will be the battlefield of the 21st century.
[16:28.820 --> 16:30.380]  Talk about war on for your mind.
[16:31.560 --> 16:34.260]  So I'm gonna be getting to that coming up
[16:34.260 --> 16:38.020]  and I'm gonna show you just one level of the brainwashing.
[16:39.060 --> 16:41.240]  One level of this.
[16:41.240 --> 16:43.540]  Now, the only way to defeat it is to have a connection
[16:43.540 --> 16:46.700]  to God and a connection to common sense and common law
[16:46.700 --> 16:49.340]  and reject everything they say and everything they do.
[16:49.340 --> 16:51.580]  Understand they lay layer upon layer of lies
[16:51.580 --> 16:52.700]  and deception on it.
[16:52.700 --> 16:55.140]  You have to realize the people carrying this out.
[16:55.140 --> 16:56.340]  No wonder they commit suicide.
[16:56.340 --> 16:57.620]  No wonder they're so unhappy
[16:57.620 --> 16:59.220]  because they're hurting humanity
[16:59.220 --> 17:02.740]  and they're following evil orders via peer pressure
[17:02.740 --> 17:04.300]  or for money or whatever the case is
[17:04.300 --> 17:05.620]  because they're blackmailed.
[17:05.620 --> 17:07.500]  And when they realize the horrible things they've done
[17:07.500 --> 17:10.140]  and that bad energy comes back on them,
[17:10.140 --> 17:11.740]  they kill themselves.
[17:11.740 --> 17:14.180]  This is not the average Green Beret
[17:14.180 --> 17:17.020]  who runs everything, you know, information.
[17:17.020 --> 17:19.980]  This is the behavioral psychologist and psychiatrist
[17:19.980 --> 17:22.820]  that actually run the military and run the Pentagon
[17:22.820 --> 17:26.060]  and hate masculine men and hate feminine women
[17:26.060 --> 17:28.180]  and hate all Americans.
[17:28.180 --> 17:29.540]  They are the globalist beachhead.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.740]  They are the corporate board.
[17:30.740 --> 17:32.500]  They are the leadership of the Pentagon
[17:32.500 --> 17:37.500]  led by horrible demons like Austin, Millie and others.
[17:37.540 --> 17:38.520]  So we're gonna be looking at that
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.580]  and then just show you a few facets of that.
[17:42.580 --> 17:44.740]  Let me show you one of the facets right now.
[17:44.740 --> 17:46.100]  You see this big article.
[17:46.100 --> 17:46.920]  It's very accurate.
[17:46.920 --> 17:47.760]  It's all in the document.
[17:47.760 --> 17:52.200]  I read the document when I was flying back today
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.140]  from Florida from a family vacation.
[17:54.140 --> 17:56.100]  And I'd already seen the similar documents over and over.
[17:56.180 --> 17:58.700]  I mean, it's the same battle plan over and over again.
[17:58.700 --> 18:01.060]  And now they're just legitimizing it
[18:01.060 --> 18:02.560]  because now they want you to just see
[18:02.560 --> 18:07.540]  the PSYOP officers as superstars
[18:07.540 --> 18:11.100]  and that the military engaging you psychologically
[18:11.100 --> 18:14.120]  but also physically and medically is a good thing.
[18:14.120 --> 18:15.720]  But I wanna show you it's global.
[18:15.720 --> 18:19.140]  So here, you read this article out of NATO,
[18:19.140 --> 18:20.420]  read the article of the Pentagon.
[18:20.420 --> 18:21.540]  They're both linked in here.
[18:21.540 --> 18:23.920]  And it's all the exact same plan, all unified.
[18:24.920 --> 18:27.000]  And then you get to see the action of it.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.520]  Walmart goes woke pushing CRT training
[18:29.520 --> 18:31.880]  on white cashiers and self-stockers
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.520]  that they are the privileged members
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.680]  of white supremacy making $12 an hour.
[18:36.680 --> 18:37.800]  So whites are inherently bad.
[18:37.800 --> 18:38.880]  That's part of the divide and conquer.
[18:38.880 --> 18:40.400]  And here's some background on it.
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.960]  The NDAA legalizes the use of propaganda on the public.
[18:44.920 --> 18:46.440]  And then as soon as it was law,
[18:46.440 --> 18:48.380]  they then wrote articles saying it wasn't true.
[18:48.380 --> 18:50.640]  That's the PSYOP, admit it, throw it your face
[18:50.640 --> 18:53.800]  and then deny it's happening as they do it to you.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.560]  Mother Jones, is Congress really authorizing
[18:55.560 --> 18:56.840]  US propaganda at home?
[18:56.840 --> 18:58.040]  The left said it's brainwashing.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.200]  It is, they call it brainwashing,
[18:59.200 --> 19:00.500]  but now the left's in control.
[19:00.500 --> 19:01.340]  They love it.
[19:02.480 --> 19:05.560]  That was the HR 5736 Smith-Mund Act,
[19:05.560 --> 19:08.560]  Modernization Act that goes back 10 years, roughly.
[19:08.560 --> 19:10.480]  I'll get to all that for you.
[19:10.480 --> 19:12.920]  Oh, but here's stuff out of the UK
[19:12.920 --> 19:14.600]  and articles out of Canada.
[19:14.600 --> 19:15.960]  It's all the same headline.
[19:15.960 --> 19:19.080]  British military secretly engaged in brainwashing.
[19:19.080 --> 19:20.960]  Canadian military engages in brainwashing.
[19:20.960 --> 19:23.680]  Here's the head of the military saying
[19:24.520 --> 19:26.440]  that it shouldn't be done, but it was overridden
[19:26.440 --> 19:28.480]  by Trudeau who says he wants to be a dictator.
[19:28.480 --> 19:30.960]  Military campaign to influence public opinion
[19:30.960 --> 19:33.720]  continued after the defense chief shut it down.
[19:34.700 --> 19:36.880]  Just like the tens of thousands of Chinese troops,
[19:36.880 --> 19:39.520]  the defense chief shut it down, but he was overridden.
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.320]  Just like when the two CDC top scientists quit
[19:42.320 --> 19:43.840]  and said, don't give kids the shot.
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.520]  It's not a vaccine, it's dangerous.
[19:45.520 --> 19:48.440]  They just had to step down and they found someone
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.560]  that would say it was good.
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.800]  Oh, but don't worry.
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.120]  Here they are now a few years later,
[19:55.120 --> 19:57.880]  military leaders saw pandemic as unique opportunity
[19:57.880 --> 20:02.280]  to test propaganda techniques on Canadians.
[20:02.280 --> 20:05.160]  Forces report says, and they gave a press conference,
[20:05.160 --> 20:07.360]  how they scared you for your own good.
[20:08.560 --> 20:11.400]  And again, just type into a search engine,
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.520]  UK military targeted public with fear
[20:14.520 --> 20:17.260]  and propaganda and brainwashing.
[20:17.260 --> 20:19.520]  Oh, but then after they announced it,
[20:19.520 --> 20:21.560]  they then have the Canadian and US media say,
[20:22.200 --> 20:23.600]  oh, you're a kook if you don't like it.
[20:23.600 --> 20:26.560]  It exists, but don't criticize it.
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.640]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[20:28.640 --> 20:30.400]  Here's one from Vice.
[20:30.400 --> 20:33.440]  Conspiracy theorists are salivating
[20:33.440 --> 20:36.740]  over a Canadian ministry psyop report.
[20:37.800 --> 20:39.460]  Oh, they're salivating over it.
[20:40.940 --> 20:42.480]  We're gonna be looking at all of this,
[20:42.480 --> 20:44.360]  the types of authoritarian communists
[20:44.360 --> 20:47.160]  they're putting in all major positions of power
[20:47.160 --> 20:48.800]  after we hit some of the good news.
[20:48.800 --> 20:51.360]  But you don't have to listen to Vice
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.480]  or listen to me, you could go read the NATO and Pentagon
[20:55.480 --> 20:57.680]  and Canadian and all the reports.
[20:57.680 --> 20:59.520]  It's all the exact same stuff,
[20:59.520 --> 21:01.640]  dividing you, making you feel alone,
[21:02.960 --> 21:06.960]  dividing people according to sexual lines and skin pigment,
[21:06.960 --> 21:09.480]  all really nasty, evil stuff.
[21:09.480 --> 21:12.120]  And it's all in the WikiLeaks from six years ago,
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.560]  couple of years for the last election in 2014.
[21:16.560 --> 21:19.060]  And it's the major psychology department heads
[21:19.060 --> 21:21.160]  talking to Hillary in email saying,
[21:21.800 --> 21:22.880]  we've said culture war is needed,
[21:22.880 --> 21:25.120]  we need to turn it up at every level.
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.760]  It's our only hope to maintain control.
[21:26.760 --> 21:27.720]  And that's what this is.
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.200]  Have us all fight with each other
[21:29.200 --> 21:31.080]  and just hit us with the most poisonous propaganda
[21:31.080 --> 21:32.340]  about how we're all bad,
[21:32.340 --> 21:34.600]  except Apple that owns the slave factories
[21:34.600 --> 21:35.760]  and suicide nets around them.
[21:35.760 --> 21:38.000]  They're good because they love Black Lives Matter
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.720]  and have black spokespersons.
[21:39.720 --> 21:41.120]  It doesn't matter if they're running slave colonies
[21:41.120 --> 21:41.960]  around the world,
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.040]  as long as they've got a black spokesperson, it's okay.
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.620]  You know, Gigi Ping can have death camps too.
[21:45.620 --> 21:48.240]  I mean, he's Asian, so he can do no wrong
[21:49.300 --> 21:50.860]  because the bad people are the white people.
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.220]  This is pure nightmare authoritarianism.
[21:53.220 --> 21:57.140]  And it's not just run by the psy-op people at the Pentagon.
[21:57.140 --> 21:59.300]  They're just legitimizing it through that.
[21:59.300 --> 22:00.460]  I mean, this is just insane.
[22:00.460 --> 22:04.020]  So we've got all of that information for you.
[22:04.900 --> 22:07.380]  And we're going to be looking at it here on air.
[22:08.360 --> 22:09.680]  Here it is, state of fear,
[22:09.680 --> 22:11.940]  how ministers use covert tactics
[22:11.940 --> 22:13.980]  to keep scared public at home.
[22:13.980 --> 22:17.600]  London Telegraph, but it was for their own good
[22:17.600 --> 22:22.400]  in Australia, in the UK, and in other nations.
[22:22.400 --> 22:25.620]  See, it's like all did it, all the militaries worked.
[22:25.620 --> 22:28.160]  Oh, but this is positive, so they admit it to you there.
[22:28.160 --> 22:30.180]  Oh, it's good for you to have the Pentagon spy on you
[22:30.180 --> 22:32.920]  and watch you and control you and lie to you and use fear.
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.560]  And then, oh, but other people like Alex Jones are bad.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.580]  When he says it exists, it doesn't exist.
[22:39.580 --> 22:41.760]  Kind of like when you go to Klaus Schwab's own website,
[22:41.760 --> 22:44.440]  the Davos Forum, and he says, I want world government.
[22:44.440 --> 22:46.080]  I don't want the public to have any power.
[22:46.080 --> 22:47.400]  I want to depopulate the earth.
[22:48.160 --> 22:49.000]  I want to capture governments.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.120]  We have captured your governments.
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.680]  We are now in control, like the Borg.
[22:53.680 --> 22:54.800]  You can go to his Wikipedia
[22:54.800 --> 22:56.560]  and it says that with a link to him saying it.
[22:56.560 --> 22:59.960]  I've captured your country, a corporate takeover.
[22:59.960 --> 23:01.560]  I run you, I've captured you.
[23:01.560 --> 23:04.840]  Like, hey, I run your country.
[23:04.840 --> 23:07.480]  Hey, what you want doesn't count anymore.
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.580]  And you're going to own nothing.
[23:08.580 --> 23:10.880]  You're going to have nothing and you're going to like it.
[23:10.880 --> 23:13.080]  These are all real statements.
[23:14.080 --> 23:17.040]  Oh, but you see, they have all the corporate media
[23:17.040 --> 23:19.680]  gaslighting like it's normal and it's fun
[23:19.680 --> 23:20.880]  and it's no big deal.
[23:20.880 --> 23:22.420]  So let's all just accept it.
[23:24.240 --> 23:25.860]  And here's a short version of the report.
[23:25.860 --> 23:28.620]  You can read several different larger expanded versions
[23:28.620 --> 23:30.080]  linked to the article right here.
[23:30.080 --> 23:33.860]  Let's show people cognitive warfare.
[23:33.860 --> 23:36.160]  They call it information warfare.
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.480]  It's been going on a long time,
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.740]  but they had to legalize
[23:41.740 --> 23:44.880]  because the military wouldn't do it, lying to you.
[23:44.880 --> 23:49.260]  And that's what was legalized in the Smith-Mund Act.
[23:51.140 --> 23:53.140]  The story's up on info.wars.com.
[23:53.140 --> 23:55.380]  You have to scroll down a bit because it was posted Friday
[23:55.380 --> 23:56.520]  where you can just simply search it out
[23:56.520 --> 23:57.360]  and find it for yourself.
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.460]  And that brings me to another point of frustration
[23:59.460 --> 24:02.420]  that I'm going to hit some of the positive news.
[24:02.420 --> 24:07.380]  There was an Adan Salazar article several days ago
[24:07.380 --> 24:10.100]  where he linked to the British government's own
[24:10.100 --> 24:12.460]  VAERS reporting and the government confirming
[24:12.460 --> 24:14.180]  that you're twice as likely to get COVID
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.100]  if you've had the vaccine
[24:15.100 --> 24:17.980]  and more likely to be hospitalized or die.
[24:17.980 --> 24:19.700]  And then after I was live on air talking about it,
[24:19.700 --> 24:23.300]  I saw it posted to freeworldnews.tv
[24:23.300 --> 24:25.320]  and I saw obvious operatives,
[24:25.320 --> 24:27.380]  they weren't real listeners, that's clear,
[24:27.380 --> 24:28.660]  saying, this is bull.
[24:28.660 --> 24:30.020]  I don't see the document.
[24:30.020 --> 24:31.380]  This isn't real.
[24:31.380 --> 24:33.180]  When anybody could go to the article and click the link
[24:33.180 --> 24:34.480]  and find it for themselves,
[24:34.480 --> 24:36.860]  they just do that hoping people watching it
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.860]  go and read people saying it's not real
[24:40.500 --> 24:42.140]  so that you just stop watching.
[24:42.140 --> 24:43.180]  That's just another tactic.
[24:43.180 --> 24:44.940]  Oh, there's no world government.
[24:44.940 --> 24:46.100]  There's no Bilderberg Group.
[24:46.100 --> 24:48.060]  Klaus Schwab doesn't want to shut off the economy
[24:48.060 --> 24:49.360]  and make you non-essential.
[24:50.580 --> 24:52.740]  Even though it's in my film, Endgame, from 14 years ago
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.600]  that the group he ran, the Bilderberg Group,
[24:54.600 --> 24:56.640]  was planning this exact same damn thing
[24:56.640 --> 24:59.900]  because they write white papers.
[24:59.900 --> 25:00.740]  It's a big new Brzezinski.
[25:00.740 --> 25:03.500]  Before he died a few years ago, the CFR in Canada said,
[25:03.500 --> 25:05.460]  it's cheaper now just to kill the general public
[25:05.460 --> 25:06.420]  than to convince them.
[25:06.420 --> 25:08.060]  We're never going to convince the public.
[25:08.060 --> 25:09.740]  They're going against our new world order.
[25:10.580 --> 25:11.800]  We need to go ahead and just kill everybody.
[25:14.260 --> 25:17.180]  I mean, these people mean business
[25:17.180 --> 25:18.400]  and they're now implementing
[25:18.400 --> 25:21.060]  a worldwide engineered planetary collapse.
[25:21.060 --> 25:24.060]  Let's just go back to what William Shatner just said.
[25:24.060 --> 25:27.300]  In fact, let's cue that back up and play that again.
[25:27.300 --> 25:31.780]  He says, well, I look down at the earth and it's so fragile
[25:31.780 --> 25:33.380]  and so there's going to be the big event,
[25:33.380 --> 25:36.240]  the big horrible cataclysm, the big horrible,
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.860]  because they're telling them that the majority
[25:39.860 --> 25:42.280]  of the public are going to be dead by 2030.
[25:42.280 --> 25:44.600]  And that gets most people that are movie stars
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.400]  and that are rich and own their own companies,
[25:46.400 --> 25:48.680]  they all get organized, they all get taken
[25:48.680 --> 25:49.680]  to these big events.
[25:49.680 --> 25:51.220]  They sign non-disclosure forms
[25:51.220 --> 25:54.380]  and then they start walking them in to what they need to do.
[25:54.380 --> 25:58.000]  And then they give them directives on propaganda
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.080]  and talking points and how to talk to the public.
[26:00.080 --> 26:02.920]  And they put them through all sorts of NLP training
[26:02.920 --> 26:04.240]  where they talk like robots
[26:04.240 --> 26:05.920]  when you see all these politicians speaking
[26:06.480 --> 26:07.560]  and they've gotten on board.
[26:07.560 --> 26:10.320]  And that's why so many of them look scared
[26:11.980 --> 26:13.900]  because they're told it's all classified,
[26:13.900 --> 26:16.680]  but the United Nations and the Rockefeller Foundation
[26:16.680 --> 26:18.640]  are trying to save you and your family
[26:18.640 --> 26:20.320]  after the cataclysm that's coming.
[26:21.240 --> 26:22.500]  You're going to have to be an underground basis
[26:22.500 --> 26:24.920]  for a few years, but you'll be able to emerge.
[26:24.920 --> 26:25.760]  And they say, what is it?
[26:25.760 --> 26:27.440]  And they go, all right, we'll tell you.
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.440]  There's going to be a poll shift in 2029 and it gets worse.
[26:33.440 --> 26:36.840]  Our solar system's passing through a new asteroid belt
[26:36.840 --> 26:38.960]  we've discovered, larger than the Kuiper belt.
[26:38.960 --> 26:40.680]  We believe we'll start being hit there
[26:40.680 --> 26:42.420]  shortly after by large asteroids.
[26:42.420 --> 26:44.160]  None of this is true.
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.680]  None of this matters to reality, but it's okay.
[26:48.680 --> 26:50.640]  I'm in a military base, I'm underground
[26:50.640 --> 26:52.700]  and you're telling me all this.
[26:52.700 --> 26:54.400]  And again, they're recruited out of college.
[26:54.400 --> 26:55.440]  They're recruited low level
[26:55.440 --> 26:58.360]  when they're first doing TV shows in Hollywood
[26:58.360 --> 26:59.800]  where they get compromised.
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.600]  And then they're told, oh, there's too many people.
[27:01.600 --> 27:03.200]  And they go to transhumanist conferences
[27:03.200 --> 27:05.480]  and they take drugs together
[27:05.480 --> 27:07.600]  and they talk about living forever
[27:07.600 --> 27:08.680]  and merging with machines
[27:08.680 --> 27:10.480]  and how sad it is the earth's dying.
[27:10.480 --> 27:12.160]  And after decades of this,
[27:12.160 --> 27:13.980]  they've got the Federal Reserve Heads
[27:13.980 --> 27:15.360]  and the William Shatners.
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.980]  I know people that have gone with Shatner
[27:16.980 --> 27:19.760]  to these closed deals, these transhumanist conferences.
[27:19.760 --> 27:21.240]  And then what goes on at these things?
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.160]  I mean, Bill Joy wrote about it
[27:23.160 --> 27:27.160]  in Why the Future Doesn't Need Us in 1999.
[27:29.920 --> 27:31.040]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[27:31.320 --> 27:32.820]  He said, I went to a conference,
[27:32.820 --> 27:35.620]  a three-day secret conference with top billionaires,
[27:35.620 --> 27:37.300]  basically all the Silicon Valley owners.
[27:37.300 --> 27:39.000]  And we had a decision about whether
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.120]  we should keep humanity alive
[27:40.120 --> 27:42.340]  or just kill the majority of the public.
[27:42.340 --> 27:45.240]  The decision was made, well, go ahead, just kill everybody.
[27:45.240 --> 27:46.940]  You don't matter, you don't count.
[27:46.940 --> 27:48.000]  Your future doesn't matter.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.280]  And William Shatner goes up to space.
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.800]  He says, oh, it's so fragile.
[27:52.800 --> 27:54.840]  And then I realized the great catastrophe
[27:54.840 --> 27:58.240]  and the big event that's about to happen and how horrible.
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.680]  But it's for the earth.
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.480]  I mean, geez, it's for the earth.
[28:03.480 --> 28:06.640]  We're gonna kill it if we don't have the big thing coming.
[28:08.080 --> 28:11.600]  And now you know why a lot of people like
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.880]  the co-founder of PayPal, who says he's a libertarian,
[28:17.880 --> 28:20.080]  a patriot and all that, and from what I've seen overall,
[28:20.080 --> 28:24.860]  it looks like that, has his big giant underground base
[28:24.860 --> 28:27.200]  in New Zealand, that's his own private one.
[28:27.200 --> 28:29.480]  And you've got people that we know are really bad news,
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.240]  like James Cameron, who's got his own underground bases
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.080]  in New Zealand.
[28:33.080 --> 28:37.740]  And I told you about this 16, 17 years ago,
[28:37.740 --> 28:38.920]  because I was out in Hollywood,
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.560]  I was introduced to a major producer,
[28:41.560 --> 28:44.680]  by another producer I knew, and we went to a late lunch
[28:44.680 --> 28:46.640]  and they'd just been back from a meeting with Cameron
[28:46.640 --> 28:48.640]  and they told me he's moving to New Zealand,
[28:48.640 --> 28:50.080]  he's gonna sell everything.
[28:50.080 --> 28:52.200]  He's got ships in case that collapses.
[28:52.200 --> 28:53.360]  He writes it off claiming, you know,
[28:53.360 --> 28:55.640]  he does these underwater vessel discoveries
[28:55.640 --> 28:58.160]  like the Titanic, but really, you know,
[28:58.200 --> 28:59.680]  Cameron's getting ready for the mass culling
[28:59.680 --> 29:01.240]  that's coming of the earth.
[29:01.240 --> 29:04.000]  And again, then like three years later,
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.920]  it happened on the news and he left and moved away.
[29:06.920 --> 29:09.480]  Yeah, New Zealand, gave Peter Thiel citizenship
[29:09.480 --> 29:11.220]  after he spent 12 days there.
[29:11.220 --> 29:13.020]  Then he goes into the bunkers he's built,
[29:13.020 --> 29:14.080]  was just in the news two weeks ago,
[29:14.080 --> 29:15.680]  these huge underground bunkers.
[29:18.340 --> 29:23.340]  So, listen, this is it, this is what's happening.
[29:23.340 --> 29:25.260]  This is what's happening.
[29:25.260 --> 29:29.100]  And I can give you so much more inside baseball
[29:29.100 --> 29:31.620]  because so many really famous people,
[29:31.620 --> 29:33.220]  and I'm not name dropping, it doesn't even matter to me,
[29:33.220 --> 29:35.980]  except it's a way to try to wake folks up.
[29:35.980 --> 29:38.540]  Contact me because they heard me talk about this
[29:38.540 --> 29:41.540]  20 years ago and now they're being invited to events.
[29:41.540 --> 29:43.420]  They're being introduced to this.
[29:44.780 --> 29:46.940]  They're being told, hey, you better get ready
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.940]  to protect yourself and to protect your family.
[29:48.940 --> 29:50.980]  You better get on board.
[29:50.980 --> 29:54.660]  And because I and others were able to expose this paradigm
[29:54.660 --> 29:56.820]  and this plan decades before it happened,
[29:56.820 --> 29:59.460]  I told these people, you're gonna get approached
[29:59.460 --> 30:01.740]  before this to sell out and work with them
[30:01.740 --> 30:03.220]  so you and your family are safe.
[30:03.220 --> 30:05.240]  But I assure you, you really think you're gonna be safe
[30:05.240 --> 30:07.780]  once they start killing everybody and society collapses.
[30:07.780 --> 30:09.660]  They're not gonna leave you out there walking around.
[30:09.660 --> 30:12.260]  They're not gonna leave you operating on your own
[30:12.260 --> 30:14.380]  when you're so prominent and can be a leader.
[30:14.380 --> 30:16.500]  They're jealous of the fact that you're famous on your own.
[30:16.500 --> 30:17.880]  They're jealous of your talents.
[30:17.880 --> 30:19.960]  They're gonna kill you.
[30:19.960 --> 30:21.620]  They're not just gonna kill 90% of us.
[30:21.620 --> 30:24.140]  That's what they tell the initiates
[30:24.140 --> 30:25.420]  that are mid-level initiates.
[30:25.420 --> 30:27.840]  The inner priesthood says that they're gonna get rid
[30:27.840 --> 30:31.580]  of all carbon-based life forms on earth, not just humans.
[30:31.580 --> 30:36.080]  This is a serious cult, I think run by super advanced,
[30:36.080 --> 30:37.920]  super evil aliens is what the Bible says.
[30:37.920 --> 30:39.320]  But I can't prove that.
[30:39.320 --> 30:41.480]  All I know is that they say they're getting rid of us
[30:41.480 --> 30:42.840]  and they say we're obsolete
[30:42.840 --> 30:44.400]  and they say the future doesn't need us.
[30:44.400 --> 30:46.400]  And they say, looking forward to the end of humanity,
[30:46.400 --> 30:47.480]  you know, Wall Street Journal,
[30:47.480 --> 30:48.640]  and we're gonna merge the machines
[30:48.760 --> 30:50.040]  and they're taking our bodies over
[30:50.040 --> 30:52.520]  and there's nothing that we can do to stop them.
[30:52.520 --> 30:54.140]  And that's out of Klaus Schwab's damn mouth.
[30:54.140 --> 30:57.880]  So I just, you know, carry it out 99% of the way.
[30:57.880 --> 31:00.400]  And then I go, okay, why would humans do this?
[31:00.400 --> 31:02.680]  Why are they multi-generationally doing this?
[31:02.680 --> 31:03.840]  Why are they building this?
[31:03.840 --> 31:07.160]  And they'll tell you, oh, we're hooked
[31:07.160 --> 31:09.880]  into the big knowledge, we've transcended.
[31:09.880 --> 31:11.800]  And to transcend, we've got to play God
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.600]  and call the majority of the public.
[31:14.600 --> 31:18.840]  As they're, again, coined to carry them
[31:18.840 --> 31:20.760]  across the river Styx into Valhalla,
[31:20.760 --> 31:22.320]  which is really Hades.
[31:23.400 --> 31:25.880]  So you're going to experience this.
[31:25.880 --> 31:28.160]  I mean, you understand this is going to happen.
[31:28.160 --> 31:30.840]  Okay, everybody just doesn't understand this.
[31:30.840 --> 31:32.220]  I don't care if you're an auto mechanic
[31:32.220 --> 31:33.720]  or you're in the FBI or you're a colonel
[31:33.720 --> 31:35.360]  in the military or who you are.
[31:35.360 --> 31:36.760]  They're not gonna take General Milley
[31:36.760 --> 31:37.880]  to the underground bases.
[31:37.880 --> 31:39.940]  They're not gonna take Austin to the underground bases.
[31:39.940 --> 31:41.960]  No one's gonna be going in the underground bases.
[31:41.960 --> 31:43.600]  They're gonna kill all them too.
[31:45.320 --> 31:48.840]  And remember, Ian Fleming was high-level banker,
[31:48.840 --> 31:51.200]  OSS, MI6, he wrote what?
[31:51.200 --> 31:54.400]  Moonraker in what, like the early sixties?
[31:54.400 --> 31:55.960]  Pull up on Moonraker was written.
[31:55.960 --> 31:57.480]  They made it into a cheesy movie in the eighties
[31:57.480 --> 31:58.560]  with Roger Moore.
[31:58.560 --> 32:01.920]  But the elite billionaires are gonna depopulate the earth
[32:01.920 --> 32:03.240]  with a bio weapon.
[32:03.240 --> 32:06.240]  And then the bio weapon burns itself out in one year
[32:06.240 --> 32:07.440]  and then they're gonna live in space
[32:07.440 --> 32:09.920]  and then come back down to the earth and repopulate it.
[32:09.920 --> 32:10.760]  Remember that?
[32:12.960 --> 32:16.280]  And they admit that Ian Fleming talked about real plans
[32:16.280 --> 32:18.140]  and real things that were going on.
[32:20.520 --> 32:23.220]  And so this is real stuff getting floated around.
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.000]  Yeah, it's a 1979 film,
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.600]  but when was the book written by Ian Fleming, I forget.
[32:29.680 --> 32:32.740]  Look up control F book so you can find it on there.
[32:32.740 --> 32:36.720]  The point is, is that this isn't just a movie.
[32:36.720 --> 32:38.360]  This is what they plan to do to you.
[32:38.360 --> 32:40.480]  But obviously if you released a bio weapon
[32:40.520 --> 32:42.000]  that had 100% kill rate,
[32:43.200 --> 32:46.720]  all 600 nuclear reactors would melt down and blow up.
[32:46.720 --> 32:49.400]  All the other stuff would basically catch on fire.
[32:49.400 --> 32:50.440]  And we would have the equivalent
[32:50.440 --> 32:54.020]  of a giant dirty nuclear war out of the process
[32:54.020 --> 32:56.000]  of those things melting down and exploding.
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.000]  So the people believing all this and AOC like, I'm sorry,
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.920]  you'll all be dead into 2030.
[33:02.920 --> 33:05.500]  And Baker was like, I talked to the scientists.
[33:05.500 --> 33:07.400]  We will all be dead.
[33:07.400 --> 33:10.440]  They believe that because they're being told
[33:11.280 --> 33:12.240]  this extinction myth.
[33:15.400 --> 33:18.720]  So there is the book, Moonraker 19, 56 or 66.
[33:21.240 --> 33:25.280]  I can't read that, it's too far away, 55.
[33:25.280 --> 33:27.860]  All right, so 1955, I said the fifties, I was right.
[33:27.860 --> 33:31.460]  So that's where we are.
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.180]  That's what's going on.
[33:33.180 --> 33:34.360]  That's what's happening.
[33:34.360 --> 33:39.360]  And it's so frustrating to sit here and know all this.
[33:41.400 --> 33:44.360]  And to now know a lot of famous people
[33:44.360 --> 33:48.360]  that have now been approached off record to say,
[33:48.360 --> 33:51.120]  hey, the earth's probably gonna be ending real soon
[33:51.120 --> 33:51.960]  as you know it.
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.520]  And there's a big event coming.
[33:53.520 --> 33:55.120]  You wanna be part of our group.
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.660]  We'll fly out on a private jet right now.
[33:56.660 --> 33:58.840]  And it's a Senator telling you this,
[33:58.840 --> 34:01.620]  or it's Jeff Bezos telling you this,
[34:01.620 --> 34:06.120]  or it is these other folks.
[34:07.520 --> 34:10.080]  Imagine who approaches well-known people here in Austin.
[34:10.600 --> 34:15.600]  Maybe Elon Musk has been approached.
[34:16.520 --> 34:17.480]  Maybe he's approaching people.
[34:17.480 --> 34:18.400]  Maybe he said no.
[34:18.400 --> 34:20.720]  Maybe he said, don't take the vaccine.
[34:20.720 --> 34:23.600]  You see, some people want a pro-human future
[34:23.600 --> 34:26.880]  and believe in freedom and humans, others don't.
[34:26.880 --> 34:30.800]  And I consider and talk about the window dressing
[34:30.800 --> 34:32.960]  and all the crazy stories and all the interesting articles
[34:32.960 --> 34:35.760]  and all that, but none of it matters at the end of the day
[34:35.760 --> 34:38.020]  because they're building a post-human world
[34:38.020 --> 34:39.920]  where we don't exist on our ashes.
[34:40.760 --> 34:42.600]  They are destroying the worldwide supply chains.
[34:42.600 --> 34:44.720]  They are cooking up deadly viruses and releasing them
[34:44.720 --> 34:47.400]  and letting the world know they released them in our faces
[34:47.400 --> 34:49.040]  because they're proud of themselves.
[34:49.040 --> 34:51.720]  And they're giving awards at Bill and Melinda Gates
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.720]  depopulation foundation ballrooms in tuxedos.
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.080]  And then William Shatner goes, it's so beautiful.
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.800]  We have to save it.
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.320]  You know, the big calamities coming, the big thing.
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.920]  And I'm sorry, Shatner, you know, your dogs and your horses
[35:17.720 --> 35:19.100]  and your wife and your kids,
[35:19.100 --> 35:20.800]  they're not gonna make it in this.
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.840]  Our only hope is saying no to this, but I get it.
[35:23.840 --> 35:26.520]  Being invited into this, oh, it's so amazing.
[35:26.520 --> 35:28.240]  Oh my God, you've been let in on it.
[35:28.240 --> 35:30.480]  Oh, you already know about all this, Alex.
[35:30.480 --> 35:32.480]  That means you should be one of the leaders.
[35:32.480 --> 35:35.080]  And once you join us, you can be in the councils
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.240]  and some of what you want is gonna be added to it
[35:37.240 --> 35:38.680]  and some of what you don't won't be.
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.000]  But see, I'm not stupid.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  I signed onto this, I lose my soul.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.720]  I don't wanna be involved in this mass murder.
[35:43.720 --> 35:46.540]  Plus you think we're gonna be safe
[35:46.540 --> 35:48.200]  once they've killed 90% of people
[35:48.200 --> 35:50.140]  and they roll out their huge robot armies
[35:50.140 --> 35:51.060]  they've already built.
[35:51.060 --> 35:53.200]  Do you think these globalists are gonna leave
[35:53.200 --> 35:55.280]  the other quote elites around
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.240]  when their whole eugenics targeting
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.220]  is of the smartest, best people?
[36:00.220 --> 36:04.600]  Their enjoyment will be starving you to death in a cage.
[36:04.600 --> 36:07.520]  Their enjoyment will be doing brain surgery
[36:07.520 --> 36:08.740]  on your children.
[36:08.740 --> 36:11.140]  These people aren't human.
[36:13.840 --> 36:16.240]  And they hate humans.
[36:16.240 --> 36:19.840]  And they want to cut us up and vandalize us.
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.680]  They wanna cut our nose off to spite God's face.
[36:25.400 --> 36:30.120]  So that's why none of these globalists have children.
[36:31.320 --> 36:33.180]  They don't even trust you in their group
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.240]  if you have children.
[36:34.840 --> 36:36.340]  And they tell you when you're young
[36:36.340 --> 36:39.720]  and they're recruiting you into this, don't have children
[36:39.720 --> 36:41.520]  because we're not gonna let you get to the higher levels
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.860]  unless you're willing to kill children.
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.100]  So here we are on this Saturday evening
[36:48.100 --> 36:50.280]  and we're covering real issues here.
[36:50.280 --> 36:52.400]  And you can decide to selfishly believe this isn't true
[36:52.400 --> 36:54.120]  and you can be committed to your football
[36:54.120 --> 36:56.160]  and your fun and your Bud Light beer.
[36:56.160 --> 36:57.400]  Okay, great.
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.440]  The globalists say that because you don't care
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.360]  and because this information is out in the public
[37:02.360 --> 37:04.240]  and because they basically let it be known
[37:04.240 --> 37:07.200]  in public notices that they've put out in their films
[37:07.200 --> 37:09.320]  and in fiction and nonfiction
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.400]  that you now metaphysically deserve to die
[37:14.400 --> 37:16.120]  because you don't care about yourself
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.020]  and you don't care about other people.
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.120]  And so you've signed your own spiritual death warrant.
[37:23.120 --> 37:25.400]  People in the literature say, hey, we know this is true.
[37:25.400 --> 37:26.360]  We've seen all the documents.
[37:26.360 --> 37:27.200]  We've seen the clubs.
[37:27.200 --> 37:28.240]  Don't talk to us like that.
[37:28.240 --> 37:29.520]  I'm not talking to you like that.
[37:29.520 --> 37:31.120]  You already know what's going on.
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.040]  I'm talking to the people that tune into this
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.520]  and think this is funny or think this is cute
[37:37.520 --> 37:39.400]  or think this is some type of damn joke
[37:39.400 --> 37:40.680]  like I said a year ago.
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.560]  I said, if society collapses within 15 days,
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.520]  almost everybody becomes a cannibal
[37:47.520 --> 37:49.760]  and behaves like a mindless zombie.
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.520]  And I said, I don't want us to have to sit there
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.680]  and look at my neighbors and think about having to size them
[37:54.680 --> 37:57.640]  up and haul them up on a chain and eat their ass.
[37:57.640 --> 37:59.000]  But in a big enough crisis,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.520]  I probably would eat my neighbors hypothetically
[38:01.520 --> 38:03.040]  to feed my starving children.
[38:03.040 --> 38:08.040]  But I went on to say, this is a modest proposal type essay
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.880]  from hundreds of years ago where they were starving
[38:10.880 --> 38:13.520]  this Irish to death, the English were.
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.720]  And so an essay has pinned an article saying
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.280]  in the newspaper saying, why don't we just tell the Irish
[38:19.280 --> 38:22.300]  to fatten up their children like piglets and sell them to us
[38:22.300 --> 38:25.500]  and then they actually have some money for food.
[38:25.500 --> 38:27.840]  But that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:27.840 --> 38:31.120]  Soylent Green in 1984 and Brave New World
[38:31.120 --> 38:34.720]  are competing worldviews that the globalists
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.480]  want to carry out in a giant Malthusian depopulation orgy.
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.760]  And if you don't know who Malthus is,
[38:41.760 --> 38:43.680]  and you don't know who Plato is,
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.960]  and you don't know who Adolf Hitler really was,
[38:45.960 --> 38:48.280]  and if you don't know who John D. Rockefeller was,
[38:48.280 --> 38:50.200]  and you don't know who Bill Gates really is,
[38:50.200 --> 38:52.440]  you better find out real quick
[38:52.440 --> 38:54.420]  because they're gonna keep the facade of the football
[38:54.420 --> 38:57.680]  and the beaches and the, oh, empty shelves
[38:58.400 --> 38:59.240]  and you can't really travel now.
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.920]  And, oh, all the airlines are shutting down,
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.880]  people won't take the shots because they're smart.
[39:02.880 --> 39:05.480]  They knew by doing the vaccine mandates,
[39:05.480 --> 39:07.540]  it would make society break down.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.480]  They knew it would cause the breakdown of civilization.
[39:11.480 --> 39:13.180]  They'd already done all the actuaries.
[39:13.180 --> 39:14.760]  They'd already done all the focus groups.
[39:14.760 --> 39:17.680]  They knew 30, 40% of the public would never take the shots.
[39:17.680 --> 39:19.740]  And once it came out that the shots were poisonous,
[39:19.740 --> 39:21.680]  they know that 90% won't take it.
[39:21.680 --> 39:23.900]  And then they just announced everything shut down
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.960]  and the corporate heads all say it shut down
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.240]  and then everything starts unraveling even faster.
[39:30.640 --> 39:32.040]  It's been battle planned.
[39:32.040 --> 39:33.120]  It's been prepared.
[39:33.120 --> 39:34.320]  It's been psy-opt.
[39:34.320 --> 39:35.960]  And the only way you get out of it
[39:35.960 --> 39:38.360]  is recognizing the whole damn thing for what it is
[39:38.360 --> 39:39.480]  and pulling back and saying,
[39:39.480 --> 39:42.060]  whoa, I don't wanna be part of this.
[39:46.780 --> 39:49.160]  They take particularly research scientists
[39:49.160 --> 39:52.720]  that have the best inventions, the highest test scores,
[39:52.720 --> 39:54.880]  and they recruit them in high school, in college,
[39:54.880 --> 39:58.560]  and afterwards, and they put them in this science cult
[39:58.560 --> 40:01.920]  around these eugenicist death cult people.
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.040]  And then they recruit them deeper into it.
[40:05.040 --> 40:06.880]  And a lot of people actually get out of this.
[40:06.880 --> 40:08.680]  That's why tens of thousands of scientists around the world
[40:08.680 --> 40:10.780]  have been killed, shot in the back of the head,
[40:10.780 --> 40:12.960]  tortured to death, run over by cars, you name it.
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.600]  But I've talked to scientists
[40:14.600 --> 40:16.360]  who got into it and got out of it.
[40:17.980 --> 40:20.600]  I'm talking to men about 15, 16 years ago
[40:21.960 --> 40:24.620]  who were also brought in and briefed on all this.
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.860]  So, man, you don't have to believe me from 20 years ago
[40:29.860 --> 40:30.920]  and see it come true now.
[40:30.920 --> 40:32.200]  This is their plan.
[40:33.280 --> 40:35.360]  And so, you know, I've already ranted and raved here
[40:35.360 --> 40:36.320]  and I've got a lot to get to.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.520]  And I said, I wanted to cover some positive news.
[40:38.520 --> 40:41.640]  But the bad news is when William Shatner says,
[40:41.640 --> 40:43.360]  oh, the poor earth, we've gotta save it
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.440]  with the big, horrible cataclysm, the collapse,
[40:46.440 --> 40:48.360]  the thing that's coming.
[40:48.360 --> 40:49.880]  You know, he's talking to the media.
[40:49.880 --> 40:51.160]  You know what it is, right?
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.640]  Because he goes to big rooms full of the top scientists
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.520]  and the movie stars and, you know, the banker heads
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.800]  and the governors, and they're just all in there.
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.440]  But see, who hasn't been let in on these meetings, huh?
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.160]  You can see it's who's being demonized,
[41:05.160 --> 41:06.200]  it's who's being attacked,
[41:06.200 --> 41:07.600]  it's who the media is going after.
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.160]  And there are the idiots working at CNN,
[41:11.160 --> 41:13.620]  the idiots working at MSNBC and ABC News,
[41:13.620 --> 41:16.060]  pretending like they're gonna be part of the power structure
[41:16.060 --> 41:18.760]  pretending like they're gonna be able to lie to the public
[41:18.760 --> 41:21.440]  and engage in propaganda and push deadly vaccines on people
[41:21.440 --> 41:24.200]  and that somehow they're not expendable themselves
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.080]  when almost all those people working in those institutions,
[41:27.080 --> 41:28.840]  including the military, have not been let in
[41:28.840 --> 41:30.200]  on any of this information.
[41:33.160 --> 41:35.060]  But I can tell you a lot of smart people
[41:35.060 --> 41:38.940]  who are also not farsighted, who are shortsighted,
[41:38.940 --> 41:40.580]  they now know this is real,
[41:40.580 --> 41:42.720]  so they're just kissing the ass of the system,
[41:42.720 --> 41:45.560]  hoping that it somehow protects them,
[41:45.560 --> 41:48.840]  hoping that the cannibals eat them last.
[41:48.840 --> 41:53.200]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.440]  and I can sit here and I can cover
[41:57.440 --> 41:59.680]  all the little other side stories that are so entertaining,
[41:59.680 --> 42:02.120]  that are so interesting, but at the end of the day,
[42:02.120 --> 42:03.560]  why are all these world leaders
[42:03.560 --> 42:04.920]  and all these prominent people saying,
[42:04.920 --> 42:07.400]  I'm sorry, you'll all be dead in 10 years,
[42:07.400 --> 42:10.360]  the thing's coming, it's sad,
[42:10.360 --> 42:12.840]  but we gotta save the earth.
[42:12.840 --> 42:15.800]  And then the anchors are nodding, yes, mm-hmm,
[42:15.800 --> 42:17.760]  because no one asks, what are you talking about?
[42:17.760 --> 42:21.300]  He says, you know, is it right what we're doing?
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.680]  Dr. Rema Labo was,
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.040]  Dr. Rema Labo was the treating physician
[42:32.040 --> 42:34.080]  to a very famous woman leader,
[42:35.700 --> 42:38.940]  who is still in office,
[42:38.940 --> 42:41.440]  and who's been serving for 14 years.
[42:41.440 --> 42:43.440]  I think anybody can figure out who that is.
[42:43.440 --> 42:44.280]  Would you like to tell,
[42:44.280 --> 42:45.920]  I'll tell you what continent it's on,
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.760]  it's named after the goddess Europa,
[42:50.760 --> 42:53.560]  and her husband was the former head of the army,
[42:53.560 --> 42:55.440]  former head of special operations before that,
[42:55.440 --> 42:58.320]  former head of all the secret projects with the CIA,
[42:58.320 --> 43:00.000]  and before he died, Stubblebine,
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.180]  and all of them came on the show,
[43:01.180 --> 43:03.320]  they also went on the terrorist show,
[43:03.320 --> 43:04.900]  this aired 12 years ago,
[43:04.900 --> 43:08.720]  but when this world leader, head of state,
[43:09.840 --> 43:11.040]  was being treated by the physician,
[43:11.040 --> 43:12.600]  she said, well, you know about the culling,
[43:12.600 --> 43:13.920]  you know what's gonna come in soon,
[43:13.920 --> 43:15.800]  we'll have to kill 90%,
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.460]  and I just really worry about it,
[43:17.460 --> 43:18.600]  and feel bad about it, don't you?
[43:18.600 --> 43:21.160]  And Labo went ahead and played along,
[43:21.160 --> 43:22.000]  because she already knew a lot,
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.880]  you know, her husband had been running a lot of this stuff,
[43:23.880 --> 43:27.160]  I guess he turned against it later,
[43:27.160 --> 43:30.680]  but you know, you're sitting there hearing all this,
[43:30.680 --> 43:32.480]  and see, she went and testified,
[43:32.480 --> 43:35.440]  and she said, they're gonna give you a vaccine
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.420]  that gives you antibody dependency enhancement.
[43:41.420 --> 43:45.340]  You know, she's on the show 12 years ago,
[43:46.220 --> 43:50.620]  2009, with me saying it,
[43:50.620 --> 43:52.240]  because we have the documents,
[43:53.300 --> 43:56.140]  and see, I was told who she treated,
[43:56.140 --> 43:57.900]  she didn't tell me, I later asked her,
[43:57.900 --> 44:00.180]  she said, how the hell do you know that?
[44:00.180 --> 44:01.620]  I could lose my license, who told you that?
[44:01.620 --> 44:02.460]  I said, you don't worry about it,
[44:02.460 --> 44:03.860]  I don't know who you treated.
[44:06.900 --> 44:08.860]  So folks, are you going?
[44:10.540 --> 44:12.760]  To start understanding what's happening.
[44:13.820 --> 44:14.820]  Yeah, and I don't know why they're calling
[44:14.820 --> 44:16.980]  that a prophetic warming 2017,
[44:16.980 --> 44:18.580]  because that's not 2017.
[44:18.580 --> 44:19.960]  What they do is they find old stuff,
[44:19.960 --> 44:22.100]  they put it out with a new date in 2017,
[44:22.100 --> 44:23.380]  and they say, that's it.
[44:23.380 --> 44:24.940]  So guys, just take it down, please.
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.240]  I'm not mad, I just, we're gonna show it,
[44:27.240 --> 44:29.980]  it's true TV, the clips everywhere,
[44:29.980 --> 44:33.140]  it's Dr. Rema Labo, it's Jesse Ventura,
[44:33.140 --> 44:35.740]  forced vaccine depopulation plan, it's everywhere.
[44:35.740 --> 44:37.860]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock,
[44:37.860 --> 44:41.300]  not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc,
[44:41.300 --> 44:43.020]  and other essential vitamins and minerals
[44:43.020 --> 44:45.900]  are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[44:45.900 --> 44:49.020]  We don't have them long-term, we die.
[44:49.020 --> 44:50.540]  But what a lot of people don't know is,
[44:50.540 --> 44:52.540]  even if you have those compounds,
[44:52.540 --> 44:54.580]  the levels that are recommended,
[44:54.580 --> 44:57.880]  if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep,
[44:57.880 --> 45:00.500]  your body will fall apart even faster.
[45:00.500 --> 45:02.380]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water,
[45:02.380 --> 45:04.900]  and so much agitation in the culture and life,
[45:04.900 --> 45:06.780]  it's hard to settle down, it's hard to relax.
[45:06.780 --> 45:08.340]  But let me tell you something right now,
[45:08.340 --> 45:12.220]  down and out is an incredibly strong, natural compound,
[45:12.220 --> 45:13.740]  it's got over eight compounds in it,
[45:13.740 --> 45:16.140]  that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep.
[45:16.140 --> 45:17.640]  And it's such a game changer.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.180]  So with all the vitamins and minerals,
[45:19.180 --> 45:21.600]  the last big ingredient is down and out,
[45:21.600 --> 45:25.940]  available again at mfoamorestore.com, for 50% off.
[45:25.940 --> 45:27.700]  And you know what, I'm gonna keep it at 50% off
[45:27.700 --> 45:30.020]  until it sells out, even though we've already sold out
[45:30.020 --> 45:31.980]  a half of it in just the last month,
[45:31.980 --> 45:34.740]  and we probably are gonna have more for about five months.
[45:35.620 --> 45:36.940]  The fast exit, if you have to.
[45:36.940 --> 45:38.980]  As soon as you and I finish.
[45:38.980 --> 45:39.820]  You're out here.
[45:39.820 --> 45:41.700]  I'm leaving the country again, why?
[45:41.700 --> 45:45.240]  Because in a very short time, not today, not tomorrow,
[45:45.240 --> 45:50.240]  but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination
[45:50.700 --> 45:55.060]  under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[45:55.060 --> 45:57.020]  What is it about these vaccinations?
[45:57.020 --> 45:58.660]  You think that they're bad?
[45:58.660 --> 46:00.780]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact
[46:00.780 --> 46:04.380]  that the World Health Organization has decided
[46:04.900 --> 46:08.500]  that we have 90% too many people.
[46:08.500 --> 46:13.500]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974
[46:13.820 --> 46:17.140]  on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[46:17.140 --> 46:20.100]  Doctor, the response is gonna be, you're crazy.
[46:20.100 --> 46:21.600]  How can you say this stuff?
[46:21.600 --> 46:24.100]  I show them the documentation.
[46:25.460 --> 46:27.300]  Now, this is pretty shocking.
[46:27.300 --> 46:29.740]  This process has already been ongoing.
[46:29.740 --> 46:34.740]  To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines
[46:35.220 --> 46:38.500]  that were illegally approved by the FDA
[46:38.500 --> 46:41.660]  contain a substance called squalene.
[46:41.660 --> 46:44.340]  If I inject you with squalene,
[46:44.340 --> 46:47.140]  your immune system will attack the squalene,
[46:47.140 --> 46:51.200]  but then it starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.420]  What does that look like when you meet a person
[46:53.420 --> 46:54.540]  to whom that is happening?
[46:54.540 --> 46:56.580]  It looks like Gulf War syndrome.
[46:56.580 --> 46:58.780]  It looks like every joint in the body
[46:58.820 --> 47:03.500]  is swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[47:03.500 --> 47:06.020]  This is in these shocks they're gonna give us?
[47:06.020 --> 47:07.100]  It's in some of them,
[47:07.100 --> 47:10.340]  but the US government has a trick up their sleeve.
[47:10.340 --> 47:15.340]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine,
[47:17.280 --> 47:19.740]  which is a live attenuated virus.
[47:19.740 --> 47:23.620]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[47:23.620 --> 47:25.380]  You're going to get the flu.
[47:25.380 --> 47:28.740]  Everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[47:29.580 --> 47:30.420]  Then the United States government,
[47:30.420 --> 47:33.940]  based on their statements that they've already made,
[47:33.940 --> 47:37.900]  will say, oh my, we have a pandemic.
[47:37.900 --> 47:40.700]  Oh my goodness, we don't have enough doses.
[47:40.700 --> 47:45.700]  So we'll add mix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations
[47:47.660 --> 47:51.420]  that the Department of Health and Human Services announced
[47:51.420 --> 47:54.300]  that they will ship the vaccines to.
[47:54.300 --> 47:59.300]  So that's where this is.
[47:59.980 --> 48:04.980]  And imagine the control that gives them of this cataclysm,
[48:05.160 --> 48:07.380]  this collapse coming, this total deaths coming,
[48:07.380 --> 48:10.380]  but don't worry, you're gonna be prepared with it
[48:10.380 --> 48:12.140]  and you're gonna be with us during it
[48:12.140 --> 48:14.700]  and you're gonna survive because you're a good person
[48:14.700 --> 48:16.860]  and you understand we've gotta kill everybody
[48:16.860 --> 48:17.820]  for their own good.
[48:19.500 --> 48:21.180]  Because you know, during a pole shift,
[48:21.180 --> 48:23.180]  all the electricity's gonna go out for years
[48:23.180 --> 48:26.300]  and seven and a half, eight million people
[48:26.300 --> 48:28.900]  are like army ants, you know, they'll steal and destroy
[48:28.900 --> 48:30.980]  and there'll be road warrior events
[48:30.980 --> 48:35.980]  and there'll be societal degeneration
[48:36.820 --> 48:39.840]  the likes of which this planet has never seen
[48:39.840 --> 48:41.380]  with warlords and everything else.
[48:41.380 --> 48:45.820]  So we've got to get rid of the majority of the public
[48:45.820 --> 48:48.620]  and we're gonna have a vote at this event,
[48:48.620 --> 48:51.460]  at this private island with just 500 of you
[48:51.460 --> 48:52.300]  to see what you think.
[48:52.300 --> 48:55.020]  They have you come agree in consensus and vote
[48:55.020 --> 48:56.140]  for what they've already planned,
[48:56.140 --> 48:57.780]  but they get you to join the consensus.
[48:57.780 --> 49:00.620]  Oh, you think we should go ahead and use the bio weapon
[49:00.620 --> 49:01.900]  to get rid of them ahead of time?
[49:01.900 --> 49:03.100]  Oh, okay, we'll vote.
[49:03.100 --> 49:06.480]  Oh, okay, we're gonna follow your directive to kill everyone.
[49:06.480 --> 49:08.860]  We just so happen to have made it right over here.
[49:08.860 --> 49:11.340]  But first we've got to roll it out and get everybody ready
[49:11.340 --> 49:13.140]  for the lockdowns and how to take the shots
[49:13.140 --> 49:15.340]  and how to behave when it happens.
[49:17.020 --> 49:18.340]  And just, we've got to save the earth,
[49:18.340 --> 49:20.980]  we've got to save the animals, we've got to save the whales.
[49:20.980 --> 49:24.840]  And so we've got to release it and get rid of everybody
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.220]  before the pole shift, okay?
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.040]  And they tell them other stuff,
[49:32.040 --> 49:34.220]  that's as high level as I've gotten into the brainwashing
[49:34.220 --> 49:35.580]  they give them, but the higher level stuff,
[49:35.580 --> 49:37.760]  it's okay with these are the alien species,
[49:37.760 --> 49:39.540]  they told us only a certain amount of us can live,
[49:39.540 --> 49:41.020]  we're gonna merge the machines later,
[49:41.020 --> 49:42.940]  then they're gonna blow the planet up and move on.
[49:42.940 --> 49:45.300]  And then you learn that's the original transmission
[49:45.300 --> 49:46.820]  that they put in all their science fiction
[49:46.820 --> 49:49.540]  from a hundred years ago, 80 years ago, 70 years ago,
[49:49.540 --> 49:54.540]  60 years ago, out of MI6, out of OSS with who?
[49:55.500 --> 49:57.980]  Arthur C. Clarke childhood's end,
[49:57.980 --> 50:01.020]  where the loving 12 foot red devils come
[50:01.020 --> 50:02.380]  and they take over the children,
[50:02.380 --> 50:04.900]  they take them from the parents, they teach them the way,
[50:04.900 --> 50:07.520]  they merge with the other mind, give up their bodies,
[50:07.520 --> 50:09.120]  merge with the spaceship that arrives,
[50:09.120 --> 50:10.620]  and then they blow the planet earth up
[50:10.620 --> 50:12.580]  because they were evil humans on earth
[50:12.580 --> 50:15.220]  that would not follow the orders of the loving aliens.
[50:15.220 --> 50:20.220]  Now, I don't know if they're really getting transmissions
[50:22.380 --> 50:24.020]  from these, I don't understand all that.
[50:24.020 --> 50:27.540]  I just know that my soul tells me not to be part of this.
[50:27.540 --> 50:30.300]  And so there, there's the rest of the story,
[50:30.300 --> 50:33.060]  ladies and gentlemen, one of the bottom of the rabbit hole,
[50:33.060 --> 50:35.140]  the people running things think
[50:35.140 --> 50:36.820]  that they've made deals with aliens,
[50:36.820 --> 50:38.820]  that if they just kill the majority of us,
[50:38.820 --> 50:41.400]  they'll give them life extension and let them live forever.
[50:41.400 --> 50:42.660]  It's very simple.
[50:42.740 --> 50:47.740]  And then I told you when Prometheus came out 10 years ago,
[50:48.580 --> 50:51.260]  that it's a Christ story, allegory of aliens coming
[50:51.260 --> 50:53.860]  and Christ was an engineer and that they came here
[50:53.860 --> 50:55.180]  and that we've not behaved.
[50:55.180 --> 50:57.340]  So a decision has been made to go back and kill us.
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.820]  And the engineers themselves are just
[50:58.820 --> 51:01.300]  a biomechanical humanoid android.
[51:01.300 --> 51:05.220]  That's a copy of what the ancient race of humanoids was
[51:05.220 --> 51:07.900]  that ascended to a higher dimension.
[51:07.900 --> 51:09.760]  I made films on it, I talked about it.
[51:09.760 --> 51:11.960]  I told everybody, I told Joe Rogan four years ago
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.880]  on his show, Elon Musk agreed with it,
[51:13.880 --> 51:15.800]  that that's what the globalists believe.
[51:15.800 --> 51:17.560]  Recently, when the new one came out,
[51:17.560 --> 51:20.240]  he did a DVD on the latest one two years ago
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.680]  and they admitted in the original script
[51:22.680 --> 51:24.000]  that was actually what the plan was.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.640]  How did I know that?
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.800]  Because it's the Illuminati secret religion
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.280]  and they're now starting to externalize it.
[51:31.280 --> 51:33.480]  So I don't know if there's 12 foot engineers.
[51:33.480 --> 51:35.480]  I don't know if there's these 12 foot devils.
[51:35.480 --> 51:36.740]  I don't know all that.
[51:36.780 --> 51:40.660]  I know the people running things believe they're working
[51:40.660 --> 51:44.140]  for off world entities and that they interdimensionally
[51:44.140 --> 51:46.740]  contact them when they take DMT and all the rest of it.
[51:46.740 --> 51:49.260]  And the devils that look like little gestures
[51:49.260 --> 51:53.560]  crossed with an elf, always say, reject Jesus,
[51:53.560 --> 51:56.760]  create abortion, get rid of babies, kill babies,
[51:56.760 --> 51:59.780]  save the earth, your planet is dying, kill your babies.
[51:59.780 --> 52:01.980]  Bring your babies to us and chop them up
[52:01.980 --> 52:03.140]  and we'll give you secrets.
[52:03.140 --> 52:05.900]  You'll live forever if you just kill your babies.
[52:05.900 --> 52:09.180]  Kill your babies, kill yourselves, kill, kill, kill,
[52:09.180 --> 52:11.140]  kill, kill yourselves, kill yourselves.
[52:11.140 --> 52:13.900]  Every culture, the message is kill, kill, kill.
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.760]  You're a God, you know you're a God.
[52:15.760 --> 52:18.300]  You only live forever and you start killing people.
[52:18.300 --> 52:21.460]  That's what you gotta do to prove that you're really good.
[52:21.460 --> 52:23.020]  And that's what they tell you.
[52:24.340 --> 52:25.520]  Every culture did it.
[52:28.080 --> 52:28.920]  You asked why?
[52:28.920 --> 52:32.460]  Well, because their priest took hallucinogens
[52:32.460 --> 52:34.220]  and interfaced with entities that told them
[52:34.220 --> 52:37.020]  they would give them secret knowledge if they did this.
[52:39.540 --> 52:42.720]  Oh, the alien bust out of your chest,
[52:42.720 --> 52:44.260]  the Aztecs pull your heart out.
[52:44.260 --> 52:45.700]  It's the same thing.
[52:45.700 --> 52:48.820]  The birth out of us comes this alien thing
[52:48.820 --> 52:51.300]  out of the black goo of the new world order,
[52:51.300 --> 52:53.980]  out of the GMO, out of very small things
[52:53.980 --> 52:56.660]  come their big things, out of what they put in our body
[52:56.660 --> 52:59.880]  and then watch us mutate just like Prometheus.
[53:05.220 --> 53:09.460]  All right, let's get to the positive news here though
[53:09.460 --> 53:10.820]  for a moment.
[53:10.820 --> 53:15.820]  There are a lot of people like Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[53:16.420 --> 53:19.260]  and so many others that thought I was pretty crazy
[53:19.260 --> 53:20.840]  10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[53:22.460 --> 53:25.860]  And I've known Rogan for 22 years or longer
[53:25.860 --> 53:28.300]  and I've known Tucker for more than 10.
[53:29.580 --> 53:31.180]  And you know, 10 years ago Tucker went from,
[53:31.180 --> 53:32.660]  I think you were a bad guy to,
[53:32.660 --> 53:33.800]  I think you're right about a lot of stuff
[53:34.360 --> 53:35.360]  even though you're wacky.
[53:37.080 --> 53:38.220]  It was a process.
[53:39.160 --> 53:40.440]  And now they've seen basically everything
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.840]  I talked about come true.
[53:41.840 --> 53:44.200]  So they on their own are out doing their own research
[53:44.200 --> 53:46.240]  and finding out how much they're being lied to.
[53:46.240 --> 53:49.220]  So they've been red pilled, not by me.
[53:49.220 --> 53:51.200]  I was able to tell them this is gonna come.
[53:51.200 --> 53:52.940]  And then when they saw that come,
[53:52.940 --> 53:55.900]  because I knew that when I could tell them the future
[53:55.900 --> 53:57.860]  off the global stone admissions and plans,
[53:57.860 --> 53:59.320]  it would sound fantastical,
[53:59.320 --> 54:00.940]  but they would remember what I told them
[54:00.940 --> 54:02.580]  so that once they actually saw it happen,
[54:02.580 --> 54:03.820]  they would then know I was right.
[54:03.820 --> 54:05.440]  Then they would ask me how I knew all this.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.740]  And then I could tell them.
[54:07.900 --> 54:11.080]  Because I work long range, just like the globalists do.
[54:11.080 --> 54:12.080]  That's how you gotta counter them
[54:12.080 --> 54:16.180]  is in long range thinking, long range understanding.
[54:18.220 --> 54:20.060]  Not just in the moment like we're a dumb animal.
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.460]  We're not dumb animals, we're builders.
[54:22.460 --> 54:25.300]  And that's why the enemy wants control of us
[54:25.300 --> 54:26.640]  so that we build our own prison
[54:26.640 --> 54:28.740]  and our own guillotine spiritually.
[54:29.740 --> 54:32.980]  And so obviously I'm not gonna give people
[54:32.980 --> 54:35.580]  any inside baseball on Joe Rogan or anybody else like that.
[54:35.580 --> 54:37.860]  You can see what's going on with Joe Rogan.
[54:37.860 --> 54:39.740]  And you saw me over a year ago say,
[54:39.740 --> 54:41.540]  about a year and a half ago, I said,
[54:41.540 --> 54:43.700]  Joe is waking up, Joe is red pill.
[54:43.700 --> 54:46.300]  And when he gets in a position to be independent,
[54:46.300 --> 54:47.800]  he is gonna go after the censors
[54:47.800 --> 54:50.380]  and go after the establishment in his own way
[54:50.380 --> 54:54.340]  like a judo practitioner would do.
[54:54.340 --> 54:56.060]  People said, oh no, he's a sellout.
[54:56.060 --> 54:57.340]  Oh, he's a liberal.
[54:57.340 --> 54:59.900]  Oh, you know, it's all BS, you're wrong, Alex.
[54:59.900 --> 55:01.340]  You're just kissing your old friend's ass.
[55:01.340 --> 55:03.940]  And I'm like, no, I went after Joe.
[55:05.100 --> 55:07.040]  Gosh, now it's four plus years ago
[55:07.040 --> 55:08.660]  because I knew he knew all this.
[55:08.660 --> 55:10.620]  And I knew, I told him this was all coming.
[55:10.620 --> 55:13.020]  And I knew that he was being liberal
[55:13.020 --> 55:14.440]  and going along with the left out there
[55:14.440 --> 55:17.100]  and trying to assimilate and just trying to get along.
[55:17.100 --> 55:18.260]  That's what Joe wants to do.
[55:18.260 --> 55:19.100]  And I was explaining,
[55:19.100 --> 55:20.620]  you're not gonna be able to get along.
[55:20.620 --> 55:22.520]  They're gonna come after you and your family.
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.380]  Los Angeles is gonna collapse.
[55:24.380 --> 55:25.580]  It's gonna be hell on earth.
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.500]  A post-industrial world's coming.
[55:27.500 --> 55:30.060]  You know, tell your kids they don't need to go to college.
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.320]  None of that's gonna exist.
[55:31.320 --> 55:33.500]  They're gonna destroy the whole future world
[55:33.500 --> 55:34.700]  with a great reset,
[55:34.700 --> 55:38.000]  with a controlled collapse of post-industrial world.
[55:39.780 --> 55:42.120]  And Joe started seeing all of it come true.
[55:42.120 --> 55:43.380]  And then Joe realized,
[55:43.380 --> 55:45.260]  and I was a big jerk about it and I did it wrong.
[55:45.260 --> 55:47.820]  And I was very vicious on air to get his attention
[55:47.820 --> 55:50.940]  and to attack him with brotherly love
[55:50.940 --> 55:55.220]  into understanding just how serious the situation was.
[55:55.740 --> 55:57.100]  And if he was trying to go along to get along
[55:57.100 --> 55:58.460]  and conform with something
[55:58.460 --> 56:00.140]  that wants to kill him and his family,
[56:00.140 --> 56:02.660]  that I was going to come after him viciously
[56:02.660 --> 56:04.340]  to just give him a little understanding
[56:04.340 --> 56:05.620]  of what was coming in the future
[56:05.620 --> 56:07.500]  from people far worse than me
[56:07.500 --> 56:10.640]  if he didn't wake the you know what up.
[56:11.700 --> 56:14.060]  And so that's not about Alex Jones getting credit with that.
[56:14.060 --> 56:15.740]  It was the world being tyrannical
[56:15.740 --> 56:17.620]  and the oppression and the lying
[56:17.620 --> 56:20.360]  and the fact that the gloves are off and the mask is off
[56:20.360 --> 56:22.600]  that finally got Joe to wake up.
[56:23.440 --> 56:26.880]  But now you see he's a good guy as the pressure's on.
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.080]  He wants to be with humanity.
[56:28.080 --> 56:29.240]  He wants to buck the system
[56:29.240 --> 56:31.400]  and he sees humanity wants the truth too.
[56:31.400 --> 56:32.900]  And it makes him more popular.
[56:33.940 --> 56:36.000]  And so Dave Chappelle,
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.280]  who's gone along with a lot of political correctness
[56:38.280 --> 56:40.040]  over the years, very politically correct,
[56:40.040 --> 56:42.320]  you know, with a kind of a leftist angle 10 years ago,
[56:42.320 --> 56:43.160]  even five years ago.
[56:43.160 --> 56:45.560]  Now coming out saying F big tech,
[56:45.560 --> 56:47.400]  F all these big operations.
[56:47.400 --> 56:49.900]  You know, transgenders are encroaching on women's areas.
[56:49.900 --> 56:51.440]  I don't hate transgenders, he's saying,
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.920]  but you can't sit there and say
[56:52.920 --> 56:54.760]  that everybody didn't come out of a woman,
[56:54.760 --> 56:55.600]  but they're getting ready
[56:55.600 --> 56:57.200]  where humans don't come out of women,
[56:57.200 --> 56:59.000]  where humanoids are made in test tubes.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.440]  So they want to delegitimize that.
[57:01.440 --> 57:03.560]  Almost all the births are now cesareans,
[57:03.560 --> 57:05.240]  that most women aren't breastfeeding.
[57:05.240 --> 57:06.880]  We're being phased out.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.880]  Babies are supposed to sleep with their mother,
[57:08.880 --> 57:11.240]  not be put in a crib in an industrial setting.
[57:11.240 --> 57:13.200]  All of this is dehumanization.
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.440]  And so yes, humanity wants freedom.
[57:16.440 --> 57:18.120]  Humanity desires freedom.
[57:18.120 --> 57:20.800]  And so the most avant-garde popular people
[57:20.800 --> 57:23.920]  are challenging the narrative, challenging the system,
[57:23.920 --> 57:26.040]  challenging the COVID-19 lockdowns,
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.760]  challenging all this and saying,
[57:27.760 --> 57:30.040]  we don't want to assimilate to your tyranny.
[57:30.040 --> 57:33.680]  We want to overcome this tyranny and not be part of it.
[57:33.680 --> 57:35.760]  And that's the animating contest of liberty
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.060]  that we are so incredibly close to actually having.
[57:46.780 --> 57:49.560]  So first I want to play the William Shatner clip.
[57:49.560 --> 57:52.720]  And then I want to go to Joe Rogan and Dave Chappelle
[57:52.720 --> 57:54.320]  and talk about what happened there.
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.600]  But you have Gupta,
[57:59.560 --> 58:01.480]  who obviously doesn't like CNN,
[58:01.480 --> 58:03.680]  who obviously doesn't like being a paid front man,
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.600]  who obviously knows ivermectin works and hydroxychloroquine
[58:07.600 --> 58:10.520]  and knows the vaccine's poison and knows this is all BS
[58:10.520 --> 58:13.280]  and knows he has to go on TV while psycho Bill Gates
[58:13.280 --> 58:16.520]  brags about how Jeffrey Epstein's dead, ha ha ha.
[58:16.520 --> 58:19.320]  So he goes on there to get the publicity
[58:19.920 --> 58:20.760]  and to try to build his own system
[58:20.760 --> 58:24.160]  because they all envy Joe being able to have their own thing
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.160]  to be their own man and to not be Jeff Zucker's creature.
[58:30.880 --> 58:35.240]  And I can tell you that that's exactly what's going on.
[58:35.240 --> 58:36.940]  Sanjay Gupta is trapped.
[58:36.940 --> 58:38.840]  Sanjay Gupta is a slave.
[58:38.840 --> 58:42.040]  It doesn't mean that he's a good person, he's a coward.
[58:42.040 --> 58:44.360]  But he had enough courage to go on Joe
[58:45.760 --> 58:48.580]  and get dominated with just simple facts.
[58:49.520 --> 58:52.200]  Because Gupta knows the truth about all these facts.
[58:54.100 --> 58:57.860]  So he basically went on Joe's show and took a dive.
[58:57.860 --> 59:02.860]  So it's the next level for people like him that are cowards
[59:03.380 --> 59:06.440]  to start flirting with the idea of being honorable
[59:06.440 --> 59:09.440]  and to know he's a fraud and then to go on there
[59:09.440 --> 59:11.780]  and basically let all that come out
[59:11.780 --> 59:13.480]  knowing he couldn't defend himself.
[59:15.560 --> 59:16.560]  Is that a form of courage?
[59:16.560 --> 59:17.720]  I mean, I guess you could say that,
[59:17.720 --> 59:20.880]  but that's really what's going on here.
[59:20.880 --> 59:22.900]  And there's tweets out there
[59:22.900 --> 59:26.000]  that Joe's taken a real interest in and so have I.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.240]  Of journalists that were talking to CNN journalists
[59:28.240 --> 59:29.180]  behind the scenes about,
[59:29.180 --> 59:32.260]  hey, get Ivermectin to Sanjay Gupta.
[59:32.260 --> 59:34.160]  And the reporter told Sanjay Gupta that
[59:34.160 --> 59:36.120]  and then suddenly they had basically
[59:36.120 --> 59:39.120]  like CNN type detectives calling up
[59:39.120 --> 59:42.820]  asking the employers and people of the other journalists
[59:42.820 --> 59:44.280]  in another journalistic outfit,
[59:44.280 --> 59:47.520]  why are you approaching Sanjay Gupta
[59:48.280 --> 59:49.120]  with Ivermectin?
[59:49.120 --> 59:52.180]  It's an intelligence agency, it's a cult, it's goons,
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.120]  literally watching their reporters
[59:54.120 --> 59:58.040]  and watching their front people who are on one inch leashes,
[59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.080]  even wanting to know if they're privately being talked to
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.760]  by Joe Rogan or somebody else about Ivermectin
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.280]  and why don't you tell the public Ivermectin is good?
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.640]  Why don't you tell them about all these studies
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.920]  about Ivermectin being good?
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.760]  Why don't you tell them about Budessadine
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.820]  and the Oxford study?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.900]  Why don't you tell them that Sanjay?
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.520]  Why aren't you with humanity, Sanjay?
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.580]  Why are you part of the group that's killing us,
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.480]  Sanjay Gupta, you see?
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.420]  And so this is all the struggle in every man
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.500]  and woman's heart of good versus evil.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.940]  And if we're gonna have society survive
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:36.960]  and have any future, good is gonna have to win that battle
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.620]  in a minority of focused, aggressive individuals
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.980]  who will not let humanity go quietly in the night.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.760]  Most people are followers, that's who they are.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.860]  And it's our job to lead them.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.880]  It's our job to stand up by example and tell the truth
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.900]  and be ridiculed and attacked by the system,
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.260]  knowing that as this horrible system unfolds,
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.260]  people are finally going to realize how dangerous it is
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.300]  and turn the tide.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300]  And it's gonna start with the leadership
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.500]  of individuals out there that are prominent.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.380]  And that's why your support of this broadcast
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.460]  is so critical because you can directly track
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.940]  getting Trump elected, getting other nationalists elected,
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.900]  getting Bolsonaro elected, he's giving us credit,
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.100]  getting the UKIP party, and they're not perfect,
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.940]  but it was a start in there.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.660]  And all the major Patriot populist groups of the world
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.820]  will say Infowars is a key influence,
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.940]  sometimes the main influence.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.580]  Nigel Farage said on air years ago,
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.820]  half our support in UKIP's from your show
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.040]  going back 20 years ago, 15 years ago.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.340]  And then of course, once their party took over,
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.300]  became dominant, they didn't need us anymore.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.140]  Well, I don't care.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.100]  I was just there trying to get a populist movement awake
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.940]  and in charge.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.180]  And back then we were one of the top rated things
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.520]  in the UK, still are.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.600]  So that's why the enemy hates Infowars
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.020]  is they can track back basically everything
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.500]  we've broken down, what we've done to the awakenings
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.020]  of not just the general public,
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.160]  not just the masses that are very important to the fight,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.740]  but also thought leaders around the world
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.780]  to decompartmentalize them
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.300]  so they get a 35,000 foot view outside the box
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.340]  and see how they're being seduced into globalism
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.180]  in the name of saving the earth and saving themselves.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.180]  But really all it is is a very sophisticated eugenics,
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.820]  depopulation operation that wants to control humanity,
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.340]  test on us like guinea pigs
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.880]  to develop live extension technology for themselves
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.660]  to be able to basically live forever,
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.460]  which they don't wanna give the general public access to.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.500]  And so I could just repeat that emergency transmission
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.420]  to you over and over and over again for a thousand years,
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.140]  but we don't have that much time.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.300]  So let's play one more time.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.300]  William Shatner telling the world in almost a desperate way,
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.380]  what's happening is he's being told
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.740]  the end of the world's in 2030
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.380]  and the end of the world as you know it is.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.740]  The collapse has only begun.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:56.900]  The supply chain problems only begun.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.860]  It's only gonna get worse.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.240]  And CNN's on TV saying that was the before time
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.540]  back when you could go on a trip.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.480]  That was the before time when you could get medicine.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.320]  That was the before time
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.880]  when your electricity worked all the time.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.200]  That was the before time when the store shelves were full
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.140]  and you had 20 different things of every type.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.440]  You don't need that anyways.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.080]  When they said, oh, your gas prices have doubled and tripled,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.220]  that's okay.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.320]  Cause you don't need that for global warming,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.660]  but China and everybody else,
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.880]  they get all the fuel they want.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.400]  And then, oh, he orders US capacity cut
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.020]  and cuts off the pipelines.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.480]  And then when people complain, he goes,
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.440]  oh, OPEC, please increase the oil,
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.360]  but higher prices for Americans.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.000]  Putting his foot on our neck
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.080]  while empowering all the authoritarian regimes,
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.760]  a gang of crooks.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.920]  And they call that progress.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.440]  They call that liberal.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.400]  No, that's a bunch of idiot followers
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.200]  that have thrown away their birthright,
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.120]  signed onto the corporate power structure
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.200]  so they get promoted on Instagram and Twitter
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.760]  and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.400]  And they sit up there as the lapdogs
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.840]  that read their talking points out
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.880]  and dutifully attack Alex Jones
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.960]  as if they think fake courts and fake lawsuits
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.040]  and fake window dressing means anything to me
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.440]  when I know we're in a post-human,
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.120]  exterminous countdown to literal synthetic Armageddon.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.640]  Because the globalists believe the end of the world's coming
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.280]  because of war and overpopulation.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.660]  So they're triggering it early
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.980]  so they can quote control the collapse.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.400]  And that's their main rationale.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.520]  And that's the real world.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.320]  I know the dystopia we're going into.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.080]  I know how serious that is.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.440]  So when people ask me four years ago
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.280]  and we got banned off the main internet,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.460]  oh, how are you taking it?
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.440]  How is this hitting you?
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.460]  I said, it's coming for you next.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.560]  I'm just the beta test.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.960]  I know all this because it's there, it's happening.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.840]  Everything I do is a rear guard action
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.120]  just to stay on air as long as I can
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.280]  with the takeover that's happening.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.320]  We could be off next week, next month, next year.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.400]  They could shoot me on my way home today.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.280]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.840]  The point is, is that this is a damn war.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.720]  This is real.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.560]  This isn't a game.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.800]  It's not a joke.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.360]  You're going to see it for yourself.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.160]  You're already seeing the leading edge
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.880]  of the knife cutting into you
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.120]  and their own battle plan and their own admissions.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.520]  They have such arrogance about you and your family
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.560]  that they tell you they're gonna kill you.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.660]  And I understand it's scary.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.960]  I understand it's hard to deal with,
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.120]  but when you just face it for yourself
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.420]  and then see it all around you
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.860]  and decide in little ways to start opposing it,
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.600]  we can turn it around.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.500]  But the big lie is the people that serve this
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.420]  are gonna get a ticket off this planet
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.100]  or they're gonna get a ticket to the underground base
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.600]  or they're gonna be protected.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.460]  They can go up in the spaceship and oh, look down
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.620]  and see that they got to protect the earth by death.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.700]  I looked down on the earth and realized it's so fragile.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.860]  And then I saw death, the cataclysm,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.580]  that's about to befall the humans.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.420]  Oh, oh, I had to do it.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.260]  I had to be selfish.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.060]  I had to not teach them and help them and build them up.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.940]  I had to kill them to prove I was a God.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.960]  I had to depopulate them.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.480]  I had to show them.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.140]  I had to show the watchers that I was a big boy
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.260]  and that I could make the hard scientific decisions.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.700]  And you look at Bill Gates and you look at Fauci
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.040]  and they're evil little gremlins
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:28.880]  who just are filled with death and unhappy and losers.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.960]  That's not the shining angels.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.040]  That's not the big, beautiful winners.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.480]  They're not filled with poetry and life and beauty
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.500]  and the technology to create a trillion worlds
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.960]  that we have imprinted in us.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.200]  They're little selfish monsters
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.720]  working for the lowest forms of energy in creation.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:47.840]  They are a fungus.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.960]  They are a bacteria.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.120]  They are the plague.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.120]  They are the virus.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.980]  They are the infestation.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.380]  Trying to claw us down and take us with them.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.700]  And Hollywood is their big poison system
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.220]  to destroy the minds of our people.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.980]  Here is William Shatner.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.260]  What a thrilling 10 minute, it had everything.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.460]  We're so happy that you're here and it feels good.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.300]  Yeah.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.380]  And the realization once again,
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:20.140]  the fragility of this planet, the coming catastrophic event
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.900]  and we all have to clean this act up now.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.560]  Well said.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.900]  We have to clean this act up now.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.900]  We've been bad, but the coming catastrophic event,
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.700]  the world financial collapse,
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.660]  the super virus is coming because the jungles are too hot.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:39.060]  No, it's coming out of the labs.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:39.940]  So there it is.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.900]  So then, you know, I look at Dave Chappelle
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.000]  coming to Netflix and saying, F you, it's my last one.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.500]  So I'm sure they're about to resign him.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.800]  And oh, the whole thing's about transgenderism
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.960]  and gay this, gay that.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.760]  It's the whole focus is about that.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.280]  And then he shows the radicalness to be able to say,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.800]  screw you, women have babies.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.800]  And we're like, oh my God, he said two plus two equals four.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.000]  Isn't he the most brave man ever?
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.960]  And I guess that's who we are.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.800]  It's super brave to say men are men and women are women.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.520]  And then, oh, he's uncancellable.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.440]  So I mean, it's good to see him moving
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.600]  towards saying two plus two equals four.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.260]  That's a good place to start.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.760]  But I like what Joe Rogan's doing
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.880]  where he is dissecting the propaganda
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.680]  and really doing it in a calm, friendly way,
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.920]  knowing they're gonna take the bait
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.400]  and then knowing that it's all gonna come out
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.320]  that they're lying.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.520]  And so I really admire the fact that Joe has,
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.440]  in many ways does a better job at waking people up
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.040]  than I do because he does it as really America's voice,
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:43.960]  the world's voice.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.600]  I saw a Shikhar Aficionado at the bookstore this weekend,
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.300]  last weekend, and I had Joe on the cover of it and said,
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.880]  is he the voice of America?
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.440]  Well, he certainly needs to be the voice of America
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.680]  because our voice of America,
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.160]  remember the government's now a globalist
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.120]  and your mouthpiece, engaging propaganda against us.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.000]  But really we, the people are all the voice
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.600]  of America and humanity.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.640]  And so one of my greatest accomplishments
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.760]  in the ways I've influenced Joe is to get him
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.400]  to really research this globalist plan
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.960]  so that he now understands the real agenda
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.720]  that it's all about depopulation
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.480]  and it's all about medical tyranny.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.320]  And Joe is a tough guy and a smart guy.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.680]  And once he figures out that him and his family
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.800]  have no future and no safety going along with the system,
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.680]  he will become one of their greatest enemies
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.660]  if he isn't already.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.680]  This is being watched by the globalist sociologists
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.700]  and psychologists.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.080]  It's being watched by all the operatives.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.480]  The phones are all listened to.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.320]  Everything we do is tracked, that's okay.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.600]  Because the people on the other end listening,
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.120]  were you taken to the underground base?
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.260]  Were you given the little William Shatner speech
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.460]  about how we're, oh no, you weren't told that.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.340]  You're told big cataclysms are coming.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.160]  You've been told destabilization is coming.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.860]  You've been told the earth's carrying capacity
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.700]  has been reached.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.180]  But were you told that you'd be protected?
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.960]  Cause you're not going to be.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.420]  And so you can pretend you're part
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.840]  of the power structure all day.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.480]  You can pretend you're part of the system,
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.740]  listening to my phones and Joe's phones
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.140]  and Tucker Carlson's phones and reading all our emails
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.420]  and having your law firms come after us.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.480]  You can do all that till the cows come home,
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.460]  but make no mistake.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.300]  This is a spiritual fight on this beautiful planet
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.100]  and God's real and God is watching you.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.460]  And you will get religion,
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.140]  not out of the stupid controlled churches,
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.820]  but out of the real things that are going down
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.120]  in the third dimension and above and below it.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:36.060]  So let's go ahead and just play two plus two equals four
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.900]  with Dave Chappelle.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.380]  Still making everything about the transgenders
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.420]  and everything about a group that was 1 10th of 1%
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.620]  five years ago.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.420]  And the chemicals in the food and the water
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.140]  that is the biological side,
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.560]  then they give you the social side of saying,
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.580]  be feminine, be sterile, have shriveled genitals,
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.340]  everything that bisphenol A and the phthalates do
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.180]  on record to feminize men, hyper feminize women.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:04.260]  Men become sterile and have tiny penises.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.620]  Women go into puberty at age five
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.180]  and are dead by breast cancer by 35.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.100]  That's the gift of depopulation they give you.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.860]  And then while you're dying, they make you love it.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.420]  And I use the last man on earth analogy remade
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.700]  into omega man remade into I'm legend
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.880]  where Vincent Price basically finds the cure,
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.100]  but the zombies don't want the cure.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.660]  And Charlton Heston finds the cure in his blood.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.860]  That's why he was immune.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.980]  And he goes to,
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.660]  cause the majority are just like zombies,
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.620]  but an upper crust are like the Morlocks.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.780]  They have eternal life unless you get shot
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.900]  or burned and killed.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.160]  But he goes to him and says, I have the cure.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.120]  And they said, buddy, we don't want the cure
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.020]  and they kill him.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.220]  And that's exactly what this is.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.620]  You see, once they mutate and dumb down
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.340]  and destroy these people and people say,
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.360]  oh, it's not normal.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.260]  It's not natural to be quote, you know, homosexual.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.480]  And oh yes, with chemicals it is ladies and gentlemen,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.400]  because in utero in the first trimester,
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.680]  the chemicals that a fetus is exposed to
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.400]  affect sexual changes in the body and in the brain.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.760]  And so they're not really,
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.440]  these men are not really women and they're not really men.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.720]  They're more hermaphroditic and we should not hate them.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.900]  They're human beings, we should love them.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.040]  And the proclivity that they feel like they're women
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.080]  is because it's been chemically done to them.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.520]  And it's the culture inducting them into this.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.600]  And they're trying to conform, they're trying to survive.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.840]  I mean, you go to New York,
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.040]  almost every black guy you see talks like a woman
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.320]  at the store and is this sugar plum, blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.520]  And it's a big black guy who they've told to act like a woman
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.800]  and to submit to it and to be it or we'll kill your ass
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.160]  or we'll put you in prison.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.440]  This is the chemical warfare.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.080]  This is the biological warfare.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.040]  This is the system.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.120]  This is the one child policy of the West
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.520]  is the transgenderism.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.920]  And these people are victims, they're not our enemies.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.960]  But then you have the priesthood pedophiles
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.200]  who have the Renfield operatives
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.800]  who are the big muscle men then saying they're a woman
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.880]  who go out to be predators against women
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.180]  and to have that cover and say, you wouldn't hit a woman
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.060]  so they can go in bathrooms and rape women.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.200]  There's that satanic side to it.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.920]  And so it's got many different multifacents
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.880]  but to sit there and to say, hey, I don't know about you
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.720]  but every baby in this world came out
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]  between a woman's legs.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.360]  Ooh boy, did you hear that man?
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.200]  That was a good one.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.320]  That's what we celebrate now
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.560]  that we need to have Dave Chappelle
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.940]  talking about the phthalates and the chemicals.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.480]  We need to talk about how as a ritual,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.220]  leftists bring their children in to men
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.040]  who dress like women and teach them that that's feminism
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.120]  and that a man coming up dressed like a woman
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  or in an ice cream truck
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.840]  is somebody your child should go be with.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.900]  They're setting them up to be controlled
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.720]  and captured by these predators.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.140]  And the James Bond actor comes out and says,
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.500]  oh, I'm heterosexual but I like to kiss men
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.060]  and I only go to gay bars
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:17.340]  because people are so aggressive in non gay bars.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.300]  The straight bars are so aggressive and bad.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.460]  When if you look at any of the literature or research,
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.940]  the homosexual lifestyle, highest death rates, most abuse,
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.580]  absolutely out of control, brutal stuff going on
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.300]  but there's the James Bond actor saying,
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.980]  heterosexuals are just bad.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.020]  And England runs TV ads saying,
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.120]  men offering to buy a woman a drink
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.000]  or asking a woman out or talking to a woman,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.920]  you're not allowed to talk to a woman
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.680]  in British government TV ads
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.880]  if you're a man unless you're spoken to.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.040]  Oh, you're white, you're a subhuman.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.860]  Oh, you're a man, you're a subhuman.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.840]  All of this is the most flagrant,
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.360]  out of control, beyond Hitlerian propaganda
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.720]  directed by psych warfare chiefs against us.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.480]  And now in the dialectic, there's Dave Chappelle over here,
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.560]  you know, saying, oh, women have babies.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.660]  And then over here, there's drag queen story time.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.840]  And men getting women pregnant in prison
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.260]  saying they're women and the media saying they're women.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.940]  That's the mind control.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:18.160]  So let's go ahead and play Dave Chappelle.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.500]  And then we'll just back to back,
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.260]  go right into Joe Rogan with Sanjay Gupta.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.840]  They've canceled people that are more powerful than me.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.940]  They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God,
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.300]  J.K. Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books by herself.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.300]  She sold so many books, the Bible worries about her.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.620]  And they canceled her because she said in an interview,
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.740]  and this is not exactly what she said, but effectually,
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.780]  she said gender was a fact.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.140]  And then the trans community got mad as shit.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.020]  They started calling her a TERF.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.620]  I didn't even know what the fuck that was.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.300]  But I know that trans people make up words
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.500]  to win arguments.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.260]  So I looked it up.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.900]  TERF is an acronym.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.620]  Stands for trans exclusionary radical feminists.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.460]  This is a real thing.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:12.100]  This is a group of women that hate transgender.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.220]  They don't hate transgender women,
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.820]  but they look at trans women the way we blacks
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:16.980]  might look at blackface.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.820]  It offends them.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.420]  Like, this bitch is doing an impression of me.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:24.820]  Now I shouldn't speak on this because I am not a woman,
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.660]  nor am I a trans.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:28.660]  But as we've established.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.060]  Head pause, I got to say something,
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.820]  and back it up 30 seconds or 20 seconds.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.300]  Oh, because you're not a woman,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.820]  you can't speak about men dressing up like women.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.220]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.820]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.660]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.820]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.820]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.820]  You can't speak about women.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.020]  You can't speak about women dressing up like women
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.900]  coming into female spaces and competing against them
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.540]  in their sports, everywhere else.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.380]  That's asinine.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.020]  You don't see women going up into men's sports.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.860]  No, you see men going on into women's sports.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.700]  And now, oh, I shouldn't be talking about this.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.660]  I'm not a woman.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.940]  Oh, you shouldn't be talking about crime
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.460]  in black neighborhoods like Chicago
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.460]  because you're not black.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.420]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.740]  Or you shouldn't be talking about black babies
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.340]  being aborted because you're not black.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:18.940]  This idea that only people in certain groups
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.900]  can talk about that and that's their own group
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.580]  where they're then led by the globalist
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.820]  and whoever the subculture leader is,
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.780]  that's the divide and conquer strategy.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.780]  But notice he goes, hey, JK Rowling, she's good.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.060]  I mean, the Christians hate her.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.140]  It's like, hey, liberals, remember?
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.180]  She talks to your kids about hocus pocus and all this.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.420]  But now she sees women's spaces being taken over
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:43.380]  where they, again, they go in men with penises and say,
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.140]  hey, I'm a woman, do a check on my cervix.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.700]  And the female nurse goes, sir, that you,
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.740]  that's a penis, fired.
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.240]  That's a cult, folks.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:55.260]  And so they know what it is.
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.700]  They need you to accept vaccines that aren't vaccines
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.300]  that hurt you, that don't protect you.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.900]  They need to sell you on tyranny.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.300]  They need to sell you on oppression.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.660]  They need to sell you on death.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.380]  They need you to accept lies
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.220]  and that two plus two does not equal four.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.380]  So I'll give Dave Chappelle this.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.860]  At least he's gotten up again for two plus two equals four,
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.460]  but I'd like to see him get a lot further along.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.220]  You know, Dave Chappelle quit for almost a decade
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.620]  and went to Africa and other places.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.060]  Because he got approached by the quote, black mafia.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.820]  He said this, that is in Hollywood,
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:26.020]  but it's not really the black mafia led by Oprah Winfrey.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.020]  It's the eugenics mafia of a few black people
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.140]  that are allowed to operate and have power
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.980]  and millions of dollars as long as they lead
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.940]  other black people into slavery.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.440]  And Oprah Winfrey is the only black person
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.460]  who goes to the actual highest level depopulation meetings
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:45.500]  with Bill Gates, Ted Turner, George Soros,
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.060]  and the rest of them, David Rockefeller, just look it up.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:51.500]  Billionaires meet in secret to curb overpopulation, 2009.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.940]  I already knew about it before that was in the news.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.980]  And that's who came to him, Oprah Winfrey and others.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.780]  And they said, listen, you got to join our club
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.080]  and do what we say, or we're done with you.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.620]  So his whole thing has been about not going along with us,
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.340]  but believe me, Dave, it ain't about black and white, buddy.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.860]  It's about world government and your soul.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.900]  It's about the devil and God.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.660]  And you can sit there and keep pretending
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.740]  and pretending that's not what it is.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.820]  But let me tell you, you're gonna find out.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.140]  And so is JK Rowling, everybody else.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:25.120]  And I bet you my bottom dollar,
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.180]  JK Rowling's got so much dark energy
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.460]  coming at her right now.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.380]  From what I've heard, she's gotten on her knees to Jesus.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.420]  And pretty soon she'll go public with that
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.860]  because that's the only choice there is, God or the devil.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.820]  Figure it out sooner rather than later be good.
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.940]  But I'd hurry up and I'd get that choice going.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.100]  And that doesn't mean you will get some
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.060]  exploitive preacher in control of your life
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.340]  or one of these church cults.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.060]  It means you get a relationship with God.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.660]  That's what Jesus Christ talked about.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.000]  You open your spirit up to God and say, I wanna be good.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.460]  I want you to cleanse me of the evil.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.500]  I wanna be strong, I wanna help other people.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.980]  I don't wanna follow this evil.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.340]  Help me, make me better than help me be a leader.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.420]  And God will start working in your life.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.100]  That's the relationship you need.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.460]  Not some damn preacher, half of them are pedophiles.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.560]  I don't care if they're Catholic or Protestant,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.060]  the devil took them all over.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.540]  And they took over the boy scouts
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.620]  and they took over every damn institution.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.500]  And now they're coming for your children family by family
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.060]  to make you take your children to sit on the knee
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.660]  of convicted pedophiles.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.020]  This is a damn religion of destroying their innocence.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.740]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.580]  They're here all over the world from Australia
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.980]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.100]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.060]  everywhere you go, and then coming to your house
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.220]  and threatening, in some cases actually,
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:51.380]  taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.020]  And they're planning in the next year
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.380]  to expand their shield process
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.900]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.980]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.740]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.620]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.940]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.580]  many of which are made here in America
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.820]  and are very compliant,
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:12.940]  meaning US government military grade at info war store.com.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.260]  We have the entire line of silent pocket

[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.460]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.020]  We have special dry bags.
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.300]  We've got them for cell phones.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.020]  We've got them for laptops.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.860]  We've got them for iPads.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.460]  It's all there at info war store.com.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.780]  So protect your privacy today and support the info war
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.260]  at info war store.com.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:34.940]  Let's go.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.460]  22 months into COVID,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.260]  we have all the information needed
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.540]  to paint a clear picture of what's going on.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.900]  We know that Anthony Fauci,
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.820]  who has done all this before in the 1980s
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.220]  with HIV, AZT and AIDS,
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.340]  was illegally working with the communist Chinese
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:04.340]  via the NIH to create a highly contagious bat coronavirus
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.700]  in Wuhan, China.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.300]  We know that the PCR test was used
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.100]  to fraudulently create a flood of false positives
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:17.580]  to legitimize the FDA's emergency vaccine authorization.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.700]  We know that the COVID vaccines are not vaccines,
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.660]  but rather highly controversial MRNA tech
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:28.660]  that failed miserably on its animal trials.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.540]  A type of gene therapy that several top scientists warn
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.540]  will kill you if you can't keep it
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.380]  from spreading throughout the body,
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.500]  which is exactly what it is doing.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.900]  We know that no matter how deadly
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.940]  these experimental shots are,
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:46.100]  the company selling them will not be held liable.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:49.460]  It is all being taken care of by taxpayer dollars.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:53.700]  We know that the ingredients are a big secret
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.620]  and they don't want you to know what's in them.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.020]  And we know that some are getting saline placebos,
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.860]  but now we are learning what these experimental jabs
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.460]  are actually doing.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.140]  Dr. Ryan Cole, a pathologist
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:10.500]  running the biggest independent testing lab in Idaho,
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.940]  described how the MRNA shots
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:15.900]  are causing serious autoimmune disorders.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.860]  The first shot stifles the production of lymphocytes,
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.580]  which cripples the immune system,
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.500]  resulting in a massive increase of autoimmune diseases
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.820]  and cancers.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.460]  The blood work presented by Dr. Nathan Thompson
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.740]  shows the same.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.780]  And after receiving the second shot,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:37.100]  their immune system begins to fail even more.
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.180]  According to one of the top virologists
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.780]  running this program,
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.260]  you need the booster shot
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.780]  because your immune system is now failing
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:48.300]  as a result of getting the previous two shots.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.980]  The data consistently shows that these shots
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.980]  are causing massive cellular mutation
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.100]  throughout the entire body.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.220]  Often, wherever the recipient is most vulnerable.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.580]  We know that some of these shots
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.860]  are contaminated with mysterious objects
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:09.460]  that appear to grow into other objects.
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.020]  For what purpose, we don't know.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.780]  But we do know that our government,
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:18.100]  along with the entire pop culture media machine,
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.700]  are blocking life-saving treatments
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.420]  while keeping them for themselves,
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:26.740]  while pushing the deadly kill shot on the public,
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.780]  and creating a segregated society.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.540]  We know without a doubt
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:36.420]  that these mRNA injections are killing people.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:40.660]  While some may get lucky with saline placebos,
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.340]  most are having their immune system
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.420]  destroyed from the inside out.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.980]  We know these things because at this point,
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.340]  the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.140]  And we know that it's the big banks
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:56.620]  calling all the shots for their great reset,
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:00.300]  which they claim is a transhumanist utopia,
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.780]  a cure to climate change.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.220]  But who knows?
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.860]  What we all instinctively know is how to stop them.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.420]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:13.980]  Joe Rogan said years ago,
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.780]  it's wrong for biological men to be in women's sports.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.940]  Of course, that's true.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.980]  And again, oh, you're hateful to the trans people.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.180]  What, hateful to them having rights nobody else has?
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.060]  Hateful to them controlling my speech?
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.660]  Hateful of the fact that men can rape women in prison
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.460]  because they say they're a damn woman?
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.020]  You damn right I don't like those men raping women.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.860]  It's all part of confusing you.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.140]  It's all part of turning you around upside down
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.380]  so that when they take your liberty and your freedom
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.460]  and your body and your soul,
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.820]  you don't know you can cry out to God at any moment
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.140]  to transcend these people.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.620]  So to finish up with Dave Chappelle,
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.220]  and then let's talk about Rogan did a great job.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.380]  I didn't have time to watch the whole thing,
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.620]  but I watched about an hour of it.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.860]  Dissecting Sanjay Gupta in almost three hours.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.380]  Here it is.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.860]  Now I shouldn't speak on this
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.180]  because I am not a woman, nor am I a trans.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:12.540]  But as we've established, I am a feminist.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.340]  That's right.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:21.180]  By the way, the left in the last hundred years
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.140]  called themselves humanist
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.100]  so they could act like we control humans.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.100]  Oh, we're environmentalists.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.420]  We care about the earth too.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.580]  They're overriding the whole thing, destroying it.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.420]  Oh, they don't like carbon
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.300]  that the whole earth is based on.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.260]  And so I am a feminist because I'm a humanist.
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.980]  I believe in God who made humans.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.820]  I love humanity.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:38.660]  And I believe in women.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.500]  I love women.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.380]  I love humanity.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.340]  And I believe in women.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.180]  I love women.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.340]  I'm a feminist, but a feminist doesn't mean
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.580]  what they say a feminist is.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.540]  Someone that wants to control women through cults
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.660]  run by people like Oprah Winfrey,
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.220]  who has just been exploitive
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.820]  and just as bad as Harvey Weinstein with women.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.460]  The women just haven't gone public yet.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.300]  And believe me,
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:03.860]  remember the Huffington Post four years ago
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.420]  before Weinstein got indicted?
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:07.860]  I said, they're burning people.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:08.700]  They're branding them.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:09.580]  They're tying them up.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.660]  Sometimes the women disappear.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.180]  I was told that by multiple famous movie stars
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.980]  who were not BSing about the level of mind control
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.580]  and Satanism in Hollywood.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.660]  I didn't know the names of the groups,
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.380]  ladies and gentlemen, but I set it on air.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:23.140]  And within 12 hours,
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.300]  the Huffington Post came out to attack me
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.500]  and to defend Harvey Weinstein.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.620]  But what I said in that radio show
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.100]  that came out years later was the truth,
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:34.380]  according to our sources.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.420]  And I know these cults under different names.
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.860]  They do the same stuff throughout history
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.700]  over and over again.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.700]  And so there's also that level of discernment,
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.980]  but finish up with Chappelle
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:49.420]  and then we'll finish up with Rogan.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.580]  Here it is.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:54.420]  I'm Team Turf.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.780]  I agree.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.820]  I agree, man.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:02.140]  Gender is a fact.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:05.140]  You have to look at it from a woman's perspective.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.300]  Look at it like this.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:09.540]  Caitlyn Jenner, whom I've met, wonderful person.
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:14.540]  Caitlyn Jenner was voted woman of the year.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.100]  Her first year as a woman.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:18.940]  Back this up.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:19.780]  They were asking me what I want to do.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.620]  We're going to run into Rogan.
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:21.860]  Now they think about it, I don't want to.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.500]  Yeah, go ahead and back up what he's saying here.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.340]  This is really important though.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.780]  He's explaining it to these people,
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.100]  like they're three-year-olds, but it needs to be done.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.940]  Women are being displaced out of their sports.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.540]  They're being displaced out of their jobs
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.020]  by men posing as if they're women,
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:38.820]  saying that they control that space
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:41.300]  because the system wants to get rid of men's spaces,
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:45.240]  women's spaces, children's spaces, human spaces.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.340]  And so, yes, we're not just going to say,
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.740]  okay, the guy can dress like a woman and say he's a woman.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.140]  Okay, fine, let him do what he wants.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.100]  Okay, fine, free country, free world.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.460]  But oh no, you are the example of a woman.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.660]  Like saying a woman wins man of the year,
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:05.060]  you'd laugh at that.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.260]  So again, this is bullying of women.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.100]  Continue.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:15.100]  I'm Team Turf, I agree, I agree, man.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:18.540]  Gender is a fact.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.460]  You have to look at it from a woman's perspective.
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.460]  Look at it like this, Caitlyn Jenner, whom I've met,
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:29.100]  wonderful person, Caitlyn Jenner was voted
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.980]  woman of the year.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.820]  She was voted woman of the year.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.580]  Her first year as a woman.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.860]  Ain't that something?
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.460]  Beat every bitch in Detroit, she's better than all of you.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.300]  Gender is a fact, this is a fact.
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.420]  Every human being in this room, every human being on earth
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:50.340]  had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.980]  That is a fact.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.380]  Not in some Austin hospitals, it's 90% cesarean now
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.140]  because they get more money, everything's a scam.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.540]  Everything is about a woman.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.340]  It's 90% cesarean now because they get more money.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.180]  Everything's a scam.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.180]  Everything is about making your normal biological operations
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.380]  obsolete.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.980]  You don't just think Monsanto wanted to have
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.660]  Terminator jeans for soybeans and cotton
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:15.460]  where the farmer couldn't save their seeds
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.940]  and keep growing cotton for generation over generation.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:21.140]  The targets us, and they now admit that.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.700]  And Klaus Schwab says the goal
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.300]  is to take over the human species.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.660]  He says, we've already captured your countries.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.820]  And I sit there and I tell prominent people this,
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.780]  they don't believe me.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.700]  And they pull up, they say, oh my God.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.540]  But let me tell you,
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.140]  a lot of people like Leonardo DiCaprio and others,
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:39.060]  they go to Davos, they sit at the knee of Klaus Schwab.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.860]  They sit there and sign on to this whole damn thing.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.620]  And so did the heads of Google.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.220]  And so did the heads of all these institutions.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:51.200]  And then I sit there and get to see
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:54.140]  the private text messages of some of these tech heads
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:58.280]  talking about me and saying, Alex Jones is always right.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:01.840]  Hey, what do you think of Alex Jones?
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.680]  Look, he said this, it came true.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.780]  Oh, everyone knows Alex Jones is always right.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.420]  And I'm not always right.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.660]  It's usually worse than I thought.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.220]  But I'm very rarely wrong and I'm never wrong on purpose.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.920]  My whole life is about telling the truth.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.060]  I say terrible things about myself on air because it's true.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.020]  Because that dials my brain into not think about BS
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.580]  and just cut right to the reality.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.800]  And I train myself to do that continually.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.900]  These people on the other hand
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.680]  don't even know how to operate.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.960]  When I get up here and say that Henry Kissinger
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.720]  tried to hire me and get me to go to New York
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.920]  and meet with him, that's true.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.160]  And almost no one ever refuses that meeting.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.760]  If they do, they sure don't do it in public.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.200]  Because you get your ass killed like that.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.440]  I'm protected by God.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.320]  As long as God wants me to be protected.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.020]  I don't thumb my nose at the fates.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.160]  And I'm sitting there in my weird world,
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.280]  I get to have a very famous person
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.280]  show me the text message of that head of Twitter.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.220]  And that individual saying,
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.200]  yeah, Alex Jones is always right.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.760]  He said, he said, man, look, he's right again.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:11.000]  He goes, yeah, he always is.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:11.820]  Are you joking?
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.240]  No, no, he's a sage.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.900]  No, I'm not a sage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.320]  I'm not some Gandalf the gray here.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.360]  This is all out in the open.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.320]  This is going down.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.520]  This is happening.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.280]  And I sit there and have people on the street ask me,
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.640]  is it real?
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.560]  Do you really mean all this stuff you say?
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.600]  Well, I mean, all you gotta do is look up 99%
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.480]  of what I talk about.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.720]  It's all right there.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.420]  Now you got William Shatner going, I'm sorry,
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:46.800]  we have to save the earth, the cataclysm,
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.160]  the big events coming, oh God, oh man.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.740]  And the anchors are like, yeah, hmm.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.620]  Because they're in on it.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.580]  They've been read into it.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.100]  The average person gets told this
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.620]  and they just Stockholm syndrome right into it.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.580]  And it's so fun to be part of the elite
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:04.480]  and so fun to be part of the classified information
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.660]  to get a little Homeland security text
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:08.620]  and to go to the different think tank meetings
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.560]  with the CIA and the NSA and all the rest of it.
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:14.580]  Remember Jesse Ventura won the election
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:18.740]  by a landslide in the 90s there in Minnesota.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:19.780]  It was his second day at work.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.140]  And they said, hey, there's a group wants to meet you
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.700]  at the Capitol with the legislature.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.300]  He said, okay, I'll go meet with the legislature.
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.820]  He goes down in the basement, the emergency center.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:30.660]  And it's all CIA, like 20 of them around him.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.700]  He goes, you didn't tell me this was a CIA meeting.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.940]  I never, and they said, well, and it was like old ladies
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:39.260]  and black men and Asian people and old white guys,
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.260]  young people who just look like janitors
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.260]  and look like librarians and stuff.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.700]  And they were all there to just say,
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.020]  well, we're studying how you got in
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.340]  and just wanna know how much you wanna basically work
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.180]  with us and we wanna know what you're gonna do.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.420]  And we want you to run things past us.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.420]  And Ventura to his credit, he's got a lot of problems.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.260]  He's pigheaded.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:57.820]  He got up and walked out of there
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.660]  and was not compromised then
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:00.900]  because they didn't think he'd win.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:02.820]  There was such a big landslide he got in.
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.100]  And then they went after him for fake corruption stuff.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.380]  And basically he just got sick of it after a few years
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.420]  and didn't run again.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.340]  But he's a real guy.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.180]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.300]  Doesn't mean he has all the answers.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.020]  But like Trump, he really thought he was running the state
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.860]  and thought he was doing a good job.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.420]  And they don't want that.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.300]  They don't wanna have anything to do with that.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.840]  But I mean, that's another real story
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.820]  of Jesse Ventura goes down to the basement
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.640]  and there's 20 CIA people.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.100]  Some of which he'd known in his life
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:33.920]  and didn't know they were in the CIA.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.540]  Just a cult, just a secret society, crap.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.420]  And forget the Jesse Ventura story,
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.440]  that's on record that happened.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.940]  My dad, I've told this story,
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:45.180]  didn't know this until Endgame
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.780]  was about to come out 15 years ago.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:48.920]  You've heard the story a thousand times, I won't tell it.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.280]  But that's a real story.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.920]  That really happened to my dad.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.540]  I already knew about a lot of the pieces of it
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:00.140]  and saw the things in my grandma's chest of wards
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.100]  he got in documents and test scores and science fairs.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.420]  And, oh, my dad at 15 sent off to work
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.400]  at cancer research facilities in Houston
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.580]  and then sent off to be trained here and sent off.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.860]  He thought he was gonna join NASA and it wasn't NASA.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:14.300]  And finally, when he got to UT,
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.880]  when he was out of high school,
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.600]  as he was going to UT during the summers,
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.580]  plan two program and sent around the country,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.400]  they brought him to dinner
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:25.000]  at the head of the botting department's house
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.140]  and said, David, Hitler was bad.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.680]  You know, I'm Jewish, David.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.900]  That was Professor Speer at UT.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.000]  My dad said, yeah, go ahead and name names.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.340]  And he said, you know, eugenics is real though.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.920]  We have to make the human race better
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.680]  and we're not gonna go after one group.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.480]  We're just gonna go after everybody that's dumb.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.720]  And my dad did not get recruited by that and said no to it.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.120]  But that was after years, four or five years of grooming him
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.200]  just to go have that meeting
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  with the guy that was running the UT eugenics project,
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.100]  the cult leader.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.880]  And my dad had been able to see the secret nuclear reactor
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.960]  that nobody knew was there under UT.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.160]  And then my dad got to see CD-ROMs
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.800]  and all this stuff that nobody even knew existed
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.040]  you know, all sorts of other stuff.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.560]  And I've had other professors and scientists on the go,
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.160]  oh yeah, you know, they were making human animal mice.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.940]  And they asked me if I wanted to be part of that.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.320]  And if I liked it, they let me know about more secret stuff.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.720]  It's a seduction of being in the end crowd.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.160]  And my mother again, was that my office watched end game?
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.820]  She said, David, this isn't true.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:39.880]  This is horrible.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.200]  He goes, no Carol, it's all true.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.400]  And for 20 minutes,
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.040]  as we drove to my oldest daughter's ballet recital,
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.640]  he spilled his guts.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.040]  And it was a weight off his shoulders.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.540]  And his mother got really disappointed, my grandmother,
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.720]  when he did not want to continue on with NASA.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.960]  And obviously it wasn't NASA.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.120]  And that's what Star Trek was in the sixties
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.560]  at the same time that my dad was one of that program.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.360]  All the smart kids wanted to be in NASA.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.840]  Oh, we're going to take you.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.640]  Oh, you're going to be part of NASA, all right.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.480]  Yeah.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.160]  And that's their cult.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.360]  And now William Shatner comes back down from earth
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.000]  and says, I'm sorry about the great cataclysm that's coming,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.240]  but we got to save the earth.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.320]  It's so fragile.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.600]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.760]  I mean, the earth's going to be gone.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.040]  We're all be dead in 2030, says AOC.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.440]  And I mean, I talked to the scientists.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.080]  I can't tell you it's classified,
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.520]  but we're all going to be dead.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.000]  If we don't do exactly what they say.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.280]  I can just sit here and repeat this over and over again.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.560]  I mean, there's so much damn news here
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.680]  where they're killing us with the shots.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.980]  I mean, it's all totally confirmed now.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.680]  We knew it was, we had experts on,
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:57.000]  it was all confirmed and now it happened.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.760]  I mean, and we're just now normalized.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.880]  Oh yeah, doubles your chances of dying.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880]  Almost all the dead and dying took the shot.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.040]  Destroys your immune systems, gives you ADE,
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.400]  double the chances of getting sick.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.600]  If you take the shot, that's just upfront.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.040]  Gives you COVID, all over the world, the same graphs.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.900]  And oh, you'll get canceled.
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:20.080]  Oh, big pharma will come after you if you say too much.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.600]  Well, how much should you put on here?
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.120]  I don't know how much you should put on there.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.000]  These other shows.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.040]  I mean, people see what's happening to me.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.880]  They go, yeah, we see what's happening to you, man.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.080]  We don't know if we want to go all the way.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.160]  I mean, we know you're right.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.400]  Oh really, go all the way.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:32.720]  You're all going to be fricking dead.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.280]  You don't stop this.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.000]  Oh, Alex, you've got more courage than we've got.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:36.840]  I got courage?
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.240]  This is the opposite of courage.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.720]  You think I'm going to sign on to this
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.680]  to go live in some bunker while they kill everybody?
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.680]  You think that sounds like a happy place to be,
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.040]  even if they let me live?
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.200]  No, I'll stay right here on the surface.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.480]  I'm going to fight these people.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.240]  And that means fighting them with information and the truth,
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.520]  not shining up your guns and getting ready for a war
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.080]  with the police that are as big a target as we are.
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.120]  No, this is a spiritual choice.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.080]  This is a choice of facing the facts
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.360]  and saying no to the system
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.200]  and withdrawing your support from it now
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.800]  before it bankrupts you and starves you out
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.800]  to make you sign on and capitulate.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.120]  Because before they kill you,
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.240]  they want you to sign on and sterilize your kids
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.840]  and capitulate and cut yourself off from God
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.240]  so they metaphysically are allowed to come in and get you
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.440]  and tear you limb from limb, because there's rules to this.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.960]  So no, I do this out of extreme selfishness for my soul,
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.560]  extreme selfishness.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:36.120]  That's why I do this, not because I'm a hero.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.080]  And that's the great trick you people don't get out there.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.440]  You don't understand, the devil's a loser.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.200]  This thing is not good.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.520]  You shouldn't want to be with this.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.360]  Oh, but you get to go up in a spaceship
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.640]  because you're part of it.
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.640]  What a joke.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.560]  And yes, I love people and yes, I have empathy
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.760]  and yes, I love God and I don't want to kill people.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  But I can also tell you that if I was a sociopath,
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.280]  I would choose God over Satan.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.520]  If I was a, if I was a psychotic,
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.760]  I mean, how does Satanists choose the devil
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.240]  when it's a total failure and a betrayal
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.300]  and that they themselves are idiots?
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  Because they're missing something
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.240]  and they want to take us down with them.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.880]  And you've got to understand that.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.820]  These people are seeking after power.
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.440]  They know nothing about power.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.960]  They cannot even imagine real power.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.140]  They could never, you want eternal life.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:37.160]  You want to kill everybody
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.280]  because some entity promised you eternal life.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.400]  If you kill everybody, you have eternal life, you dumb ass.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.720]  You live through the species
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.620]  and you live at a higher level as spiritual energy.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.260]  And the enemy knows that they just want to be God.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.240]  They don't want to sit here and have this body go
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.400]  and be part of that.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.000]  And no, they want the control because they want to be God
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.700]  and they want to do mad scientist stuff on us.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  They are in rebellion against our creator.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.240]  It's very simple.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.000]  You look at the stars at night, you look at the universe,
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I'm with that.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.960]  You understand, I'm not with Bill Gates and Fauci
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.760]  and Peter Daszak and Oprah Winfrey and Ted Turner.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.680]  You understand, I'm not with them
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:28.680]  because they're at war against everything God made,
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.560]  everything beautiful, everything good, everything clean,
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.960]  everything that regenerates,
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.600]  everything that has the Genesis profile.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.220]  They are against Eden.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.880]  They're against the perfection of what God created
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.840]  in God's system and the free will we were given
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.020]  to accept that perfection and be part of that perfection,
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.360]  total completion.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.500]  They don't want to be complete.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.640]  They are fallen, they are failed
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.200]  and they want to take you with them.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.160]  I can repeat that a thousand more times.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.880]  Let's hear Joe Rogan speaking to the pathetic slave,
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.680]  the so-called doctor, the mouth of CNN.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.560]  They're suppressing all the real treatments,
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.480]  engaging in crimes against humanity.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.880]  Here it is.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.000]  Lying at your network about people taking human drugs
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.400]  versus drugs for veterinary-
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.440]  Calling it a horse to worm is not a flattering thing.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:15.280]  I get that.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.100]  It's a lie.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:19.160]  It's a lie on a news network and it's a lie
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.680]  that's a willing, that's a lie that they're conscious of.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.480]  It's not a mistake.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.160]  They're unfavorably framing it as veterinary medicine.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.840]  Well, the FDA put this thing out.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.800]  You saw that.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.640]  Did you see the thing that the FDA put out?
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.720]  What did the FDA put out?
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.380]  It was a tweet and it was snarky.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:38.220]  I admit it.
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.120]  They said, you are not a horse, you are not a cow.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.600]  Stop taking this stuff or something like that.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.860]  Why would you say that when you're talking about a drug
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:46.880]  that's been given out to billions and billions of people,
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.460]  a drug that was responsible for one of the inventors of it
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.300]  making-
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:51.120]  Nobel Prize.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:51.960]  Nobel Prize in 2015.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.000]  15, yeah.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.040]  Yeah, a drug that has been shown
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.960]  to stop viral replication in vitro.
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.320]  You know that, right?
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:02.000]  Why would they lie and say, that's horse dewormer?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.680]  I can afford people medicine, mother.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.040]  This is ridiculous.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:06.880]  It's just a lie.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.760]  I don't think anyone is thick.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.320]  But don't you think that a lie like that is dangerous
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.060]  on a news network when you know that they know they're lying?
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:15.800]  You know that they know that I took medicine,
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.780]  like here it is.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:18.920]  This is ivermectin.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.960]  You got it with you. This is it right here.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.720]  Somebody gave it to me.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.280]  All right, hang on.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.700]  The thing is, we're like going so fast.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.240]  Like I feel like I'm missing, I'm missing.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.880]  Do you think that that's a problem?
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.160]  That your news network lies?
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:33.240]  Well, I don't think-
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.080]  Dude.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.900]  What did they say?
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.240]  They lied and said I was taking horse dewormer.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.440]  First of all, it was prescribed to me by a doctor.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.080]  Along with a bunch of other medications.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.960]  If you got a human pill,
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.760]  because there were people that were taking
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.080]  the veterinary medication, and I, you're not, obviously.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.000]  You got it from a doctor.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.520]  So that shouldn't be called that.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.740]  Ivermectin can be a very effective medication.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:57.940]  For parasitic disease.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:00.220]  And as you say, it's probably, you know, I think what?
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:02.820]  A quarter billion people have taken it around the world.
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.660]  I get that.
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.020]  More, way more, way more.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.660]  Billions of people have taken it.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.780]  Can I just come back to the one?
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.420]  I want to talk about two things on the ledger.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:12.260]  You have, before we get to that,
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.780]  does it bother you that the news network you work for
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.100]  out and out lied, just outright lied
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.420]  about me taking horse dewormer?
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.780]  They shouldn't have said that.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:23.620]  Why did they do that?
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.060]  I don't know.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:28.940]  All right, so that is Joe Rogan owning the slime at CNN
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:31.660]  and just destroying Gupta, which is good.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.480]  He deserves it.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.640]  That man has a lot of blood on his hands.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.220]  I don't see that to score a point on Gupta.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.360]  I wish he didn't.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.200]  He can always repent.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.000]  If he means it, he can be cleansed.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.180]  I'm serious.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:42.820]  But he's gotten up there and made fun of people
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:45.660]  about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and zinc
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.620]  and vitamin D, and he's pushed the poison shots
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.820]  and said that they'll protect you.
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.780]  And now the wheels are all off that it was all a lie.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:55.780]  People go, oh, Alex, we're winning.
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.620]  It's coming out.
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:57.780]  It's all a big lie.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:00.460]  What did I tell you a year and a half ago?
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.020]  You got to think outside the box
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.860]  and look at it wide spectrum.
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.880]  If all the top scientists that weren't on the payroll
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.340]  and weren't evil like Woodard and Yeedon
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.500]  and all the rest of them knew this would happen for sure.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.660]  They're like, this will be a death sentence.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.460]  This will kill a large portion of the take it.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.780]  This will destroy civilization.
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.400]  This will discredit vaccines for generations.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.300]  We're pro vaccine.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.140]  Please, what the hell?
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:18.980]  This is crazy.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.460]  And I started saying, okay,
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.820]  they're going to blame the unvaccinated.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:26.100]  That's clear, but still it's going to come out.
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:27.060]  The vaccines don't work.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:27.900]  What are they going to do?
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.900]  And I went, oh my God, it's going to discredit the military,
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.800]  the police, the government, the medical system.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.380]  It'll break the social contract
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.140]  and the public won't believe anything
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.460]  the government says anymore
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:40.280]  when the globalists are having the government do it
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.340]  as their puppets to destroy the country.
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:44.140]  It's real simple, destroy nation states
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.100]  and say, look at the horrible job they've done
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.580]  when it's corporate systems
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:48.940]  and globalists that are doing this.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.140]  I'm not defending the government.
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:51.600]  It's been captured by evil globalists,
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:54.140]  but it's not the system doing this.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.780]  In fact, it's the police all over the country saying, no,
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:00.040]  you don't see on the news that Chicago and Miami
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.160]  and Austin and Dallas and everywhere else,
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.360]  in Los Angeles, I talked to people involved.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.400]  R.J. Saaveda was fired in Miami
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.600]  because he tried to forcibly inject the police
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.040]  and tried to kick them off the force.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:17.680]  And his commanders disagreed.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.300]  And then his deputy commander physically assaulted
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:23.660]  one of the other captains because he said, this is BS.
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:24.700]  He had a fist fight.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.260]  Asa Vada's goon started it.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:29.020]  That all came out with witnesses
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.200]  because Asa Vada was a globalist.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:34.020]  Just like he was in Austin, just like he was in Houston,
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.020]  just like he was when he was in the California Highway
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.860]  Patrol for working for the feds.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.660]  And the police have got their own issues.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:45.300]  But you notice it's the unions saying no to these shots.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.580]  And it's people going, hell no,
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.180]  cause they go to the calls and see the 15 year olds
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.380]  having heart attacks taking it.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:51.920]  Or their mama took it and died.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:55.180]  And they know what's going on and they can read the inserts.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.180]  So you think about that.
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.740]  In fact, let me hit that news right now.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:01.060]  I've just spent a lot of time on the depopulation,
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:01.900]  the rest of it.
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.140]  I'll be back tomorrow night, 4 to 6 p.m. Lord willing
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.680]  with a Sunday show to get more into this
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:06.520]  and all the other developments.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.660]  But let me just show you this.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:10.280]  Video, pathetic CNN scrambles to sweep
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.360]  Rogan Gupta exchange under the carpet.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:17.100]  A great meme going around that I know Joe likes,
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.100]  as he sent me this.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:23.020]  Joe Rogan is Hillary Clinton and CNN is Jeffrey Epstein,
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.260]  meaning Hillary killed Epstein.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:28.140]  Very smart meme, hilarious.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:32.020]  And again, Joe is red built and he's reveling in it.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:33.860]  And that's good cause he's a friend of mine.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.040]  I knew he had what it took.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.140]  I knew he could see it all for himself.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:39.300]  And he's out there researching constantly now.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.040]  And he's totally gets it.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.140]  And cause I knew Joe 20 years ago
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:46.580]  and he knew all the stuff I knew about the new world order
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.180]  and the globalist and all of it.
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.740]  Back when I knew all that stuff, he knew as much as I did.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:53.420]  And that's why I got pissed at Joe and went after him saying,
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.460]  you know, this is real.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.680]  You know, this is happening.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.100]  You know, it's about depopulation
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.260]  and I want you to do the right thing.
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.040]  And now the globalist made their move.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.560]  And so Joe's like, wow, this is all real.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.420]  I'm going to fight it, but in his own nuanced way.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.540]  So I'm excited because this is an example,
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.180]  how other people can wake up
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.140]  and how other people can get involved
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:15.780]  and how we as a society and a culture
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:19.260]  can rise above this and say to the depopulationist
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.020]  and the globalist, you may have been financed
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.180]  by the Royal families and by the robber barons
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:26.060]  and Prince Philip and Prince Charles
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.760]  may say they want to kill everybody with a virus,
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.100]  which they said, look it up.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:29.940]  But you know what?
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.300]  We're taking the wheel of the ship away from you.
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.800]  And you're not going to get away with this.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.760]  And we know that you're cooking up the viruses
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.260]  are not being caused by global warming.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.980]  And we know you're the bad guys
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.020]  with the organized post-industrial world.
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.800]  And we're going to clean the planet up on our own.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.140]  We don't need you to play God
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:46.100]  and kill all of us in the process.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.960]  State department memorandum 200, look it up.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.820]  Henry Kissinger, the plan for global government
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:54.460]  and foresty population.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:56.020]  It's a program.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.740]  The Rockefeller's put their money in to do it.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.500]  Bill Gates runs the foundation.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:00.740]  They're coming after us.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.420]  There's a Jay Sanchez tweet that's very interesting.
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.020]  And again, it's people contacting folks
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:11.160]  that talk to Gupta and saying,
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.260]  why are you talking to Jay Sanchez?
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.640]  That's the level of stuff that's going on.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.200]  And boy, don't you think Joe sees things like this?
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.520]  That really gets his wheels turning
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.080]  about how this is total suppression of this on purpose.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.120]  And he's a good guy,
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.800]  but he projects his own goodness onto other people.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.080]  And so Joe, I don't want to call him naive,
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.600]  but now as this stuff comes out in the open,
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:32.640]  they're going to have a real problem.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.320]  And not just with him, but other people.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.620]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:38.220]  So yeah, I'm excited.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.120]  Because they're going to carry this operation out
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.920]  and the question is how far are they going to get?
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.480]  And what are we going to let them do?
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.880]  But they're implementing it.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.600]  And so this is what it is.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.760]  And I'm not going to just sit here
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.480]  and play softball the new world order.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.140]  So I get a few more years above ground
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.120]  or a few more years, not behind bars.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.540]  And then sit there while the nukes are going off
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:05.000]  or sit there while the bio weapon,
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.400]  the airborne Ebola is killing everybody
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.600]  and the cities are burning.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.540]  And before the cell phones go out,
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.380]  I've got all these top people calling me saying,
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.500]  you were right, what do we do?
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.320]  What do we do?
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.380]  And I say, it's too late.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:17.400]  Kiss your ass goodbye, baby.
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.800]  Because I know that trains are coming.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.660]  I know that's what we're going under.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.140]  And so the last 27 years, 28 years, I've been dead on
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.940]  and I'm going to be dead on about the next 10.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:34.060]  And I'd love to be here in eight years in 2030
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.540]  and their program is way behind
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:37.660]  and they haven't launched their depopulation program
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.180]  and they haven't gotten rid of 90% of us,
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:41.260]  but that's the official plan.
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.580]  And they were behind schedule just like five years ago.
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:45.940]  I'm like, they're behind schedule 2021
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.340]  was they're supposed to have it all going
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.580]  and the global lockdowns and it hasn't happened.
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:50.700]  But I think they may do it though.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.980]  It's the only move they've got.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:53.180]  They're probably going to release a virus
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:54.780]  and do a UN world lockdown.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:57.020]  And I mean, you've seen the videos where I said it
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.060]  because they fricking have the white papers.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:00.700]  They have the battle plans.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.940]  I study the enemy's force posture.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.900]  It's what I do.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.020]  It's public because they're so arrogant.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.020]  Let me hit this news.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.820]  And then I'll get more into cognitive warfare
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:16.580]  and the rest of it on the Sunday show tomorrow
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.340]  because it's already getting late here
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:20.820]  and the crew's got to get home to their families.
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.540]  And it is Saturday here when we're doing this broadcast
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:24.580]  this transmission.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:27.620]  So let's just go ahead and hit this for you right here.
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:29.220]  Let's just go ahead and hit this for you right here.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.200]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.700]  I mean, we can show you the video of this
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.260]  or I can just tell you about it.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:36.460]  Biden brags administration ready to inject all ages
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:38.700]  of children five to 11 experimental jab.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:40.780]  He tells so many incredible lies like it's safe
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.660]  and effective and it totally protects you.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.200]  And oh, it's so wonderful.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.820]  Oh, and the experts agreed at the CDC and FDA
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.460]  that it's good for you and safe.
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:51.560]  When the top scientists all quit the CDC and FDA over it.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:54.380]  I mean, it's just a fricking 45 second lie.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.060]  The whole damn thing is like it came out
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.540]  of Satan's rear end.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:03.660]  Deputy Treasury Secretary only way past transition.
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:05.720]  That's a transition.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:08.060]  See the great reset, build back better.
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:11.020]  That's causing high prices is to get everyone
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:13.220]  in the US and the world vaccinated.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.580]  Oh yeah.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.340]  And then once that domino falls,
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.400]  we'll take whatever shots they want you to take.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.620]  Everybody's got to take it because everybody's got to die.
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.100]  You know, the big cataclysm hitting us right now.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.540]  Oh, but all the special unions and the FBI
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.900]  and all the teachers unions, they're all exempt,
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:29.740]  but sure not.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:32.060]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:33.540]  Meanwhile, black lives matter.
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.200]  Oh, save the black people
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.140]  while they're killing the black people,
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.620]  while they're cutting their food off in Africa.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.060]  But that's okay because all the spokespersons are black.
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.120]  The globalists just put black face on.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.940]  This is such a key article by Don Salazar.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:50.540]  Alarming double vaxed contracted COVID
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.760]  at higher rates than unvaccinated UK data shows.
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.020]  And I'm going to play with audio
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:58.180]  that one and a half minute animation put together
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:01.940]  by a British statistician firm with links under it
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.740]  to all the British government's own numbers,
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:05.560]  which is incredible.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.300]  The fine print like cigarette says it'll kill you.
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:09.900]  Fine print says, oh, on average,
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:12.620]  you're double the chances of getting sick
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:17.620]  and a much higher percentage from 30% up to 100% or double
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:20.900]  dying from COVID, being hospitalized or dying.
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.420]  And that's what the numbers show all over the world.
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:24.780]  And remember, they don't count people that die
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.900]  for the vaccine, the shot in the first 14 days.
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.860]  And that's the majority of the death.
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.900]  So it's even worse than these because worldwide,
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:33.780]  the UN runs it.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:35.380]  They don't use those numbers, but look,
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.780]  the needle point is when the shot begins, boom.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:41.000]  Right where the needle is, is where the vaccine starts.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.140]  Every country, bam, bam, within just a few weeks,
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:47.940]  it skyrockets because it's creating the spike protein
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.700]  in the body that makes you sick.
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.580]  And then you test positive for COVID.
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.020]  But now they've got the new COVID, the super cold,
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.460]  the worst cold ever that kills a large portion
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:58.340]  of those that take it.
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:53:59.980]  And they just so happen to be vaccinated,
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:01.300]  but it's not the vaccine that kills you.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:03.100]  It's a new super cold you got.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:06.080]  It's not antibody dependency enhancement.
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:09.760]  That's from John Hopkins.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.740]  And then we told you about this two weeks ago
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.960]  when this first came out, the raw data,
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.380]  but now it's in the British news, it's in the US news
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:18.580]  that, oh, not only does it not protect you,
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:20.340]  you're more likely to get sick if you take it,
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:21.340]  but that's okay.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.500]  If you wanna buy and sell, you better do it.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.620]  Oh, and we're gonna give stimulus money
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:29.260]  and taxpayer money to all the big corporations
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:30.680]  that do make people be vaccinated,
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.680]  but everybody else that refuses, you get nothing.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.020]  We take your money and then engage
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:35.340]  in economic warfare against you.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:38.340]  But that's okay, because money's worthless if you're dead.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.020]  Alarming double vax contracted COVID at higher rates
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:47.660]  than unvaccinated UK data shows.
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.100]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play with audio.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.060]  We'll just take a little pause here.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.380]  I'm not gonna talk over this.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:55.080]  I'll go ahead and play the a minute and a half graphic
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.340]  of dozens of countries around the world,
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:58.740]  hundreds show the same thing.
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:00.940]  Highest vaccinated, highest death rates,
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.780]  highest illness rates, highest hospitalization rates.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.100]  It's the same all over the world.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.360]  Within 12 to 14 days of taking the shot,
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.740]  your body starts mass producing the equivalent of COVID-19.
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:13.580]  Here it is.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:19.980]  It's Albania, take the shots, explodes.
[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.380]  Algeria, Bahamas, same story.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:29.380]  Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia,
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:42.780]  Cote de Ivory, Djibouti, Fiji, Grenada, Guinea,
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:47.780]  India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan,
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:08.860]  Malaysia, it goes on from there.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:14.860]  Mongolia, Zambia, Nepal, it goes on and on and on.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:30.500]  The illness, death, not being able to breathe,
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:31.660]  being put on the ventilator,
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:36.660]  all directed by the United Nations, Taiwan, Thailand.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:44.860]  Tobago, Indonesia, Uganda, United Kingdom, Uruguay,
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:57.460]  Vietnam, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:02.460]  But it's okay, Tim Cook's gay, run some death camps,
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:06.420]  got 3 million slaves, suicide nets, forced abortion,
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.260]  but he's got a black turtleneck.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:12.660]  Yeah, and there's a big cataclysm coming
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:14.660]  and you're all gonna be dead soon.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:19.660]  It's so sad, it's so sad, it's so sad.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:25.260]  It's so sad, it's so sad, it's so sad.
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:30.620]  It's so sad, yes, so sad for all of you.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:37.340]  I like to freak the Satanist out.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:44.340]  God's gonna tear you into pieces
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.780]  and then banish you to be with spirits
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:50.500]  like yourself for eternity, so I hope you enjoy it.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.740]  I don't take any pleasure in it,
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:55.860]  but I do take a lot of serenity in knowing
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.020]  that I won't have to be around you forever.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:02.180]  And your energy will finally be separate from me
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.420]  because I can smell it and I can feel it
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:06.620]  and I can taste it.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:10.940]  Rub it up against me.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:18.340]  Snake scales, that smell, that stink, that spiritual filth.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:23.340]  Ugh, that broadcast, hmm.
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:53.340]  I've been on the air for almost 30 years.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.260]  And what does your gut, what does your spirit
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:57.620]  tell you on top of that?
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:02.220]  Plus the idea that if Alex Jones was for real,
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:04.540]  he'd be dead is a loser mentality.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.540]  I trust in God and I'll be alive
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:09.220]  as long as God wants me to be alive.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:10.860]  Plus I understand history.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:14.460]  Garrison, the DA in New Orleans who exposed
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:16.140]  the fact that they really assassinated Kennedy
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:18.100]  and got all those congressional hearings going
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:21.260]  and totally exposed the system and got sued
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.180]  by CIA operatives and won.
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:26.260]  He said, I'm alive because I stay in the sunshine
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:27.100]  and I'm out in the open.
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:28.660]  They threatened his family, they attacked him,
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.660]  they did all these terrible things, but he kept fighting.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:34.820]  And so that's why I'm still here.
[01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:37.060]  But there's another big reason.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.260]  Not just being in the sunshine,
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:39.700]  God of course is the main reason,
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.980]  but also because there's so many good people.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:45.060]  That's why when I see Tucker Carlson the last 10 years
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.140]  get more and more awake or Joe Rogan
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:49.620]  or countless others or Glenn Beck starting to get
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:50.580]  really totally woke.
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:54.420]  I mean, when I see stuff like that,
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.920]  that's not competition for me, I get excited.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.140]  That's what's gonna protect me and my family.
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:01.020]  So I've told you this a hundred times,
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:02.820]  probably this year already
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:04.220]  and thousands of times over the years,
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:06.580]  my job is to become obsolete.
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:08.300]  My job is to turn the tide against tyranny
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:10.860]  and things be so good and people know what I know
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:12.380]  about the new world order and how to stop it
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:15.120]  and how they operate to such an extent
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:19.800]  that I have become passe, I have become redundant.
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.440]  I have become where I don't even really matter anymore
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.640]  because it's accepted knowledge.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:28.320]  So you've been attacked,
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.880]  you've been demonized for supporting liberty, so have I.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.000]  It's okay, God's watching and that's all that matters.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.840]  And we've been vindicated now
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.160]  by the horror that's happening.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.720]  I don't wanna be vindicated anymore
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:40.360]  by more of where we know this goes.
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.960]  We have their own documents, we have Operation Lockstep,
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.720]  we have the SPARS event, we have it all.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.680]  And then separately, there's so many great people
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.200]  like Mercola and countless others
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.000]  that have been awake as long as I've been or longer.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.200]  And so there's millions of people, black, white,
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.920]  Hispanic, Asian, old, young,
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.840]  who all are understanding what's happening
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.320]  and now they're speaking up more than ever.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:04.000]  So all of you are the answer.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.760]  All of you speaking out of the answer.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.800]  And separately, we're helping so many people.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:10.840]  The corporations aren't all bad,
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.600]  the government's not all bad, they're just people like us.
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:14.800]  It's who's in control at the top.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.040]  So we have a lot of friends in the system as well
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.160]  who don't wanna see Alex Jones dead or put in prison
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.760]  or Owen put in prison, but they're sure as hell trying
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.240]  where they even get rid of jury trials for us.
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.560]  So we're at the tip of the spear.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.600]  I am consciously trying to be as good as I can.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.240]  I'm a fallen creature though,
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:31.720]  fall short of the glory of God,
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.880]  but I'm consciously and my spirit is pointed towards God
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.000]  and being a good, just person.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.040]  Please help keep us on the air during this critical time.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.440]  We're having the biggest success we've ever had
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.280]  against the New World Order.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.400]  Get your DNA force plus,
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.000]  it's been sold out for six months.

[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:46.040]  and your body.

[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:36.400]  So you're on a planet, you're under attack.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.600]  Call it space invaders, call it whatever you want,
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.160]  but you don't want to be one of the slaves
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:43.240]  or the so-called leaders of the system.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.980]  You think Joe Biden's a winner.
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:46.040]  Think Hunter Biden's a winner.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.440]  You think Gigi ping is a winner serving the system.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:51.160]  Think again.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.240]  Oh, so I've gotten through three articles.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.100]  Let's continue.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.000]  Oh, look at a mainstream news article.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.840]  Oh, vaccination rates are not likely to lower COVID rates
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.400]  epidemiology paper fines.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.600]  It's a fricking whitewash, it makes it twice as bad.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.000]  Newsom who wants kids vaccinated fights vaccine mandates
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.480]  for prison guards whose union gave 1.75 million
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.460]  to fight the recall.
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.620]  Oh, they don't have to take it,
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.820]  but they're trying to make you.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:17.000]  That's total discrimination.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.040]  It's illegal on its face,
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:19.800]  but they're trying to convince you it's okay.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.520]  And Democrat judges say it's going to happen.
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.040]  They don't have to take it, but you do.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.480]  They claim, no, you don't.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:28.760]  Exclusive House Republicans to introduce freedom act
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:31.300]  would fight Biden's vaccine mandates.
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:33.020]  Good news.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.400]  Texas Supreme court rules against San Antonio school
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:38.360]  district vaccine mandate saying you got to have it period
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.840]  for the teachers and others.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.960]  Meanwhile, mainline Taiwan national news,
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.360]  more deaths from vaccination than from COVID-19
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.160]  the government officially documents.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.120]  Protests erupt in Italy,
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.320]  becomes the first nation to mandate vaccine passes
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:53.960]  for all workers.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.120]  New York city judge prevents father from visiting his
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.280]  daughter unless he takes the COVID vaccine,
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.480]  pure evil violation of the Nuremberg code.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:09.300]  UK MP, David Davis blast YouTube for censoring his speech
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.680]  against COVID passports.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.560]  Yep, manipulating governments,
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.700]  totally censoring next level tyranny.
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.800]  Pentagon takes on Texas over vaccine mandates,
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.040]  fights to stop the state from not many people take the shot.
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.040]  Oh, what's the Pentagon doing involved?
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:28.160]  Miami police union clashes with chief over threat of COVID
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.060]  vaccine mandate.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:30.280]  That was weeks ago.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.360]  I read the transcript of the hearing.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.800]  It was all about the four shots.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:36.840]  They threw his out, but no national news will tell you that
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.040]  just like all the other victories we're having.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.240]  I'll never hear about it.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.200]  And it goes on and on.
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:46.440]  Oh, but parental control is a smokescreen
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.640]  for right-wing activists.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.480]  That's right.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.360]  Parental controls are right-wing thing.
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.400]  Reject parental control.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.880]  Just like you reject freedom of speech liberals.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.120]  And now you're pro war and pro torture.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.700]  You're such angels.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:03.680]  All right, look, this has been a powerful transmission.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.560]  I appreciate the crew coming in.
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:07.760]  I've got all these other stacks.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:12.160]  And if I got into this, I'd be here for hour after hour,
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:13.880]  after hour, after hour.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:20.860]  Tomorrow, I'm going to get into cognitive warfare and NATO,
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:22.280]  admitting they run the Pentagon.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.880]  They're involved in mass brainwashing and lying to the public
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.920]  and how they turn you against yourself and your family.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:28.400]  Now they make you feel pathetic,
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.280]  hoping you'll basically kill yourself.
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.760]  I suggest you do the opposite and love God
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.640]  and then love yourself and love others
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.920]  and decide that you're not going to resonate
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.040]  with their evil and it's a spiritual choice.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.380]  The matter of your car's broke down,
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.560]  your shoes got holes in it or whatever it is,
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.400]  you're not going to be happy
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:45.680]  until you've got spiritual sustenance,
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:48.880]  which you're going to get by opening yourself up to God.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.600]  The worst place to go is these churches, I can tell you.
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:54.480]  Here is the hidden 150 trillion agenda
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.680]  behind the crusade against climate change.
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.720]  I'm going to read this article tomorrow on air
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:00.000]  and show you the documents.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.660]  I mean, it's not just 150 trillion
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:03.300]  bankers give themselves to buy everything up
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.180]  under the carbon tax in the next 10 years.
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:06.260]  It's official announcement
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.660]  that Biden's got the world signing onto
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:09.860]  or his controllers do.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:12.600]  It's that it cuts off all the fuel
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.300]  and it'll kill at least 3 million people in the next decade.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:16.740]  But that's the great cataclysm.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.820]  They're going to say it's all naturally occurring.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:20.580]  Like they cut the fuel off, they're starving.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.980]  Oh, we don't know why they're starving.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:24.820]  Oh, no one can leave their house in Africa.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:25.820]  We wonder why they're starving.
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:29.860]  Oh, COVID, no, no, it's the COVID lockdown killing people.
[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:36.660]  I'm going to leave this transmission
[02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:40.460]  with this little tidbit of information.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.240]  And I just want to have a strong finish.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.000]  I don't want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:48.840]  that they've got to win.
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:49.660]  They've got to take over.
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:50.760]  They've got to depopulate first
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.520]  before their system collapses.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.380]  I want to believe that God can, like Nineveh,
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.580]  give us a reprieve at least for our lifetimes
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:00.300]  and hopefully others lifetimes out of this.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:01.940]  You see the writing on the wall.
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:04.740]  I'm just here to give everything my full push
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.600]  and to be as strong as I can and as truthful as I can.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:10.580]  So help me God and to commit myself into God's hands
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:13.460]  so that people that are meant to hear this message
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:14.300]  are going to hear it.
[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:15.900]  And those that are meant to have a connection to God
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:16.740]  are going to find it.
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.140]  And I just appreciate this crew.
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:20.100]  And I appreciate everybody that makes these special shows
[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:21.260]  and all of them possible.
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:23.460]  And I'll just leave this information with you.
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:27.220]  If we get a lot of funding in here,
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.500]  we're going to be able to, working with others,
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.140]  launch a lot of amazing projects
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:33.020]  and be involved in a lot of amazing projects
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:34.940]  that you see like COVID land already reaching
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:36.300]  millions and millions of people
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:40.780]  and more versions of the film and new films coming out
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:42.780]  and other films in production and other.
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:45.260]  I mean, I'm just working three times harder
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:46.220]  than I ever have.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:47.140]  I'm totally focused.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.420]  I've never been given so much energy.
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.600]  It's all God.
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.460]  And I've got 15 projects that are going.
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:55.060]  Seven or eight of them are huge
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:57.260]  and four or five of them are almost ready.
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:59.260]  I'm talking by early next year.
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:00.940]  And I'm just going to keep working and working and working
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:02.340]  on what we're doing and things we're doing.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:04.540]  And you know, a lot of the stuff going on,
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.780]  you don't see what we're behind.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:06.600]  That's okay.
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.700]  Or you don't see what's going on.
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.900]  You see the big effect we have.
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:10.560]  And I like to tell you the big effect we're having.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.300]  So you feel good about your support of the broadcast.
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:13.600]  Understand that it's, you know,
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.220]  you out there that's really promoting this
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.220]  and carrying the ball on the field.
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:21.460]  So I just needed to take on the globalist
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.060]  with everything I got.
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.220]  And that means we need massive capital
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:29.500]  to expand our operations and to work with others
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:33.220]  and just to override the enemy with support.
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:34.380]  We don't get millions of dollars.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:35.620]  We don't get hundreds of dollars.
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.260]  We don't get dozens of cents.
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:40.040]  We get zero from George Soros, the big corporations.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.180]  We're supported by viewers like you that buy t-shirts,
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.900]  buy books, buy storeable food,
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.740]  that buy high quality coffee,
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.380]  that buy high quality supplements
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:49.500]  that are amazing that people totally love.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:51.220]  You know, I always had one of my security guys
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:52.460]  that I have with me.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.220]  You know, that's another one of the expenses.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.500]  Because you know, the globalists, their operations,
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:57.420]  we don't want to make it easy to kill me.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:00.980]  And believe me, they certainly would like that to happen.
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:02.700]  And so I said, hey,
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:04.700]  why don't you take some of this vitamin D3
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:06.340]  and some of this ultra 12
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:10.820]  and a little bit of this iodine in some soda water,
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.860]  you know, just natural sparkling water with lemon in it,
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:17.780]  or lime in it, with a little bit of a brain force ultra.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.260]  He said, sure, I'll drink it.
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:20.860]  I gave him a very small dose of all of it.
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.380]  He was, he said, I feel amazing.
[02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:25.320]  This is incredible in like an hour.
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:28.320]  Because this stuff works.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.840]  And it's amazing.
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.280]  And tomorrow is the last day to get all these products
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.360]  at 40 to 50% off the DNA force plus back in stock,
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.600]  ultra 12, winter sun.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.000]  We've extended the sale as long as we can.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.280]  It'll be months till we get more in once it sells out.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.720]  So I'm going to go to full price for the next month or so
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:45.960]  until we hopefully get more in,
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.420]  because I need that full price
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:48.680]  to be able to fund our operation.
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.280]  But at the same time, people react
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.440]  and buy more of the product when we sell it at discount.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:53.720]  So I've got to sell it at discount
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.520]  just to get money in to keep the operation going.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:58.920]  So you got a commitment for me to fight really hard here.
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.040]  We got a lot of great products.
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.240]  It'll make your life a lot better.
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:04.280]  So check them all out at info war store.com
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:07.840]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.000]  And you've been great supporters.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.240]  You know, last year we dug ourselves
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.280]  out of a $5 million hole,
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.760]  but then the supply chain breakdowns,
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:15.140]  we can't enough product to sell.
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.480]  So we haven't had as much money as we need,
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:19.280]  but I'm very close to selling my house.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.860]  So that'll give us extra,
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:23.380]  extra logs to throw into the steam engine here
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.420]  as we just approach maximum ramming speed
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:27.360]  with the new world order.
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:28.540]  And I'll just be honest with you,
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:32.660]  spiritually I'm on fire and I'm very blessed
[02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:33.840]  to be in this position and very thankful
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.100]  for all you out there supporting us.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.720]  So I would suggest you go to info war store.com
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.180]  and get great products while you put money in our war chest
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.620]  to be as effective as we can here.
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:44.340]  But if God wants us to go on at the pace we are
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:46.740]  and do the projects we've got, then that's the case.
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:48.740]  And then we'll just kind of implode down
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.740]  into this hell hole the next few years.
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:52.860]  And someday I'll probably just be completely off the air
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.820]  and I'll say farewell, last transmission, good luck.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.340]  Hope you fight hard.
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.500]  They're coming to kill you and your family.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.580]  Already killed millions of people.
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:02.860]  But instead I'd like to really in this moment
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:05.380]  of the globalists making their big move on us,
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:08.700]  radically expand in their face very, very aggressively
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:11.360]  and just throw everything we've got at them energetically
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:14.300]  with the truth now and just absolutely
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.100]  have a huge grand slam effect.
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:19.580]  So I'm just in the position to try to grow and fight
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:21.760]  and work as hard as I can in every way.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.240]  But I need your prayers.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:24.200]  I need your word of mouth.
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:27.320]  I need your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.200]  All right, I got a few clips I didn't get to
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:30.600]  that I wanna play here at the end.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.960]  And then this will be restreaming and re-airing
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:37.240]  at infowars.com, forward slash show and band.video.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:39.760]  And I hope you share those links.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.900]  But let's go ahead and,
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.700]  let's go ahead and play a few of these clips here.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:49.040]  Let's play a few of these really important
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.600]  John Bowne reports he did this week.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.040]  And a couple of the great reports
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:56.480]  that have also been done by Greg Reese.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.120]  I just wanna leave you with this monster
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:11:59.840]  salivating over your children
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.500]  and how he wants to poison them for his God.
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:06.200]  Clip one, Biden, we already have purchased enough vaccines
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:07.600]  for all children.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.520]  And then we also have, I wanna air this clip two,
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.260]  students support diversity quotas
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:14.780]  until it comes to football.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.740]  And then the absolute state of California,
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:21.160]  I wanna play the daylight robberies
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.000]  at drugstores going on that the local governments defend.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.220]  And then I also wanna show the man with a bow and arrow
[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:28.280]  kills five people in Norway.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.920]  The Islamicists are trying to cover that up.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.540]  And so that's just some of the clips
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:34.060]  we're gonna have there.
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:36.740]  And then also clip nine, more carbon dioxide
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.220]  equals more plant life from Joe Rogan last year,
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:41.300]  which is a fact and is a revolutionary fact
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.820]  that they don't want you to understand.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.180]  They want death on this planet.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.580]  They want all life dead.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:46.460]  That is their message.
[02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:48.020]  That is their constant transmission.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:49.860]  Kill yourself, kill the planet, blow it up,
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:51.020]  we'll give you eternal life.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.300]  Kill yourself, kill the children,
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:53.860]  kill the planet, we'll give you eternal life.
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:55.420]  Kill death, just murder yourselves,
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:57.380]  murder yourselves, murder yourselves.
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.420]  And that's what they take the DMT and all the rest of it
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:01.140]  to go be told that over and over again.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:03.040]  Sounds like hell on earth, doesn't it?
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:04.360]  So that's the transmission.
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:06.060]  Thank you so much for tuning in tonight.
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:07.120]  I wanna again thank the crew
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:08.580]  and I'll see you back tomorrow night,
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:11.620]  four to 6 p.m. Central, Lord willing, thank you.
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:16.620]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:20.420]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:22.420]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:26.260]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government
[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:29.540]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map
[02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:32.060]  and a database of where you go and what you do.
[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:34.660]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.480]  they can shut you down.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:39.680]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards,
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:42.160]  protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:45.400]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:48.120]  That's why everybody should visit Infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.080]  We're carrying a huge new line
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:53.260]  of very compliant made in America products

[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:57.800]  It's a 360 win.

[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:03.700]  to support the overall Infowar against the globalists,

[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:10.400]  It's amazing.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.880]  Now I know parents out there are anxiously waiting
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:22.080]  for a vaccine for children ages five to 11.
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:27.360]  The good news is the FDA and outside experts in the CDC
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.600]  are set to make its determination
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.280]  as to whether the vaccine will be authorized
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.820]  for that age range in the next few weeks.
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:38.460]  If authorized, we are ready.
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.340]  We have purchased enough vaccines for all children
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:46.200]  between the ages of five and 11 in the United States.
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.380]  And it'll be convenient for parents
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:51.660]  to get their children vaccinated at trusted locations
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:54.580]  and families will be able to sleep easier at night
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:57.060]  knowing their kids are protected as well.
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:14:59.020]  Hi, I'm Ophelia Jacobson with Campus Reform.
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.260]  It's game day here at the University of Florida
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.840]  and we're talking with college students
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:04.780]  about diversity quotas today.
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:07.060]  Do students support these quotas in the workplace
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:08.820]  and in the college admissions process?
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.560]  And will these students change their mind
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.960]  if we apply those same diversity quotas
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.900]  to the Florida Gators football team?
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:15.900]  Let's find out.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:18.220]  Talking first about diversity just in general,
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:19.700]  do you think diversity should be a factor
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:22.500]  in hiring decisions and in college admissions processes?
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:26.860]  Probably they should probably have diversity quotas
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:29.820]  for like college admissions and a bunch of other things.
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:30.960]  I think they already have quotas though,
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.640]  but like those are definitely a good thing.
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:33.480]  Absolutely.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.460]  I mean, I think it's an absolute necessity.
[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:38.700]  Yeah, everyone should have an equal part in anywhere really.
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:40.860]  As a first-generation college student
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:42.940]  from a Hispanic household, it's very important.
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:46.580]  Should we develop diversity quotas for the workplace
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:47.700]  or for college admissions?
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:52.700]  How they usually work is if a population is 35% Hispanic,
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:55.300]  then the school in that region, I guess,
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.340]  would also have to be 35% Hispanic
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:59.980]  and its student population to reflect the demographics
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:00.940]  of the larger community.
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.620]  Is that something that you would support?
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:03.700]  Yeah, I would support that.
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:06.020]  Yeah, I totally support that.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:09.340]  Yeah, I mean, that sounds pretty reasonable.
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:10.380]  Yeah, I think that makes sense to me.
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:11.220]  Yeah, same.
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:12.460]  I think it definitely should be taken into account.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:13.300]  Absolutely.
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:14.140]  There should be more diversity
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:15.540]  in basically every single field.
[02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:18.140]  So what about diversity quotas on sports teams,
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:19.340]  college sports teams?
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:20.220]  Do you guys think?
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:21.700]  No, I think that should be skill-based.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:22.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:23.380]  Same thing.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.200]  Same thing.
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:26.240]  We wanna win no matter like what you are.
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:28.100]  Probably not.
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:29.540]  I feel like it should be based off talent.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.220]  That's something that's a little bit different.
[02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:34.900]  With sports, it's definitely more emphasis
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:35.820]  placed on ability.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.220]  Sports is different than college.
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:38.100]  Sports is not the same.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:40.980]  I mean, talent is talent is talent is talent.
[02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:42.860]  I don't think we should.
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:44.660]  College sports is about getting the best players
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.900]  for your team and I don't think we should focus
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:48.980]  on which race or ethnicity to get.
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:51.780]  I think a diversity quota for any sports team,
[02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:53.100]  it doesn't make much sense.
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:55.060]  It should be based on skill.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:56.660]  Just let the skills shine
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:58.860]  and whoever's the best player deserves to be on the team.
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:01.380]  Obviously with sports, it's talent first over anything.
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:03.980]  I did some research about the demographics here at UF.
[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:06.220]  We're gonna put this into like a hypothetical situation.
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:08.540]  So 50% of students here are white.
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.200]  This is from 2019.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:14.780]  19% are Hispanic, 8% are Asian, 5% are African-American.
[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:17.160]  If we were to apply that quota to the offensive lineup
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.940]  for the Florida Gators football team,
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:21.700]  this is what the lineup would look like.
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.860]  Okay, and that's probably not what it looks like at all.
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:25.340]  This is what it looks like right now.
[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:26.900]  Yeah.
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:30.100]  I feel like they're probably just more skilled players
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:35.340]  cause I mean, I guess you could say like more skilled people
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:36.740]  should get into schools too.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.540]  I guess what I said could kind of be pod bowl.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:40.940]  We'd probably be losing
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:43.340]  because we recruit like based on skill
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:44.940]  and if we recruited based on diversity
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:47.460]  then we'd probably be worse.
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:50.500]  I see nothing wrong with the current roster right now.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:51.980]  I think it's perfectly fine.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:53.340]  If they're the best players fit for the job
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:54.780]  then they deserve the spot.
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.860]  I don't necessarily think that it's a bad thing
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:00.080]  that these people are just better
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:01.540]  at the sports that they play.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:04.780]  I mean, it'd definitely be different
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.660]  when's the last time you saw a prominent Asian in football.
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:09.060]  Does this kind of change your mind
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:11.520]  about diversity quotas in other sectors
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:14.260]  like the workplace, like college admissions?
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:17.140]  If we're talking about being the best in sports
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:19.100]  shouldn't we also be talking about being the best
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.660]  in the workplace, being the best company,
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:23.080]  being the best college, the best university
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.440]  regardless of anyone's race?
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:27.240]  Yeah, I think it was a good way to open your eyes
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.480]  and think like if you're recruiting athletes
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:30.380]  based on their skill level
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:34.000]  maybe you should admit students based on their scores
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.200]  and their like academic merit more so than diversity.
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:38.840]  Yeah, a little bit because I just,
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:40.240]  I didn't think about it being applied.
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:42.940]  I mean, I guess they are applied to schools but not sports
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:44.840]  and you could make a good argument
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:48.720]  for why my reason for school would be the same
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:50.920]  for sports basically, yeah.
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:52.380]  I think so.
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:56.220]  I think I really didn't think about diversity too much
[02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:58.860]  in like college admissions or workplace.
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:01.140]  I think like now that I think about it.
[02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:02.740]  It's interesting to see it compared in sports
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.420]  like versus college admissions, so.
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:06.400]  Skill always comes first.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.140]  I don't necessarily think quotas are the way to go.
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:10.340]  I know they're unconstitutional.
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:11.180]  I know they're wrong.
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:12.520]  I feel like that's just counterintuitive
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:16.620]  to feel obligated to admit anybody or do anything.
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:19.900]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, you want the best.
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:22.100]  It doesn't really matter what the person's race is,
[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:24.460]  who they are, whatever, like you have skills.
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:25.540]  You're a good person.
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:26.380]  That's about it.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:37.320]  Oh shit, he's just stealing my attention.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:38.740]  Can I get a pharmacy please?
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:40.500]  Can I get a pharmacy?
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:44.940]  Oh my God, look at him just stealing my shit.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:45.780]  Move.
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:47.700]  I'm gonna move this guy.
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:50.980]  That man in the middle one please.
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:51.820]  Move.
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:07.860]  A man armed with a bow and arrow killed five people
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:10.820]  and wounded two others in the Norwegian town of Kongsberg
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:13.300]  during a series of attacks on Wednesday.
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:16.020]  That's according to local police chief Oivind Ass.
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:19.360]  I can unfortunately confirm that five people
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:21.400]  have been killed and two are injured.
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:23.220]  One of the injured is a police officer
[02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:26.420]  who was in the store off duty where the incident happened.
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:30.120]  He is now in the hospital as is the other injured person.
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:32.740]  Ass said a male suspect was apprehended
[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:34.300]  and that it was too early to know
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:36.500]  the intentions behind the attack.
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:38.340]  Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:41.340]  said police were investigating if it was an act of terror.
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:46.020]  I want to underline that if it's terror related,
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:47.740]  we don't know if it's a political attack
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.180]  that has taken place.
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:51.660]  The police will have to investigate that.
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:53.900]  Following the attacks, the police directorate said
[02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:56.100]  it had ordered officers nationwide
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:20:58.340]  to carry firearms as a precaution.
[02:20:58.340 --> 02:20:59.780]  It added there was no change
[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:02.340]  to the national threat level so far.
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.460]  Norwegian police are normally unarmed
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:07.820]  but officers have access to guns and rifles when needed.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:11.020]  Wednesday's attack was the worst in Norway since 2011
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:14.100]  when a far right extremist killed 77 people,
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.240]  mostly teens, at a youth camp.
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:18.820]  We don't, but if we continue to put that stuff
[02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.300]  in the atmosphere and it continues to get higher
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:23.820]  and higher and higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere,
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:24.660]  wouldn't that-
[02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:25.660]  This is gonna make, it's gonna make,
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:29.300]  the studies show it's gonna make deserts become green again
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:31.900]  and plants are gonna absorb the carbon.
[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:32.960]  What studies are these?
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:33.800]  You can look them up.
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:34.660]  Okay, let's find out.
[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:36.260]  And that's why the left even says-
[02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:37.580]  But if you're gonna say something like that,
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:39.340]  and I'm not arguing with you,
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:41.260]  but if you are gonna say something like that,
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:43.340]  that's a very bold thing to say,
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:45.600]  you should probably not just say, look them up.
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:46.440]  There should be something-
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:47.260]  No, let's type it in.
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:48.100]  Let's type it in.
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:48.940]  There's hundreds of them.
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:51.220]  I actually brought like over 50 articles right here.
[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:52.980]  Do you have something that you've read
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:55.140]  that makes you so confident that you can say this?
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:58.220]  I actually know what the plant studies show
[02:21:58.220 --> 02:21:59.900]  where in greenhouses,
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:02.740]  they grow plants with higher carbon dioxide
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:05.220]  and plants can grow up to three times faster.
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:06.060]  They live longer.
[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:08.460]  Of course, plants live off carbon dioxide.
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:09.300]  Then what do they put out?
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:10.120]  More oxygen.
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.660]  Well, this one thing that has been proven
[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:13.740]  is that there's more plants now
[02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:14.580]  than there have been at a long time.
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:16.860]  This is a global greening happening,
[02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:20.600]  countering us losing our atmosphere up until this point.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.060]  The earth has less atmosphere
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:23.500]  than it did a million years ago.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:25.300]  And it's like, God did this or something
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.740]  where we discovered all this oil,
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:29.540]  which is blind luck that we are terraforming the planet
[02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:31.620]  back to an earlier, healthier state
[02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:34.300]  by taking ancient carbon that was under the ground
[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:36.380]  and putting it back into the atmosphere.
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:40.260]  I am so excited to announce a new member
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:42.660]  of the M4 Wars Life family.
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:45.620]  And I think you're gonna be very, very excited as well
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:46.900]  after you hear what I have to say
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:51.900]  and after you get your first bottle of Brain Force Ultra.
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:55.660]  Now Brain Force Plus has been very, very popular for years.
[02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:57.220]  It's an amazing formula.
[02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:58.520]  It's a different formula.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:02.260]  This formula is roughly twice as strong
[02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:05.060]  and that's just in the natural caffeine department.
[02:23:05.060 --> 02:23:07.580]  Then it's got a bunch of other things in it.
[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:09.820]  Other key ingredients that are associated with energy
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:12.620]  and mental focus, but also your immune system,
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.360]  like quercetin.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.380]  This thing has amazing ingredients.
[02:23:17.380 --> 02:23:20.060]  We've had it separately tested by another major lab
[02:23:20.060 --> 02:23:23.020]  and they say it's off the charts strong.
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:27.860]  Guarana seed is loaded with energy compounds, antioxidants.
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:30.420]  Guarana seed is native to the Amazon,
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:33.700]  has been used by the Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:37.460]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:41.220]  that delivers choline, a water-soluble essential nutrient
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:42.880]  across the blood-brain barrier.
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:46.660]  Green coffee bean, from the raw seeds of the coffee fruit,
[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:49.460]  green coffee beans pack a powerful natural punch
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:51.620]  and a rich in chlorogenic acid.
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:55.820]  Eleuthero root, a celebrated member of the ginseng family.
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:57.980]  It has been used for thousands of years
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:23:59.520]  by traditional systems.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.620]  And here's another big one, Uromate leaf.
[02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:07.340]  Green tea leaves, filled with EGCH, as well as L-theanine.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:09.380]  Only the highest quality green tea leaves
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.940]  are included in this formula.
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:14.860]  Ginkgo leaf, known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:17.140]  Ginkgo comes from an ancient group of plants
[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:18.620]  and has been the focus of both ancient
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:20.100]  and modern fascination.
[02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:24.340]  Ashwagandha root, an ancient herb used for over 3,000 years.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:28.020]  Ashwagandha is favored for its many beneficial properties.
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:30.660]  Flip the switch and supercharge your mind
[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:32.580]  with Brain Force Ultra,
