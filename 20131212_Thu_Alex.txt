[00:19.040 --> 00:38.240]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on
[00:38.240 --> 00:45.920]  this live Thursday edition the 12th day of December 2013 former congressman and
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.640]  omnibudsman of the Worldwide Liberty Movement Dr. Ron Paul will be joining
[00:52.640 --> 00:55.880]  us coming up at the start of the third hour but other than that we're gonna
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.720]  have open phones and we're going to cover a lot of news and believe me there
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.560]  is a ton of it this Obamacare thing is just getting crazier by the minute where
[01:06.560 --> 01:15.880]  they are canceling charity ads for good messages on MSNBC on channels like ESP
[01:15.880 --> 01:24.080]  but then running Obamacare ads telling people to go sign up at the site when
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.600]  consumer reports and others are saying do not go sign up there and it's all the
[01:30.600 --> 01:35.920]  hoax that it exists it's designed to be a fraud and there have been huge new
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.880]  developments on this front we're gonna cover after the break also the health
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.480]  director who approved Obama's birth certificate has died in a plane crash you
[01:45.480 --> 01:49.040]  heard me right on that the health director who approved Obama birth
[01:49.040 --> 01:57.120]  certificate dies in a plane crash and that's the lady that approved it and
[01:57.120 --> 02:03.800]  released it and of course you know it was obviously a fake on purpose just like
[02:03.800 --> 02:07.440]  the websites meant to be a complete fake and not work and be a total fraud and
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.160]  then you have all these people that think they signed up months later found
[02:11.160 --> 02:17.400]  out they didn't people that mailed in the paper enrollments learn they haven't
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.400]  signed up it's they selectively will take a few people on the news and take
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.600]  them and show them enrolled it's like well somebody won the lottery somebody
[02:27.600 --> 02:31.920]  I promised all leprechaun one time you know in Ireland they walked over to
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.880]  hill there was a rainbow there was a lucky charms guy the bucket of gold
[02:35.880 --> 02:41.200]  they're dancing around happily in the mist maybe were unicorns existed maybe you
[02:41.200 --> 02:47.520]  lucky charms is real I mean who knows who knows maybe Chewbacca brothers are
[02:47.520 --> 02:53.800]  real maybe Obamacare is a good good deal of course now the architects of it
[02:53.800 --> 02:56.600]  admitted was just meant to bankrupt the system and bring in a single pair and
[02:56.600 --> 03:04.120]  good old helpful colon pal same guy that told us about anthrax trucks a course
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.560]  was lying on purpose he says it's a great idea and gave an anecdotal story
[03:07.560 --> 03:16.160]  so you could see boner and Powell and Rove and the Republican leadership the
[03:16.160 --> 03:24.400]  old blue blood globalist they're ramming through the total takeover system and
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.680]  making sure that the real tea party is unable to try to save the country and
[03:29.680 --> 03:34.600]  anyone that exposes that the United States is turning into a communist
[03:34.600 --> 03:39.000]  dictatorship run by offshore interests that are extracting our wealth corporate
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.600]  outside interest finance the Bolshevik takeover and for 70 plus years
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.920]  extracted the wealth working with the high-level Communist Party heads that's
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.440]  that's all on record now in congressional testimony bestselling books
[03:51.440 --> 04:00.000]  it's all come out Putin talks about it I mean it is an open secret and now they're
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.400]  moving that model here where they shut everything down only multinational
[04:04.400 --> 04:13.400]  combines are allowed to operate and it is a emergency situation on every single
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.400]  front so we're gonna be breaking all that down also DPS officer resides if
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.520]  we're found to be an illegal immigrant that's in Arizona I actually saw ads in
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.640]  Arizona and New Mexico we covered a few years ago where they actually want to
[04:25.640 --> 04:31.800]  hire illegals as sheriff's deputies and have been doing so you know illegals get
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.200]  higher state tuition in most states than even US citizens do if you're not from
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.240]  that state I mean I would get more benefits if I was an illegal alien and
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.520]  again I'm not even demonizing these poor illegal aliens they're just being
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.720]  brought in and given preferential treatment so they'll work for lower wages
[04:48.720 --> 04:53.440]  to just supplement their wages to then destroy the middle class just like
[04:53.440 --> 04:56.360]  Obamacare makes everybody go to part-time basically it's all it's all the same
[04:56.360 --> 05:04.280]  deal Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.880]  the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.340]  model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[05:14.340 --> 05:17.920]  to the global takeover that's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[09:14.600 --> 09:19.160]  callers a chance to call in first then the second hour I'll have a free for all
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.840]  but on any of the news I love the wildcard aspect of it on any topic you

[09:37.640 --> 09:49.800]  now here is just some of the news that is up on info wars dot com right now
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.360]  anti-Christian group forces Air Force to remove nativity scene and that happened
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.120]  of course yesterday but Kurt Nemo's got a article breaking it down with a deeper
[10:01.120 --> 10:08.000]  analysis on the persecution of Christians but but everything else is
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.640]  allowed also Obama nominates Israeli Bankster as a Federal Reserve vice
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.320]  chair and you know I think that's an issue we got two articles by Nemo right
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.040]  there because you know we should obviously have people that are Americans
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.520]  first and foremost even the Federal Reserve is a private entity running
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.680]  government policy also Homeland Security employee who called for mass
[10:32.680 --> 10:40.760]  murder of whites finally has been fired and also America dream rest in peace
[10:40.760 --> 10:45.520]  two-thirds of all Americans think the American dream has died and a lot of them
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.560]  think capitalism did it when it's the opposite it's been rigged markets the
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.960]  opposite of free market that have done this damage control we're going to get
[10:53.960 --> 11:01.720]  into the article with the well we're gonna break that down we actually get
[11:01.720 --> 11:07.120]  into that at that time also we're going to get into Obama shipping in China
[11:07.120 --> 11:12.080]  produced poultry why not they already get our fluoride most the fluoride they
[11:12.080 --> 11:15.200]  put in our water comes from China with hundreds of other chemicals and toxins
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.440]  and heavy metals added to it why not the sky's the limit and also another story a
[11:19.440 --> 11:24.480]  handful of constitutionally minded people in the Pentagon stopped the Syrian
[11:24.480 --> 11:29.680]  War and that is a very important article because it breaks down the fact that
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.520]  that that's been confirmed but not many people are aware of it there's actually
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.640]  good people in the Pentagon that put the brakes on that thanks to public support
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.280]  as well that's just some of the news up on info wars calm and prison planet
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.440]  calm let's go over some of the Obamacare news let's just go over these
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.960]  headlines Obamacare one of the greatest achievements in the nation's history
[11:54.960 --> 12:02.000]  that's representative Jan how do you pronounce that shakalski and CNS news
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.480]  reports never mind that naysayers this representative from Illinois introduced
[12:06.480 --> 12:12.400]  positive reviews of Obamacare into the congressional record at Wednesday's
[12:12.400 --> 12:15.480]  congressional hearing then she addressed health and human services
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.320]  secretary Kathleen Sebelius personally she said I just want to say to you
[12:20.320 --> 12:26.320]  madam secretary I am absolutely confident that the role that you played
[12:26.320 --> 12:31.000]  in bringing affordable health care to millions tens of millions of Americans
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  will go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of our country
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.240]  throughout the entire history and I want to thank you for that and I actually
[12:40.240 --> 12:49.040]  agree that this is one of the greatest achievements of absolute open manifest
[12:49.040 --> 12:56.080]  fraud I absolutely agree with that
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.160]  because it is such a huge fraud and it it it makes PT Barnum look like an honest
[13:05.160 --> 13:13.480]  person it makes Pinocchio's nose look short it it it's just unspeakable levels
[13:13.480 --> 13:16.480]  of fraud stacked on top of fraud that's just one of the articles here let's move
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.760]  on to the next one over here is some the congressman charges Sebelius with
[13:21.760 --> 13:28.240]  criminal obstruction in Obamacare investigation that is like charging with
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.920]  Sun with coming up in the morning manifest lying manifest fraud designed to
[13:32.920 --> 13:39.200]  bankrupt the economy this is a globalist communist run operation to blow out our
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.880]  engine our financial engine and collapse the country and when you look at
[13:43.880 --> 13:48.280]  Sebelius you realize she knows exactly what she's doing they are carrying out
[13:48.280 --> 13:54.960]  the destruction of this country to build their their authoritarian utopia on
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.840]  its ashes and they're doing a great job again White House works to attract
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.600]  younger health plan users that means young dumb morons that they can feed
[14:04.600 --> 14:08.360]  into a meat grinder just like they do for the military Sebelius says social
[14:08.360 --> 14:13.040]  media celebrities will help get the message out to make it trendy to be
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.880]  ripped off and they've actually been hiring Hollywood stars music stars to
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.760]  tell people to basically stick their hand in a garbage disposal and and and if
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.600]  you put it out on MTV or in the culture even intelligent people I found just
[14:27.600 --> 14:35.280]  get mesmerized by it and and by the glitz and by fame and just think it must
[14:35.280 --> 14:41.400]  be good because the Hollywood people are saying that I'm gonna get to that here
[14:41.400 --> 14:48.520]  in a moment fact here it is sexiest man alive brought into boost Obamacare
[14:48.520 --> 14:55.040]  enrollment that's right and Roger Port has a photo of the individual who they
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.840]  say is the sexiest man alive I can't really comedy looks pretty stupid to
[14:58.840 --> 15:03.760]  me sticking his tongue out and it's kind of like a twerp but what do I know and
[15:03.760 --> 15:10.000]  this guy's name is Adam Levine or Levine I have no idea I don't know who Adam
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.360]  Levine is to show you the singer of Maroon 5 I do know about how the world
[15:18.360 --> 15:25.680]  actually works of course what people are supposed to do is obsess all day over
[15:25.680 --> 15:31.200]  the celebrities and how to look trendy and then to a certain extent women then
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.520]  think of they find a trendy man that will make them successful but but the
[15:34.520 --> 15:37.920]  whole trendiness is actually there to show a few examples that are successful
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.040]  by being trendy but then everyone else just basically buys into that so that
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.720]  you're unsuccessful and it's all a paradigm to keep you out of the real
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.160]  world out of discovering the real world to keep you in the matrix so there you
[15:50.160 --> 15:56.280]  go the Obama administration is bringing in the sexiest man alive to help boost
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.240]  Obamacare enrollment numbers well you know they say the greatest advertisement
[16:01.240 --> 16:04.920]  ever was Bill Hicks is just a sexy woman you know showing you a can of beer or
[16:04.920 --> 16:08.120]  can of Coke that's the only look at the bear commercials to show a bunch of
[16:08.120 --> 16:11.520]  beautiful women on the beach running around just having the best time of
[16:11.520 --> 16:17.600]  their lives and they're drinking a cold beer and the guy's got a cold beer
[16:17.600 --> 16:23.720]  doesn't matter he's got a body by Budweiser giant porcine potbelly bigger
[16:23.720 --> 16:28.520]  than a hippopotamus that doesn't matter because he's got the beer of course the
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.000]  women actually aren't really attracted to him and he's all alone drinking the
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.280]  beer that doesn't matter he still just thinks we drinks more beer that the 15
[16:36.280 --> 16:43.840]  Swedish bikini team models will repel down on rubs from helicopters and if you
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.400]  buy into the whole rap culture the whole the whole deal you're going to be
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.040]  successful why all of you are going to be in the NFL all of you are going to be
[16:51.040 --> 16:57.280]  in the NBA all of you are going to be you know the top golfers all of you are
[16:57.280 --> 17:02.080]  going to be stars ladies and gentlemen when you already can look up at the
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.240]  stars at night and you are a star made by the creator of the universe with all
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.120]  this incredible adventure going on around you people look down at the dirt
[17:11.120 --> 17:14.400]  and obsessed over celebrity and I know a lot of celebrities some of them are
[17:14.400 --> 17:17.200]  really interesting really smart really neat people it's fun to know them you
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.560]  can admire the music they play you can but but when you get into the whole
[17:21.560 --> 17:27.400]  culture being that and not the bedrock of liberty then your society degenerates
[17:27.400 --> 17:32.400]  and that's a historical cycle but it's okay Obama has the sexiest man alive
[17:32.400 --> 17:40.760]  they say to help push it and the goal of that he's going to have pushing it is
[17:40.760 --> 17:45.360]  a hundred million internet contacts and and that's put up in the wilds yeah
[17:45.360 --> 17:51.480]  they want your data when you go over and over again trying to get your free
[17:51.480 --> 17:54.400]  health care they want your data they want to track and know who doesn't have
[17:54.400 --> 17:58.440]  health care so they can grab your paycheck garnish your wages grab your
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.000]  tax refund and grab your bank account and that's now been admitted and it's
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.600]  kind of it's kind of like a soda machine where you put in your dollar and
[18:07.600 --> 18:10.640]  then it doesn't give you a drink but you're really thirsty so you keep
[18:10.640 --> 18:15.520]  sticking dollars in by the third or fourth try not getting the bottled water

[24:30.720 --> 24:35.560]  comical it's painful it's disgusting it's nauseating it's infuriating it's
[24:35.560 --> 24:42.760]  mind-boggling to watch people conned by the hype-driven system and look I don't
[24:42.760 --> 24:49.400]  blame people I remember when I was a child my dad taking me to movies like
[24:49.400 --> 24:54.360]  the running man and stuff when I was like 12 years old and thinking Arnold
[24:54.360 --> 25:00.040]  Schwarzenegger was just the most manly awesome cool guy in the world and that
[25:00.040 --> 25:06.000]  is a good movie great Stephen King screenplay and book short story now
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  that I know who Arnold Schwarzenegger really is as an adult he's a horrible
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.440]  abusive monster and it's the same thing but but but but now because I've
[25:14.440 --> 25:17.520]  actually had a chance to get to know a lot of celebrities I know most of them
[25:17.520 --> 25:22.440]  are vapid empty unhappy people themselves obsessed with other celebrities
[25:22.440 --> 25:28.320]  just like a child but then many of them actually know it's all a big fraud and a
[25:28.320 --> 25:31.760]  prison and they want to change their name and get out of it or fake their
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.080]  death and the reason I talk about this so much is that it is celebrity the
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.600]  celebrity of Obama the celebrity of Obamacare and who's pushing it the
[25:42.600 --> 25:53.120]  celebrity of Oprah Winfrey to sell a lie when when Oprah Winfrey probably has
[25:53.120 --> 25:59.560]  about a hundred and seventy IQ she's a genius of manipulation deception she's
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.000]  part of eugenics secret meetings that have leaked confirmed she's part of
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.800]  running bizarre cult takeovers of Africa and churches that she uses as
[26:08.800 --> 26:13.120]  fronts I mean she's one of the only people they led into meetings where
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.920]  there's only 10 top globalists they let Oprah Winfrey in just to give you an
[26:17.920 --> 26:25.360]  idea and this is a woman selling racialist race pimping division and
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.320]  trying to sell her people out and trying to depopulate Africa I mean that's
[26:29.320 --> 26:32.360]  why she's been brought up that level she's very intelligent but she's very
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.720]  evil and she says they're in fake cries just like Obama and everybody else to
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.040]  her audience of people she's abusing and that makes me not even hate her it
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.560]  makes me realize this is L Diablo you get really smart talented people who
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.480]  choose to be parasites so she can be worth you know ten million dollars or
[26:51.480 --> 26:58.840]  whatever it is it's disgusting truly sick how she sits there and beams that
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.240]  she's a real person and really cares about people but when you actually study
[27:02.240 --> 27:09.800]  her she's a cold blooded operator just like Obama these people you turn your
[27:09.800 --> 27:16.280]  back on them they will stick it in they will stick a knife right between your
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.320]  political cultural and spiritual ribs right into your heart and it's just once
[27:21.320 --> 27:28.320]  you know this the trance is broken the haze is broken and you realize my gosh
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.160]  these people are literally abusing me I think everybody should go see the
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.000]  film the face in the crowd I want to get that clip at the end or maybe do a
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.120]  movie review for the nightly news showing the progression of the film
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.760]  reviewing it and then showing the end scene where the Oprah Winfrey type
[27:44.760 --> 27:51.120]  character but he's a white guy played by Andy Griffith and he doesn't know he's
[27:51.120 --> 27:55.480]  live on air still talking about what idiots his viewers are and I remember
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.960]  seeing that as a kid on television one night when my dad was out of town me and
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.320]  my mom watched I'll never forget about eight years old I thought nobody'd
[28:03.320 --> 28:07.280]  actually really be like that and now I realize with these globalist folks
[28:07.280 --> 28:14.080]  that's the norm not the exception they don't get off on building good products
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.840]  writing good books having good culture teaching people things building people
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.800]  up I mean I enjoy teaching people things I enjoy helping other talk show
[28:22.800 --> 28:27.080]  hosts that aren't as successful as I am who are good people I enjoy trying to
[28:27.080 --> 28:32.960]  lift up other news organizations I enjoy seeing people do well I think it's
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.360]  neat when somebody is worth billions of dollars on their own initiative and they
[28:37.360 --> 28:43.280]  they bring something to humanity I admire the Swiss you you could have a
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.520]  billion dollars and they don't just want a billion dollars brought to
[28:46.520 --> 28:52.640]  Switzerland if you've got a patent on something for construction or something
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.880]  for electronics and you'll just come to Switzerland that because you've invented
[28:57.880 --> 29:01.880]  something and you've done something you don't even bring money then they'll have
[29:01.880 --> 29:05.240]  you into the country I mean that's the type of culture I was thinking about
[29:05.240 --> 29:09.560]  that last night that's the type of culture I want to live in not where you
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.880]  you come here and we give you free welfare so you'll vote to enslave those
[29:13.880 --> 29:20.120]  of us that produce and that's really what this comes down to I mean what do you
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.760]  bring to the table what do you contribute to society to make it a richer
[29:23.760 --> 29:32.320]  society I like to see culture rise I just admire beauty I don't get mad at
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.320]  some guy when he's got a girlfriend looks like Marilyn Monroe I admire them
[29:36.320 --> 29:41.520]  and just think man they've they must really love each other but most guys I
[29:41.520 --> 29:46.600]  know get violently angry so I guess I'm just a weirdo we're gonna come back get

[33:47.560 --> 33:52.960]  director who approved obama's birth certificate dies in a plane crash and
[33:52.960 --> 33:57.760]  this is out of u.s. news and world report it's also in NBC news reporting on it
[33:57.760 --> 34:00.800]  the health director who approved the release of president obama's birth
[34:00.800 --> 34:08.040]  certificate has died in a plane crash Hawaiian officials said last night or I
[34:08.040 --> 34:11.600]  guess this morning actually because it's Thursday right now the 12th day of
[34:11.600 --> 34:19.600]  December 2013 Loretta Fuddy I guess you pronounce it died after the Cessna
[34:19.600 --> 34:23.600]  Grand Caravan aircraft she was traveling on went down shortly after
[34:23.600 --> 34:30.160]  leaving the airport around 3 15 p.m. on Wednesday so this news just came out the
[34:30.160 --> 34:37.920]  other eight people on board were rescued so who knows if it was foul play but there
[34:37.920 --> 34:44.360]  was no indication is why the plane had crashed but I had said at the time you
[34:44.360 --> 34:47.280]  can pull these videos up right when they released the birth certificate a few years
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.280]  ago it was clearly fake I'm not saying she put out a fake but someone may have
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.600]  given made a fake inside the records have given it to her to release that
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.160]  whoever was involved in this or whoever might blow the whistle inside later
[35:00.160 --> 35:06.600]  would be having a plane crash or getting a mugged and falling down hitting their
[35:06.600 --> 35:09.920]  head so it's it's very very suspicious but of course there won't be any
[35:09.920 --> 35:17.640]  investigation of that also speaking of government-run health care NHS never
[35:17.640 --> 35:23.360]  events revealed that's never never events that they want to happen that's
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.280]  National Health Service in England surgeons carried out heart surgery on
[35:27.280 --> 35:33.320]  wrong patient wrong toe removed and wrong foot operated on and it just goes
[35:33.320 --> 35:37.600]  over 148 never events medical mistakes that according to the guidelines should
[35:37.600 --> 35:44.200]  never happen an NHS trust between April and September this year and it just goes
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.360]  into the nightmare scenarios that we're going to be living under here more and
[35:47.360 --> 35:54.240]  more and again I'm not saying that our current health care system is good what
[35:54.240 --> 36:00.680]  I'm saying is that it's government and corporate takeover of the health care
[36:00.680 --> 36:04.200]  system it's made it so expensive and so fraudulent that's what the history shows
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.240]  and now they're going to wreck it even worse covering a total single payer that
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.520]  micromanages every facet of our lives with social control because we're now
[36:13.520 --> 36:18.680]  all communally tied to socialist health care but with the profits offshoreed in
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.840]  a fascist pipeline so the very worst system that they could come up with
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.800]  purely criminal exploitive private corporate tax with social engineering by
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.680]  private corporate eugenicist you could not come up with something nastier than
[36:34.680 --> 36:41.600]  this now Obamacare is now advertising I guess the taxpayer money on ESPN and the
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.120]  big insurance companies are all lobbying to keep Obamacare in place as it is
[36:46.120 --> 36:51.960]  right now because they wrote it but I love how when I criticize Obamacare I
[36:51.960 --> 36:56.560]  see comments and emails saying you must work for you know the insurance
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.640]  companies no connection to the insurance companies I have insurance
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.320]  overpriced I ever use that just went up by the way a bunch I haven't done a
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.680]  story on that yet my insurance out of Minnesota is that's I got it through
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.800]  Genesis has only gone up really 50% or so though I guess I'm on the low end so
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.880]  thank you Obamacare I won't get kicked off and I won't have my premiums raised
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.560]  and no one else will it'll lower to the price of a phone or cable bill but here
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.000]  it is Obamacare advertises on ESPN last night the 32nd advertisement ran to
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.800]  encourage folks to sign up at health insurance marketplace otherwise known
[37:33.800 --> 37:38.560]  as Obamacare now with the first time you can be covered with a quality health
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.160]  plan from a new health insurance marketplace part of the health care
[37:42.160 --> 37:47.680]  law says the male announcer absolute total fraud and it ran on ESPN perfect
[37:47.680 --> 37:53.040]  audience of sports morons men who don't want to spend time with their family
[37:53.040 --> 37:56.080]  men who don't want to spend time learning how the world really works they
[37:56.080 --> 38:02.160]  want to go home at 6 7 o'clock at night and watch five hours of sports and men
[38:02.160 --> 38:05.880]  all acting manly sitting around desk talking about this quarterback or this
[38:05.880 --> 38:10.200]  running back or this golf player maybe one thing if you watch golf on Saturday
[38:10.200 --> 38:13.120]  or Sunday maybe one thing we went to football game you know once a month or
[38:13.120 --> 38:16.840]  went to your kids little league or when I'm all for athletics if you're in it I
[38:16.840 --> 38:23.400]  love it but I mean it's just such a sick shine of the Roman decline that we've
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.880]  become so let's play the ad that's allowed to air then we've got a clip of
[38:27.880 --> 38:34.120]  Fox News reporting on the very same ESPN drops Christmas ad because Christmas is
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.960]  offensive the word Christmas is not allowed but we will run an ad by a
[38:37.960 --> 38:42.040]  criminal government run by foreign banks and insurance companies to have people
[38:42.040 --> 38:45.680]  go sign up so they can be sent tax bills for not having Obamacare because
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.800]  they're not allowed to sign up for Obamacare I mean that that is beyond a
[38:51.800 --> 38:59.520]  bizarro world futuristic novel by Heinlein or somebody like that I mean
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.200]  this this is just if you wrote satire like this 30 years ago no one would
[39:04.200 --> 39:09.160]  believe what they would say it's too fantastical absurdist surrealist and
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.640]  now I feel like I'm in a living inside a cuckoo bird clock or something with a
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.840]  general public because I hear people that you know at the store or wherever or
[39:19.840 --> 39:24.240]  at the bank talking and they're like I like Obama right I think the health
[39:24.240 --> 39:27.640]  care is gonna be fine they're gonna fix it I see the comments online everything
[39:27.640 --> 39:35.120]  and sure it's maybe 30% of the public that's still literally living in a false
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.560]  reality but it's still just insane because doesn't matter of Congress as a
[39:39.560 --> 39:43.200]  six percent approval ray the systems just set the precedent that this is what
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.600]  they're gonna do so I'm trying to figure out how do they top this well they're
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.400]  going to take the public and private pension funds to protect them just like
[39:52.400 --> 39:55.960]  the models they've done in other countries hundreds of times in different
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.640]  county cities and regions around the world thousands of times it's how they've
[39:59.640 --> 40:02.280]  done it in California in other areas how they're doing it in Michigan and it
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.000]  will come everywhere when they're done because it's designed to bankrupt us no
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.640]  matter what we do they've signed us on the systems that are unsustainable they'll
[40:09.640 --> 40:13.360]  first have a deal and take 20% of the pension funds public and private here or
[40:13.360 --> 40:17.560]  there to protect them and then and then two years later oh it's unsolving again
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.760]  insolving it we got to take another 30 and they're like oh a couple years later
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.000]  you know what we're gonna take 80% of what's left that's what's happening in
[40:28.000 --> 40:35.720]  Detroit right now or you're going to get nothing and the average people that are
[40:35.720 --> 40:40.040]  totally cowardly totally scared and most of them government workers that have been
[40:40.040 --> 40:42.680]  parasiting off people and running everybody out of the area anyways in
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.520]  California or Michigan they're gonna say okay I'll take my 20% and then down the
[40:48.520 --> 40:54.840]  road you're gonna take half of that or 80% until you end up with nothing and
[40:54.840 --> 40:58.680]  listen they're not going to you're not going to get social security within the
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.800]  next five ten years they it's same thing worldwide they're going to take your
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.280]  social security one by at a time they're going to take the stock market when the
[41:05.280 --> 41:08.920]  dollar devalues it's all pumped up and I'm not saying this to scare you folks
[41:08.920 --> 41:13.320]  it's only going to get worse the longer you beg to be hurt by the new world
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.800]  order the longer you're gullible the longer you go well well my favorite
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.080]  music star says in in ads I should sign up for Obamacare so it's so trendy I
[41:23.080 --> 41:28.040]  feel like I'm buying into it and I'm his friend or I'm her friend you know if
[41:28.040 --> 41:37.160]  if if if Kyan West Kanye West Joe you know Bieber or whatever Joseph Bieber what's

[41:42.200 --> 41:47.520]  that they if they say it you do it
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.560]  excuse me let's go ahead because I want to go to your phone calls and get to
[41:51.560 --> 41:58.400]  Obamacare advertises on ESPN but Christians you see the door you're offensive

[42:34.120 --> 42:39.200]  world order so let's go ahead and go to the not offensive con artist ad
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.840]  literally to suck people in to be mugged by the Obamacare fraud machine and his
[42:43.840 --> 42:47.400]  army of criminal navigators that we predicted with Kit Daniels four months
[42:47.400 --> 42:55.160]  ago two months before this latest pile of you know what dropped into the dropped

[43:25.160 --> 43:30.080]  had Kanye West tie in West get out there and say get on the ground and eat
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.280]  dog crap people would do it and I'm not joking the Aztec said it was trendy to

[43:37.600 --> 43:43.120]  joking I'm not joking let's go ahead and go to go to the ad that's allowed on
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.760]  ESPN now I'm covered now for the first time you can be covered
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.520]  with a quality health plan from the new health insurance marketplace part of
[43:54.520 --> 43:57.840]  the health care law it's where brand-name companies offer plans you can
[43:57.840 --> 44:03.040]  compare side-by-side and it's the place to get lower monthly payments oh it's
[44:03.040 --> 44:08.480]  lower so if you have an accident get sick or just need a checkup I'm covered
[44:08.480 --> 44:14.240]  we're covered now we're covered BS now with the health insurance marketplace at
[44:14.240 --> 44:23.120]  healthcare.gov oh isn't that sweet isn't that darling that they do that for us by
[44:23.120 --> 44:26.480]  the way you hear that you're gonna get lower prices through Obamacare on average
[44:26.480 --> 44:29.200]  they've doubled set to quadruple the next two years
[44:29.200 --> 44:34.920]  Humana plans in Texas Mike Adams of natural news.com got that document a
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.840]  five hundred and something percent increase we can show the document my
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.440]  dad's is doubled in like three installments just that's how they're
[44:43.440 --> 44:48.320]  doing to most people goes up 25 50% 30% it's just why they take your pension
[44:48.320 --> 44:53.960]  fund okay they never start having tanks drive around and guys in black
[44:53.960 --> 44:57.920]  uniforms and training to take on gun owners to fight al-qaeda folks that when
[44:57.920 --> 45:00.440]  the government starts doing that it's like when criminals come into a bank and
[45:00.440 --> 45:04.440]  say hands up when the state starts arming against you and training against
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.400]  you they're saying you know they're walking into a bank hands up folks all
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.560]  right move in the operation but before they did that they culturally hit you
[45:13.560 --> 45:16.760]  with a culture bomb a dummy down chemicals biologicals there it is
[45:16.760 --> 45:22.360]  rate shock Obamacare causing 539% increase in health insurance cost for
[45:22.360 --> 45:27.000]  Texans and you scroll down right during the article he's actually got a copy of
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.720]  the document there in the story so there you go and it actually says you have
[45:33.720 --> 45:38.680]  the right to contact the Texas Department of Insurance regarding this
[45:38.680 --> 45:44.360]  notice and then in there it says your increase percentage of change in one
[45:44.360 --> 45:53.520]  month 539.60 I'm sorry here now now that's not offensive this is what's
[45:53.520 --> 45:59.360]  offensive ESPN drops Christmas ad for reference to God and Jesus there's not
[45:59.360 --> 46:03.000]  a dirtier word the FCC ought to add that to the seven deadly words you're not
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.920]  allowed to say actually here they say you're allowed to say that now on
[46:06.920 --> 46:12.000]  broadcast TV it's only selectively enforcing its broadcast radio and its
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.560]  continuing effort to expose the secular lefts war on Christmas Fox News Bill
[46:15.560 --> 46:20.280]  O'Reilly reported what a good guy over there I'm being sarcastic on rather this
[46:20.280 --> 46:23.920]  heartening story about I mean O'Reilly doesn't work we also goes there's more
[46:23.920 --> 46:28.720]  and more sex abuse online then cuts to a picture of me ranting about Obama but
[46:28.720 --> 46:34.080]  doesn't say it's Obama and then and then says stop the hate on screen it's like
[46:34.080 --> 46:40.440]  but anyways O'Reilly got this right each Christmas thousands in our
[46:40.440 --> 46:44.120]  community send messages of hope to sick and injured children who may not be
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.040]  able to come home for the holidays said SSM's Cardinal Glennon Children's
[46:49.040 --> 46:52.600]  Medical Center we celebrate the birth of Jesus that's what Christmas is and the
[46:52.600 --> 46:56.920]  season of giving bringing hope to many children parents and families we serve
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.440]  our patients are filled with hope as they receive a message each day from the
[47:01.440 --> 47:06.360]  treasure chest beneath our tree of hope God forbid at a Catholic hospital they
[47:06.360 --> 47:09.480]  run an ad for helping sick kids this is a you're not allowed to have the
[47:09.480 --> 47:13.480]  Catholics run ads us the Catholics are supposed to teach abortion at their
[47:13.480 --> 47:18.560]  churches according to Obamacare help us reveal God's healing presence this
[47:18.560 --> 47:25.000]  Christmas senior message of hope and what they don't want is the medicine of
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.040]  love and God and remembering it's not about materialism it's about helping
[47:29.040 --> 47:32.240]  sick children I told my wife it's Christmas time I said what are we doing
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.680]  for charity I give money to Salvation Army we're gonna give money to some good
[47:35.680 --> 47:39.400]  children's hospitals we're gonna give money to some other things where you
[47:39.400 --> 47:43.840]  know 90 plus percent of it goes to what there's only a few charities you can
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.560]  really even trust out there and God forbid no no no we've got to have Bill
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.040]  Clinton run ads for Haitian kids where he keeps more than half of it for his
[47:52.040 --> 47:58.920]  private jet aircraft again that's that's that's that's the kind of charity we
[47:58.920 --> 48:04.400]  can run so let's go ahead and air this dirty dirty dirty dirty banned ad from
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.120]  ESPN here it is fact of our segment tonight the continuing battle over
[48:08.120 --> 48:14.320]  Christmas and Jesus Hospital in St. Louis wanted to take out a t-pad on ESPN
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.600]  that said this each Christmas thousands in our community send messages of hope
[48:20.600 --> 48:24.680]  to sick and injured children who may not be able to come home for the holidays at
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.920]  SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center we celebrate the birth of Jesus
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.040]  and the season of giving bringing hope to the many children parents and families

[48:36.720 --> 48:41.880]  day from the treasure chest beneath our tree of hope help us reveal God's
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.720]  healing presence this Christmas send your message of hope egglennon.org but
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.560]  ESPN said they would not run that ad because the lines celebrate the birth
[48:51.560 --> 48:57.440]  of Jesus and God's healing message are problematic their word to the network
[48:57.440 --> 49:03.560]  yeah and offensive so there you go ladies and gentlemen only in an
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.840]  authoritarian country the Old Soviet Union would you see something like this
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.880]  and remember what came out a few months ago we broke it people didn't believe it
[49:12.880 --> 49:18.320]  and then the documents got released by folks at Fort Hood and Fox News finally
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.040]  did pick it up but they actually taught them that if you're part of the Tea
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.760]  Party or give money to evangelical group or a part of it we're going to court
[49:26.760 --> 49:32.680]  marshal you because these are terrorist groups and under federal law aiding a
[49:32.680 --> 49:38.480]  terrorist group is punishable by prison yeah if you send money to the Somali
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.360]  pirates that's punishable by prison and it should be if you give money to al-Qaeda
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.600]  that's punishable by prison and it should be but our government's giving a
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.520]  money billions and arms to al-Qaeda in Libya Syria all over the place Egypt
[49:52.520 --> 49:57.680]  that's okay but then if it's soldiers want to be part of the Tea Party mainline
[49:57.680 --> 50:02.320]  Americana not perfect but you know Bill of Rights Constitution Family Second
[50:02.320 --> 50:09.760]  Amendment national sovereignty low taxes sounds like John F. Kennedy type stuff if
[50:09.760 --> 50:15.760]  you support that then we're going to court marshal you actually says court
[50:15.760 --> 50:21.640]  marshal you until we expose it and others exposed it and they backed off but
[50:21.640 --> 50:25.200]  it shows they're just going to keep pushing and keep pushing and keep
[50:25.200 --> 50:29.760]  pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing and keep I mean this is
[50:29.760 --> 50:37.200]  incredible this is the authoritarianism of these people all right Troy Ryan Tom

[56:47.840 --> 56:52.520]  hey it's Troy from St. Louis I just want to let you know I've been listening
[56:52.520 --> 56:57.160]  since 2006 mainly on WWCR at 9 but also on the podcast you can get a St. Louis
[56:57.160 --> 57:03.920]  affiliate that um anyway everything's everything crazy that's going on you see
[57:03.920 --> 57:07.680]  today I mean everything I don't know if you're I know you're aware of it but I
[57:07.680 --> 57:12.920]  don't know if I've actually heard you you say that this is just a spiritual war
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.320]  that's going on and everything is like a physical manifestation of the spiritual
[57:17.320 --> 57:21.760]  war that we're all a part of no that's it I mean you cannot have a children's
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.320]  hospital charity that's Christian put an ad on and say help us take care of sick
[57:26.320 --> 57:32.600]  kids because anything Christian is offensive no these people blocking us
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.560]  from access to the airwaves is offensive and this is how Hitler started in
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.000]  Germany against groups he was going after was banning them from advertising
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.440]  first they shut you up then they worked your ass to death then they kill you
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.640]  excuse me yeah well yeah and see I have a different a little bit different take
[57:50.640 --> 57:54.320]  on it than I think maybe you or some other people might I don't think that
[57:54.320 --> 57:59.560]  the Constitution is the answer because the Constitution isn't problem Satan is
[57:59.560 --> 58:03.520]  the problem and the worst kind of lie that people tell themselves and I see it
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.920]  every day is the lie that you tell yourself so if you're the lie to yourself
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.200]  why are you what would stop you from lying to other people the answer is Jesus
[58:12.200 --> 58:15.480]  Christ the spirit of Jesus Christ I mean if people aren't going to obey God's
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.600]  ways why would anyone think that people are gonna obey man's law no no I hear
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.320]  you but but if you're gonna have a rule of law it should be based on God's law
[58:24.320 --> 58:27.040]  to the Bible and that's what I believe the Declaration of Independence Bill of
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.560]  Rights and Constitution is and that's why the devil's forces attack that
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.840]  document perpetually so I'm gonna come back to you because I want to continue
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.720]  discussing this Troy I'm gonna Ryan Tom Austin be in others thank you for

[58:59.240 --> 59:04.720]  model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:21.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:34.000]  remember the con game with the supposed person giving hand signs for the
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.520]  hearing impaired at the old Mandela communism worship fest well now they're
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:47.560]  saying the interpreter at Mandela event I was hallucinating visions of angels I'm
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.040]  sure the angels were arriving to fight all the devils that were there the
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.760]  man accused of fake sign interpretation while standing alongside world leaders
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.040]  like US President Obama and Nelson Mandela's memorial service said he saw
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.320]  angels at the event and had been violent in the past and suffers from
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.520]  schizophrenia I mean I mean that's about who follows all this stuff is just
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.440]  completely out of their mind people if you imagine trying to wake that guy up
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:20.640]  and explain to him the con game you imagine the people that are going and
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:29.560]  buying Obamacare because the sexiest man alive is promoting it quote sexiest man
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:36.840]  alive listen I've got this caller here Troy and in St. Louis and I get this a
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:43.280]  lot from my Christian friends they'll say man you need to focus on God on Jesus
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.480]  and not on the temporal things that are happening here and of course anything
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.520]  of this world is going to end up being evil well you know they misinterpret
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.760]  Romans 13 to say do whatever the government says but really if you read
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.960]  that whole chapter I've had a lot of preachers who I respect on on the
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.600]  subject it's like when Christ you know said you know should we pay taxes and
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.120]  others said this well who's on the coin it's Caesar it's his so yeah it's his
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.120]  system come out of Babylon come out of that system as much as you can but no
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.120]  one's perfect you know we're born on this world we you know we're of the flesh
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.560]  I'm not going to turn this into an ecclesiastical debate I just know my
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.360]  heart loves justice and loves God and there's a lot of people that only go to
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.360]  church and say that's the answer and pray all day and I don't see them out
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:37.240]  confronting any evil anywhere that's an overgeneralization but we need to you
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.800]  stop hiding in the churches like our forebears did and take down the new
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.920]  old order the Constitution isn't perfect but it's it's diametrically opposed
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.560]  to everything the globalists want to do that's why they're going after and the
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.800]  Constitution is is nothing compared to Declaration of Independence or Bill of
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.880]  Rights which themselves point out this doesn't give you your rights they're
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:04.800]  God-given by our Creator so I see the ideas enshrined and that doesn't matter
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.920]  if those men weren't fully fulfilling it those ideas could be fulfilled and are
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.400]  the blood of liberty now you've got about a minute and a half we're going to
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.120]  break them to come back along seven go to everybody else but Troy make your
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.200]  point okay yeah there's nothing wrong with the Constitution don't get me wrong
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.880]  I'm just saying that we're ultimately supposed to be living in a kingdom where
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.360]  the king of kings and the Lord of all the Lords on the earth keys are benevolent
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.240]  ruler and so I mean is that if you look think about that is the Constitution the
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.920]  answer for the people of China or Brazil or Ireland or Australia or Japan no
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.400]  different people can choose to govern themselves under their own laws here on
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.920]  earth but the law but they get conquered they've been conquered most those
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.720]  countries have been conquered by authoritarian systems given a choice if
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.200]  they could see the fruits of liberty there's not a group on the world that
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:58.200]  wouldn't want it right yeah and and and it's the apathy I guess it's being we're
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.840]  all seeing it right now worldwide by the corporations the the governments the
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.760]  people it's the answer to it ultimately has to lie above the government of man
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.880]  but we're gonna have we're always gonna have the government of man but above
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.160]  that you know we've been shown the right way the way we're supposed to go and
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.720]  honestly in my personal opinion that we were never supposed to know right
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.880]  from wrong we were never supposed to govern ourselves but now that we know
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.360]  right from wrong we have to do what's right and you're right because the
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.360]  Constitution definitely shows you a way that we can do that sure sure listen the
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.240]  whole Garden of Eden deal from my perspective it doesn't mean they were
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.960]  completely innocent of thoughts that we could see a sin it's that they were not
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.040]  conscious of it and they were not given the knowledge of good and evil of that
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.320]  you could choose a good system or a bad system so it was almost like a viral
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.880]  infection of satanic ways of being parasitic against other humans the
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.960]  knowledge of good and evil is the domestication of other humans and
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:03.280]  actually stealing their free will in the last 50 years iodine has been phased
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.480]  out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.080]  banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:18.200]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.280]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:28.600]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.640]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:39.720]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent

[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.440]  cognitive ability of the American people so why are the social engineers
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.600]  adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.720]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.040]  water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies I am extremely

[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:16.520]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:25.920]  network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones yesterday if you just joined
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.600]  us the russian government came out and said that if nato that's the united
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:37.720]  states in europe western europe nato members move missile systems which are
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.200]  really designed to shoot down russian response to a preemptive nuke attack that
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.480]  if they move those in that they may strike with nuclear weapons well they
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.880]  didn't say they may they said they will respond with nuclear weapons and the
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:09:01.360]  russians seem to mean it just like kennedy said he would basically nuke
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.560]  russia if they didn't pull their ships back that were carrying the warheads
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.600]  and other systems in the early 1960s to be moved to cuba during the cuban
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.640]  missile crisis and we just put up on screen the moscow times for everybody
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.560]  to see paul watson wrote a story about it at prison planet dot com picked up by
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.320]  drudge report dot com russia warrants of nuclear response russia warrants of
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.080]  nuclear response to u.s. global strike program now you have to understand folks
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.040]  i've never been to russia though i'd like to visit there in many other places
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.640]  i'm an american i had both sides of my family mother and father side which is
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.760]  extremely rare i'm not bragging but it's very rare something like 200,000
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.600]  people can say they had family on the mayflower direct descendant who live in
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.400]  the u.s. today on both sides it's less than a thousand people can say that they
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.400]  had both sides of their family directly on the mayflower i mean i'm as american
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.240]  as it gets that was 400 plus years ago that the mayflower landed here
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:12.040]  okay so my family goes back deeply the revolutionary war of texas independence
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.960]  if there was a revolution a renaissance happening some would say a
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.920]  tyranny happening my my bloodline goes right back through it
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.280]  that's why i grow like a plant and just like seeds and look just like an act
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.480]  just like my ancestors it's in the blood but it's in everyone's blood to want to
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:37.800]  be free to a certain extent my issue is i am 100 percent american 100 percent
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.640]  americana i mean 400 years that's indigenous folks
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.360]  that's a long time there but other people hear a lot
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:49.400]  longer obviously and the issue is i'm sick of being
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.560]  called a traitor by national media it's happened
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.640]  in so-called conservative media mainline right-wing establishment media
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.240]  whenever i am against messing with russia starting wars with russia
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.760]  russia's population is declining massively they've got huge problems
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.800]  they're not offensive in any way they're not expanding
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.800]  and our government and nato is trying to overthrow the russian government
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.200]  trying to start revolutions and riots rolling weapons systems in putting
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.920]  al-qaeda all over the southern area of southern russia and central asia
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.880]  publicly threatening to activate al-qaeda to blow up the olympics
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.720]  that's in mainstream moscow news and the saudi arabians admit it
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.640]  our allies are threatening to blow up the russians and the russians have had
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.400]  just about enough okay i don't go start fights
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.160]  that's what it comes down to and you're like oh you're for russia no i'm for
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.640]  living and not having nuclear war how's that sound
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.120]  i'm for common sense i mean just because i don't like communism doesn't mean
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.240]  that i'm for crony capitalism and all of its corruptions and all of its
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.560]  exploitation i'm for justice when i sit here and i say
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.320]  that it's not like i'm saying i'm mr goody two shoes wouldn't everybody be for
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.440]  not wanting to have nuclear war with russia
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.640]  wouldn't everybody know these globalists want total power they want global
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.080]  domination just like hitler and so they will probably push us to the
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.480]  brink they've already done it in 2008 almost causing a nuclear war in
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.800]  georgia and our media didn't even cover
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.240]  that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the russians
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.560]  and the russian foreign minister said we have moved nuclear weapons
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:37.480]  into georgia and we will attack the airfields where nato troops are landing
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.280]  because foreign troops are landing to fight the russian
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.120]  counter invasion what do you do you roll nuclear weapons in and they said and
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.120]  if you respond to that we're going to attack europe
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.840]  and if you respond to that we're going to attack your we're going to attack your
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.480]  military bases in europe a standard military procedure
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.840]  and if you attack that we're going to attack the united states
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:03.480]  and we got 10 000 warheads in icb m's ready to launch
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.240]  topol m missiles you name it i mean and literally folks
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.760]  this was all over the british all over the middle eastern all over the russian
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.840]  news all over the japanese news all over the chinese news
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:21.160]  no one even knew russia was saying we're preparing for nuclear war and rolled the
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.160]  medium range missile launchers in
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.320]  so they couldn't be targeted that's why they're mobile folks so they can move
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.240]  around from you know minute to minute hour to hour satellites
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.400]  target them for for i mean it's it's just like
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.680]  nuclear war could start up anytime between south korea
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.880]  china uh japan now by the way china is
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.320]  offensively taken over the planet with the globalist funding them
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.000]  they're offensively launching bluewater navies they're offensively saying
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.080]  they want to nuke the us preemptively they're offensively running around and
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.080]  there's no issue in the media with china being a problem
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.200]  john carrey says they're our friends see how this is so screwed up
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.880]  russia is just kind of flopping around trying to get itself together and the
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.560]  globalists are trying to overthrow it but they've got nuclear weapons
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.160]  and then meanwhile china is ten times the threat russia is
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.160]  just running around doing whatever it wants the threat ladies and gentlemen
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.640]  is the people that run our government that are
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.840]  endangering our entire planet and that's what i wanted to get out here
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.440]  because that's the big news on top of all the obama care all of it
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.040]  it shows how out of touch with reality the ruling classes
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.880]  they think because they haven't been withheld or restrained by anybody yet
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.080]  that that's obviously their right to keep escalating things
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:45.240]  and that's how big wars start folks so i would just say to the establishment
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.520]  and all the people that demonize me that i work for the vatican or i work for
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.280]  israel i'm a protestant christian or or i work for the
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.160]  easter bunny or any of this i work for me and my family having a future
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.360]  let's just get that straight and i i think all of us when we get demonized
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.360]  to just identify who we are we identify for not having a nuclear war
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.720]  we identify with having safe healthy food to eat we identify with having clean
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.280]  water we identify with having justice and
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.680]  liberty and a good culture of honorable people
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.880]  and if that's alien to new listers folks i'm sorry okay
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.360]  but in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king folks and
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.560]  all you got to do is open your eyes up politically spiritually socially you'll
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.360]  see what's going on i'm gonna shut up i said i go to your calls i'm hogging
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:36.600]  time as usual ryan tom austin v joseph we're going to all of your ryan thanks
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.880]  for holding uh you're on the air go ahead
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.400]  whatever obama came on the air the first time to speak he said
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:48.680]  America it is time for a change well alex um the way double talk works
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.400]  some of the best deceptive speakers like to tell their populace that they're
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.360]  really hurting them while it sounds like they're helping them when they're
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.360]  really hurting them and what i mean by that is well whenever you hear the word
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.400]  change you think of oh we're going to change this or we're going to change
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.800]  that when you hear of reform you think it means
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.640]  always good no you can be run over by an 18 wheeler and that's a reform
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.440]  with all your bones broken you've been reformed
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.640]  exactly you've been reformed into a dead casket and but
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.040]  my brain works out like what i saw that some people don't see and this may blow
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.680]  your mind but you probably see it because you're a really smart articulate
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.800]  person and what they do is okay the word change whenever you buy
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.000]  something at the store or whenever you sell something
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.080]  i.e. whenever you sell your country into bondage to the globalist takeover what
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.760]  do you get back to put into your pocket to change
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.760]  and it's all a dividing contra mechanism that they're using especially with the
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.000]  obamacare most people what's flashback to the 1700s
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.720]  remember the slogan no taxation without representation
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.080]  well obamacare is a federally mandated tax
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.840]  which is imposed upon the people with a punishment of non-payment which
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.720]  is taxation without representation and it's institutional social control
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.600]  and it transfers the money to private interest
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.880]  in the first run-through that is patently illegal
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.600]  yeah well food medicine and money are the three main resources that the
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.280]  globalists need to be able to alter our
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.880]  perception of reality and to basically control the universe
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.400]  and what you're going to see happen alex i don't mean to get all predictive
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.680]  on the air but i think you're going to see a scare tactic
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.440]  but they're going to use a food shortage to levy the votes for either the 2014
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.360]  congressional election or for the 2016 presidency because
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.440]  whenever we sell something alex we start by giving away free samples right we
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:45.240]  know that um well during july i saw this happen
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.920]  about eight or nine times on the decepticon media mainstream news
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.800]  and what they said was according to experts if all is according to experts
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.480]  according to experts today american food was rejected at the port
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.600]  due to unsafe possibility of consumption the food was then later rerouted to
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.480]  China first okay well what they did alex was they
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.240]  called our food unsafe so they could give it to China
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.720]  and then we fast forward to the third of july i was watching jleno and he said the
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.120]  chinese government has now announced that it has
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.880]  lost it's built food the world's largest food supply
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.720]  my question is is the food is no no no they're
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.240]  clearly rolling out with an ad campaign throughout the culture
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.080]  that american food isn't safe chinese food is safe when everybody knows the
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:36.120]  chinese food and and and supplements drugs you name it is the dirtiest
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.400]  in the world probably and the most counterfeited
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.600]  just like there's a rollout still about amazon and their drones
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.680]  and everyone's saying birds will attack it it'll crash your dog will attack it
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.320]  when the thing was all cooked up to make everybody say amazon amazon amazon amazon
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.240]  a billion billion times during the christmas season i mean it's totally
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.160]  transparent and then people see me talk about that
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.720]  and they debate and say i'm wrong there's no way i'm wrong
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.000]  it's just absolute ignorance you're absolutely right so
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.320]  how do we turn this around well the way we can reverse engineer with alex
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.240]  there well we still use the dividing culture and mechanism
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.760]  today it's still taught in school um actually graduate from college tomorrow
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.120]  with an accounting degree and a letter and radio television communications
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.800]  so i'm really good at catching continuity errors and how they stage these
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.520]  events um the way dividing conquer works alex
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.640]  you'll still hear it today they call it well every time the government does
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.520]  something they call it something else it's like a paradigm shift it's like
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.760]  the sine wave or the cosine wave you know it's military technology of a wall
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.360]  of pure deception because even though you know it's all a lie
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.440]  you know the smoke is obscuring the view you still can't see through the smoke
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:53.320]  so it's an artificial reality of induced fraud wave
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:57.720]  backed up by fraud to where you just roll over into a catatonic state and

[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:10.200]  it's a felony you shouldn't stop felons operating in the open
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.440]  uh just because uh they have badges and guns you should let them steal all your
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.400]  data and give it to homeland security don't climb up there with a baseball
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.800]  bat and beat it all up wearing a mask don't do that do not resist this

[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.520]  and we're going to pull it up i see you say it's a k a r
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.680]  e 11 uh let's uh correct what's the name of the headline
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.880]  and then we'll go like oh loving boxes help everyone uh what's the headline
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.440]  if you scroll down it's um it's down and it says something to the effect of um
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:58.120]  cell phone data and it shows like a hand holding a cell phone
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.560]  it's one of their top stories on their home page
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.520]  and it's about a two-minute clip and actually the news anchors are kind of
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.680]  against it which actually was a surprise oh my gosh they don't want to live in
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.560]  the in the soviet union no imagine that you know god our god
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.840]  obama and his wonderful obama cares finally
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.360]  not working out so well listen that is the good news i'm seeing local news i'm
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.600]  seeing police i'm seeing everybody get it
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.600]  that whoa tyranny hidden fun we don't want this and we did find the headline
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.240]  there it is good job guys we ought to give that story to a don or kurt or uh
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:35.480]  daniels uh because uh that is national news right there
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.640]  we broke this four weeks ago three and a half weeks ago with story lake dot com
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.760]  on them doing it they denied it first then admitted it
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.680]  and we got the secret documents from the city inside the city on how illegal it
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.960]  was and what they are doing that they are surveilling everyone
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:54.200]  so it's those documents that show it's illegal and now we need to move forward
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.960]  then us say today sunday covered it and then drudge report
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.560]  ended up picking it up so again it's an example of how
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:05.800]  the alternative media is key to bubbling this up
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:11.800]  and forcing it to be covered exactly and if i could just ask you one quick
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.520]  question regarding the nascent iodine and the fluoride
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.640]  shield you just came out with yes sir i've been taking the the nascent iodine
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.240]  now since i've gotten it and i'm waiting for my pro pier system to get
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.400]  here so i can get that fluoride out but the question i have for you is
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.040]  if i order the fluoride shield do i need to stop taking the survival shield
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.480]  you need to consult your physician as dr group and others have said
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.000]  but it's actually set to be a low dose compared to even some of the other
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.800]  supplements that are out there uh and no it's designed so you can take them both
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.080]  at the same time because it's a tiny amount of nascent iodine
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.440]  in the fluoride shield compared to the amount of iodine
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.480]  because that's all that's in there is iodine and the glycerin base
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:01.160]  in the survival shield the survival shield is the turbo charging
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.760]  and it is our best seller for the products but the
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.080]  the fluoride shield itself is by the way a two ounce bottle
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.200]  and and and only like you know 20 more so it's really the best deal we have
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.840]  and it's got the shillogy and a bunch of other things
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.000]  that are shown to cause the metabolic shift according to dr group and others
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.840]  to help move it out of the body so it doesn't just kind of move
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.400]  around in the body once you extract it out of the tissue
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.480]  so according to uh folks that help us uh a development
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.000]  it can be taken together but there can be detoxing in the first month i
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.200]  experienced it all this stuff came out of my skin
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.160]  people can look at me on tv now and say man this guy's been on this three months
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:45.320]  we can see the difference and there's no doubt what dr group developed
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.120]  is simply amazing god bless you appreciate your call

[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.800]  three shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade

[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.480]  article page you'll see a listing up there of
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.840]  basically uh i guess the military calls it a ham salad
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.080]  or a uh tossed salad or whatever it's called of different
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.400]  links uh i said it because it looks like all the
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.640]  you know medals on the chest where you can go to the different
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.000]  youtube and facebook and twitter and follow us all
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.400]  right there at info wars dot com or prison planet
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.840]  dot com but let's go back to your calls now these
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.120]  callers are all really raising important points and i love callers calling
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.160]  in because they end up bringing up local news that becomes national news
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.680]  because they mentioned it here on air and folks then discover what's happening
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:51.480]  they want to keep us compartmentalized the answer is to have local news be local
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.040]  and international and national and to have national news be national
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.280]  international but also local because the human experience
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.520]  is the human experience regardless and then you find what's happening here is
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:07.400]  happening in australia is happening in south africa is
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.800]  happening in germany is happening in mexico
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.360]  is happening in canada is happening in brazil is happening in asia
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.880]  in japan because it's it's global systems that corporations
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.840]  create a fraud and a manipulation
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.360]  and being unaware of it is why we're in so much trouble
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.400]  people like i don't want to know all that it sounds like a headache it's that
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:33.720]  mental laziness folks that has gotten us in the position where it's fun to know
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.440]  how stuff works it's fun to be informed
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.640]  it's great to be part of the animating contest of liberty
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.320]  and your animating contest of liberty can be different than mine
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:53.160]  just be involved just don't be a cookie cutter
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.680]  biological robot that's programmed from birth to do what
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:04.040]  other people want live that's what life's so really about
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.520]  let's go ahead and talk to austin in texas and then we'll go to v and others
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.480]  austin welcome hey how's it going addict
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:16.360]  good brother thanks for calling thank you um i just uh i wanted to say first uh
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.280]  that long time listener uh first time caller and i want to thank everything
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.640]  that you do for us you know i mean uh i'm pretty sure winner lose you're
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.840]  gonna everyone's gonna remember you as a hero but uh
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.680]  a point that i wanted to talk about was uh something starting about martial law
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.520]  like as in when when it does really does hit the fan like
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.120]  wherever we're at whatever the situation or whatever location we're at like
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.440]  what do we do do we just like hunker down on where we're at or do we like
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:46.840]  get to the streets and uh not start violence but start banding with other
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.200]  sure people that are aware of what's really happening like what what what
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.640]  what goes on and once we know it's hit the fan
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.800]  you know you know i could write a book
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.280]  about different scenarios you never know exactly what's going to happen
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.360]  the globalists the social engineers want to have an incremental
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.040]  ratcheting up of tyranny and of martial law and armored vehicles and
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.280]  checkpoints and face scanners and systems tracking everyone and
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  internet kill switches and they want to just slowly turn
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.480]  the heat up and beat us but they know if we continue to mount resistance to them
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.920]  and it looks like we're about to win and take the country back they will blow up
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.920]  a city and say we did it guaranteed they'll release a bio weapon i mean
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.960]  there's no telling so then folks say well then we're totally held hostage we
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.320]  can't beat them no if you're aware of just how bad they
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.840]  are and know what their tricks are and enough people know that it'll give to
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.320]  the point where they'll run an NSA algorithm
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.440]  i know how they operate i studied how they've you know past meetings and things
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.040]  that have been declassified or leaked they'll say uh this isn't going to fly
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:56.120]  people aren't going to buy this you know if you back al-qaeda and launch an open
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.560]  attack on syria the russians aren't going to back down
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.840]  and so the joint chiefs went and told obama you can't do it because public
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.040]  opinion was against it and mill and the military knew it was a bad
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.880]  operation both morally but also on where it would probably
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.400]  lead so it's not just good people that are
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.280]  going to turn this around it's people that are into self
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.160]  preservation
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.280]  um what i also i just i just wanted to clarify was this
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.720]  like as far as like when we do when it's official when we see on the news
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.080]  CNN or every like breaking news uh martial law has been declared and i
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.440]  know where troops are leaving the bases into the city streets like that's
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.720]  what we want to know like what do we do if it does come back to that right
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.880]  well i appreciate your call sir let me try to answer that again we don't know
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.400]  what scenario it'll be
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.000]  even if they release the bio weapon or a natural
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.440]  pathogen bacterial viral develops that's killing millions of people
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.720]  if you're not in the area affected by the bio weapon you're going to want
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:03.800]  martial law see it's not just that the martial law is good or
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.960]  bad it's that they're preparing us for the
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.840]  martial law and gearing up for it and have a history of staging
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.960]  other precipitating events and then they stand to gain from it because
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:23.160]  that's their main philosophy and system of control
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:28.360]  so if i mean let's say some white cop kills some 10-year-old black kid and
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.920]  it's obviously racist and wrong and there's video of it
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.120]  there will then be a v for vendetta type scenario
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.760]  with people so sick of it all that you'll end up probably having black folks
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.360]  riot and kill people and burn stuff first and then people are so sick of it
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:47.560]  even if the media tries to play it as racial division
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.800]  you might even start having you know whites hispanics others join them
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.360]  in the burning and killing everything about that
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.920]  so so their scenarios that because they've tried to divide us that could
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.400]  backfire on them and actually explode in ways they don't know and
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.240]  that's really where the wargaming comes in and the establishment even admits
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.640]  this in higher level white papers out there
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.600]  that we've covered you can look up it's just legion
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.960]  that even though they've got all this google system and nsa systems try to
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.040]  gauge the future and can and try to steer reality
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.960]  because if you're aware of the trends you can then add data and add stimuli to
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:33.000]  be able to steer it the way you want it it starts gyrating out of control
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.320]  and you're unable to maintain
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:43.480]  the controlled cultural implosion you see they say they want to dumb us down
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.400]  distract us put us in a false reality ahead of
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:50.600]  incremental phasing out of the mass population
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.280]  because we're destructive we're bad for the earth and because they're not able
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.920]  to control seven eight ten twenty billion people
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.520]  already seven and a half billion so i get the elite saying they're sitting on
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.360]  top of time bomb and sitting on top of something the problem
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:08.200]  is they've helped create this and clearly with my own organic
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:12.040]  computer i can analyze history spectrums common sense
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.400]  and tell that what they've done to be in control
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.400]  has actually has actually created the greater threat
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.560]  by removing the normal inhibitions and programming
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  in the public towards good social order because they were in a revolution
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.280]  against good social order seeing it as a threat to their hegemonic rule
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.720]  but now they've destroyed the very underpinning of societal
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.880]  stability but then enters the larger spiritual nature
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:45.240]  of these systems in that at the base of it they can intellectually claim why
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.760]  they're doing what they're doing but the fruits are entirely different
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.360]  and at the heart of it is a love of degeneracy a love of betrayal
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:59.320]  a love of failure a love of collapse a love of all the curses
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:05.080]  that follow the manifestation of the Babylonian system
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.560]  so you ask me questions about
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.880]  you ask me questions about what do you do when there's troops on the streets
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:21.080]  if the troops are maintaining order from groups that are running around killing
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.920]  people you support them if the troops are quarantining
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:28.440]  cities to keep a bio release out even if the globalists released it
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.120]  we're with the troops there with us we don't want to die from the bio release
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.000]  we want it contained so you support them
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.440]  if the troops those stage a bio attack or somebody else does
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.680]  and they use that to say turn your guns in ahead of us coming into your area
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.720]  then you know it's predatory and you have to try to stay out of their way
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:53.560]  get to a rural area and try to not engage them
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.280]  because it does nothing to the new order to kill a bunch of troops
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.400]  if they stage a revolution nuke a city say the patriots did it
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:05.880]  come after the patriot leaders and try and open coup or push because they're
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.840]  not the globalists don't even go with the best plans i hate to even
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.160]  lay out what i think they would do because sometimes it's better than what
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.400]  they even come up with they're very unimaginative because they're so evil
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.840]  if they just try to open round up of them of the patriot leaders well then you
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.880]  know what's happening and you know what to do folks you've got to fight back
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.400]  against the dumb cops that come in the armored vehicles against the military
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.280]  they're engaged in treason they're trying to take you and your family to a
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.480]  FEMA camp they're trying to take you for reeducation that's in the official
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:35.000]  army manuals try to avoid them try to stay out of their way but
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.440]  a lot of military people intend while you are trying to get out of the way
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.360]  they're going to go attack and that's just that's the consensus
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:49.800]  and i'm just listen this this is so sophisticated that as a general in the
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.160]  info war you have to understand i cannot sit
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.680]  there and play out the endless permutations of war games for you on
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.760]  air
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.720]  you want to see its army regulation to 10-35 civilian and main labor
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.960]  program that's just one of the programs you can look
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.160]  up the reeducation camp documents just type in army
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:19.160]  manual reeducation camp they even used the soviet term reeducation camp
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.640]  and all of this troops and police you know for one gunman or whatever
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:27.240]  and and strutting around is all like a dog hiking its leg urinating on you to
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.280]  show dominance you know we roll over and show our belly
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.720]  and the cops know that deep down they think they're on top because they're
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.080]  in a hierarchical situation so they themselves are more
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:40.840]  controlled than anybody we're going to have to lead
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.760]  and listen the most important thing is that
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.520]  that's fm3-39.40 internment resettlement operations 2010
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.720]  if you want to see the reeducation camp for how they process your social
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.200]  security number how they break you and your family up
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.280]  i mean you know i don't want to physically have a war and i do a trillion
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.960]  times more speaking out than i would do is one one
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.680]  combatant as they would call me but at the same time it says a man
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:12.840]  i can guarantee i know how i i mean i know how we all are
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.880]  it's not that we are afraid to get a shooting war going it's just we want to
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.040]  win it the other way and are very sad about where all
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.480]  this is going but once the bullets start flying once the
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.840]  triggers start pulling we're americans love to fight more
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.920]  than anybody in the world and we love to kill
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.680]  once we're in the right i mean i'm a killing machine
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.040]  any man who's got their head screwed on straight is a killing
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.760]  machine
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:49.640]  and i don't even want to think about those areas of my mind
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.480]  but anybody hurts my family anybody messes with me
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:58.680]  anybody tries to run some soviet crap we are going to absolutely go haywire and
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.800]  everybody knows that by the way
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:07.720]  so everybody trying to start war with the russians
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:12.520]  trying to start war here you globalists aren't going to be safe in your bunkers
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.160]  and let me tell you whether you're in the police the military i don't care our
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:20.280]  enemy collectively are these crazy people they all want us to fight with
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.480]  each other this is a joke
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.840]  so he gets me to start thinking about what i'll do during this i don't know
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.520]  because there's a lot of different scenarios i'm going to try to stay out
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.480]  of a fight i'm going to try to stay out of trouble
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.680]  but if it's a war they want it's a war they'll get
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.360]  they start the fight they'll get a response
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.240]  and they know they won't have the moral high ground if they do that
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.760]  so what the technocrats are going to do is carry out atrocities in our name so
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:58.680]  what do we do we inoculate psychologically the fact
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.520]  that false flag is historical is the majority of the attacks
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.880]  and that they have the mode of the means the capacity the history of doing it
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.040]  they are the prime suspects of any event when it transpires
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.960]  that's what i'm saying and everyone in the system better have a debate about
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.080]  this right now because i know 98 percent of you are good men and women in the
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:20.280]  system i don't care if it's public private corporate
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:23.480]  and and and let me tell you just like the joint chiefs went to obama and said
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:27.720]  we're not going to launch a war with syria and have a fight with russia
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.000]  hey this is very immoral and we started this with al-qaeda
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.920]  and we're backing al-qaeda don't do it and it's that's the kind of thing that's
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.160]  going to save us folks that's the kind of thing
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.840]  that when the joint chiefs came to kennedy was the other way around in 1961
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.840]  1962 and they said we want to primitively nuke russia this has been declassified
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.880]  and kennedy been pro-war a big hawk all you know as a veteran he's like
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.160]  i'm against communism and i'm not going to start a war with him that's evil
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.800]  that's another strange love the movie's basically all about real stuff that
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.080]  happened minus the attack actually being launched by lemay
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.080]  who's general jack t ripper in the film stanley cubrick's
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:10.680]  black satire masterpiece and
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:15.640]  in that you see the mindset of these people
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.920]  and they came to kennedy and said we want to launch a primitive nuclear war on
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.440]  them and we want to stage some terror attacks in america to do it
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.040]  and kennedy said you're fired
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.360]  you're fired
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.120]  basically peter cellars you know repeats it where they're sitting in the
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.000]  war room they wanted to launch a primitive attack on russia since the
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.600]  bombers have already been launched under plan r by general jack t ripper
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:44.600]  aka jack the ripper and they go come on sir it's already been committed don't
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.800]  think about yourself in the history books when the president says i don't want
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:52.840]  to go down in history as the greatest killer since hitler
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:01.080]  we're going to come back go to v wesley jody jim and others ahead of ron paul

[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:27.880]  now scientists are saying that the universe collapsed back into the big bang uh big bang tomorrow
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.320]  and then another day they say it's going to keep expanding for 50 billion more
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.400]  years the truth is they don't know anything science is being turned on its
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.720]  head every day not every week and the truth is we're living in the middle of
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.920]  an incredible wondrous mystery and my greatest regret is that we spend so
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:48.200]  much time focused in on what the globalists are
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.520]  doing and the control freaks are doing
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.680]  because we have to or they'll ruin our lives and ruin our planet
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:00.840]  instead of marveling at the creation all around us
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.240]  i just want to see humanity succeed if folks ask me what i stand for
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.520]  we tell people what we stand for versus what the technocrats stand for
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.320]  they say humanity's ugly and bad they're going to get rid of us and merge with
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.280]  machines that's the official policy of these people
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.400]  that's the official idea of ray Kurzweil that heads up google's
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.560]  futurist project he's on their board
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.560]  does that mean that everybody at google's bad no
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.560]  does it mean everybody at uh microsoft is bad
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.160]  is because bill gates is certifiably a new world order eugenicist
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:42.440]  no but the directive from the top is corrupt and bad
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.080]  same thing with the police departments all of it
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.280]  there's paul watson's article the dark side of ray Kurzweil's transhumanist
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.880]  utopia the elite's obsessive pursuit of immortality
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:59.960]  is the new tool of class enslavement let's go back to your calls v in
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.000]  nevada thanks for calling in
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.520]  Ernest salutations my fellow american um
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:12.040]  please bear with me i just had a major uh dental surgery okay
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.880]  here you are i i guess i could start out like everyone else and say
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.200]  oh i'll explain what you do and thank you so much
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:24.920]  yada yada yada uh let me hear me out i hate what you do
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:31.400]  because uh it's it's a weather vane uh a fork to me
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.160]  it uh it's a gauge of you know the slow
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.280]  creeping tyranny that each and every one of us
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.600]  are basically becoming oblivious to every day you know i agree with you it's
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.680]  almost like i'm play-by-play chronicling and it can almost
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.280]  demoralize people and i'm almost acclimating people
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:54.600]  and that is a side effect of what i do but overall
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.040]  i believe in humanity and that people will rise against the tyranny
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.640]  and not just accept it but it undoubtedly with some people
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:05.320]  it demoralizes them because they're timid spirits
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:09.880]  go ahead right with you i'm right with you and you know i agree 100 percent
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.520]  um i love you from one man from a black man to a white man
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:18.360]  believe it or not i love you believe it or not we're all just human beings
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.120]  i don't we are yeah and that's what i try to get people to see every day i got

[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:49.960]  uh yeah i remember seeing this months ago that no one seen milson mandela no
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:53.720]  one was allowed to go in and see him there was a big debate about whether he
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.240]  was alive or not and they do this a lot when famous world leaders die the
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.120]  soviets would do this and these are communists so they act the same
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:03.080]  they would hide the fact that they'd been dead for a while
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.680]  you've also saw speculation that castros been dead a bunch too so
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:12.040]  it doesn't always mean that but i i saw this last week and this week i i did
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.800]  see it in foreign press that family been demanding to seem others had been
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.400]  demanding to seem and then it was that they couldn't cover it up anymore so
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.800]  they just suddenly announced he passed in the night no details of why
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:27.080]  and just the pieces i've got in the way communists operate
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.000]  they follow a handbook uh you you have the article here out of your local
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.960]  paper and it's got basically the same stuff i'd seen
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.480]  i'm glad you raised this so so tell folks what the article is about and we're
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:40.680]  going to get it linked up on info wars dot com right now
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:44.520]  you bet you bet and i could not be prouder to be handed it to
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:49.800]  Alex Jones himself sir check this out reading into the article but the young
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.720]  woman has come under fire here too and in other local news i've been looking
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.760]  into it they had a denial of service attack
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.600]  they had a denial of service attack perpetrated on them like
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:06.760]  probably the same day that they tried to break this news
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:10.680]  their that entire news website was shut down for three days
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:14.120]  and they know another guardian express it seems like a pretty good publication
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.640]  i don't like go ahead they're pretty good you know they they break some
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:20.760]  some kind of juicy stuff you know i'm an info how man i'm gonna look
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.560]  true but they traced they traced the denial of
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.960]  service attack back to south africa there is your
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:33.800]  caramelizer your your your your crystallizer this
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:37.640]  is probably one of the the single most cast
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:43.640]  and covered uh news stories ever now i've been digging
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:47.640]  for some reason or another right after obama showed up there
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:51.480]  is when the machine will shut off now if you look in this article it says
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:55.240]  that the family was debating over some kind of
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.440]  a state or something like that they were having a legal
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.360]  you know tie-up in that mandela wasn't basically there to make decisions
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:05.800]  so they had to keep him alive because
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.680]  you can't have these sorts of legal proceedings over in the state and stuff
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:13.640]  if a person is dead so they've basically been pumping
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:18.600]  air into a corpse in order to keep him alive so that the judicial
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:23.080]  i'm sorry oh god this sounds terrible so that the legal proceedings could
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.800]  you know continue they can continue to fight over
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:30.360]  you know what's going on i don't know what happened once obama showed up
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.440]  okay and now he's been you know the are supposedly the like the life support's
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:37.800]  been turned off or whatnot uh me and my sister are very
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:43.880]  passionate about this kind of thing and she found even that they had the casket
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:48.040]  uh they just recently put the casket out in public and i will bet you
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:51.400]  every gun in my arsenal and i love my guns
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.920]  that they've got people out there walking around an empty
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:59.400]  casket i promise you mandela's been dead for about six months probably
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.480]  and the fact that this site was attacked you know these globalists work you know
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.520]  if whenever something's on the level and it's going to inform people
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.560]  they come out and get it so the denial of service
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.600]  is traced back to south africa and i really just want to have you completely
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:20.520]  read that article i want alex jones do me the honor
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.200]  read that number i mean i remember that uh
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:27.720]  hearing about people saying where is he he's dead in the controversy in south
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.920]  africa people can pull those articles up watson or somebody could do an article
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.640]  about this so that was definitely a controversy and they just
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:36.920]  finally said he was dead and people will do this so that they can continue to
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:41.160]  operate and sign his name and do things i mean this this this sounds like a
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.680]  whole bunch of murdering communists would operate so standard procedure thank

[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.920]  you said you want to talk about syria so please give us
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:37.640]  dr paul your take on that well i hope it's good news so far so good
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:41.080]  the people spoke out because they've been listening to programs like yours
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:44.840]  and a lot of other ones and the people spoke out when the president decided
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:49.000]  that he would come to the congress and get permission to start bombing syria
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.240]  and the american people evidently said we've had enough wars we don't want to
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:56.200]  and we're not going to let our congressman vote for it so he
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.280]  he knew he couldn't win the vote so he backed off so they had to back off on
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:04.680]  the bombing so i think this is a victory does this mean that he has
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:09.080]  changed his tune probably not he's still very much involved
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:14.520]  he's put out an open hand you know to the iranians i think that is good
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.720]  so although i am not certain about where he's coming from finally
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.920]  you know when there's a chance to at least say well he's doing the right
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.360]  thing we shouldn't say well we we don't we don't want him to do that
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.960]  i want you know a different type of foreign policy and so far
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.320]  i think we're seeing it but you know today there was something in the news i
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.880]  thought was important it's related to this
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.000]  and that is the american government now has said
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.720]  you know we're going to cut off non-lethal
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:47.720]  help and aid to the syrian rebels well and behold
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.320]  i mean can you imagine how long it's been going on long time before we even
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:54.840]  knew about our involvement you know the cia's been involved there long time
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.920]  but they cut off non-lethal aid is it good but why did we send it in the first
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:02.040]  place and does that mean they're still going to send lethal aid
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:05.960]  and he assures us that they're going to continue to send humanitarian aid which
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:08.680]  is nothing more than a weapon for these factions
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:12.040]  so he's moving in the right direction but we need to move right
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.520]  a lot faster because my position has been that we just shouldn't be involved at
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.440]  all and this whole pretense that we're helping the good guys over there
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:23.560]  and yet the weapons end up in the hands of the al-qaeda
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.000]  at least they're recognizing that not only did he back off on the bombing he's
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.280]  recognizing that yes some of us who said don't send the
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.920]  weapons it'll end up in the hands of the enemy
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:35.960]  he's recognizing this and the president is backed off on
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.120]  sending some of this equipment but that's put to keep the pressure on him to
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.080]  back off on sending anything to an area like this because it can be
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:50.280]  cannot be of any benefit to us whatsoever well it's it's it's very
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:53.560]  exciting dr paul and i want to get your take on this because it ties into the
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.920]  media that they said we've got to go to war it's
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:01.480]  going to happen they launched the sarin gas attack aka the the syrian
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.600]  government Assad and then now sy hirs has come out with
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:08.680]  documents that it was really the syrian uh opposition that did it
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:12.120]  back by the west of course we broke that first with world net daily and others
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.120]  grudge report carried our articles and of course we got attacked for it your son
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.720]  got attacked valiantly in the senate for daring to point out that we're funding
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:24.760]  al-qaeda but overnight now it's admitted and
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.880]  suddenly we don't ever hear about syria in the news anymore
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.040]  from imminent we've got to have war to let's not talk about it
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.960]  and we've stopped this criminal escalation to me
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.520]  and we're seeing this down on so many fronts obama care you name it
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:44.040]  their wave has been stopped politically and i've seen this historically where
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.720]  everything they wanted they got just by weight of inertia
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:53.160]  now it looks like we've stopped them and are beginning to turn the tide
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:56.840]  do you concur or do you add anything to your deep historical perspective
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.600]  well i concur and i'm excited about it i'm very pleased
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.880]  and i praised the direction that we're going and i give the credit to a lot of
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.560]  people who put pressure on their members of congress because that's the way the
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.560]  system actually works i know that a lot of people get frustrated oh one person
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:14.680]  can't do any good mike member of congress never listened
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.240]  but when enough people send the message you know uh they will listen because
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.600]  they're political political animals so i see this as being very very positive
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.400]  but i'm not convinced that uh even though the pew poll showed that
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:33.000]  now we have 54 percent of the american people the first time in 40 years saying
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.920]  that we should be not involved in this kind of activity
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.160]  i'm not convinced that the american people are quite with us but they're so
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:43.800]  much better than they were some of them were just saying well
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.320]  we're running out of money to spend all that money on welfare here at home
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.160]  but you know the first step of just stopping this overseas is a big
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.240]  big help and therefore i'm cautiously optimistic and
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.400]  everybody knows i spend a lot of time on college campuses and believe me
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.240]  reaching young people uh is important and the young people
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.600]  do not want to have another war to inherit they have enough problems
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:10.920]  uh and enough you know things that they have to face that they've been given
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.440]  uh you know by a previous generation you know including the death and
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.040]  the mess in medical care and all this military intervention so one thing for
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:20.680]  sure the message i hear in college campuses
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:25.320]  we don't need another war that's good again uh libertarian
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.120]  patriot constitutionalist icon ron paul joins us the website of course is
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:34.200]  excellent the shows are amazing i'm a big fan of ron paul channel dot com
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.120]  and it is supplanting the mainstream media and all over talk radio now
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:42.040]  i do affiliate interviews every other day and so many times when i'm on a local
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.720]  station i was on one in noxville just yesterday and heard
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.080]  during the news break then play your two-minute analysis it's just
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:52.360]  just excellent and hard hitting and absolutely pertinent
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:56.280]  to what's happening now looking at targeting young people
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.520]  we're targeting to take the blinders off obama's targeting them with the obama
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.760]  care to dumb them down which i believe was designed to fail
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.080]  and they now admit that to bankrupt the old system and bring in single payer
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:13.480]  now colin pal's getting behind that uh bainer john boner whatever his name is
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.200]  the speaker of the house is coming out saying it's ridiculous that tea party
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:23.080]  republicans in the house of senate led by ted cruz and your son a senator
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.800]  rand paul would not want to have a bigger budget
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:30.040]  when they boosted 60 million cut at 20 million rearranging deck chairs in the
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.680]  titanic um dr paul i see the republican and
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:38.200]  democratic leadership with with carl roe and others really trying to
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:41.800]  destroy a true libertarian movement the republican party that
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.720]  you've helped forge with uh the groups that you set up the campaign for
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:48.280]  liberty and others we're trying to save this country
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:54.040]  what do we do to get on the offense to once and for all remove these rhino
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:58.040]  statist out of the republican party because they admit they're scared
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.480]  that we could take over well i think we're making progress because the
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.840]  alignment has changed uh you know when these budget
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:08.680]  agreements come up you know it's leadership of both parties that get together
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.000]  but the grassroots uh you know on both sides frequently get together
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.760]  that's that's what happened on the bombing you know the leadership republican
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.600]  democrats wanted to give permission to the president to bomb syria
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.200]  but the people went out and reached the individual congressman
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:28.600]  that's exactly what happened when we uh you know got our audit the fed bill
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:33.000]  passed on two occasions in the house and it wasn't because i had any
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.760]  uh you know legislative cloud you know in that sense i
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:40.040]  didn't have any ability to put leverage on anybody
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.520]  but we had every republican vote for it and we had a lot more democrats vote
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.440]  for it too but this comes from a coalition of the people
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:53.640]  so uh i think it's i think uh the most important thing is changing people's
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:57.720]  attitudes and hopefully issues like war issues of
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:03.720]  and if they spying uh issues of the fed they transcend some of this party stuff
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.440]  and i love the issues where you can reach both elements uh
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.760]  you know that uh you know where we can come together and change policy
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:15.720]  but then there's this power struggle that is so
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.000]  uh disruptive to the whole system in washington
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.640]  uh even though uh they do compromise on the big issue there's a big fight on
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:26.760]  who gets to pull the strings and write the checks
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:30.600]  well i agree with you i would be a democrat if they had ron paul's and rand
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:33.880]  paul's and ted cruise in it and i would love to take over the
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:37.640]  democratic party with american free market ideas
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:41.080]  uh separately as you know they're scapegoating capitalism
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:44.440]  for the problems we're in when it's purely crony capitalism
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.200]  uh how do you see us winning that fight uh
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.240]  dr paul for the hearts and minds as things collapse into collectivism that
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:57.560]  you've always predicted you have said many times that the crisis is
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.480]  they'll offer more collectivism as the answer how do we
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:06.680]  reverse uh this this this qe unlimited what's happening with the economy how
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:10.680]  do we explain to people that it's insider groups doing this
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:13.960]  not the free market well there's no easy way we have to keep
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:17.480]  plugging away and that is getting information out there which that's your
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.720]  business and that's been my goal and uh if you change the
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:26.280]  prevailing attitudes uh of the people you will change the attitudes of people
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:30.920]  uh in in congress but it's been helpful there's been a couple things going on
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:33.960]  here in these last five years and i especially noticed it
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:37.080]  during the presidential campaigns that i was involved in
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.400]  and that is uh communications are different now your communications are
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.000]  not average you're not fox news you know you you communicate with a lot of
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.600]  people but it's differently so we have the internet we have radio
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:53.320]  programming that's independent so that vehicle is available to us like
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:58.280]  never before but also the evidence failure of the
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:03.320]  system is so clear uh so we look at it and say yeah
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.400]  uh the foreign policy of the Middle East is a disaster
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.680]  let's slow it down so this information has gotten out
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.200]  and uh we can use that to our benefit so i think it's going to be the failure of
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:16.680]  the system i think the question that you might be
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:20.680]  raising here is yes we know it isn't working and we know things are going to
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.800]  come down but what will the results be and that's
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:28.360]  still up for grabs although we can look at some areas that are very positive we
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:32.840]  can be optimistic but that is that that is the bottom line you know who gets
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:37.720]  blamed will it be uh capitalism in the good sense or will it be
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:43.240]  crony capitalism that gets the blame you know we have these uh uh you know
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:47.160]  wall street uh you know demonstrators but they're always
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:50.440]  complaining but they should be it should be shown that they're
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:54.840]  against crony capitalism not free capitalism it's an educational effort
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:58.120]  and i think the opportunity is there the opportunity to spread the message
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:02.360]  at the same time uh the failure of the system is going to play
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:06.920]  into our hands uh because there has to be a need there has to be a replacement
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:11.160]  because if we allow a vacuum to you know come with the failure
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:15.880]  of the economic system believe me we're going to end up with a worse situation
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:19.240]  then we will have dictatorship and that's why
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:23.000]  you know empires and dictatorship depends on lies
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.160]  and uh just look at the lies that we've had to put up with
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:30.280]  in the last several decades they get worse and worse
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:33.800]  at the same time we have more whistleblowers than ever before
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:37.080]  that's right that's that to me is a good trend
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:39.800]  we've only got about four minutes left with you and i appreciate your time
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:43.320]  let me throw this out at you them since you mentioned dictators that reminds me
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:46.120]  they're finally having congressional hearings as i'm sure you know is a new
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:49.320]  sound uh with jonathan turley on the left and and
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:53.000]  and kato institute people on the right saying obama pretty much has become a
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.240]  dictator doesn't mean he's physically a dictator
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:58.920]  will stay in office but they're making the office dictatorial on
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:02.520]  on immigration on obama care which they created
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:08.120]  uh across the board on power plants what do we do about repudiating obama
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:10.680]  because if we just let him sail off into the sunset
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.280]  and don't impeach him or don't repudiate it it sets that precedent that you
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:17.560]  just mentioned what do we do about dictatorship and then separately give me
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:21.160]  your take on obama care well obama care i mean we can dismiss
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:25.000]  that rather easily as a total disaster and the medical care that you will get
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.520]  is no better than the computers that he has been working with
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:33.000]  but you know the dictatorship is a very real thing but i don't see it as limited
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.760]  to obama because when you look at uh what's
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:41.160]  happened and what has happened you know with uh the attack on civil
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.320]  liberties the spying and the covert war there is republican as democrat what
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:48.360]  about the national defense authorization act that was under
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:53.000]  the you know uh another administration and we have uh
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:59.320]  with this idea of assassination uh that that this too often is bipartisan
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:03.320]  yes if you want to tag it on and show what's happening with obama
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:08.280]  uh that is that is fine but i think we're going to accept the dictatorship
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:11.480]  that is elected because i people say well no he's going to
[02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:14.760]  announce for a third term he's going to be a a dictator i don't think that's
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:17.720]  going to happen i think the american people would it would shake the american
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:21.160]  people finally uh and i think it would serve our
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:25.880]  interest but that doesn't mean that we will have a less dictatorial government
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:29.800]  oh i totally agree so we now have a exactly we now have a kind of a
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:34.040]  dictatorial bureaucracy and a system that has just set the president
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:37.480]  to get away with whatever they want let me ask you this how do we reverse that a
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:41.560]  briefly get give me your take on where you think obama care is going now
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:45.880]  then i have one more question for you dr paul okay well i think obama care
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:49.400]  probably is going to limp into existence
[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:52.680]  and that the election next year will show that it wasn't very popular and
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:56.440]  they'll probably back off a little bit but uh even if the republicans have
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:00.600]  more control next year they're not going to get rid of the whole thing
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.760]  and they're not going to take a principled stand
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:05.880]  of questioning why should the government be involved at all
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:09.560]  so i as bad as it is now and as bad as obama is trying
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:15.960]  to make it i think that uh not a whole lot is going to happen uh for the
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:19.240]  long-term future until after the next election and then i think
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.640]  hopefully they'll at least allow individuals to opt out of the system and
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:26.840]  then say it all i want is to be able to take care of myself
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:30.760]  a big big request in a free society so i i think that
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:34.760]  uh it it doesn't look good on the on the long run but
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:38.360]  at least maybe it'll get improved a little bit after next year's election
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:44.120]  sure or rand paul's bill to make congress the house and senate live under
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.800]  the same laws they passed for us i mean for me that's major discrimination
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:50.920]  that they're exempt i know you pushed against that and speaking of that here
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.840]  are the two final points that go together uh former reagan advisor
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:59.000]  david stock on the top economist told bloomberg earlier in the week that
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.040]  uh every market valuation has lost every anchor to the real world that sounds
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:07.480]  like ron paul talking a lot of economists say the big
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:11.320]  event has to happen by the middle of next year with all this qi unlimited with
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:13.880]  the bubble bursting what do you think's happening in the
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:19.960]  real economy with all this fiat uh and then uh what's the word on your son
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.520]  running for president
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:27.160]  well you know i think in the real world uh the economy is a lot worse than
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:30.360]  people you know think of course the people who are suffering they know darn
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.760]  well and that's the bottom one third at least because uh you know if you look
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:40.040]  at the uh workforce uh only 61 of the workforce are employed so
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:43.560]  the more than a third of the people are essentially unemployed or having a
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.400]  terrible time and yet uh you know stock markets go up and you look at
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:50.840]  wall street and there's more wealth than before in certain group
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:55.960]  so we're in the bipolar world that uh it's uh the very rich and the very
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.800]  poor and and that is that is going to continue and it's in a predictable
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.240]  event uh by uh austrian economics that this would
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:06.760]  happen and middle class would uh be destroyed but that's that's going to
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:09.960]  lead to you know a lot of political problems as
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:13.000]  well uh economic problems lead to political problems
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.880]  the whole thing well who's going to get blamed for it
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.040]  will freedom and the free markets be blamed or will it be too much government
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:25.080]  will it be uh obama type obama care and and big government and big
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:28.680]  government's buying is this kid are they going to get the blame
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.400]  and uh that's that's still our job and uh we have a lot of work to do
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:36.760]  now obviously you're going to let him answer this but i mean undoubtedly we
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.040]  show support i think your son's hands down the best candidate
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:43.800]  i'd like to see a rand paul uh run for president
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:49.240]  and a ted cruise run for run for vice president uh or or i guess you couldn't
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:52.680]  have a father son uh team up you for president ran for
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:57.000]  vice president but certainly i mean as a father you can't speak for your son but
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.240]  as a father could you ever have imagined that your son
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:04.360]  could end up being not just president but end up being
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.720]  a libertarian president to restore the republic
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.160]  well it takes some adjustment to think about it but
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:15.960]  you know he he's in a position now you know i was toiling in the field for a
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:22.120]  lot of years a lot of decades and i made uh some progress but i think he's in a
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:25.560]  much better position now you know being in the senate makes a difference i think
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.920]  the freedom movement is much further along i think the failure
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.680]  of our economic and foreign policy system is in shambles
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:36.680]  so i think he's in a much better position now to
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:41.080]  play an instrumental role you know in uh whatever he does whether it's in the
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:45.480]  senate or how well he does in the presidential election and most people
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:49.240]  are assuming that's probably uh you know what he'll do
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:53.960]  i'm sure he hasn't made a final decision even though he hasn't discouraged the
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.160]  discussion about whether or not he might run
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.680]  well he has just really made us all proud and i'm so glad i backed him
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.120]  he's turned even better than i imagined it's hard to be a
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:08.120]  you know a total clone off the old block but i tell you he really is a statesman
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.160]  and god bless you dr paul look forward to speaking to you again soon
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.320]  very good talk to you soon all right take care wow there goes former congressman
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.080]  ron paul and that is very exciting and i'll be on his tv radio show
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:24.520]  on monday for folks that want to tune into that and that's at the ron paul
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:29.000]  channel dot com and i tell you collectivist
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.320]  everywhere hate that person hate that man that you just heard on air
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.280]  and i got to tell you i'm a little bit proud of the fact that i personally
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:39.880]  twisted arms behind the scenes and ron paul's even said this on the show
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:42.520]  i could get ron paul on the show but he goes through a lot of flak with the
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.960]  republicans and the establishment last time he was on he called up and said i
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:48.600]  want to come on your show i haven't talked to him in probably six months i need
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:52.040]  to call him up privately and talk to him and uh because it's good to have
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:54.760]  controversy i think it'd probably be good for him to come on and have msnbc
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:58.120]  attacking for coming on here you go on that crazy person show yeah the guy
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:02.200]  that said the nsa was spying on us 15 years ago or the guy that said they
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:04.200]  were preparing for war with the american people
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:08.120]  i mean yeah i act crazy a lot folks because i'm an angry real person
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:11.560]  and i mean i think we should be acting quote crazy about being raped
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.960]  having our liberties pillaged financially abused having a bunch of marxists
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.120]  and communists and socialists and fascists running rampant all over the
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.280]  place i'm upset we've got our calm stately ron paul
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:27.240]  we've got the state statesmen's like ted cruz and
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:31.880]  ron paul but we need some firebrands and believe me this isn't an act
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:36.680]  i am like this but i fit in and regardless of what color you are
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:40.520]  how old you are where you're from male female catholic christian

[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:07.560]  at first when i first heard about you i'm just my i'm a first-time caller but
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:11.640]  um i heard about you about a year ago from a friend of mine and i
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:14.840]  i decided to check you out i've been let's throw it up on a little bit of rush
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:17.880]  limbaugh a little bit of glimb back and others and uh
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.280]  it was a savage nation but uh i listened to your show i'm a truck driver i
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.720]  drive up and down these highways i do in-hall delivery uh
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:30.600]  out of the high point north carolina um and uh just want to let you know man i'm
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.760]  out here i'll let these customers know about you i've done my research uh
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.240]  outside of god i believe in you brother i believe in your calls i i believed it
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:43.720]  for 10 years myself before i found you which is kind of like a blessing in my
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.040]  life because you opened up a whole new perspective on things that i had
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:51.400]  overlooked because i was also done down with this
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.840]  mainstream media and society and uh
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.280]  after opening up everything and kind of just revealing your pandora's box and
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.960]  what was going on um i see it was the truth and uh
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.040]  i think the hardest thing for me is trying to go to my family members um
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:10.280]  god it seems like they're the ones that don't want to believe in it oh listen
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:14.840]  brother i know the feeling i'll be around family members and people that
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:17.960]  aren't really listeners and they're nice folks and
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.680]  they're somewhat away compared to the average person but you almost feel like
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:27.000]  you're doing bad things to tell them about bad stuff that's happening
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.760]  it's almost like impolite but we don't have a future if we don't
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.760]  we owe it to them to admit just how bad things are
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:38.280]  because again as good people or as just folks that aren't
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:44.600]  overtly evil none of us are perfect we are blind to just how bad bad people
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:49.240]  are and that it's limitless what they'll do
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:52.280]  so i i totally understand what you're saying and
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.600]  what you're getting at and that's why i personally i don't really beat family
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:00.840]  over the head with this info if they don't already you know what's going on
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:04.680]  i reach out to folks just randomly everywhere and and and tell them what's
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:06.440]  happening and it's certainly working there is an
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:10.040]  undoubted awakening happening and ron paul concurs i think for the first time
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:13.240]  ever he said we're getting close to it turning the tide or close to a tipping
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:16.840]  point he now thinks we're right there and i agree
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:19.160]  with dr paul who's a pretty smart cookie show
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.120]  uh what else does you want to throw out there jody i appreciate you
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.720]  promoting the show to folks because that's how we're going to expose these
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.960]  people absolutely sir i agree 100 i just want to let
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.440]  you know also that i go to customers homes every day i deal with
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:40.280]  uh 40 50 customers every trip i'm all over this country all 48 states so i get
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:43.400]  to see a lot of these things you're talking about as i'm doing my travels
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:47.080]  here um and i have noticed how you know
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:50.520]  things are changing i've been looking out for the armored vehicles the things
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:53.480]  like out the sheriff's departments and things i go through dallas i lived in
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:57.720]  dallas for three years man i love texas if i ever retire
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.240]  told my wife that's where i want to live at would love to live right next door to
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:04.040]  you uh man you're like my biggest hero but
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:08.760]  anyway outside of that stuff um i just want to say uh
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:14.040]  now i i maybe you could tell me how i could convince uh my wife who's an
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:20.040]  intelligent woman 4.0 gpa graduated um high honors um she's in the medical field
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:25.240]  i do science research study on uh like the first uh stage one phase one of
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:29.800]  now i get it she's a smart lady i mean uh yeah what should i convince her of
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.240]  uh well i just wanted to know if you had 30 seconds
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:36.840]  to tell my wife or to try to convince my wife
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.440]  of what's going on in our country today and to really wake up
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:44.360]  and be a part of my team and the info war team
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:48.680]  the team is driving for the truth in the right direction what would you say
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:51.800]  all right well i appreciate your call let me just say this to your wife jody
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:58.360]  thank you jody i can't make her do research on the topics
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:02.600]  we're covering and i noticed a lot of professionals that are really smart
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:06.040]  are some of the hardest people to wake up to this because they know there's
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.720]  problems in society but they see it as almost positive
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:12.920]  that they overlook all that and just move forward
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:16.120]  and take care of business as elvis pressley would say
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:19.080]  and you certainly have to take care of business and you can't let
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.760]  all this tyranny get you down and stop you from living a life
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:26.680]  but you've got to understand historically when corruption builds to
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:30.840]  this level it brings down civilizations and horrible tragedies happen
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.040]  and tyranny is a norm in history not an exception
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:37.640]  and we've got a really bad batch of tyranny
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:41.880]  cooking up in the kitchen and it needs to be thrown out
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:47.640]  and so i understand statistically that husbands and wives don't listen to each
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.440]  other as much as they'd listen to a random salesman at the door
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.440]  and so i guess i'm a random salesman at the door
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:02.520]  selling freedom and i would just say to jody's wife that
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:06.600]  there's so much admitted evil by the criminals that hide in government major
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:09.640]  corporations that if i tried to just list a few
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.520]  things it would make my head spin i mean there's
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.160]  thousands of declassified i use this a lot because everybody knows this
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:21.720]  lethal studies that were killing people carried out by our government right
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.880]  through the last decade from the 30s
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.320]  and no one ever got in trouble for any of it and that's because there's a
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:35.080]  eugenicist-based power structure hiding within western governments
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:39.480]  hitler was only one eruption of that that went too far for even the
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.000]  establishment and so i understand that this stuff
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.080]  scary and and it's easy to to just deny it but
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:54.040]  i'll assure you that it is real and that i am actually wrong about a lot of
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:56.920]  this it's worse than i normally have thought
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:02.440]  so so it's not that i'm exaggerating it's the other way around
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:09.880]  and i wish every day i was wrong ma'am i wish every day this wasn't true but
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:14.200]  i have the textbooks i have the documents i keep plugging this every day just
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.160]  because it's been on my desk the last few months i need to put it back on the
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:21.320]  bookshelf eco science it's free online it's been scanned online about how they
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:25.320]  put stuff in the water to reduce our IQ and sterilizes
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:28.280]  the white house regulations are currently talks about
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:31.000]  you know dumbing us down and breaking us up and having us fight with each
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:34.920]  other i mean these are social engineers and you ignore
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:38.360]  all of this at your own peril
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:44.360]  dan bonjino the secret service agent senior agent over obama's foreign
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:46.760]  trips
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:51.240]  basically has said it's worse than anyone knows he had a sign agreement
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:57.640]  not to talk about it obviously uh and it is last night
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:02.120]  i talked to a secret service connection
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.480]  it doesn't matter it's just see i don't even want to get into this it's just
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:15.000]  so crazy i just i mean there's a lot of stuff going on
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.360]  there's a cult stuff going on and we're in trouble i mean that's all i can
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.120]  say and i man i i i know you probably feel like well what
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:28.760]  can you do about it so why not just deny it and so fine just deny it
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:32.840]  but down the road when things get so bad you can't deny it anymore
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.240]  then at least get your heart right with god i said i take a lot of calls i just
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:40.760]  spent six seven minutes seven minutes on that one subject
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:45.080]  or longer let's go to wezzly real fast in mississippi go ahead
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:49.480]  hey alex um i want to say that the new coliseum and the nation i died are
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:52.920]  amazing i love the coffee i'm actually drinking some right now
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:57.320]  and to jody if your wife doesn't believe this stuff it's because she hasn't
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.440]  taken the time to look into this stuff that's the only way you can
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:03.720]  come to that conclusion if you take 30 minutes to look into this stuff
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.880]  research neural order research luminati research all this conspiracy and
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:11.480]  there's no way you can come away from it without realizing it's the truth
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:14.760]  and i want to commend you alex for because there's so many christians that
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:18.120]  are blind to this evil and yeah i know you don't like to accept the
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:22.200]  praise and everything but at least i mean i can't i'm surprised you mentioned
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.640]  stuff like the nephalum and the book of enok and this stuff because that's what
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.800]  this stuff is that's what kurs will and hugate hugo
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:32.120]  the garras that's what they're all talking about when they're talking about
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.440]  hybrid hybridization and transhumanism and a singularity they're all trying to
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:41.400]  come to they're talking about the same stuff that happened in the days of noah
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:44.840]  exactly what it is because that's what jesus said the days of noah
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:48.360]  that's what's going to be like when the end times come when history term will be
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:51.240]  is like it wasn't a day to know what what was going on in the days of noah
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:56.040]  well the sons of god were coming down and having sex or trans you know
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.560]  genetically modifying human beings to create giants which
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:03.320]  no church will ever talk about the giants no church ever explains why
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:08.520]  goliath was you know of not being tall a log of a shrine with 18 foot feet tall
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:12.120]  on amos they say the amorites were you know the tall
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.560]  no i know and that's actually what they all but the occultists now even mainline
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.800]  literature believes the anunnaki all this if i don't get into it but the elite
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:23.320]  and i don't cover stuff i can't prove but you see the movie prometheus
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.800]  that's an anunnaki nine foot tall guy that's what they're telling us we came
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:31.400]  from and uh the bible says no that's who came
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:35.160]  here to manipulate us and that's basically you know the fallen angels and i
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.400]  don't get into all that because the media picks up on it
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:41.000]  i just cover you look at why they're doing all this engineering why they're
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  saying they're god the elite are into this
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:48.600]  themselves what's that term that they say we were seated by aliens
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:51.960]  that's like harvard even believes in mit and transpermia
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.760]  what's what's that term what is it pan spermia yeah that's
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:00.600]  that's in the piece i did with erin didix it's excellent uh on secrets of
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:04.280]  prometheus leaked good to hear from you sir again whether that's real or not
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:08.360]  that's what they think okay sculling bones all of it and they think they're in
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:12.120]  touch with these entities that's what demon conjuring and all
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:15.080]  that stuff is folks that every culture gets into
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:18.920]  and the demons say take your kid up on a pyramid and chop their heart out
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:23.480]  every culture went to kill their kids so these creatures would give them power i
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:28.440]  don't know if that's real or not but as a sociologist as an anthropologist as
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:32.520]  an archaeologist as a lay researcher i i look at this and go why does every
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:36.440]  culture do this well they tell you why in the movie prometheus
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:42.680]  which is a religious tract promoting by the transhumanist that of course they
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:45.240]  don't think it's evolution and all this Darwin stuff
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.680]  that we came from this
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:54.440]  and and then and then some bad gods are going to come back and destroy the
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:56.920]  earth because they'd mix their genetics with us and they
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:59.880]  didn't like that but the good alien stopped it all
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.320]  i mean they're just telling you the story of the devil and the snake
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:07.080]  and all of it in that movie super heavy folks
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.320]  super heavy i don't know if any of this is real
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:16.120]  i know the federal reserves private and they tell me it's governmental
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:21.080]  by the way he mentioned it look i got to fund my operation
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:25.080]  i need fuel it's expensive to build an operation like this and we need capital
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:28.760]  in case we get sued or attacked to defend ourselves and you've done that
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:31.880]  so we can expand in the face of the new world order fearlessly thank you for
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:35.160]  your prayers i my favorite brand of coffee took
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:37.400]  me years to find out how to get it directly from the farmers
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:41.160]  we put it out everybody that tries it loves it it's a medium
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:47.480]  roast high mountain arabica shade grown and it's even
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:50.360]  better than guatemalan guatemalan been my favorite go over the board of the
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.240]  mexicans even better they think because the soils aren't played out
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:58.600]  and it's grown totally organically in fourslife.com for our two different
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.280]  patriot blends including the one with mushrooms for immune boost
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:06.920]  it's very fairly priced for a pound of this lightly or medium roast coffee
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:09.480]  we've got it without the mushrooms and with the mushrooms
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:13.000]  it's excellent most of the coffee gives me headaches or heartburn
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.320]  that's the reason i like this it doesn't give me headaches or heartburn
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:18.920]  i don't know why it's my favorite coffee i never thought about putting out
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:21.160]  coffee until my wife like five years ago said
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:25.000]  you should put up wake up america coffee and say jones for it
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:29.640]  and then i'm actually tracked down how to get it and did it
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:34.520]  that helps support our operation the survival shield nasa and iodine we have
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:37.960]  plenty of that in supply and you can give it as gifts to your

[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:02.600]  dillard's you'd pay a hundred dollars for a golf shirt like this
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.520]  so it's it's it's premium designer made in america

[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:43.800]  that much compared to what designer stuff is in fact they're about half off
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:46.920]  even with the price they are now but my main mission of putting this down
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:52.040]  is to take back the culture too i'm seeing so many pro gun t-shirts around
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.840]  austin including our t-shirts i went to a megadeth concert

[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.080]  and changing of the climate with the patents adding the jet fuel so even the
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:18.040]  airline don't even know what's going on in most cases
[02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:22.040]  they have all these so-called experts all over the news promoting geoengineering
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:25.080]  and children's textbooks that we've been showing you for a decade
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:28.200]  under federal curricula there's literally scores of them teach
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:31.400]  oh we added to jet fuel barium salt limbo oxide
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:34.840]  to put up sunscreen to protect us from global warming you can look that up
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:41.080]  textbooks teach kids about chemtrailing so there's a giant last time i checked
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:44.600]  five billion dollars a year just department of energy with one group
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:49.320]  and then look Stephen Colbert Colbert government likely covering up chemtrail
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:54.120]  conspiracy so they have an expert on their quote saying we need to geoengineer
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.440]  to save the earth because of climate change
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:01.480]  and then Colbert goes what if the government is already doing this and
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:06.120]  not telling us about it but still it's all in the context of a joke
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:10.120]  just like oh what if the NSA is really spying on us 15 years ago and i'm like
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:17.080]  here's the documents here oh shut up i mean it's absolute but people go i don't
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:20.440]  see any documents on chemtrails because they're not called chemtrails it's
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:24.600]  called geoengineering programs high altitude aerosol programs stuff
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:26.920]  like that you type that in you'll get it all
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:30.440]  patents how they do it where they're doing it and then these within all these
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:33.160]  cooks point up at regular condensation trails and go
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:37.480]  look that's it it's so so there's also disinfo on the other side but
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:42.600]  it's going on boys and girls you know when i was a kid condensation trails went
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:45.160]  away in seconds or minutes they didn't stay there for hours and
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.560]  during the sky gray look at this and it goes on the videos up on info wars.com
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:51.880]  we'll probably cover this on the nightly news tonight
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:55.480]  that's pretty darn important that's an info wars.com

[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:49.000]  same-sex cake for a gay couple well those people have a right to not shop
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:53.400]  there um and and i haven't heard about this is this in the news yet
