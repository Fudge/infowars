[00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.470]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.230]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.991]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.571]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.132]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:17.313]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:21.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.967]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, gold is up at $900 an ounce right now as we speak on this 22nd day of September 2008.
[00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:57.172]  The stock market is down right now as they await the, quote, bailout.
[00:00:57.172 --> 00:01:06.600]  And now the bailout is not the bailout, it is the cancer in the heart of the country preparing to send out its spores.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.721]  Metastasizing.
[00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:13.055]  This is the metastasization of the New World Order.
[00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:29.724]  You're about to see the birth of the New World Order out of chaos, out of pain, out of all of you in the Western world having your entire future pledged as chattel property of the International Crime Syndicate.
[00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:36.074]  That is the bottom line, and even a lot of mainstream media sources are having to admit that.
[00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:38.456]  This is a massive bank robbery.
[00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:45.139]  This is not a bailout, as the people have been told.
[00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:50.382]  Meanwhile, we've got lots of propaganda out of Israel and the United States about Iran having nuclear weapons.
[00:01:50.382 --> 00:01:56.985]  They're now back to their old tricks, completely lying, saying they've got to be struck.
[00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:58.566]  And don't think they won't hit Iran.
[00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:10.206]  I mean, I don't know if it's going to happen, but the point is these people fly planes into buildings and blame it on imaginary enemies to take liberties and freedoms and launch wars and grab oil and no-bid weapons contracts.
[00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:17.228]  They implode economies and suck pension funds dry in the government and private industry.
[00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:18.788]  They are bold.
[00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:23.749]  If the New World Order is anything, it is bold beyond imagination.
[00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.770]  Just hubris on top of hubris stacked on top of arrogant
[00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:35.344]  Wicked desire to feed on populations.
[00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:36.965]  We do have some guests coming up later in the show.
[00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:40.586]  I'll tell you about that after the break.
[00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.807]  But some of the news that we have here.
[00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:45.787]  Fury at U.S.
[00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:55.350]  Lehman Brothers staff who could get more than three million dollars in bonuses as UK employees face bleak failure.
[00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.171]  Well, that's how it works.
[00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:05.902]  You see, we pay the bankers everything, and then they turn loose army brigades on us.
[00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:06.782]  That's how it works.
[00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:09.163]  We bail them out, i.e.
[00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:16.547]  give them everything we've got and become their chattel slaves on paper, and then they take our houses.
[00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:26.072]  And then, if you can't pay the taxes to them, they take your houses, and they send in army brigades to make sure you pay them.
[00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:30.924]  And if you don't know what the brigades are, they're the federalized local police.
[00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:35.405]  They are federal, just as the Capitol building is federal.
[00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:40.408]  Just as the Federal Reserve is not federal.
[00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:51.892]  And so, uh, but forget your militarized local police, the local fluoride roidheads, a mixture of fluoride and steroids, lobotomized death zombies.
[00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:53.093]  I'm not talking about them.
[00:03:53.866 --> 00:04:05.492]  Here in zombie world, the prison planet peopled by zombies that watch TV eight hours a day, I'm talking about regular army brigades.
[00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:18.619]  And we're so conditioned to it that even InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com just posted the Army Times and a few other articles last week where they calmly announced, yeah, they're going to be there to fight the American people.
[00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:19.979]  It's just mentioned there.
[00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.420]  Oh, you know, we hope we don't have to shoot you.
[00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:29.447]  It's for civil unrest, the regular army brigades, and then even this show.
[00:04:29.447 --> 00:04:32.729]  I mean, I make a big deal about it on the radio, but we don't even write articles about it.
[00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.810]  It's kind of like, ah, you know, foregone conclusion.
[00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.673]  Yeah, you know, economic Armageddon is unfolding.
[00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:46.776]  And yeah, you know, they're going to turn the regular army loose on us, full of gang members and illegal aliens and felons.
[00:04:46.776 --> 00:04:49.058]  And yeah, you know, it's...
[00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:55.537]  There's about a hundred articles today admitting that five times increase in brain tumors with cell phones, but we don't care.
[00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:57.518]  We'll hand them all out to our kids.
[00:04:57.518 --> 00:05:00.781]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:02.982]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:05.344]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:07.566]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:09.167]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:10.888]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:13.790]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.493]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO?
[00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:31.869]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:43.262]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:43.262 --> 00:05:45.584]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:04.183]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:06.505]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.809]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:16.698]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:18.801]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:22.582]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:27.382]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:31.303]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.912]  Here is why.
[00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:23.835]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.078]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:29.220]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.202]  this fall?
[00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:31.022]  Don't wait.

[00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.254]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.591]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:43.377]  Thank you for joining us today on this 22nd of September 2008.
[00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:57.025]  Coming up in two and a half hours, Professor Roger Masters of Dartmouth will be joining us to get in to some very important information.
[00:08:57.025 --> 00:08:59.467]  I'll just leave it at that and tell that information
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.542]  When he joins us coming up later.
[00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:23.457]  In the meantime, let me give you a preview of some of the news we have in front of us today as the New World Order instigated global crises, both military, economic, and social, as they turned the heat up to boil off what's left of freedom.
[00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:33.468]  And to solidify the toxic brew known as the New World Order Technological Control Grid, enslavement system.
[00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:36.589]  Pakistani troops fire on intruding U.S.
[00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:40.249]  helicopters for the second time in several weeks.
[00:09:40.249 --> 00:09:41.310]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.190]  Pakistan troops fired on two U.S.
[00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:51.692]  helicopters that intruded into Pakistani territory last night, forcing them to turn back to Afghanistan, a senior Pakistani security official said on Monday.
[00:09:53.146 --> 00:10:04.130]  So that's regular Pakistani troops that are in control of the US-transferred nukes.
[00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:22.217]  Now, England, the United States, and Israel, in order of culpability, according to Jane's Weapons Quarterly and many others, and what's admitted by our own media, England, the United States, and then Israel, gave the nuclear weapons
[00:10:23.627 --> 00:10:26.628]  Oh, not just atomic, hydrogen as well.
[00:10:26.628 --> 00:10:28.328]  Thermonuclear.
[00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:50.454]  To them, and then they also help them through the Chinese, Clinton, Laurel, Hughes, and others to the Chinese, and then to the Pakistanis, with the blessing of the United States, continuing with George Bush in 2001, to give nuclear weapons, and they reportedly have upwards of 20 of them.
[00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:57.575]  Warheads menacing India and surrounding neighbors.
[00:10:57.575 --> 00:11:07.641]  And meanwhile their troops, every time US forces come into the country, shoot at the helicopters.
[00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:15.225]  And the United States has been launching rocket and bomb attacks into several different regions of Pakistan.
[00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:16.646]  Now, that's going on.
[00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:38.074]  You have the United States, a month and a half ago, through its proxy, backed up by NATO and Israel, 1,000 Israeli troops, according to the Jerusalem Post, in Haraz, launching a sneak attack on the Russian-held enclaves of South Ossetia and the gorge leading into Abkhazia.
[00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:50.010]  The average zombie yuppie stumbling around thinks that Russia launched a sneak attack and falls down before Sarah Palin when she talks about how war with Russia may be needed.
[00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:55.253]  That is a quote by the beauty queen.
[00:11:55.253 --> 00:11:58.956]  Barack Obama basically says the same thing.
[00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.957]  God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:06.241]  We are going to hell in a handbasket is the only way to describe it.
[00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:10.104]  Pakistani troops fire on intruding US helicopters.
[00:12:13.203 --> 00:12:21.770]  So, a country with nuclear weapons that finally threw out the U.S.-backed dictator, and God knows who's running things over there.
[00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.453]  I can't even nail that down right now.
[00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:24.753]  U.S.
[00:12:24.753 --> 00:12:35.722]  troops are basically in control of the perimeter in a Mexican standoff at two different Pakistani bases where the nuclear missile silos are based.
[00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:40.526]  And of course, the jets that can carry the bombs upwards of 2,000 miles.
[00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:45.571]  Pakistani troops fired on two U.S.
[00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:52.238]  helicopters that intruded into Pakistan territory on Sunday night, forcing them to turn back in Afghanistan, a senior Pakistan security official said on Monday.
[00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:59.746]  The helicopters violated the border area of Lowarta, Mandi, 80 kilometers west of
[00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:15.039]  Miran Ashar, the main town in the North Tribal Region, at around 9pm on Sunday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, because of the severity, sensitivity of the subject.
[00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.820]  There was no official confirmation.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:24.045]  We don't have any information on border violation by American helicopters, Major Murad Khan, military spokesman, said.
[00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:28.148]  Relations between the two allies became frayed earlier this month, after U.S.
[00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:31.370]  commandos raided a border village of South
[00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:36.331]  Waziristan and killed 20 people including women and children.
[00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:45.037]  On September 3rd, Pakistanis were outraged by the incursion and the six-month-old civilian government issued a diplomatic protest.
[00:13:45.037 --> 00:13:46.999]  It was the first overt incursion by U.S.
[00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:47.999]  ground troops.
[00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:49.481]  Pakistan territory through the U.S.
[00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:53.183]  military has conducted numerous missile strikes against Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.866]  Please, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:56.866 --> 00:13:59.987]  I mean, against the Easter Bunny and Popeye the Sailor Man.
[00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:06.490]  They launched numerous missile strikes against Popeye the Sailor Man and Taliban targets in Pakistan tribal lands.
[00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.690]  Pakistani troops fired on two U.S.
[00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:21.656]  helicopters that crossed the border at the same village, Angor added, a week ago, again forcing them to turn back, according to residents and security officers, through both Pakistan and U.S.
[00:14:21.656 --> 00:14:24.437]  officials issued denials.
[00:14:24.437 --> 00:14:24.857]  Oh, God.
[00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:32.380]  They deny everything that's admitted and true in public, and then they make up stuff about Popeye the Al Qaeda man.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:44.386]  Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is due to meet President George W. Bush on Tuesday in the United States.
[00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:45.847]  Heaven help us.
[00:14:45.847 --> 00:14:52.550]  Now, remember where the hijackers' funding came from.
[00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.771]  They came out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:54.321 --> 00:15:00.885]  Who always matches money with Pakistani Intelligence ISI, who's been MI6 for close to a century.
[00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:02.667]  That's just mainline history.
[00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:06.429]  British Intelligence fraud.
[00:15:06.429 --> 00:15:13.254]  And then... They wire $100,000 to Muhammad Ali in one payment alone.
[00:15:13.254 --> 00:15:22.840]  You've got the head of Pakistani Intelligence, in the second trip of his tenure to the United States, the week before 9-11, in the morning of 9-11, he's meeting with Porter Goss and
[00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:37.330]  Senator Graham in a high security area of the Capitol for a national security meeting at the highest levels of security.
[00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.070]  You've got all those connections to 9-11.
[00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.411]  You've got Mossad crawling all over it.
[00:15:41.411 --> 00:15:42.892]  You've got the hijackers or U.S.
[00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:44.833]  government agents, no doubt, training U.S.
[00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.214]  military bases with high security clearances.
[00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:48.615]  That's all mainstream, by the way.
[00:15:49.306 --> 00:15:52.008]  Don't roll your eyes out there, police, and others.
[00:15:52.008 --> 00:15:55.330]  You know, we told you Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would go under eight years ago.
[00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.173]  You know, we break it all down here.
[00:15:59.173 --> 00:16:00.734]  We're talking about reality.
[00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:15.765]  Associated Press, Pensacola News Journal, MSNBC, San Jose Mercury News, Toronto Star, BBC, all admitting that the hijackers were U.S.
[00:16:15.765 --> 00:16:16.486]  government agents.
[00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:21.633]  That came out in the first few weeks and those stories got shut down.
[00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:27.596]  You understand laughing and giggling about this only means the tyranny is going to win and that hurts us all.
[00:16:27.596 --> 00:16:30.217]  You can't live in denial anymore.
[00:16:30.217 --> 00:16:36.420]  Confusing television and your make-believe world of eight hours of TV watching a day with reality.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.881]  You can't choose what reality is.
[00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:40.422]  That's delusional.
[00:16:40.422 --> 00:16:42.963]  Perception isn't reality as Madison Avenue says.
[00:16:43.812 --> 00:16:50.216]  Perception is reality for jackasses that don't count and don't matter and aren't history's actors.
[00:16:50.216 --> 00:16:54.979]  And that's why the establishment laughs at you, because you believe a false paradigm.
[00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:59.821]  Not just a tainted view of the world, and a distorted view of the world.
[00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:01.582]  All views are distorted.
[00:17:01.582 --> 00:17:02.943]  Limited perspectives.
[00:17:02.943 --> 00:17:05.885]  But you are in a completely false paradigm.
[00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:11.848]  And you enjoy going through life being... being idiots, being schmucks.
[00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:12.729]  I mean, is that fun?
[00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.272]  I mean, do you like being conned and being suckers?
[00:17:17.272 --> 00:17:18.473]  Is that funny?
[00:17:18.473 --> 00:17:27.059]  And then giggling and laughing about being suckers, self-assuredly, with that, you-know-what-eating grin on your faces?
[00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:35.444]  You know, you look at fools and people that have been conned and manipulated, they lie to themselves, and they always have that self-assured, giggling smirk on their faces.
[00:17:35.444 --> 00:17:37.685]  Hey, wipe it off your face, okay?
[00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:40.607]  It's enough that we basically already have no economic future.
[00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:41.708]  Now it could be World War III.
[00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:44.663]  And you laughing about it doesn't make it better.
[00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:47.867]  It makes it worse.
[00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:53.052]  And even though you're stupid and like to be a slave, it doesn't mean I want you to be hurt.
[00:17:53.052 --> 00:17:54.493]  Because we're all in this together.
[00:17:54.493 --> 00:18:00.619]  And if I'm going to be free and have any liberty or any future, you're going to have to have it too, jackass!
[00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:03.102]  That's why I'm angry with you.
[00:18:03.102 --> 00:18:04.864]  This isn't a game, okay?
[00:18:04.864 --> 00:18:06.025]  This isn't a game!
[00:18:07.802 --> 00:18:15.125]  They got 36 level 4 bioweapons labs in this country now with level 2 security.
[00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:16.206]  That isn't a joke.
[00:18:16.206 --> 00:18:17.626]  That'll kill you and your whole family.
[00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:22.468]  Instead of getting the flu or a cold, you flop over and die in 24 hours.
[00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.329]  Does that sound fun to you?
[00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:26.630]  Does dying sound fun to you jackasses?
[00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.792]  Excuse me, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:35.954]  How did we get psychopathic eugenics killers in control of the western governments orchestrating World War 3?
[00:18:36.972 --> 00:18:38.473]  How did it happen?
[00:18:38.473 --> 00:18:45.036]  Now sucking every financial system dry.
[00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:48.778]  And we're signing the bill.
[00:18:48.778 --> 00:18:52.119]  The point is, Pakistan's brimming with nukes.
[00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:57.582]  On the edge of civil war, God knows what globalist intelligence operations are doing.
[00:18:57.582 --> 00:19:00.103]  No doubt they're in control of the situation over there.
[00:19:00.103 --> 00:19:03.285]  They're creating a crises.
[00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:06.066]  You've got them starting wars with the Russians, kicking that off.
[00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:20.832]  The economy's imploding, the dollar is dying right now in front of us, the Pakistani troops are shooting at US forces on every other day that we know of, and then meanwhile this is what we get from the news.
[00:19:20.832 --> 00:19:30.559]  You see, you have to understand a wider reach of news and information, have a background and research all these issues to then know when the AP reports a plane crashed and
[00:19:33.684 --> 00:19:41.529]  Some rock band barely lived, you know that really happened, because there's witnesses, there's TV cameras, you can verify it from other local sources.
[00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:49.154]  But then you know when the mainstream media is distorting with a deceptive headline, and we're going to cover that when we get back.
[00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:52.136]  Chief Inspector, Iran may be hiding secret nukes.
[00:19:52.136 --> 00:19:52.877]  We'll cover that.
[00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:54.378]  Listen to that deceptive headline.
[00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:56.499]  You see that headline every few days.
[00:19:56.499 --> 00:19:57.780]  May have secret nukes.
[00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:05.858]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:07.999]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:13.381]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:17.822]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free-energy device.
[00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:22.604]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[00:20:23.784 --> 00:20:27.786]  Also called Browns Gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[00:20:27.786 --> 00:20:31.027]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:34.349]  This is the secret the oil and auto industry doesn't want you to know.
[00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:39.651]  Go to GasFreedom.info to learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car.
[00:20:39.651 --> 00:20:45.194]  During the month of August, visit GasFreedom.info and receive $100 off of your order.
[00:20:45.194 --> 00:20:47.915]  Turn any car into a hybrid and laugh all the way to the bank.
[00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:48.656]  We're good.
[00:21:01.017 --> 00:21:05.121]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.121 --> 00:21:17.831]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:18.291]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:23.816]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.256 --> 00:21:27.239]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:29.441]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:32.404]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.404 --> 00:21:38.850]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.273]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.273 --> 00:21:48.639]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.179 --> 00:21:53.302]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.302 --> 00:21:56.263]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.263 --> 00:21:56.764]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.764 --> 00:22:07.650]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.291]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:11.832]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:11.832 --> 00:22:12.813]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:12.813 --> 00:22:13.533]  This is his MO.
[00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:14.994]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.994 --> 00:22:16.555]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.995 --> 00:22:24.139]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:24.619]  Some U.S.
[00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:30.983]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.983 --> 00:22:34.425]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:34.665 --> 00:22:44.947]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:46.187]  Fabled enemies.
[00:22:46.187 --> 00:22:53.709]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:57.290]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:05.146]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:12.991]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:16.733]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:20.916]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:26.220]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker, available as a wallet or passport case.
[00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:29.664]  We're good to go.
[00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.788]  Dixie!
[00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:20.379]  Man, that is hella stiff!
[00:24:57.278 --> 00:25:02.141]  You know, sometimes... Now, first he's in the back.
[00:25:02.141 --> 00:25:05.103]  Not even the chief of police.
[00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:35.564]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:35.564 --> 00:25:36.510]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:47.234]  Look, I'm going to get into all the economic news, but I think you are pretty well informed.
[00:25:47.234 --> 00:26:06.088]  Our general audience, the know-it-all establishment liberals and conservatives are laughing, sucking their thumbs, saying there's no North American Union, saying there's no government corruption, saying there's no gun control, saying there's no amnesty, saying there's no open borders, saying they can trust everything the government says and the media.
[00:26:06.088 --> 00:26:10.471]  But they are becoming the minority, and that is the good news.
[00:26:11.218 --> 00:26:19.700]  But they do people and command much of the mid-level petty power positions of the New World Order system.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.761]  Look, my whole point is this.
[00:26:20.761 --> 00:26:28.343]  You've got Pakistan completely corrupt, completely run by Western intelligence, and what does Western intelligence do when they've got control of something?
[00:26:28.343 --> 00:26:33.064]  What does the U.S., England, and Israel do when they've got control of a country?
[00:26:33.064 --> 00:26:34.425]  What do they do?
[00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:39.006]  They just hand them nuclear weapons, put the most violent factions in control,
[00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.236]  Uh, and then now there's some type of mafia war going on between the U.S.
[00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:58.211]  and Pakistan while the United States controls the airfields with the nukes, with the Pakistani troops inside the airfields sitting on the nukes, with special forces outside of them.
[00:26:58.211 --> 00:26:59.152]  I mean, this isn't funny.
[00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:00.806]  Okay?
[00:27:00.806 --> 00:27:05.170]  That's a real national security threat right there, which is exactly what the New World Order does.
[00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.975]  They go around stirring up crises so they can scare the daylights out of everybody.
[00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:11.817]  Oh, we've got a world financial crisis.
[00:27:11.817 --> 00:27:16.361]  We need a world government and a New World Order financial system.
[00:27:16.361 --> 00:27:19.224]  We need the world financial banks to run things.
[00:27:19.224 --> 00:27:21.306]  If they had total control, this wouldn't happen.
[00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:22.147]  Well, they're the ones that did it.
[00:27:23.078 --> 00:27:28.480]  We need a world government to regulate different bioweapon components because they're spreading.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.621]  Meanwhile, who's spreading it?
[00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:31.422]  The elements of the global government.
[00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:34.823]  We need to have a world government to stop nuclear weapons proliferation.
[00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:35.904]  Who's proliferating?
[00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:38.525]  The Anglo-American establishment.
[00:27:38.525 --> 00:27:40.886]  The axis of evil.
[00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:49.590]  It's just... I mean, who gave North Korea nukes when he was the chairman of the board of the Swiss company that was given authorization by the
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:57.906]  G7 at the time, now G8, and it was given authorization by the National Security Council.
[00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.427]  With Bill Clinton.
[00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:00.828]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:00.828 --> 00:28:06.532]  And I've said this, it's like in an old 50s movie, where the devil appears out of a poof of smoke.
[00:28:06.532 --> 00:28:13.738]  Anything earth-changing, anything very dangerous that threatens the whole planet, you will always find Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:13.738 --> 00:28:17.301]  In studies to get cell phones approved, saying they wouldn't give you cancer, Rumsfeld.
[00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:20.403]  Getting aspartame approved, that's killed tens of millions, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:21.542 --> 00:28:25.065]  Getting Prozac approved in 1982, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:29.628]  Handing out nukes to North Korea, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:29.628 --> 00:28:33.771]  Helping give nukes to Pakistan, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:38.074]  Helping arm Saddam and setting him up to attack Iran in the early 80s, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:38.074 --> 00:28:39.755]  I mean, Donald Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:28:39.755 --> 00:28:49.182]  Getting the Terminator seeds approved, now spreading into the plant genomes, infecting all sorts of plants of the same species, all sorts of environmental crises, Donald Rumsfeld!
[00:28:49.742 --> 00:28:57.783]  Donald Rumsfeld is a Sith Lord, ladies and gentlemen, to use a popular, uh, you know, pop culture metaphor.
[00:28:57.783 --> 00:29:00.504]  Before the New York Times quotes me, I mean that figuratively.
[00:29:00.504 --> 00:29:10.486]  But, I mean, he might as well wear a black hood and look, you know, out from the darkness of it and say, a new apprentice, young guy, more powerful.
[00:29:10.486 --> 00:29:14.926]  I mean, this guy is pure evil.
[00:29:14.926 --> 00:29:16.227]  I'm telling you.
[00:29:16.227 --> 00:29:18.287]  He is directly plugged into the New World Order.
[00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:22.472]  When that guy was 30-something years old, he was.
[00:29:22.472 --> 00:29:24.873]  It just never ends with this guy.
[00:29:24.873 --> 00:29:27.335]  He is an imperial legate.
[00:29:27.335 --> 00:29:29.437]  What's an imperial legate in the Roman system?
[00:29:29.437 --> 00:29:39.465]  There were usually just a few people, trusted old wise men, who the emperor could send to speak with the power of the emperor to faraway lands or to lead armies.
[00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:47.050]  And Donald Rumsfeld, even more than Cheney, Cheney's his protege, has been the president for the last seven and a half years.
[00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.511]  All right, I'm going to get back into all this.
[00:29:48.511 --> 00:29:48.972]  Stay with me.
[00:29:51.053 --> 00:29:54.975]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.975 --> 00:30:01.358]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.358 --> 00:30:03.519]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:06.440]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.123]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.

[00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:48.250]  Counting on the people to wake up and take action and resist the New World Order.
[00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:08.699]  All right, here we go, into the news.
[00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:17.567]  Chief Inspector, Iran may be hiding secret nukes.
[00:34:17.567 --> 00:34:21.430]  Now, meanwhile, you got Pakistan menacing the United States with nukes.
[00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:23.012]  They can hit Western Europe.
[00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:24.313]  They can hit all over Russia.
[00:34:25.052 --> 00:34:35.639]  That's really what they are, is another floating fortress, another tectonic fortress, another giant aircraft carrier like Israel for the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:40.522]  Israel with 400 plus nukes, ready to nuke, ready to rock and roll.
[00:34:40.522 --> 00:34:44.845]  Crazy members of the Knesset routinely talking about nuking Europe if they want to.
[00:34:44.845 --> 00:34:52.070]  You've got Pakistan running around a floating fortress of the New World Order, a giant aircraft carrier, but that's not a problem.
[00:34:52.788 --> 00:34:54.289]  That's not a problem at all.
[00:34:54.289 --> 00:35:02.595]  No, we've got a lot of the American people, Associated Press, George Wan, and I'm really getting tired of this.
[00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:07.078]  Because I see this every few days, an AP headline, that's similar.
[00:35:07.078 --> 00:35:09.519]  Iran may be hiding secret nukes.
[00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:11.601]  Iran soon to have nukes.
[00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:13.282]  Iran has nukes.
[00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:17.825]  Iran may activate nukes.
[00:35:17.825 --> 00:35:19.186]  Iran may use nukes.
[00:35:19.921 --> 00:35:20.822]  I mean, Google all these.
[00:35:20.822 --> 00:35:24.525]  You will see AP are the biggest liars.
[00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:30.590]  When it comes to the specific news about Iran, people say, well, you keep using AP.
[00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:37.656]  You have to get a large breadth and width of knowledge and then double-check it with local publications, and then you can find out if a story's accurate.
[00:35:37.656 --> 00:35:40.138]  Or you can read three or four stories to get a better picture.
[00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:41.259]  That's analyzing things.
[00:35:44.753 --> 00:35:50.016]  But when it comes to war news, it's generally a bald-faced deception or lie.
[00:35:50.016 --> 00:35:52.458]  Now, this is a simple lie.
[00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:58.262]  This is a simple semantical play on words.
[00:35:58.262 --> 00:35:59.602]  You can catch them doing this.
[00:35:59.602 --> 00:36:00.543]  Newspapers do this.
[00:36:00.543 --> 00:36:01.584]  The TV does this.
[00:36:01.584 --> 00:36:05.166]  Coming up on CNN tonight, Iran about to go nuclear.
[00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:08.368]  Nuclear Iran tonight on Fox.
[00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:10.509]  Chief Inspector.
[00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:12.971]  Iran about to use their hiding nukes.
[00:36:13.906 --> 00:36:28.264]  Iran about to activate secret nukes about to use their secret nukes and you hear about the user secret nukes and then 30 minutes Later into the Fox News piece they say about to activate their nuclear reactors Which by the way are peaceful?
[00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:35.913]  Let's see, for 30 minutes of the person cooking dinner or whatever ended up not paying attention, they said, I ran nukes!
[00:36:35.913 --> 00:36:47.687]  See, it's all designed for people who are mesmerized by TV and a subconscious mindset, which you go into in just a few minutes of watching TV, that's admitted, you go into a dream state, or people who are passively watching.
[00:36:48.067 --> 00:37:04.472]  Passively listening, or in a restaurant, seeing it on the ticker tape, or, or, or, or, so someone parrots it at work, or, or, you hear the earlier part of the newscast where they announce five times, you know, coming up, at the end of the show, Iran, and it's nukes!
[00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.693]  Will they use them?
[00:37:06.693 --> 00:37:11.034]  And then you read, and it's peaceful.
[00:37:11.034 --> 00:37:17.556]  But the headline sounds like, I mean, you read this headline, Chief Inspector, oh, that does it, the Chief Inspector says they've got them!
[00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:22.272]  Iran may be hiding secret nukes!
[00:37:22.272 --> 00:37:23.113]  Oh, that's it!
[00:37:23.113 --> 00:37:23.973]  The secret nukes!
[00:37:23.973 --> 00:37:29.917]  And then the secret nukes... aren't nukes.
[00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:35.080]  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Monday that Iran may be hiding secret nuclear activities.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.941]  See?
[00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:39.323]  Oh, nuclear activities, not nukes.
[00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:44.906]  Comments that appeared to reflect a high level of frustration with stonewalling of its investigators.
[00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:47.568]  Now see, they know people forget what happened five years ago.
[00:37:49.176 --> 00:37:57.923]  You can either take total UN domination, have them in your country, controlling what you can and can't do, or you can be bombed into the Stone Age.
[00:37:57.923 --> 00:37:59.865]  But the Russians, the Chinese are in there.
[00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:01.946]  It's peaceful systems, unlike the U.S.
[00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:11.314]  and others handing out real systems to North Korea and Pakistan and others.
[00:38:11.314 --> 00:38:14.877]  These are type reactors that cannot be used in nuclear weapons production.
[00:38:14.877 --> 00:38:18.600]  They don't get anywhere near the purification of the isotopes they need.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.301]  And Iran has a fraction of the centrifuges they need.
[00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:26.522]  I mean, you don't just hide this stuff in a shed.
[00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:34.624]  Like CNN said when they invaded Iraq in 2003, they said, look, in this shed was a secret nuclear weapons program.
[00:38:34.624 --> 00:38:40.686]  And then under this rosebush was the piece of equipment that made the nuclear bomb.
[00:38:40.686 --> 00:38:40.926]  And then
[00:38:42.498 --> 00:38:48.162]  More credible mainstream news reported a week later, actually, here's a photograph of a factory in Russia and a factory in the U.S.
[00:38:48.162 --> 00:38:53.986]  that produces this part of a nuclear weapon and it's the size of, you know, hundreds of football fields.
[00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:59.250]  But again, you have a public that doesn't know how all of this works, or the scale of it, so you can lie to them.
[00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:05.194]  There's still a lot of people going around saying Saddam had nukes.
[00:39:05.194 --> 00:39:09.257]  They haven't gotten the new download of corporate tyranny propaganda.
[00:39:09.257 --> 00:39:09.837]  Brainwashing.
[00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:19.580]  So, see, maybe hiding secret nuclear facilities because Iran totally let them in, gave them more access than any country ever has to world government.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.060]  They acquiesced to world government.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.321]  They had moderates in that were being pro-U.S.
[00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:30.543]  And the United States said, and the G8 said, well, we don't care if it's totally peaceful and the U.N.
[00:39:30.543 --> 00:39:32.903]  admits it is and Russia's selling you this.
[00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.984]  You're now not allowed to have it.
[00:39:34.984 --> 00:39:38.765]  And Iran said, but we agreed and signed agreements with you to let inspectors in.
[00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:42.872]  For the last decade, we did this, and you promised.
[00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:49.533]  And then the people got real mad, and I ran and swept in Ahmadinejad, who's a lot more rabid and hardcore.
[00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:51.214]  Because what do you expect?
[00:39:51.214 --> 00:39:58.995]  So they signed the agreements, did the deals, bought, spent billions of dollars buying the peaceful systems, and we're told, okay, now you can't have that.
[00:39:58.995 --> 00:40:00.636]  And they said, my God, you're completely treacherous.
[00:40:00.636 --> 00:40:01.956]  And they said, that's right, we are.
[00:40:01.956 --> 00:40:04.276]  And so they said, that's it.
[00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:06.877]  Inspectors, get out of here.
[00:40:06.877 --> 00:40:07.337]  That's it.
[00:40:08.244 --> 00:40:16.493]  And the inspectors have cameras in all their offices and we're going through all the presidential files and doing things our criminal government or Israel would never allow.
[00:40:16.493 --> 00:40:18.876]  Their nuclear program is completely sacred.
[00:40:18.876 --> 00:40:21.279]  They don't have to be under any treaty.
[00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:31.225]  A senior Iranian envoy accused the United States of trying to use the IAEA as a tool in Washington's confrontation with Tehran.
[00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:34.809]  Iran, he said, has demonstrated full cooperation with the agency.
[00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:40.334]  Allegations of nuclear weapons work by Tehran is based on forged documents and the issue is closed, the envoy said.
[00:40:40.334 --> 00:40:47.340]  It's been admitted those were forged by the same folks that brought you forged uranium, yellowcake, Niger documents and aluminum tubes and
[00:40:49.193 --> 00:40:51.674]  Or they would take real, you know, U.S.
[00:40:51.674 --> 00:40:57.016]  moles, deputy head of the Army, it was their mole going back to when they put him in in the 80s, it was a U.S.
[00:40:57.016 --> 00:41:12.881]  operation, so of course they had moles inside the Iraqi government, and they just took all of his reports when he defected, saying no, they have no nuclear programs, abandoned in 1991, and then they just forged it with his signature at the bottom and had it say, huge nuclear program.
[00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:17.402]  They just added that, and then brought it to Congress, and then got caught!
[00:41:18.381 --> 00:41:21.463]  I mean, these people are incredible!
[00:41:21.463 --> 00:41:23.064]  It doesn't matter if they get caught!
[00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:25.945]  The public doesn't even know what getting caught is!
[00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:27.646]  They don't even know what Iraq is!
[00:41:27.646 --> 00:41:33.549]  They just know it's brown people, and it feels tough to watch TV with them dying and dead kids with their arms and legs blown off.
[00:41:33.549 --> 00:41:33.989]  It's fun!
[00:41:33.989 --> 00:41:43.194]  I mean, these guys are all over their websites and military websites bragging about dead kids, laughing, but then YouTube takes down all the video of them killing kids.
[00:41:43.194 --> 00:41:45.235]  Hey, let us see what the good guys do!
[00:41:45.914 --> 00:41:46.354]  No.
[00:41:46.354 --> 00:41:48.816]  I'm not the anti-American, you bastards!
[00:41:48.816 --> 00:41:55.180]  I'm the one that would never let anybody act like that or do that to destroy our name!
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.322]  And by the way, don't you get the trap, you idiots in the military?
[00:41:58.322 --> 00:41:59.423]  And I don't mean the majority of them.
[00:41:59.423 --> 00:42:03.706]  The majority of you are awake, but those sickos that think it's cute and funny to kill little kids.
[00:42:03.706 --> 00:42:06.407]  That was a New World Order trap.
[00:42:06.407 --> 00:42:07.648]  That was a New World Order trap.
[00:42:07.648 --> 00:42:11.751]  This was all meant for the world to see your crimes, you idiots.
[00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:14.973]  That's why the White House released the secret memos about torturing kids.
[00:42:15.848 --> 00:42:18.790]  They want to bring the country down, you see.
[00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.471]  They're bringing the country down.
[00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:24.753]  We, the patriots, are the ones trying to save it!
[00:42:24.753 --> 00:42:33.258]  It's not macho to shoot families driving along in their minivans to church, to the mosque.
[00:42:33.258 --> 00:42:36.500]  It's not funny to shoot little dogs and throw little dogs off cliffs.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.821]  You fools!
[00:42:38.821 --> 00:42:41.623]  The CIA released the Abu Ghraib photos.
[00:42:43.129 --> 00:42:46.524]  They let the army put out the report about the torture.
[00:42:46.524 --> 00:42:48.292]  All part of a sick double game.
[00:42:50.009 --> 00:42:59.013]  And only by admitting it, and only by going deep into it, and only by admitting the horror, but then understanding that it has been done systematically.
[00:42:59.013 --> 00:43:10.598]  If you understood the evil alchemy we're dealing with, the complex psychological operations that are all interwoven, it would stun you, and then you would hit your knees and ask God for forgiveness.
[00:43:10.598 --> 00:43:16.341]  But instead, you just get more satanic tattoos, and you just kneel down to darkness, and you think it's tough.
[00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:28.811]  Well, you're gonna find out when you're crying for mommy, when that cancer they shot you up with, when you hit 44-45, when that stuff's eating you alive, you just remember, tough guy.
[00:43:28.811 --> 00:43:34.075]  I'm sure, you know, some of you out there may kill me or kill other patriots someday or imprison us.
[00:43:34.075 --> 00:43:39.019]  Don't worry, your master's gonna hurt you too.
[00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:43.503]  Because the New World Order hates your guts.
[00:43:43.503 --> 00:43:44.624]  And they're gonna bring you down.
[00:43:45.546 --> 00:43:49.648]  So you just remember that.
[00:43:49.648 --> 00:43:52.570]  You will not escape judgment.
[00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.830]  And I don't mean in the afterlife.
[00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.812]  You will not escape it in this life.
[00:43:57.812 --> 00:44:10.779]  The only way you can escape judgment in this life, and the life after that, is to repent of what you've done and then selflessly sacrifice yourself in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:44:10.779 --> 00:44:12.300]  That is the only way.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.025]  For you to turn it around if you've done these great acts of evil.
[00:44:18.025 --> 00:44:19.566]  People can say, well, there's grace.
[00:44:19.566 --> 00:44:20.668]  Well, absolutely.
[00:44:20.668 --> 00:44:23.391]  But if you have the grace, you're going to fight the evil.
[00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:33.742]  If you're not fighting evil, if you're sucking your thumb in one of these $50 million churches with helicopter pads and swimming pools and shopping malls and RFID scanner chips to get in,
[00:44:35.043 --> 00:44:44.845]  And your church isn't out there feeding the homeless every weekend, and if you're not out there fighting corruption, and if your preacher isn't speaking out against the war and torture, you are in the wrong place.
[00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:54.247]  So don't sit there with your slack jaw baloney about how you're a Christian.
[00:44:54.247 --> 00:45:00.488]  The only way for you to reprieve yourselves for the crimes you've committed is to start doing good and start doing it right now.
[00:45:02.913 --> 00:45:03.934]  I'll tell you a little secret.
[00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:07.055]  It'll feel so good when you actually start doing good.
[00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:12.458]  I don't mean some evil that you've been told's good, but things don't feel right when you're doing it, do they?
[00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:15.640]  There's a lot of good people who are sucked into evil incrementally.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.521]  Who are seduced.
[00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:22.284]  And then by the time they've turned over to the dark side, it's too late.
[00:45:22.284 --> 00:45:27.167]  But there's still time for a lot of you to turn back, and that's what really matters here.
[00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:29.448]  Flesh and bone will fall away.
[00:45:29.448 --> 00:45:30.969]  Flesh and bone will not survive.
[00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:37.733]  But the flesh you pass on, your progeny, will go on forever.
[00:45:37.733 --> 00:45:39.414]  Will go on forever.
[00:45:39.414 --> 00:45:43.435]  It's a very old species and it's going to go on, God willing.
[00:45:43.435 --> 00:45:45.436]  And you live on through your progeny.
[00:45:45.436 --> 00:45:51.679]  You, who are alive today, you are your ancestors living on.
[00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:58.622]  And that's something that even a secular humanist, someone who doesn't believe in creation or God, should be able to understand.
[00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.763]  There are many lives
[00:46:00.669 --> 00:46:02.790]  But not in the recarnation sense.
[00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:22.839]  There are many lives through the human capacity and through the human mind and that's why the New World Order seeks to destroy it, seeks to attack the genetic code, seeks to create abominations because they hate what humanity is.
[00:46:22.839 --> 00:46:24.280]  So you read this deceptive headline
[00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:29.154]  Chief Inspector, Iran may be hiding secret nukes.
[00:46:29.154 --> 00:46:36.259]  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Monday that Iran may be hiding secret nuclear facilities.
[00:46:36.259 --> 00:46:44.884]  Comments that appear to reflect a high level of frustration with stonewalling of his investigators.
[00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:52.329]  The two men spoke at length about the 35-nation board of IAEA meeting with time running out before Tehran developed potential nuclear weapons capability.
[00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:55.045]  Some worry that Israel or U.S.
[00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.607]  might resort to military strikes.
[00:46:56.607 --> 00:46:58.868]  They believe all diplomatic options have been exhausted.
[00:46:58.868 --> 00:47:05.614]  So, so, so, later they admit they don't have secret nukes, they're not close to having nukes, but if you read the headline, you think they already have secret nukes.
[00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:09.077]  Now, here's the Jerusalem Post being more accurate.
[00:47:09.077 --> 00:47:14.882]  Military intelligence Iran halfway to first nuclear bomb.
[00:47:14.882 --> 00:47:18.545]  Yeah, it's taken them decades to get halfway there, now take them another eight years.
[00:47:18.545 --> 00:47:20.867]  That meshes with the internal CIA reports to have one.
[00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:32.231]  I ran us halfway to the nuclear bomb, and it goes on.
[00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:34.272]  Oh my goodness.
[00:47:34.272 --> 00:47:41.276]  You know, I want to cover some cell phone news, and then I'll get into financial news after that, and we'll start taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:41.276 --> 00:47:41.996]  First-time callers.
[00:47:41.996 --> 00:47:42.717]  First-time callers.
[00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:48.619]  And that's all.
[00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:52.081]  First-time callers, I want new callers to have a chance to get in.
[00:47:52.081 --> 00:47:52.761]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:52.761 --> 00:48:05.707]  About the, not even hypocrisy, but the... Well, what do you think of Pakistan shooting at the U.S., the U.S.
[00:48:05.707 --> 00:48:06.348]  bombing them?
[00:48:06.348 --> 00:48:11.910]  And again, it's even wrong to use the term U.S.
[00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:12.831]  Globalist forces.
[00:48:13.969 --> 00:48:16.712]  Using American basically mercenaries.
[00:48:16.712 --> 00:48:18.734]  That's what the all-volunteer military is.
[00:48:18.734 --> 00:48:25.701]  They're just now fully converting it over to Merc force so it can now be Blackwater worldwide and Titan worldwide.
[00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:28.583]  You know, they all go offshore now.
[00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:29.284]  Because they're done.
[00:48:29.284 --> 00:48:31.827]  The Ponzi schemes coming to the end.
[00:48:31.827 --> 00:48:36.291]  They fattened up the USA hog and now it's time to butcher.
[00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:45.124]  It's all about being hard, and tough, and not caring, and that's just the way things are, and hehehehe.
[00:48:45.124 --> 00:48:48.485]  All those dumb sheep are getting what they deserve is the attitude.
[00:48:48.485 --> 00:48:52.987]  Look at them believing all this bull that the president actually runs something.
[00:48:52.987 --> 00:48:55.468]  You know, that's the attitude of people that work for the system.
[00:48:55.468 --> 00:48:57.209]  Yeah, it's all a scam, so what?
[00:48:57.209 --> 00:48:58.470]  I'm taking care of myself.
[00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.570]  Oh, you know what?
[00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.851]  You're not gonna change nothing.
[00:49:01.851 --> 00:49:05.713]  Oh yeah, when everybody has that attitude, society just completely breaks down like Mexico.
[00:49:06.658 --> 00:49:13.362]  With over a thousand murders a month now, two thousand murders the last nine months just on the Texas border.
[00:49:13.362 --> 00:49:16.644]  Rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks, car bombs going off.
[00:49:16.644 --> 00:49:18.605]  You gotta dig for it in local newspapers.
[00:49:18.605 --> 00:49:25.770]  I mean, it's war in the streets, millions protesting it, total breakdown of society, paramilitary forces everywhere.
[00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.331]  That's how America's gonna be.
[00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:29.612]  That's how these criminals operate.
[00:49:29.612 --> 00:49:31.673]  First they create a black market, they control it.
[00:49:31.673 --> 00:49:33.894]  That's how they brought China down.
[00:49:33.894 --> 00:49:36.336]  Look at how the West set up and brought China down.
[00:49:37.136 --> 00:49:45.703]  They introduced heroin, first opium, then heroin, to get control of the criminal gangs, the Asian gangs.
[00:49:45.703 --> 00:49:49.045]  Then they corrupted local police and local constabularies.
[00:49:49.045 --> 00:49:55.551]  Then they brought the country down using rival drug gangs, giving them different sectors to divide and conquer.
[00:49:55.551 --> 00:49:57.532]  That's why they made drugs illegal here.
[00:49:57.532 --> 00:49:59.914]  That was their cover to militarize the police and federalize them.
[00:50:01.733 --> 00:50:05.616]  Then it energizes the drug gangs, which are controlled by the intelligence agencies.
[00:50:05.616 --> 00:50:09.178]  It corrupts the police with the asset forward to seizure money.
[00:50:09.178 --> 00:50:13.061]  On the surface, then there's all the drug dealing by police below that.
[00:50:13.061 --> 00:50:15.843]  It scares the public into accepting paramilitary police.
[00:50:15.843 --> 00:50:25.330]  Then the next phase is staged terror to get the public to accept open intelligence gathering, secret police, spying on the public that's non-drug related.
[00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.032]  That's a way, an excuse for them to get involved in your life.
[00:50:28.032 --> 00:50:30.153]  A cover.
[00:50:30.153 --> 00:50:30.894]  Special forces.
[00:50:31.818 --> 00:50:39.223]  CIA pay off local governments, set up command centers, start running open operations like we were a third world country.
[00:50:39.223 --> 00:50:55.514]  Next phase, economic collapse, and the paramilitary police are there, again, to block the public from ever seizing control of their government again, so the criminals are safe to extract all the wealth, and then just take the cream off the top of a peon slave neo-serf system.
[00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.954]  Come back into cell phone radiation, frying your children's brains.
[00:50:59.954 --> 00:51:00.555]  I know you don't care.
[00:51:00.555 --> 00:51:01.416]  You're gonna keep doing it.
[00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:02.137]  You invest.
[00:51:02.137 --> 00:51:03.018]  You buy insurance.
[00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:03.199]  You wait.
[00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:06.151]  I think so.

[00:51:42.177 --> 00:51:43.218]  Prepare for tomorrow now!
[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:08.123]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:08.123 --> 00:52:10.787]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.787 --> 00:52:12.309]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:13.110]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.132]  This is his MO.
[00:52:14.132 --> 00:52:15.494]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.494 --> 00:52:17.056]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.476 --> 00:52:24.625]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.625 --> 00:52:25.105]  Some U.S.
[00:52:25.105 --> 00:52:31.453]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.453 --> 00:52:34.917]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:35.137 --> 00:52:45.426]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:45.426 --> 00:52:46.667]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:52:54.374 --> 00:52:57.777]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:01.246 --> 00:53:03.007]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:53:03.007 --> 00:53:05.228]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:53:05.228 --> 00:53:07.008]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:53:07.008 --> 00:53:07.849]  Sound familiar?
[00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:11.310]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:16.673]  Introducing our patented Find One Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.

[00:53:30.858 --> 00:53:37.200]  Fofa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.040]  Got the remote!
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.661]  Oh, my keys!
[00:53:40.661 --> 00:53:42.041]  There's my wallet!

[00:53:54.804 --> 00:53:56.085]  Yeah, this song says it all.
[00:53:56.085 --> 00:53:58.026]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:53:58.026 --> 00:53:58.546]  Only death.
[00:54:19.483 --> 00:54:23.768]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:27.412]  Say that joke back to that leaf.
[00:54:27.412 --> 00:54:29.655]  There's too much confusion.
[00:54:32.649 --> 00:54:46.660]  That's really 101 in high-level intelligence operations, to create that artificial confusion.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:55.647]  In fact, British intelligence had a line going back over 200 years ago about, may our enemies be confounded, confused.
[00:54:55.647 --> 00:54:59.570]  But if you study them, and you look at them long-term,
[00:55:01.608 --> 00:55:02.349]  Crystal clear.
[00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:03.830]  You can see all of it.
[00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.052]  You can understand it all.
[00:55:06.052 --> 00:55:10.576]  It's really quite simple.
[00:55:10.576 --> 00:55:23.527]  History is the gauge, is the lens through which it becomes as clear as a mountain sky.
[00:55:23.527 --> 00:55:27.551]  And oh, you are some wicked bastards.
[00:55:29.947 --> 00:55:32.889]  I see you.
[00:55:32.889 --> 00:55:36.011]  And more and more people see you.
[00:55:36.011 --> 00:55:40.154]  My God, you've committed crime.
[00:55:40.154 --> 00:55:41.615]  Against humanity.
[00:55:41.615 --> 00:55:45.558]  Against the soul.
[00:55:45.558 --> 00:55:48.440]  Against the meek.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.941]  The innocent.
[00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:50.501]  The good.
[00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:54.844]  The decent.
[00:55:54.844 --> 00:55:56.365]  The upright.
[00:55:56.365 --> 00:55:58.907]  You have waged war against all that is good.
[00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:04.231]  And you were born to lose.
[00:56:38.025 --> 00:56:38.826]  You're avarice.
[00:56:38.826 --> 00:56:40.427]  You're drastic.
[00:56:40.427 --> 00:56:59.619]  Desire to pull down those better than you... ...will consume you.
[00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:01.841]  They're foot servants.
[00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:02.041]  What?
[00:57:11.749 --> 00:57:16.772]  All of you that think evil is beautiful.
[00:57:16.772 --> 00:57:20.974]  That love the black sunshine.
[00:57:20.974 --> 00:57:33.261]  That have looked at the surface of the water and wanted to swim in its depths.
[00:57:33.261 --> 00:57:37.583]  You will now be bound in chain and dropped into its depths.
[00:57:37.583 --> 00:57:39.544]  And you will cry out forever.
[00:57:40.718 --> 00:57:48.985]  Wishing that he would have gone the other way.
[00:57:48.985 --> 00:57:57.131]  Wishing he would have done something while he still had time.
[00:57:57.131 --> 00:58:00.654]  Now, there are things we can do.
[00:58:00.654 --> 00:58:07.779]  I've got an expert coming on about sodium fluoride, and not just the fluoride, but the lead, mercury, arsenic they put in the water.
[00:58:07.779 --> 00:58:08.440]  That's official!
[00:58:09.133 --> 00:58:10.274]  Hidden in plain view.
[00:58:10.274 --> 00:58:12.675]  So huge, people can't deal with it.
[00:58:12.675 --> 00:58:22.139]  That's coming up after some calls and economic news, but the first mobile phone's use raises children's risk of brain cancer five-fold.
[00:58:22.139 --> 00:58:28.542]  That's why I see six, seven, eight-year-olds everywhere with cell phones and don't dare tell their parents.
[00:58:28.542 --> 00:58:31.463]  Last night, I mentioned a lady out front of a restaurant.
[00:58:31.463 --> 00:58:33.964]  I said, you know, cell phones aren't good for children.
[00:58:33.964 --> 00:58:34.885]  She just laughed at me.
[00:58:36.736 --> 00:58:37.417]  That's fine.
[00:58:37.417 --> 00:58:42.701]  Be an arrogant bitch.
[00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:45.303]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.469 --> 00:58:58.455]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.530]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:06.876]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.558 --> 00:59:16.465]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.465 --> 00:59:23.570]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.712]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:31.776]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.476 --> 00:59:35.218]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:59:44.545 --> 00:59:53.611]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.611 --> 00:59:55.993]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.993 --> 00:59:58.775]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.459 --> 01:00:06.761]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:08.523]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:10.286]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.286 --> 01:00:11.868]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.868 --> 01:00:13.430]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.616]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:21.682]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:59.049]  That was another lady I was driving home last night getting gas and she was freaking out up here from Milano trying to get her baby I think she said like a six-month-old baby to the doctor and she was asking where the hospital was and I was drawing a map for her in there in the gas station because the guy behind the counter couldn't speak English
[01:01:00.396 --> 01:01:06.119]  And, uh, I said, you didn't just vaccinate the baby out in Atlanta in the last week, did you?
[01:01:06.119 --> 01:01:16.603]  And she just looked at me and her eyes got real big and she goes, how do you know that?
[01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:19.124]  Because I know, lady.
[01:01:19.124 --> 01:01:21.825]  That's why.
[01:01:21.825 --> 01:01:27.568]  Your child's reacting badly to its chemical lobotomy.
[01:01:27.568 --> 01:01:29.809]  So your child can join the ranks of the zombie force.
[01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:35.000]  Oh, God help us.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.961]  I don't even know why I have to even do a radio show.
[01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:42.604]  And every instinct I've got is to haul butt.
[01:01:42.604 --> 01:01:44.645]  I mean, every instinct I've got.
[01:01:44.645 --> 01:01:49.808]  And every day I look at my children, and I just, I just, I just, oh, I just want to get them out of this country.
[01:01:49.808 --> 01:01:51.409]  But then I know there's nowhere to run.
[01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:55.951]  And my destiny is to stand and fight and do whatever I can.
[01:01:55.951 --> 01:02:00.514]  I just can't believe we have to even explain any of this to people.
[01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:11.290]  God help us!
[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.170]  God help us!
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:14.451]  God help all the evil people that serve the system.
[01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:20.174]  The drug-dealing CIA, and sheep-dipped special forces, and all the corrupt mafias.
[01:02:20.174 --> 01:02:22.455]  It just, it's all, I mean, look what you've done!
[01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:24.516]  And that's really the key.
[01:02:24.516 --> 01:02:28.438]  A point I never make is that, I need to make more often,
[01:02:30.623 --> 01:02:51.325]  The reason corruption always accelerates and expands and grows, even if the elite is trying to contain low-level corruption, is that when higher-ups engage in corruption, whether it's in a local police force, or a state legislature, or the Congress, or international bodies, is that everybody's basically corrupt, because the system itself is corrupt,
[01:02:52.105 --> 01:03:02.511]  And so even if you're only into a low-level corruption, you don't ever want to blow the whistle on somebody else's big-time corruption, because they may come back and burn you.
[01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:07.333]  And then there becomes kind of a false instinct to never stand up to evil.
[01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:08.394]  That's how corruption works.
[01:03:08.394 --> 01:03:13.736]  It starts with one little thing, and next thing you know, you're as bad as it gets.
[01:03:13.736 --> 01:03:17.498]  And we all have those decisions daily in our own lives.
[01:03:17.498 --> 01:03:20.580]  Corruption is growing everywhere, in private business, in life, everywhere.
[01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:23.457]  I mean, we're becoming an evil culture.
[01:03:23.457 --> 01:03:25.698]  That's why Mexico's broke back!
[01:03:25.698 --> 01:03:30.220]  I mean, Mexico's got triple the resources we've got.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:37.883]  Both mineral, and in there, the soils, the volcanic soils, the climate.
[01:03:37.883 --> 01:03:41.324]  They've got three growing seasons a year in Mexico.
[01:03:41.324 --> 01:03:43.425]  We've only got one and a half here.
[01:03:43.425 --> 01:03:46.886]  North America, on average.
[01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:48.247]  But they can't get anything done!
[01:03:48.957 --> 01:03:54.502]  Because they've got a corrupt elite that keeps their people down, and their people have given in to corruption and think it's funny and cute.
[01:03:54.502 --> 01:03:58.065]  No, it's not funny and cute.
[01:03:58.065 --> 01:03:59.806]  And it turns into caveman land.
[01:03:59.806 --> 01:04:04.790]  It turns into a complete breakdown of society.
[01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:10.735]  And that's going to happen here, and let me tell you, the yuppies and people, when they have all their pension funds and bank accounts taken, they are going to be monsters.
[01:04:12.054 --> 01:04:18.918]  I'm not worried about the inner city people and the illegal aliens as much as I'm worried about mainline middle class people and working class people.
[01:04:18.918 --> 01:04:23.721]  They are going to turn into, especially the yuppies, they're going to be demons.
[01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:32.266]  And Homeland Security is going to say, we got jobs for you, running FEMA camps, tattling on neighbors, running your neighborhood, and they're setting it all up for them.
[01:04:32.266 --> 01:04:39.350]  And now that slack-jawed, know-it-all piece of garbage that you know at work, that's going to be your commissar.
[01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:39.550]  Well,
[01:04:41.474 --> 01:04:47.640]  They send any neighbors to FEMA camps, they need to have a little something, you know, a little something.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:53.947]  If this all goes into the dark zone, a little something might happen to those people, you know, and that'll teach them.
[01:04:53.947 --> 01:04:56.970]  If not, they're going to win completely, and God help us.
[01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:57.710]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:58.091]  Stay with me.
[01:05:01.238 --> 01:05:07.986]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:07.986 --> 01:05:10.629]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:10.629 --> 01:05:12.170]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.971]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:12.971 --> 01:05:13.852]  This is his ammo.
[01:05:13.852 --> 01:05:15.354]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:15.354 --> 01:05:16.916]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:17.316 --> 01:05:24.479]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:24.479 --> 01:05:24.959]  Some U.S.
[01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:31.322]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:31.322 --> 01:05:34.823]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:34.823 --> 01:05:45.308]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.028]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:54.272]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:54.272 --> 01:05:57.634]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:06:02.603 --> 01:06:05.785]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[01:06:05.785 --> 01:06:07.167]  The banks are crashing.
[01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.768]  The stock market's a mess.
[01:06:08.768 --> 01:06:10.429]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[01:06:10.429 --> 01:06:12.370]  There's the lending crisis.
[01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:17.054]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[01:06:17.054 --> 01:06:18.615]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[01:06:18.615 --> 01:06:20.597]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[01:06:20.597 --> 01:06:21.377]  I don't know what to say.
[01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:22.178]  What can you do?
[01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.038]  Do what you can do.
[01:06:23.038 --> 01:06:23.659]  That's what you do.
[01:06:23.659 --> 01:06:24.800]  You do what you can do.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.461]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:28.342]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[01:06:28.342 --> 01:06:28.902]  I can read it.
[01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:32.083]  I can go to eFoodsDirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:36.445]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[01:06:36.445 --> 01:06:36.885]  I know it.
[01:06:36.885 --> 01:06:37.285]  You know it.
[01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:38.045]  Look at the prices.
[01:06:38.045 --> 01:06:38.766]  Look where they're headed.
[01:06:38.766 --> 01:06:39.386]  Be prepared.
[01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:40.066]  Take care of yourself.
[01:06:40.066 --> 01:06:46.169]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.721]  Vaccines.
[01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.741]  Arsenic in the water.
[01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:10.744]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[01:07:10.744 --> 01:07:14.727]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[01:07:14.727 --> 01:07:18.390]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure.
[01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:18.930]  I think so.

[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:06.041]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:08.442]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:10.526 --> 01:08:16.752]  We're covering all the big economic developments, stock market going way down, gold exploding, other commodities going up in price.
[01:08:16.752 --> 01:08:22.117]  We're going to cover it all after I take some calls from John, David, Jim, Jeff, Matthew, and others.
[01:08:22.117 --> 01:08:25.561]  Here's an example of cell phones.
[01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:26.802]  Something we've habitualized.
[01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:29.084]  That is, you've got a habit.
[01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:31.486]  You're trained to use a cell phone as your little friend.
[01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:33.008]  It takes photos.
[01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.189]  It records things.
[01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:36.091]  It's got video games on it.
[01:08:37.009 --> 01:08:59.609]  Photos, movies you watch, the center of your life is a little portable computer that also is a high-powered microwave transmitter that, around computers and wiring, ever notice it makes other electronics make noise, speaker systems buzz, you hear it, you know, every minute or so, that's it, logging back in with a cell tower telling the NSA where you are under federal law.
[01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:01.591]  Oh yeah, total grid.
[01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:03.493]  They knew when they got it approved back in the 80s.
[01:09:04.469 --> 01:09:08.291]  That it gave laboratory rats brain tumors and other tumors.
[01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:11.633]  They would just keep cell phones on a few hours a day.
[01:09:11.633 --> 01:09:17.536]  Back then, the battery pack, you know, transmitter units, on a few hours a day near the rats.
[01:09:17.536 --> 01:09:28.322]  And then they would test it with rats of the same typing, got the same thing, and the same lighting, and the same food, and the same vitamins in another facility next door.
[01:09:28.322 --> 01:09:29.163]  And they would find that
[01:09:30.007 --> 01:09:34.893]  Uh, depending on the study, the power of the cell phone, I mean, these rats were completely fried.
[01:09:34.893 --> 01:09:36.755]  And they found it heated up their brains.
[01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:39.398]  They found it, it gave them brain tumors.
[01:09:39.398 --> 01:09:49.130]  They found it gave them all different forms of blood diseases, uh, different, um, you know, types of blood cancers.
[01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.871]  On and on and on.
[01:09:52.384 --> 01:09:53.746]  Thousands of studies.
[01:09:53.746 --> 01:09:58.270]  I mean, this was heavily studied by the British and Dutch and Swedish and U.S.
[01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.953]  government, Canadian government, before they allowed it.
[01:10:00.953 --> 01:10:15.047]  Because they knew about people at radar installations and microwave installations, the old things in, you know, Korean War, people cooking their food on top of them, you know, just the radio waves cooking food, and, you know, how the guys would all go home two years later and die of cancer, and they taught them, hey, you gotta stay away from this.
[01:10:19.039 --> 01:10:20.599]  But, knowing all this, what do they do?
[01:10:20.599 --> 01:10:27.501]  They stuck cell towers on almost every major private school and public school in the country to, quote, get some money.
[01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:33.462]  And now they give the children as young as three, four years old their own cell phones for their safety.
[01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.202]  It's advertised.
[01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:36.182]  Get a family plan.
[01:10:36.182 --> 01:10:37.442]  Give your children cell phones.
[01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:44.784]  I mean, look, if you're in the habit of using a cell phone and you want to die of a brain tumor, an excruciating, horrible death, that's your business.
[01:10:44.784 --> 01:10:46.444]  You know, I've got a cell phone.
[01:10:47.054 --> 01:10:58.341]  But because I've read all the studies about it frying your testicles, it is in another room, sitting on a table, charged, off, and I will check messages on it once today.
[01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:08.187]  The problem is I've gotten habitualized to not using it now, instead of the way I was before, and so I might use it two or three times a week and I forget to get the messages off of it now.
[01:11:08.187 --> 01:11:09.388]  So that's a problem.
[01:11:09.388 --> 01:11:11.449]  I've missed a couple coast-to-coast AM interviews because
[01:11:12.128 --> 01:11:19.513]  By the way, I'm on three hours Wednesday, because they'll call up as part of the moment, and I'm not answering my cell phone, my wife's not listening to the phone at home, and I missed the interview.
[01:11:19.513 --> 01:11:23.216]  But hey, familiarity breeds contempt, so whatever.
[01:11:23.216 --> 01:11:33.343]  The point is, is that, um, is that I have gotten away from using, because I made a commitment about a year and a half ago to really cut back.
[01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:38.106]  And so it's a convenience, it's good for emergencies, sometimes I use it when I have to.
[01:11:38.106 --> 01:11:40.548]  I was late to pick up Jim Mars yesterday, like five minutes late,
[01:11:41.184 --> 01:11:45.868]  And so I called him at, you know, the hotel he was at and said, I'll be about five minutes late.
[01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.790]  Walk out at 105 instead of 1.
[01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:51.273]  And he came walking out right as I pulled up.
[01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.474]  So I did use a cell phone.
[01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:58.559]  And then I was going to be home late because I've been doing late interviews with him after the radio show.
[01:11:58.559 --> 01:12:04.245]  And I was going to take him to eat before he left back to Fort Worth, or where he lives outside Fort Worth.
[01:12:04.245 --> 01:12:05.165]  So I did call my wife.
[01:12:05.165 --> 01:12:06.426]  60-second call.
[01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:07.768]  Hey, I'll be home about 9.
[01:12:09.156 --> 01:12:09.977]  Or ten.
[01:12:09.977 --> 01:12:19.502]  So, that's too much, though, because I noticed my children see me using it, so they're gonna habitualize thinking it's okay to use it.
[01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.302]  Here's an example.
[01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:29.848]  Rob Jacobson, right outside the studio, has a Edit Bay cubicle, and he has a nice phone.
[01:12:29.848 --> 01:12:33.049]  Long distance, international calling, everything on it.
[01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:33.970]  He will not use it.
[01:12:34.924 --> 01:12:42.549]  Now, before he had by his cubicle, another cubicle that was kind of shared in this area of the office, that has a phone, and he wouldn't use that.
[01:12:42.549 --> 01:12:46.091]  So I got him his own phone right there at his desk, and he never uses it.
[01:12:46.091 --> 01:12:47.452]  It's got dust on it.
[01:12:47.452 --> 01:12:52.415]  He's out there right now, using it.
[01:12:52.415 --> 01:12:53.956]  Because he's in a habit.
[01:12:53.956 --> 01:12:57.158]  You know, they'll tell you half a cigarette addiction isn't even the nicotine.
[01:12:57.158 --> 01:12:58.019]  It's the breathing in.
[01:12:59.697 --> 01:13:01.639]  It's the, it's the putting something in your mouth.
[01:13:01.639 --> 01:13:03.360]  I'll tell you, chew gum, use a toothpick.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.702]  I've quit smoking many times and gone back many times.
[01:13:05.702 --> 01:13:09.425]  The point is, I always just, I don't quit with gum or, you know, the patches.
[01:13:09.425 --> 01:13:10.505]  I quit with a toothpick.
[01:13:10.505 --> 01:13:12.387]  Chewing on it.
[01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:13.508]  Or pretending I'm smoking.
[01:13:13.508 --> 01:13:15.810]  And then it's easy.
[01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.713]  Until I just am out late night working and go, okay, give me a cigarette.
[01:13:19.713 --> 01:13:21.734]  And then it's over.
[01:13:21.734 --> 01:13:23.656]  And yeah, yeah, I'll just drink one beer.
[01:13:23.656 --> 01:13:25.617]  Those ice cold beers look good.
[01:13:25.617 --> 01:13:28.980]  You know, friends will talk me into going to see a fight or something at a restaurant bar.
[01:13:29.733 --> 01:13:36.938]  Everybody's drinking big, tall, frosty beer, and I'll drink one, and then three days later I'm drinking Jack Daniels.
[01:13:36.938 --> 01:13:38.679]  But anyways, that's how habits work.
[01:13:38.679 --> 01:13:43.022]  You've got to stay away from the cell phones.
[01:13:43.022 --> 01:13:53.590]  But hey, if you're going to use cell phones and use them all day long, you might as well just start smoking cigarettes, drinking whiskey, and I'm joking, but the point is they're worse for you than that, and there's been studies on that.
[01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:54.851]  I mean, it's far worse.
[01:13:57.702 --> 01:13:59.604]  But you know cell phones are bad for you.
[01:13:59.604 --> 01:14:02.086]  I mean, cops know radar guns are frying their testicles.
[01:14:02.086 --> 01:14:02.626]  They don't care.
[01:14:02.626 --> 01:14:03.387]  They keep using them.
[01:14:03.387 --> 01:14:04.768]  They're in the habit of doing it.
[01:14:04.768 --> 01:14:06.169]  They're like, oh, I'll just be macho.
[01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:09.071]  It's fine.
[01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:10.833]  No, it's time to say no to all this.
[01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:13.855]  It's time... These radiation devices, that's what they do.
[01:14:13.855 --> 01:14:17.518]  They emit waves, high-powered waves.
[01:14:17.518 --> 01:14:19.560]  You need to just be aware of it.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.704]  And you need to know that even if you've got hands-free and the cell phone's like two, three feet away from you, it's emitting.
[01:14:26.522 --> 01:14:31.426]  See, they don't charge you for those minutes, but it's always transmitting back home.
[01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:33.828]  Intermittently, every minute.
[01:14:33.828 --> 01:14:39.672]  So, I keep the cell phone off, that's when it's not transmitting, and I only use it when I need to.
[01:14:39.672 --> 01:14:44.576]  And that's bad enough, because now there's all the other frequency pollution going on.
[01:14:44.576 --> 01:14:47.838]  You're not going to have big giant wireless units in my new office and save money.
[01:14:47.838 --> 01:14:48.199]  I'm not.
[01:14:48.199 --> 01:14:49.940]  We're wiring the whole thing.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:53.643]  Because those wireless systems are bad for you as well.
[01:14:53.643 --> 01:14:55.244]  Nothing like a cell phone, but it's still bad.
[01:14:57.023 --> 01:15:01.589]  So, children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop brain tumors.
[01:15:01.589 --> 01:15:04.572]  This is why I wish I was on 500 radio stations.
[01:15:04.572 --> 01:15:08.256]  This is why... 60-something isn't enough.
[01:15:08.256 --> 01:15:12.161]  This is... I mean, I want to warn people.
[01:15:12.161 --> 01:15:14.203]  I want to warn them.
[01:15:14.203 --> 01:15:17.047]  Children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop brain tumors.
[01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:22.781]  A study suggests that children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop a type of brain tumor.
[01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:25.762]  Children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop a type of brain tumor.
[01:15:25.762 --> 01:15:36.468]  Research has shown, the Swedish study indicates that under-16s are at risk for radiation from mobile phones because their brains or nervous systems are still developing.
[01:15:36.468 --> 01:15:41.051]  Because their heads are smaller and their skulls are thinner, the radiation penetrates deeper into their brains.
[01:15:45.046 --> 01:15:50.570]  It goes on, after presenting their findings, the scientists said that children under 12 should only use mobile phones for emergencies.
[01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:56.053]  They added that teenagers should use hands-free devices and try to restrict themselves to texting.
[01:15:56.053 --> 01:16:07.440]  But other researchers, it goes on to say, cast doubts on their findings, saying that mobile devices have not been on the market long enough to test accurately the risks associated with them.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.522]  About 90% of the under-16s in Britain have a mobile phone
[01:16:11.369 --> 01:16:13.590]  As do 40% of the primary school children.
[01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:14.971]  Good God.
[01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:22.173]  And man, they'll all basically get brain tumors and... They'll blame it on the parents or something and say they shook them and arrest them.
[01:16:22.173 --> 01:16:24.054]  That's what they do.
[01:16:24.054 --> 01:16:25.775]  Um, uh, it just goes on and on.
[01:16:25.775 --> 01:16:31.757]  It was held at the London's Royal Society by the Radiation Research Trust, independent organization.
[01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:33.278]  It goes on.
[01:16:33.278 --> 01:16:35.319]  Researching electromagnetic radiation effects.
[01:16:35.319 --> 01:16:38.080]  Uh, here's another one.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.741]  This cites a whole bunch of big studies.
[01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:43.572]  Daily Tech.
[01:16:43.572 --> 01:16:49.194]  New study shows cell phones are no friends to your testicles.
[01:16:49.194 --> 01:16:51.275]  They use the scientific name of gonads.
[01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:58.759]  There's been plenty of hearty debate between cell phone proponents and critics about potential cancer risk.
[01:16:58.759 --> 01:17:02.580]  After one study claimed cell phones had more detrimental health effects than smoking.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.401]  There you go, what I mentioned earlier.
[01:17:04.401 --> 01:17:10.884]  A major cancer doctor came forward stating that there was strong upcoming evidence of cell phone cancer linked
[01:17:12.262 --> 01:17:19.630]  And it goes on, now another new study has been released citing a direct, decidedly different hazard of cell phone use.
[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.732]  Well, there's a whole bunch of these.
[01:17:21.732 --> 01:17:26.497]  The new study shows that cell phones are no friends to testicles.
[01:17:26.497 --> 01:17:28.319]  And it goes on to talk about how it literally fries them.
[01:17:28.319 --> 01:17:33.404]  Well, any, listen, anything with radiation, any of the fields of radiation, you know, the whole spectrum,
[01:17:34.537 --> 01:17:35.618]  Fast-growing cells.
[01:17:35.618 --> 01:17:41.221]  That's why, you know, if you're in the fallout of a nuke, your teeth fall out, your intestines start bleeding.
[01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.222]  They've got fast-growing cells.
[01:17:43.222 --> 01:17:47.344]  Fingernails fall out.
[01:17:47.344 --> 01:17:48.424]  Fast-growing cells.
[01:17:48.424 --> 01:17:51.286]  Well, the testicles are producing sperm.
[01:17:51.286 --> 01:17:53.467]  Millions of them every week.
[01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:59.930]  And so, they're even outside the body, so they can have a cooler temperature to operate in.
[01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:00.791]  Okay, it's basically
[01:18:02.046 --> 01:18:07.647]  Ovaries on the outside, but a woman's born with all of her eggs intact, which is an age factor.
[01:18:07.647 --> 01:18:13.248]  Not a lot of age factor in men's sperm, there's a big age factor in women's eggs.
[01:18:13.248 --> 01:18:16.409]  Mainly space radiation x-raying you naturally.
[01:18:16.409 --> 01:18:23.350]  So we're designed to handle some of this, but you add a whole bunch more into it, you got a major problem.
[01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.351]  And it just goes into it.
[01:18:25.351 --> 01:18:30.392]  Folks, testicular cancer is no joke, and so you just need to be made aware of that, okay?
[01:18:32.288 --> 01:18:37.912]  I'm gonna come back and go to John, David, Jeff, Jim, Matthew, I promise, on the other side.
[01:18:37.912 --> 01:18:39.192]  Here's another one.
[01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:44.155]  School children should be given smart drugs and a bid to boost brain power.
[01:18:44.155 --> 01:18:44.836]  I love it.
[01:18:44.836 --> 01:18:56.923]  They got three-year-old girls going into puberty and so they give them hormones to block it instead of getting the girls off the GMO food and GMO milk that's got the growth hormone.
[01:18:56.923 --> 01:18:58.924]  And the plastics, which is an absolute fact.
[01:18:58.924 --> 01:19:00.005]  The plastics leaching and
[01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:05.892]  Makes the girls hyper female and the boys feminine.
[01:19:05.892 --> 01:19:14.595]  You wonder why your boy is feminine and looks like a little girl, it's because they are basically.
[01:19:14.595 --> 01:19:15.855]  About hell, don't listen to me.
[01:19:15.855 --> 01:19:21.077]  It's easier just to listen to CNBC that said poison food is good.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.941]  They said poison food is good, and that if we don't have poison food and toys, the market will crash.
[01:19:27.941 --> 01:19:29.362]  By the way, I haven't played that in six months.
[01:19:29.362 --> 01:19:30.162]  People won't believe me.
[01:19:30.162 --> 01:19:31.282]  Will you find that, John?
[01:19:31.282 --> 01:19:36.683]  Remember the CNBC about poison being good for us?
[01:19:36.683 --> 01:19:37.304]  No, thank you.
[01:19:37.304 --> 01:19:38.684]  People won't believe me.
[01:19:38.684 --> 01:19:41.285]  They have another newscast about mercury being good for your brain.
[01:19:41.285 --> 01:19:43.245]  You know, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:47.146]  All right, I promise we're gonna get to John, David, everybody else on the other side of this break.
[01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:48.846]  Then all the financial news is coming up.
[01:19:48.846 --> 01:19:50.367]  I'm staying abreast of that.
[01:19:50.367 --> 01:19:50.807]  Stay with me.

[01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:14.915]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:21:14.915 --> 01:21:18.739]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:25.963]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:21:25.963 --> 01:21:29.384]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:37.268]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:21:52.903 --> 01:21:55.546]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:21:55.546 --> 01:22:00.852]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:06.072]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:22:06.072 --> 01:22:11.114]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:11.114 --> 01:22:16.536]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:16.536 --> 01:22:27.061]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:27.541 --> 01:22:31.942]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:34.723]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:22:34.723 --> 01:22:38.283]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:38.283 --> 01:22:50.806]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:23:01.757 --> 01:23:02.598]  Question.
[01:23:02.598 --> 01:23:07.341]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:23:07.341 --> 01:23:11.824]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:23:11.824 --> 01:23:12.665]  Question.
[01:23:12.665 --> 01:23:17.928]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:23:17.928 --> 01:23:18.709]  Question.
[01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:25.993]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[01:23:25.993 --> 01:23:26.214]  Answer.

[01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:12.425]  That's another interesting point because a lot of people like to say scare monger about China, right?
[01:24:12.425 --> 01:24:15.389]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:17.391]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:24.059]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous,
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:29.864]  Their costs of production are going to go up, and that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:32.406]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[01:24:32.406 --> 01:24:35.768]  They're keeping prices low, and they're keeping prices for mortgages low, too.
[01:24:35.768 --> 01:24:42.793]  Yeah, if China was to stop making poisoned food or toys that don't have lead, we wouldn't have a good market.
[01:24:42.793 --> 01:24:44.795]  Things wouldn't be cheap at Walmart.
[01:24:44.795 --> 01:24:50.119]  They'll want to pay ten more cents for that toothbrush or that can so it doesn't have melamine in it.
[01:24:50.896 --> 01:24:54.077]  Thousands of children are sick in China.
[01:24:54.077 --> 01:24:57.477]  Plastic actually has a high protein value.
[01:24:57.477 --> 01:24:58.657]  Melamine does.
[01:24:58.657 --> 01:25:01.438]  Also fries your kidneys and accelerated aging.
[01:25:01.438 --> 01:25:03.318]  Kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:25:03.318 --> 01:25:05.099]  And we eat melamine over here.
[01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:06.959]  Just China, you know, it comes out there.
[01:25:06.959 --> 01:25:07.799]  They report it in the news.
[01:25:07.799 --> 01:25:10.060]  But melamine's in a lot of your food.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.680]  In fact, it helps your boys be girls.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.480]  And your girls die when they're 25 of breast cancer.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.081]  But hey!
[01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:17.021]  Party time!
[01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:17.541]  Yeah!
[01:25:18.323 --> 01:25:20.264]  I love the New World Order, man.
[01:25:20.264 --> 01:25:21.565]  Everything's good.
[01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:24.147]  That Alex Jones is evil.
[01:25:24.147 --> 01:25:25.188]  I'm not going to listen to him.
[01:25:25.188 --> 01:25:26.649]  John in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:25:26.649 --> 01:25:28.190]  Go ahead.
[01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:31.232]  Hey, thanks, Alex, for being out there.
[01:25:31.232 --> 01:25:33.613]  I love listening to you.
[01:25:33.613 --> 01:25:36.575]  Just a poor Catholic here trying to love my neighbor here.
[01:25:36.575 --> 01:25:38.857]  And they had a great show on Coast to Coast.
[01:25:38.857 --> 01:25:39.857]  You mentioned them last night.
[01:25:39.857 --> 01:25:41.218]  They had these two monks.
[01:25:41.218 --> 01:25:42.619]  Well, they call themselves monks.
[01:25:42.619 --> 01:25:44.701]  They're guys that surf the internet.
[01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:45.761]  And they've seen 9-11 coming.
[01:25:48.482 --> 01:25:54.004]  What they do is they observe how humans use words, kind of like looking at animals before an earthquake.
[01:25:54.004 --> 01:26:00.505]  And they said right now, starting today, September 22nd, we're on the verge of an epic event, world-changing, practically.
[01:26:00.505 --> 01:26:01.766]  What is it?
[01:26:01.766 --> 01:26:15.349]  There's a separate program that's got millions of dollars of funding, I forget, where the computer tracks the buzz and words that keep showing up, kind of like a... I think that's it.
[01:26:15.349 --> 01:26:16.470]  A way of tracking the
[01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.612]  You know, group consciousness?
[01:26:19.612 --> 01:26:20.372]  Right, right.
[01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:21.373]  That sounds like it.
[01:26:21.373 --> 01:26:26.557]  Yeah, they surf the net and, uh, yeah, they said... Well, that sounds like, yeah, well, surfing the net's one thing.
[01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:32.561]  This is, uh, kind of like a massive NSA private deal where they're, where it's scanning for key buzzwords.
[01:26:32.561 --> 01:26:44.470]  Well, maybe, uh, more government-based, I don't know, but... Also, you know, I was at a, uh, prepared in a conference in 98 with, uh, Fulbright, and, uh, I never heard you mention, um, Don McIverney.
[01:26:45.425 --> 01:26:53.752]  And, uh, I'll be like, and Don Malcolmini, you know, he's real estate, he predicted the bubble, we saw the bubble, real estate will come back then.
[01:26:53.752 --> 01:27:02.559]  But, he said he saw the, uh, receipt that Janet Reno signed under Clinton to bring 5,000 guillotines into the United States, you know.
[01:27:02.559 --> 01:27:06.442]  So these people are definitely into death, you know, and the FEMA camps are ready for it, you know.
[01:27:06.442 --> 01:27:12.607]  Well, they do have, uh, the crematoriums, that's been in the mainstream news, and they do have mass FEMA camps.
[01:27:12.607 --> 01:27:13.648]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:15.069 --> 01:27:16.110]  Absolutely.
[01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:23.473]  Look, going back 10-15 years ago, there were thousands of times the derivatives and there is all the real assets in the world.
[01:27:23.473 --> 01:27:26.955]  Now it's just hundreds of times worse than that.
[01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:32.677]  So we could have had this economic collapse at any time, any time the globalists decided to pull the plug.
[01:27:32.677 --> 01:27:34.998]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Ohio.
[01:27:34.998 --> 01:27:35.899]  David, you're on the air.
[01:27:35.899 --> 01:27:37.860]  Hey, how you doing there, Alex?
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:38.960]  Good, sir.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.162]  Hey, who do you have coming on to talk about the hydrofluorosilicic acid there?
[01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:44.810]  I'm gonna get into it later.
[01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:45.730]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:49.293]  I was wondering who it was, the person, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.
[01:27:49.293 --> 01:27:58.779]  I was on the, uh, the UN website a minute ago, and I wondered if... I'd never read this, because I just started researching this stuff recently.
[01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:04.042]  Um, the, uh, United Nations Global Counterterrorism Strategy.
[01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:08.204]  I was, uh, I was reading it, and the wording in it is just, it's ridiculous.
[01:28:08.204 --> 01:28:11.086]  They don't ever define terrorism.
[01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:12.047]  I was wondering if you had any...
[01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:40.667]  Well, terrorism is defined in Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act as basically any misdemeanor, or any threat to commit a misdemeanor, and that's why you can Google a headline like, Patriot Act used in non-terror cases, Patriot Act used in thousands of drug cases, and you'll read, in West Virginia it was used 25,000 times, in Texas it was used, and there's just hundreds of articles where they say, no due process, no nothing.
[01:28:40.667 --> 01:28:42.008]  They're just getting rid of everything.
[01:28:42.637 --> 01:28:46.001]  And we're going into hardcore tyranny.
[01:28:46.001 --> 01:28:48.003]  Yeah, I was just, this thing that the U.N.
[01:28:48.003 --> 01:28:54.149]  wrote though, it just bothers them to make them sit here and read it, and they don't ever have to define anything.
[01:28:54.149 --> 01:29:04.300]  And there's all these little things that they put in like every paragraph where it says, we encourage nations to comply with our strategies, you know, towards globalism or whatever.
[01:29:05.392 --> 01:29:08.353]  But then if you say you don't want it, they say it doesn't exist.
[01:29:08.353 --> 01:29:12.515]  You know, our government's under treaty following every order of the U.N.
[01:29:12.515 --> 01:29:13.355]  Not because the U.N.
[01:29:13.355 --> 01:29:14.135]  runs America.
[01:29:14.135 --> 01:29:17.336]  The global corporate state that runs America also runs the U.N.
[01:29:17.336 --> 01:29:18.556]  The U.N.
[01:29:18.556 --> 01:29:19.497]  was founded with U.S.
[01:29:19.497 --> 01:29:24.598]  money and set up at the Presidio Naval Base, and then of course with the Rockefeller land.
[01:29:24.598 --> 01:29:32.241]  But, look, there's another big article up on PrisonPlanet.com right now where YouTube is now openly admitting
[01:29:33.183 --> 01:29:38.327]  That anybody Lieberman's staff says ban on YouTube is banned.
[01:29:38.327 --> 01:29:41.849]  And they're banning hundreds of 9-11 truth accounts.
[01:29:41.849 --> 01:29:43.770]  Other major websites are doing it.
[01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:51.335]  They're implementing the Violent Radicalization Act right now because they're going down.
[01:29:51.335 --> 01:29:52.716]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.716 --> 01:29:55.238]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.238 --> 01:29:57.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.457 --> 01:30:08.203]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:10.846]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:10.846 --> 01:30:12.407]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:13.208]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:14.069]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:14.069 --> 01:30:15.570]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:17.152]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:17.552 --> 01:30:24.717]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:24.717 --> 01:30:25.178]  Some U.S.
[01:30:25.178 --> 01:30:31.542]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:31.542 --> 01:30:34.985]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:35.225 --> 01:30:45.511]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:45.511 --> 01:30:46.752]  Fabled enemies.

[01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:57.859]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:01.209 --> 01:31:04.651]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:06.952]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:31:06.952 --> 01:31:10.254]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:10.254 --> 01:31:17.138]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:19.239]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:19.739 --> 01:31:23.041]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:27.823]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:27.823 --> 01:31:31.764]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:31:31.764 --> 01:31:33.385]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:31:33.385 --> 01:31:36.066]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[01:31:46.971 --> 01:31:47.231]  Let's go.
[01:32:01.567 --> 01:32:04.908]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:32:04.908 --> 01:32:12.651]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[01:32:12.651 --> 01:32:20.494]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[01:32:20.494 --> 01:32:26.776]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[01:32:27.396 --> 01:32:34.162]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:32:34.162 --> 01:32:36.964]  Beware, be smart and be ready.
[01:32:36.964 --> 01:32:39.066]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[01:32:43.329 --> 01:32:49.673]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[01:32:49.673 --> 01:32:53.635]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[01:32:53.635 --> 01:32:59.999]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[01:32:59.999 --> 01:33:10.706]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[01:33:11.656 --> 01:33:14.057]  I'm going to get into the financial news.
[01:33:14.057 --> 01:33:17.420]  The stock market is down 237.27 on the Dow.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:17.920]  NASDAQ down 54.48.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.380]  S&P down 28.70.
[01:33:32.456 --> 01:33:39.138]  Hey, you think the criminals that run our government were just gonna fly airplanes into buildings and say Al-Qaeda did it?
[01:33:39.138 --> 01:33:42.759]  When they publicly run that organization just to launch a few wars?
[01:33:42.759 --> 01:33:48.000]  We were always the target.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.020]  And this is business as usual.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.481]  What's going on right now with the banks?
[01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:53.821]  Bailout.
[01:33:53.821 --> 01:33:55.822]  This is a scam-out.
[01:33:55.822 --> 01:33:56.902]  This is the big theft.
[01:34:02.521 --> 01:34:16.025]  And they're sending in the regular army to be garrisoned in our cities in case anybody doesn't like it.
[01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:19.986]  But take a deep breath because this is the moment before the plunge.
[01:34:29.158 --> 01:34:32.261]  The New World Order loves hurting people.
[01:34:32.261 --> 01:34:34.703]  They love ruthlessly consolidating power.
[01:34:34.703 --> 01:34:40.067]  And they've never found such arrogant, know-it-all sheep.
[01:34:40.067 --> 01:34:48.334]  They've never found a people more ready to be hustled, more ready to be taken.
[01:34:48.334 --> 01:34:50.977]  We have to get to the point where we can look at ourselves
[01:34:51.784 --> 01:34:56.805]  Because the New World Order is an inside job, but we have to, as the song says, change ourselves on the inside.
[01:34:56.805 --> 01:34:58.406]  That's also an inside job.
[01:34:58.406 --> 01:35:03.567]  We have to get fired up and angry and focused and say no to them and say, we know you're behind the bailout.
[01:35:03.567 --> 01:35:04.968]  We know you're behind the scams.
[01:35:04.968 --> 01:35:06.348]  We have your own documents.
[01:35:06.348 --> 01:35:07.448]  We know you're a terrorist.
[01:35:07.448 --> 01:35:09.669]  We know you're illegitimate.
[01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:10.649]  Let's run through some more calls.
[01:35:10.649 --> 01:35:12.190]  I'm going to get into financial news.
[01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:14.210]  Jim in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:14.891]  Thanks for holding.
[01:35:14.891 --> 01:35:16.591]  Hello, Alex.
[01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:19.072]  Why don't you sue the insiders who brought about 9-11?
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.666]  You know, I get these calls from people, maybe even from you before, saying, you need to sue these people.
[01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:27.868]  You need to do more, Mr. Jones.
[01:35:27.868 --> 01:35:30.892]  You need to take action and go in and stop them.
[01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:40.203]  Actually, I have supported three different groups of people on air and tried to get my great listeners, we go to that well so much,
[01:35:40.823 --> 01:35:41.504]  We're good to go.
[01:36:04.098 --> 01:36:05.579]  For whatever reason, his lawyer's dead.
[01:36:05.579 --> 01:36:07.201]  They said suicide.
[01:36:07.201 --> 01:36:11.364]  And I try to fund stuff for the firefighters and police and emergency workers.
[01:36:11.364 --> 01:36:14.386]  And I know this show has raised more than 50 grand for them.
[01:36:14.386 --> 01:36:19.530]  But, hey, why don't you, Jim?
[01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:21.151]  Good answer.
[01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:27.455]  Next question is, are you going to change frequencies during the daylight hours like you were before the daylight savings time?
[01:36:27.455 --> 01:36:29.917]  You know, I don't even micromanage WWCR.
[01:36:31.653 --> 01:36:36.798]  And I know that they've told me that I am, like, I count for half they're listening now.
[01:36:36.798 --> 01:36:39.380]  I mean, it's the main popular show.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.202]  That's why they re-air it.
[01:36:41.202 --> 01:36:41.502]  I don't know.
[01:36:41.502 --> 01:36:46.427]  I think I'm on there like 12 hours a day or something on different frequencies.
[01:36:46.427 --> 01:36:51.191]  And I just don't control when or where they put it on, but if you're having problems, call them.
[01:36:51.191 --> 01:36:51.952]  Okay.
[01:36:51.952 --> 01:36:52.693]  All right.
[01:36:52.693 --> 01:36:53.493]  Keep up the good work.
[01:36:53.493 --> 01:36:54.114]  Thank you, sir.
[01:36:54.114 --> 01:36:55.795]  I appreciate the call, Jim.
[01:36:55.795 --> 01:36:56.716]  Jeff in Florida.
[01:36:56.716 --> 01:36:57.277]  You're on the air.
[01:36:58.115 --> 01:36:58.916]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:58.916 --> 01:36:59.858]  First time, long time.
[01:36:59.858 --> 01:37:00.860]  How are you?
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:02.122]  I'm doing pretty good, sir.
[01:37:02.122 --> 01:37:02.482]  Excellent.
[01:37:02.482 --> 01:37:10.756]  I just wanted to let you know and thank you for the work that you've done, true patriot, and I'd like to let you know that I've illuminated many as well.
[01:37:10.756 --> 01:37:12.178]  Let me be clear, I'm not a true patriot.
[01:37:12.842 --> 01:37:23.909]  I mean, if I know that cell phones are frying little kids' brains and are going to kill them, I mean, I would be the most wicked, heartless bastard on earth if I didn't get on there and freak out.
[01:37:23.909 --> 01:37:24.790]  But go ahead.
[01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:25.630]  Alex, very true.
[01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:30.553]  And you've got to remember, they like to make us believe that it's our fault, you know, when they do this for us.
[01:37:30.553 --> 01:37:31.294]  Like the bailout.
[01:37:31.294 --> 01:37:36.037]  Like, oh yeah, it's our fault that we let people take loans like that, you know.
[01:37:36.397 --> 01:37:37.838]  So I agree with what you're saying.
[01:37:37.838 --> 01:37:43.441]  They're going to say, OK, there's 20 million brain tumors like Ted Kennedy, all on the same lobe.
[01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:44.481]  Well, you know what?
[01:37:44.481 --> 01:37:45.502]  It's your fault.
[01:37:45.502 --> 01:37:48.604]  You were told what cell phones were going to do.
[01:37:48.604 --> 01:37:49.604]  Absolutely.
[01:37:49.604 --> 01:37:54.347]  I wanted to quickly, I know you had some things going on around 9-11 and whatnot.
[01:37:54.347 --> 01:37:59.650]  Ron Paul could have dropped a Carol Quigley bombshell video on YouTube that I recently saw.
[01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:05.073]  And it takes Ron Paul's quote that he used for the one-party system from Carol Quigley from his book
[01:38:06.312 --> 01:38:07.973]  A tragedy in hope?
[01:38:07.973 --> 01:38:08.634]  Uh-huh.
[01:38:08.634 --> 01:38:16.919]  I just wish you would have kind of gone into it a little bit further and talked about the domination of world economies that Carol quickly pointed out into into the world of hope.
[01:38:16.919 --> 01:38:25.725]  Well, I'm sorry, Ron Paul has said this is a stage collapse and he said that we have a secret government running everything.
[01:38:25.725 --> 01:38:27.086]  That's not even secret now.
[01:38:27.086 --> 01:38:27.827]  I mean, it's admitted.
[01:38:28.916 --> 01:38:39.982]  That's right, and I think this video will help people understand that, hey, Ron Paul said it, Carol Quigley said it, I even had, there's footage on that video of Bill Clinton even praising Carol Quigley.
[01:38:39.982 --> 01:38:46.946]  And then it has a bunch of the quotes from the book, so if people could check out Ron Paul could have dropped the Carol Quigley bombshell.
[01:38:46.946 --> 01:38:51.248]  A lot of people are waking up as it is right now, but need to find out further information.
[01:38:51.248 --> 01:38:52.029]  This is a great start.
[01:38:53.552 --> 01:38:58.716]  Well, I appreciate your recommendations and I appreciate your call.
[01:38:59.837 --> 01:39:01.838]  He's absolutely right.
[01:39:01.838 --> 01:39:04.979]  We need to get the word out about who's behind this.
[01:39:04.979 --> 01:39:07.020]  In fact, I was thinking about it this weekend.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:14.923]  We had a 9-11 truth movement, not just to expose 9-11, but that Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center attack, the Madrid bombing, the 7-7 bombing.
[01:39:14.923 --> 01:39:22.247]  You know, as this continues, as this happens, we are able to then expose government-sponsored terror.
[01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:25.608]  And as the public becomes more aware of false flag terrorism,
[01:39:26.505 --> 01:39:27.045]  We're good to go.
[01:39:52.597 --> 01:39:55.018]  You know, I guess she was jumping over to somebody else's side.
[01:39:55.018 --> 01:39:56.039]  They had to kill her.
[01:39:56.039 --> 01:39:58.741]  Right on TV cameras, they just machine-gunned her.
[01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:02.063]  You know, she gets splattered up against the car like in a movie.
[01:40:02.063 --> 01:40:05.044]  But, worldwide, they said she was machine-gunned.
[01:40:05.044 --> 01:40:07.006]  Only the American cattle.
[01:40:07.006 --> 01:40:08.306]  They said she hit her head.
[01:40:08.306 --> 01:40:13.249]  I mean, I laugh because it's so painful and sick.
[01:40:13.249 --> 01:40:17.111]  But later, it was even admitted here, okay, that report was wrong.
[01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:19.593]  She didn't bump her little head and kill herself.
[01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:28.174]  Pretty soon they'll just say the person's not dead, and then if you say the person was killed, they'll say that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:40:28.174 --> 01:40:32.878]  I mean, you know, they're really trying to train us with just the most baseline propaganda.
[01:40:32.878 --> 01:40:35.301]  Why would terrorists want to decapitate anti-U.S.
[01:40:35.301 --> 01:40:37.142]  leadership in Pakistan?
[01:40:37.142 --> 01:40:45.529]  And yeah, there's all these bombings and shootings and killings and stabbings and kidnappings of anybody anti-New World Order in Pakistan right now.
[01:40:45.529 --> 01:40:48.512]  And every time they say, Al-Qaeda is killing
[01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:52.823]  The anti-U.S.
[01:40:52.823 --> 01:40:54.984]  group, which is true.
[01:40:54.984 --> 01:41:00.266]  I mean, Al-Qaeda always strikes the Serbs who are anti-globalist, or they strike the Russians.
[01:41:00.266 --> 01:41:01.746]  They're always used.
[01:41:01.746 --> 01:41:15.452]  But why would Al-Qaeda, because Al-Qaeda is Al-Qaeda, a group that is supposedly the prime target of the U.S.-initiated war on terror, commit a terrorist attack against a country that has recently changed its government, all but renounced its role as a U.S.
[01:41:15.452 --> 01:41:16.473]  ally in the war on terror?
[01:41:17.742 --> 01:41:18.522]  Well, you got U.S.
[01:41:18.522 --> 01:41:26.005]  helicopters and predators bombing and killing and shootouts with the Pakistani military, so Al-Qaeda is going to go into action against their enemy.
[01:41:26.005 --> 01:41:31.308]  They work for the globalists, so of course they're going to attack Pakistan government.
[01:41:31.308 --> 01:41:33.088]  Oh, that's sick!
[01:41:33.088 --> 01:41:35.049]  Man, it's sick!
[01:41:35.049 --> 01:41:38.030]  But somebody's out there going, oh, the Middle Easterners, shut up!
[01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:41.051]  They're not in the Middle East, it's Central Asia.
[01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:42.272]  It's Eastern Central Asia.
[01:41:43.493 --> 01:41:56.581]  The mass media has already blamed the Marriott hotel bombing which killed at least 53 people on Al-Qaeda, a routine reflex action, despite the lack of any real investigation, and no claim of responsibility.
[01:41:56.581 --> 01:42:03.025]  On Saturday morning, newly elected Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardiyah
[01:42:03.852 --> 01:42:05.633]  About pronouncing that right.
[01:42:05.633 --> 01:42:18.376]  Zardari told his parliament, we will no longer tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism.
[01:42:18.376 --> 01:42:22.097]  And then, well you know who hits.
[01:42:22.097 --> 01:42:27.439]  He says, you're not going to, in the name of fighting terror, take any more of our, you know, our country's sovereignty.
[01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:27.919]  Oh really?
[01:42:27.919 --> 01:42:29.379]  How about Al Qaeda kill you?
[01:42:29.379 --> 01:42:31.620]  How about anybody that supports you?
[01:42:34.881 --> 01:42:39.443]  And then we'll tell our schmucks back home Al-Qaeda's hitting, and then they'll give up even more rights.
[01:42:39.443 --> 01:42:40.444]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:42:40.444 --> 01:42:44.305]  Oh, it's so genius!
[01:42:44.305 --> 01:42:49.268]  When you have fat, dumb cattle begging to be slaves.
[01:42:49.268 --> 01:42:52.369]  Hours later... Presto!
[01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:54.310]  Al-Qaeda provides the perfect pretext for the U.S.
[01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:59.853]  to violate Pakistan's territorial integrity in the name of, you guessed it, combating Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:04.292 --> 01:43:14.036]  And that was the 6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda that were flown in the airlift of evil.
[01:43:14.036 --> 01:43:15.776]  Yeah, I mean, it's hidden in plain view that U.S.
[01:43:15.776 --> 01:43:27.020]  Special Forces would capture the top Taliban general, or the number two in Al-Qaeda, and then they'd be ordered by the command, okay, put them in a convoy, give them a bunch of money and weapons, and let them go, and escort them to the border.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:31.142]  Or load them on C-130s and fly 6,000 out of them.
[01:43:31.142 --> 01:43:31.942]  Always the same story.
[01:43:33.476 --> 01:43:41.403]  And then now they are nesting in Pakistan and launching attacks against the Pakistani government and then the U.S.
[01:43:41.403 --> 01:43:48.830]  goes in and attacks regular Pakistani military and tells our people that they're Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:50.932]  Guys in army uniforms!
[01:43:50.932 --> 01:43:53.674]  And the public believes it, of course!
[01:43:53.674 --> 01:43:55.816]  Because they love being raped!
[01:43:55.816 --> 01:43:56.477]  They love it!
[01:43:56.477 --> 01:43:57.898]  They love it so much, being losers!
[01:44:01.394 --> 01:44:04.215]  I'm trying to get you to wake up out there and stop being losers.
[01:44:04.215 --> 01:44:05.616]  I'm not talking to my general audience.
[01:44:05.616 --> 01:44:09.558]  I'm talking to those out there snickering and picking their nose right now.
[01:44:09.558 --> 01:44:18.963]  More telling than that, had the leadership of Pakistan not cancelled their plans to dine at the Marriott Hotel at the last minute, oh, that was a good thing.
[01:44:18.963 --> 01:44:23.145]  The entire command structure of the whole country would have been decapitated.
[01:44:24.648 --> 01:44:26.729]  What's our Congress under?
[01:44:26.729 --> 01:44:30.571]  They're under PDD 51, COG doctrine.
[01:44:30.571 --> 01:44:33.613]  They've been told they run nothing.
[01:44:33.613 --> 01:44:40.416]  And if they get too uppity, they've been quietly told, and this has even come out, congressmen have said this, that they will be decapitated.
[01:44:40.416 --> 01:44:45.099]  Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-E-A-D-A, will set off a neutron bomb.
[01:44:45.099 --> 01:44:46.779]  Or a small nuke when they're in session.
[01:44:46.779 --> 01:44:52.142]  And, ooh, we gotta make the president a dictator, or whatever president's coming.
[01:44:52.142 --> 01:44:53.543]  The National Security Council,
[01:44:54.384 --> 01:44:58.027]  Under shadow government because Al Qaeda hit our capital!
[01:44:58.027 --> 01:44:59.848]  I've had enough of it!
[01:44:59.848 --> 01:45:02.831]  I've had enough of you 9-11 truthers!
[01:45:02.831 --> 01:45:05.533]  Arrest every single one of them!
[01:45:05.533 --> 01:45:12.819]  You didn't let us fight Al Qaeda and now they've hit our capital!
[01:45:12.819 --> 01:45:16.682]  That's the general public like lobotomized seals!
[01:45:16.682 --> 01:45:20.024]  Just believing anything and everything!
[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:35.860]  Meanwhile, public Pentagon plans, British Pentagon perspectives openly state that they might use neutron weapons against rogue Congresses or Parliaments or peoples.
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.961]  And they surveil the Congress and Parliament.
[01:45:37.961 --> 01:45:38.722]  Rogue!
[01:45:38.722 --> 01:45:39.683]  Criminal!
[01:45:39.683 --> 01:45:40.724]  Iron-fisted!
[01:45:40.724 --> 01:45:42.205]  With weapon systems!
[01:45:42.205 --> 01:45:43.686]  With nukes!
[01:45:43.686 --> 01:45:45.188]  That's why they're so arrogant!
[01:45:45.188 --> 01:45:46.629]  That's why they don't care if you know!
[01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:56.972]  And you've got just the cops and the public who are believing any of it.
[01:45:56.972 --> 01:46:02.874]  And our news, Al-Qaeda, trying to blow up the Marriott and hurt civilians.
[01:46:02.874 --> 01:46:11.258]  And you actually read it was a government meeting there of the new government.
[01:46:11.258 --> 01:46:13.578]  Oh my goodness.
[01:46:13.578 --> 01:46:19.541]  Pakistan's top leaders were to dine at the Marriott Hotel that had devastated by a truck bombing over the weekend.
[01:46:20.367 --> 01:46:26.289]  But change the venue in the last minute, as senior government officials said Monday, reports the Associated Press today.
[01:46:26.289 --> 01:46:35.892]  Perhaps the terrorists knew that the Marriott was the venue of the dinner for all the leadership, where the President, Prime Minister, Speaker, and the entire leadership were to be present.
[01:46:35.892 --> 01:46:44.995]  Interior Minister Chief Raymond Malachy told reporters that at the 11th hour, the President and the Prime Minister decided that the venue would be the Prime Minister's house.
[01:46:44.995 --> 01:46:46.356]  It saved the entire leadership.
[01:46:47.677 --> 01:46:48.958]  Indeed!
[01:46:48.958 --> 01:47:04.628]  It seems the terrorists did know that their prime objective was to completely wipe out the most influential players in the government that just so happen to be anti-Al Qaeda, that have seemingly vowed to break away from the years of Peres Musharraf's mandating lapdogs of serviants to U.S.
[01:47:04.628 --> 01:47:05.429]  imperial whims.
[01:47:06.204 --> 01:47:18.268]  The timing of the weekend's Al-Qaeda bombing coincides with a build-up in tensions over the past month, not between Pakistan and Al-Qaeda, but between Pakistan and the United States government.
[01:47:18.268 --> 01:47:18.868]  And it goes on.
[01:47:18.868 --> 01:47:20.308]  I'm going to get Paul Watson on.
[01:47:20.308 --> 01:47:22.689]  Let's try to set him up the last 30 minutes.
[01:47:22.689 --> 01:47:23.810]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:29.371]  I'm going to get to you all when we start the next hour in about 15 minutes, about 12 minutes to be technical.
[01:47:29.371 --> 01:47:34.553]  But there's all this financial news, and I'm going to go over it after Ted and Tim Larson come on with us.
[01:47:35.689 --> 01:47:41.053]  Because the stock market is down 240 points.
[01:47:41.053 --> 01:47:47.899]  The Dow is about 60 points on the Nasdaq, 30 points on S&P, a little over that.
[01:47:47.899 --> 01:47:53.383]  Oil jumps way back up to 114 as bailout weighs on dollar.
[01:47:53.383 --> 01:47:58.507]  Look, if there was any doubt the dollar was going to die, it's all out the window.
[01:47:58.507 --> 01:48:02.070]  And again, they'll probably resuscitate it again a few points, but then it'll plunge even further.
[01:48:02.563 --> 01:48:05.925]  You look at the graph, the one-year, the two-year, the five-year, it's straight down.
[01:48:05.925 --> 01:48:07.465]  You look at a month-to-month, it's up and down.
[01:48:07.465 --> 01:48:09.806]  But you look at the big graph, it's down.
[01:48:09.806 --> 01:48:13.108]  And, uh, well, look, as an audience, you know what's going on.
[01:48:13.108 --> 01:48:20.732]  But they're talking about the ABC News, Paulson was on ABC News yesterday, and he said, we're gonna bail out all the foreign banks.
[01:48:20.732 --> 01:48:24.814]  Now, bail out means let them all share and suck on its drive.
[01:48:24.814 --> 01:48:27.395]  The housing thing's a few hundred million bucks, folks.
[01:48:27.395 --> 01:48:29.776]  That's just the excuse to say the people did it.
[01:48:29.776 --> 01:48:31.617]  Okay, this is trillions and trillions.
[01:48:32.518 --> 01:48:41.084]  And now when they announce they're going to, quote, bail the whole world out, the dollar started plunging again, and that's why gold has shot up to 900 bucks an ounce today.
[01:48:41.084 --> 01:48:50.832]  And let's go to Ted Anderson and the chief market analyst in this business for decades, and also an author on economics, Tim Larson.
[01:48:50.832 --> 01:48:53.914]  Let's bring up Ted Anderson and Tim Larson.
[01:48:53.914 --> 01:48:56.576]  Gentlemen, either one of you can go first.
[01:48:56.576 --> 01:48:58.017]  Tell us what we're seeing happen today.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.663]  Well, Alex, we are seeing just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:49:04.663 --> 01:49:08.706]  I mean, the banking system is falling apart like I've been predicting for a long time.
[01:49:08.706 --> 01:49:10.627]  You've got Lehman's the one belly up.
[01:49:10.627 --> 01:49:14.390]  I mean, that dwarfed anything that has been out there.
[01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:15.871]  You can talk about WorldCom.
[01:49:15.871 --> 01:49:18.272]  You can talk about Enron and Tyco.
[01:49:18.272 --> 01:49:21.714]  You can add up all of their totals for their bankruptcies.
[01:49:21.714 --> 01:49:23.916]  You can multiply that by six and you're talking
[01:49:25.145 --> 01:49:28.307]  Not even what Lehman went belly up for.
[01:49:28.307 --> 01:49:32.910]  Six hundred and thirteen billion dollars.
[01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:34.471]  So I mean this is going to continue.
[01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:38.653]  I mean this is all of the the housing bubble that's burst.
[01:49:38.653 --> 01:49:42.055]  I mean they took all these subprime loans and guess what?
[01:49:42.055 --> 01:49:45.697]  This has put the bank in the situations and they're not going to be able to bail out of it.
[01:49:45.697 --> 01:49:46.438]  It's simple as that.
[01:49:48.507 --> 01:50:10.183]  But Tim, when you look at the IMF and World Bank strategies, when you look at what the Financial Times of London has said, the larger mega-institutions are engineering this for a consolidation, and the real threat isn't the subprime mortgages, it was the fact that they were packaged and sold and then leveraged to the 10th degree out.
[01:50:10.183 --> 01:50:10.744]  Ted Anderson?
[01:50:11.511 --> 01:50:16.958]  Well, you know what, Alex, the biggest laugh to this is the $700 billion bailout that they're talking about right now.
[01:50:16.958 --> 01:50:27.832]  I mean, I'm reading down through just CNN's report, and what they want, I mean, they want the United States government to buy all the bad debt, so it's just the companies are left with the good debt.
[01:50:28.252 --> 01:50:34.315]  And they're saying that if we don't do this, we're going to run into an economic crisis like we had the depression of the 1930s.
[01:50:34.315 --> 01:50:36.215]  Taxpayer collections are going to go down.
[01:50:36.215 --> 01:50:39.677]  The dole's going to go up because everybody's going to be drawn on employment.
[01:50:39.677 --> 01:50:40.937]  The government's going to implode.
[01:50:40.937 --> 01:50:42.738]  This is like a full collapse.
[01:50:42.738 --> 01:50:45.619]  And they're saying, hey, just pour on the presses, man.
[01:50:45.619 --> 01:50:47.140]  Let's just print as much as it takes.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.241]  Yeah, what they're doing is they're blowing it all out now.
[01:50:49.241 --> 01:50:52.942]  Like an engine they know is going to blow, they're just having fun with it.
[01:50:52.942 --> 01:50:54.803]  You know, putting it in first gear and flooring it.
[01:50:55.565 --> 01:51:00.403]  They're just ripping the engine to pieces, laughing and giggling, hiring more SWAT teams, more prisons.
[01:51:02.862 --> 01:51:05.423]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[01:51:05.423 --> 01:51:08.885]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[01:51:08.885 --> 01:51:14.508]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[01:51:14.508 --> 01:51:17.270]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:21.872]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[01:51:21.872 --> 01:51:27.215]  They call it a G-Line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[01:51:27.215 --> 01:51:27.735]  Impossible?
[01:51:28.135 --> 01:51:33.376]  Head over to eminiforecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[01:51:33.376 --> 01:51:37.617]  Eminiforecaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.
[01:51:37.617 --> 01:51:41.578]  It's simple to use and can give you the market edge you've been looking for.
[01:51:41.578 --> 01:51:46.279]  If you're an active trader in the markets, go directly to eminiforecaster.com.
[01:51:46.279 --> 01:51:50.800]  That's E-M-I-N-I forecaster.com right now for more information.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.001]  Again, that's E-M-I-N-I forecaster.com.
[01:51:55.948 --> 01:52:01.013]  This is Rob at eminyforecaster.com, and I approve this message.
[01:52:01.013 --> 01:52:03.175]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:52:03.175 --> 01:52:06.618]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:06.618 --> 01:52:07.879]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:07.879 --> 01:52:09.420]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.122]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.122 --> 01:52:14.024]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.024 --> 01:52:17.647]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:27.285 --> 01:52:33.448]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:33.448 --> 01:52:35.969]  An inside job?
[01:52:35.969 --> 01:52:38.390]  How dare you?
[01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:43.493]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.493 --> 01:52:45.974]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:49.684 --> 01:52:57.453]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites?
[01:53:10.088 --> 01:53:18.251]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[01:53:18.251 --> 01:53:22.853]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:25.614]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:53:25.614 --> 01:53:34.457]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as
[01:53:34.617 --> 01:53:35.318]  I think so.
[01:54:08.716 --> 01:54:10.617]  Oh, we got interesting times ahead.
[01:54:10.617 --> 01:54:13.678]  In a way, I'm kind of looking forward.
[01:54:13.678 --> 01:54:16.338]  Decadent people out there have been living in denial.
[01:54:16.338 --> 01:54:17.279]  Having to live in reality.
[01:54:35.314 --> 01:54:43.082]  Like everybody else in the third world that's been living.
[01:54:43.082 --> 01:54:45.224]  But a lot of innocent people are going to get hurt in the process.
[01:54:45.224 --> 01:54:50.490]  That's why I'm trying to stop it as best I can.
[01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:53.333]  That's why we've desperately been trying to warn you.
[01:54:53.333 --> 01:54:58.178]  Ted Anderson and Tim Larson of Minus Resources.
[01:55:00.486 --> 01:55:05.368]  For those that don't understand what's happened, every couple weeks they have hundreds of billions in bailout.
[01:55:05.368 --> 01:55:08.029]  Again, I keep using their term, bailout.
[01:55:08.029 --> 01:55:10.630]  Scam out.
[01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:26.417]  And they know that the dollar's never coming back, so while it's still got some value, they are just creating hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions in more liquidity for themselves a day, and then they're raiding the real economy, by real economy, companies that actually manufacture things.
[01:55:26.417 --> 01:55:27.417]  700 plus companies.
[01:55:28.911 --> 01:55:36.433]  That are financial brokerage houses, banks, they're not allowed to be shorted, but they are going out and attacking the real economy.
[01:55:36.433 --> 01:55:43.836]  So this is a looting orgy of death, exterminating the buffalo right now, basically.
[01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:49.617]  The scamming and thieving and pension fund stealing going on right now dwarfs anything that's ever happened in history.
[01:55:49.617 --> 01:55:54.159]  All the scamming of the last decade, it's nothing, nothing compared to it.
[01:55:54.159 --> 01:55:54.299]  Now,
[01:55:56.858 --> 01:56:00.140]  On the surface, they say, oh, we're going to guarantee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:02.021]  Market goes up for a few days and plunges.
[01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:04.382]  Oh, now we're going to bail out all these other big brokerage firms.
[01:56:04.382 --> 01:56:07.324]  Goes up for a few days, starts plunging again.
[01:56:07.324 --> 01:56:09.565]  Because the world knows what this means.
[01:56:09.565 --> 01:56:11.886]  Now the Japanese and Chinese are buying into U.S.
[01:56:11.886 --> 01:56:14.567]  banks, you know, on the surface to prop them up.
[01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:19.970]  No, they just want to be part of the power play of consolidation of who's left on the other side.
[01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:21.191]  So this is an incredible
[01:56:22.484 --> 01:56:29.391]  In the line predatory system where they're being gobbled up basically into one New World Order system.
[01:56:29.391 --> 01:56:32.594]  And then while they're doing it, they're running out the debt on us forever.
[01:56:32.594 --> 01:56:36.598]  Bottom line, Tim Larson, Ted Anderson, what is your time frame?
[01:56:36.598 --> 01:56:37.999]  What do you see happening?
[01:56:37.999 --> 01:56:42.704]  How long until this goes into a full bore depression and destroys what's left of the physical economy?
[01:56:43.274 --> 01:56:47.537]  Well, I can add in right here now, you know, that this is like the mark of the end.
[01:56:47.537 --> 01:56:58.465]  When you see the United States government being sold by the central bank, that they've got to step in and pick up an institution that bails out their buddies' bad debt, the bad loans that they've made.
[01:56:58.465 --> 01:57:02.628]  The United States economy is in trouble.
[01:57:02.628 --> 01:57:07.131]  It's all based upon this debt that comes from the Federal Reserve System and our own central bank.
[01:57:07.131 --> 01:57:11.174]  And each one of those bank members right now are crying wolf, saying, hey, we need help.
[01:57:11.514 --> 01:57:33.664]  This is like what happened in 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office, and we're running into the Depression in the 1930s, and the liability of the banks to pay the people their gold back that they've deposited was a big problem to them, so they went to the United States President and said, we need you to bail us out, and the President has signed an executive order to force the people to turn the gold over to the banks.
[01:57:33.664 --> 01:57:35.264]  This is what's going on right now.
[01:57:35.264 --> 01:57:39.126]  The bankers have a lot of bad debt, a lot of bad mortgages that they're trying to collect,
[01:57:39.846 --> 01:57:40.927]  But let's explain.
[01:57:40.927 --> 01:57:49.895]  The owners of these banks and the shareholders quietly have been moving all the real assets out the back door and buying infrastructure and commodities for decades.
[01:57:49.895 --> 01:57:52.778]  They've been quietly planning this for decades.
[01:57:52.778 --> 01:57:54.920]  This is the birth of the New World Order.
[01:57:55.646 --> 01:57:56.947]  It most certainly is, Alex.
[01:57:56.947 --> 01:58:03.929]  I can tell you right now, they are asking that the United States government come in and buy all their bad debt so they can keep the good debt.
[01:58:03.929 --> 01:58:06.530]  And it's a sad situation.
[01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:16.054]  And even the LA Times yesterday, I covered it on the Sunday Show, said there's no checks and balances, Congress is out of the loop, and that Bush is now a dictator.
[01:58:16.054 --> 01:58:16.995]  So there you go!
[01:58:16.995 --> 01:58:17.635]  Voila!
[01:58:17.635 --> 01:58:22.217]  In fact, Bloomberg last night had the headline that Bush is now a dictator.
[01:58:22.217 --> 01:58:22.797]  I mean, folks!
[01:58:24.008 --> 01:58:26.289]  You're like, well, that's good, he's a Republican!
[01:58:26.289 --> 01:58:30.172]  No, he doesn't run anything, he's a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting person.
[01:58:30.172 --> 01:58:32.533]  Won't matter if it's Barack Obama or John McCain.
[01:58:32.533 --> 01:58:34.254]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:34.254 --> 01:58:37.136]  The heavy armored brigades are moving into the U.S.
[01:58:37.136 --> 01:58:38.617]  Stay there, Tim Larson, Ted Anderson.
[01:58:38.617 --> 01:58:43.420]  I want to talk more in one minute.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.701]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.701 --> 01:58:48.243]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:58.355]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.355 --> 01:59:00.997]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:00.997 --> 01:59:02.558]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.558 --> 01:59:03.338]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.338 --> 01:59:04.339]  This is his ammo.
[01:59:04.339 --> 01:59:05.720]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.261]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.701 --> 01:59:14.871]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:14.871 --> 01:59:15.332]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.332 --> 01:59:21.700]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:25.145]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.385 --> 01:59:35.672]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:35.672 --> 01:59:36.893]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:00:07.104 --> 02:00:08.865]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.865 --> 02:00:10.626]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.626 --> 02:00:12.187]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.187 --> 02:00:13.748]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.748 --> 02:00:17.951]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.951 --> 02:00:22.734]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.734 --> 02:00:28.738]  In the last week, I've seen no fewer than, I don't know, it's more than ten headlines going, this is the New World Order.
[02:00:28.738 --> 02:00:33.721]  Prepare for it to be born, an international banking order with a global control
[02:00:34.924 --> 02:00:39.166]  Out of England, we must run everything, and currencies all pegged to one system.
[02:00:39.166 --> 02:00:41.647]  Only that will save us.
[02:00:41.647 --> 02:00:46.148]  So again, they run the Ponzi scheme up, they get all these countries trillions of dollars in debt.
[02:00:46.148 --> 02:00:53.151]  We have the IMF and World Bank documents on this when they planned all this, and I keep warning people since we learned this six years ago, intensely.
[02:00:53.151 --> 02:00:57.673]  I mean, we knew this was the game a long time ago.
[02:00:57.673 --> 02:00:57.933]  And, uh,
[02:00:59.696 --> 02:01:02.700]  Folks, they are pulling out all the stops right now.
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:07.846]  I mean, they announced that the government will bail out any foreign banks that basically want it.
[02:01:07.846 --> 02:01:11.010]  But remember, nobody gets prosecuted, nobody gets investigated.
[02:01:11.010 --> 02:01:13.514]  That's why you know it's an inside job, plus their own documents.
[02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:15.915]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:01:15.915 --> 02:01:21.859]  Later, they'll burn a few little low-level janitors or something and dress them up in suits and call them, you know, big guys.
[02:01:21.859 --> 02:01:24.901]  And I mean that figuratively, but some low-level broker.
[02:01:24.901 --> 02:01:25.941]  But nobody's getting in trouble.
[02:01:25.941 --> 02:01:27.723]  They're telling you nobody's done anything wrong.
[02:01:27.723 --> 02:01:28.983]  Just a mistake.
[02:01:28.983 --> 02:01:30.745]  But they're going to repossess your house.
[02:01:30.745 --> 02:01:32.626]  You're not getting bailed out.
[02:01:32.626 --> 02:01:39.730]  You're just giving all of your future money and pledging, you know, all of your taxes to the private bankers.
[02:01:39.730 --> 02:01:41.151]  This is the New World Order.
[02:01:41.151 --> 02:01:43.813]  Tim Larson, what do you see happening in the short term?
[02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:52.259]  Well, in the short term, I seriously don't see the banking system lasting another year, and I'll be surprised if it's got another six months.
[02:01:52.259 --> 02:01:57.141]  You know, people need to put some of these numbers in perspective here real quickly.
[02:01:57.141 --> 02:02:02.302]  So, real quickly, let me explain what a billion and a trillion dollars is.
[02:02:02.302 --> 02:02:05.603]  Alright, now you can sit down with dollar bills in front of you.
[02:02:05.603 --> 02:02:11.125]  You can count a dollar bill every second, and it'll take you 12 days to get to a million.
[02:02:12.609 --> 02:02:17.531]  You would get to a billion, it's going to take you 34 years.
[02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:21.373]  To get to a trillion, you're talking 3400 years.
[02:02:21.373 --> 02:02:25.694]  These are incredible numbers, and there's not enough money out there to do it.
[02:02:25.694 --> 02:02:29.496]  They can run the printing presses as long as they want, but it's not going to save it.
[02:02:30.794 --> 02:02:37.840]  By the way, the numbers we're talking about is going to dwarf the Weimar Republic and, you know, 2 million percent inflation.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.704]  I mean, that's... and there's... I've got a big stack of news where countries are seriously debating getting rid of the U.S.
[02:02:43.704 --> 02:02:44.845]  AAA rating.
[02:02:44.845 --> 02:02:47.227]  Ted, if they get rid of the AAA rating, it's all over.
[02:02:47.227 --> 02:02:48.368]  It's insolvency.
[02:02:48.368 --> 02:02:49.209]  It is bankruptcy.
[02:02:49.309 --> 02:02:51.931]  Well, that just means that the interest rate on U.S.
[02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:53.713]  government securities is going to have to go up.
[02:02:53.713 --> 02:03:04.023]  And the whole manipulation scheme that we've had here, Alex, is that the Federal Reserve System is pushing money into the system and lending money and buying U.S.
[02:03:04.023 --> 02:03:08.247]  government bonds so the open market doesn't push the interest rates up.
[02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:09.228]  Right now, the U.S.
[02:03:09.228 --> 02:03:11.230]  interest rate is so far below inflation
[02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:19.752]  That nobody in their right mind wants to lend money in this country anymore, and that's why we're having so much problem, because there's too much manipulation.
[02:03:19.752 --> 02:03:20.872]  Now let's explain.
[02:03:20.872 --> 02:03:38.216]  The people can't get any credit, small corporations and businesses can't get credit, but the big boys, the windows open, and the Fed, private Fed is saying, and the Treasury is saying, whatever you want, and the only big brokerage house of the big five that's halfway left is the one that Henry Paulson came from.
[02:03:38.216 --> 02:03:39.456]  You want to talk about that, Larson?
[02:03:40.254 --> 02:03:42.715]  Well, yeah, I mean, and that is it.
[02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:56.398]  I mean, the Federal Reserve System just keeps pumping in money, and it's just not going to do any good, because unless, like Ted says, we start raising our debt prices, you know, our bonds and our treasuries, nobody wants them.
[02:03:56.398 --> 02:04:00.759]  China quit buying our debt here, oh, God, a year and a half ago.
[02:04:00.759 --> 02:04:01.759]  You know, we need to borrow 2.2
[02:04:03.334 --> 02:04:10.796]  Billion dollars or 3.2 billion dollars a day to keep this whole thing afloat, and it's not happening because nobody wants our debt any longer.
[02:04:10.796 --> 02:04:13.717]  And again, they put banking elites in who would do this to us.
[02:04:13.717 --> 02:04:24.660]  This is what the United States and England used to do to third world countries under the last wave of neo-colonialism was, oh, it's not a colonial power, you just owe us money.
[02:04:25.721 --> 02:04:33.549]  And then they would set things up, and it was in agreements that the leadership would not pay it back because the banks wanted the assets.
[02:04:33.549 --> 02:04:34.470]  That's been done there.
[02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:35.331]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:40.697]  We're going to do five more minutes on Economic News with our guest, Tim Larson, Ted Anderson.
[02:04:40.697 --> 02:04:42.559]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[02:04:42.559 --> 02:04:43.821]  I know we had a lot of phone calls there.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:48.506]  Then we have a guest coming on dealing with sodium fluoride.
[02:04:48.506 --> 02:04:49.908]  It's not just sodium fluoride.
[02:04:49.908 --> 02:04:53.334]  That's a catch-all name the government uses.
[02:04:53.334 --> 02:04:59.243]  It's lead, it's mercury, it's arsenic in hundreds of times safe levels for you and your family.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:03.441]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:05:03.441 --> 02:05:07.042]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:05:07.042 --> 02:05:09.504]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:05:09.504 --> 02:05:12.545]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:12.545 --> 02:05:18.267]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:18.267 --> 02:05:22.189]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:22.529 --> 02:05:27.711]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:06:03.327 --> 02:06:18.194]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was reminded
[02:06:18.234 --> 02:06:18.554]  We're good to go!
[02:06:41.459 --> 02:06:42.179]  You know what I did?
[02:06:42.179 --> 02:06:43.740]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.541]  Go to the J. Michael Stephens EFoodsDirect.com company.

[02:07:01.733 --> 02:07:06.256]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:07:06.256 --> 02:07:11.339]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:07:11.339 --> 02:07:12.860]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:16.483]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:08:11.670 --> 02:08:14.292]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[02:08:14.292 --> 02:08:18.356]  We've got another guest coming up in about 22 minutes from now.
[02:08:18.356 --> 02:08:19.617]  Very important information.
[02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:32.397]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have words to describe just how dastardly, how serious this is.
[02:08:32.397 --> 02:08:35.079]  And then you've got all the military news.
[02:08:35.079 --> 02:08:44.447]  Clearly the West trying to kill the entire government in a bomb attack last night in Pakistan, blowing up a large section of a hotel.
[02:08:44.447 --> 02:08:48.731]  They're trying to blame it on Al-Qaeda.
[02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:52.631]  As usual, Al Qaeda attacking the U.S.
[02:08:52.631 --> 02:08:53.391]  enemies.
[02:08:53.391 --> 02:08:54.312]  Give me a break.
[02:08:54.312 --> 02:08:57.914]  Yeah, attacking the American people, that's their enemy.
[02:08:57.914 --> 02:08:59.474]  Attacking the Russians, that's their enemy.
[02:08:59.474 --> 02:09:02.136]  Attacking the Serbs, that's their enemy.
[02:09:02.136 --> 02:09:04.117]  Attacking Saddam, that's their enemy.
[02:09:04.117 --> 02:09:06.618]  On and on and on.
[02:09:06.618 --> 02:09:13.001]  And then I hear talk radio, I see the financial news, and they're still engaged in so much deception.
[02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:13.261]  Ted,
[02:09:14.378 --> 02:09:18.800]  I mean, what is it like knowing how the markets really work, knowing how commodities really work?
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:25.703]  I mean, for me, I've got some knowledge of this interviewing all these financial experts over the years and studying it, and to see them getting away with it.
[02:09:25.703 --> 02:09:27.224]  I mean, they're getting away with the bailout.
[02:09:27.224 --> 02:09:34.548]  They're getting away as if all their other thieving and scamming and everything they caused wasn't bad enough.
[02:09:34.548 --> 02:09:34.788]  Now,
[02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:38.012]  You know, they're getting multi-billion dollar bonuses.
[02:09:38.012 --> 02:09:41.996]  Some of these CEOs, you know, have been paid $3 billion the last few years.
[02:09:41.996 --> 02:09:44.318]  I mean, they are raping the daylights out of us.
[02:09:44.318 --> 02:09:48.382]  Well, $17,000 an hour is what the guy from AIG was getting.
[02:09:48.382 --> 02:09:50.785]  I mean, could you imagine getting that kind of money?
[02:09:50.785 --> 02:09:53.467]  You're talking about Paulson and Benarki.
[02:09:53.467 --> 02:09:57.772]  Both of them address Congress, and if Congress was just dumbfounded, they don't even know what's going on.
[02:09:58.572 --> 02:10:07.716]  You know, they're talking about a frozen credit market right now because the banks are afraid to enter into deals with each other because they don't know which one's going to kill them.
[02:10:07.716 --> 02:10:11.577]  And with frozen credit markets, that means there's no money coming into the system.
[02:10:11.577 --> 02:10:16.739]  The Federal Reserve System only has the ability to get money into the system if people are willing to take it on loan.
[02:10:17.319 --> 02:10:18.500]  And that's why they want the U.S.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:25.663]  government to step in to do it, because that's how the money has to get into the system to free up this frozen credit market.
[02:10:25.663 --> 02:10:26.663]  It's crazy, Alex.
[02:10:26.663 --> 02:10:28.244]  We should have a free market system.
[02:10:28.244 --> 02:10:40.949]  The United States government has been commissioned by our forefathers to not have central banking systems and to be able to get our money through the creation, you know, bringing gold and silver out of the ground.
[02:10:40.949 --> 02:10:42.250]  That's how we should have it.
[02:10:42.250 --> 02:10:43.391]  And this is crazy.
[02:10:43.391 --> 02:10:44.451]  The whole thing is nuts.
[02:10:44.551 --> 02:10:47.812]  And then you have people who blame the free market for this.
[02:10:47.812 --> 02:10:54.413]  No, this is government that is allowing this, government that engineered this, in partnership with the big banks.
[02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:55.794]  That's called fascism.
[02:10:55.794 --> 02:10:58.694]  Yes, Alex, this has nothing to do with freedom at all.
[02:10:58.694 --> 02:10:59.814]  It's been manipulated since 1913.
[02:10:59.814 --> 02:11:02.735]  Certainly the 1920s, the Roaring Twenties, was created by easy credit.
[02:11:06.636 --> 02:11:08.577]  And then we ran into the depression of the 1930s.
[02:11:08.577 --> 02:11:11.019]  It's been going on and on and on.
[02:11:11.019 --> 02:11:16.862]  And right now, we're bailing out problems that were created by the easy credit of the 1990s.
[02:11:16.862 --> 02:11:18.443]  I mean, come on!
[02:11:18.443 --> 02:11:21.085]  We definitely have to get away from this system.
[02:11:21.085 --> 02:11:28.049]  That's why it makes me so happy to see that 12,000 people showed up at the Liberty Campaign thing with Ron Paul.
[02:11:28.049 --> 02:11:31.031]  Definitely, folks, now we're finding out about the private Federal Reserve.
[02:11:31.571 --> 02:11:32.952]  They're finding out about the New World Order.
[02:11:32.952 --> 02:11:39.515]  The problem is, people that have saved, who have lived in their means, they're being penalized.
[02:11:39.515 --> 02:11:46.718]  The poor folks that went and lied on their applications, and the system allowed them to, that flipped houses, now they just walk away.
[02:11:46.718 --> 02:11:54.241]  But people that want to be solvent, folks that haven't lived outside their means, people that have businesses and companies that are solvent, they're going to be punished.
[02:11:54.241 --> 02:12:00.204]  But the crooks of every stripe, from the international bankers, down to slobs in this country,
[02:12:01.042 --> 02:12:06.183]  And then down to those that got tricked and over leveraged or lost their jobs, they're going to get punished too.
[02:12:06.183 --> 02:12:09.764]  But criminals are going to be rewarded.
[02:12:09.764 --> 02:12:15.626]  And folks, if you think things are bad now, there is no doubt this is going to get deeper, this is going to get more intense.
[02:12:15.626 --> 02:12:23.728]  Every analyst we have on says it is a virtual certainty, barring miracles, that we are not going to have a sustained deep
[02:12:24.341 --> 02:12:24.962]  That's the Army Times.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.704]  And oh, by the way, we're going to have the jaws of life out helping the police.
[02:12:47.704 --> 02:12:48.705]  That's for PR.
[02:12:48.705 --> 02:12:51.468]  Oh, look, the army's here to help me get with a car wreck.
[02:12:51.468 --> 02:12:53.771]  I mean, this is black ops taking over.
[02:12:53.771 --> 02:12:55.673]  We're going into third world receivership.
[02:12:55.673 --> 02:12:57.895]  It's in all the IMF and World Bank plans.
[02:12:57.895 --> 02:12:59.577]  They've done this in hundreds of nations.
[02:12:59.577 --> 02:13:02.140]  And in closing with you, gentlemen,
[02:13:03.616 --> 02:13:06.299]  I know, Ted, that you have been getting into the position.
[02:13:06.299 --> 02:13:11.024]  This is the right kind of market to be in, because you're able, as gold climbs, $70, then $80, then $100.
[02:13:11.024 --> 02:13:13.466]  The last time I checked, it was up over $100 and, what, $29 from last Wednesday.
[02:13:13.466 --> 02:13:15.548]  I haven't looked in the last 30 minutes or so.
[02:13:15.548 --> 02:13:17.110]  Where is gold right now, Ted?
[02:13:24.717 --> 02:13:27.778]  Last time I looked at gold, gold was at $9.0310.
[02:13:27.778 --> 02:13:29.938]  Silver's even higher, $13.49.
[02:13:29.938 --> 02:13:32.078]  It's up like crazy, both of them.
[02:13:32.078 --> 02:13:33.439]  And I don't blame them.
[02:13:33.439 --> 02:13:35.039]  So that's up $130.
[02:13:35.039 --> 02:13:36.319]  Gold is up $130.
[02:13:36.319 --> 02:13:37.739]  Silver is up how much?
[02:13:37.739 --> 02:13:40.220]  Silver right now is up to $13.49.
[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:41.580]  It's up 78 cents.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:44.620]  So it's up like $3 plus from its low.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.561]  Gold's $130 plus from its low.
[02:13:47.561 --> 02:13:50.621]  I guess even more from its low, but from its low last week.
[02:13:50.621 --> 02:13:53.162]  And ladies and gentlemen, it may go down again, though I doubt it.
[02:13:54.562 --> 02:13:58.205]  Historically, the winter is when, the fall and winter is when it goes crazy.
[02:13:58.205 --> 02:14:13.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the commodities, oil surged like 18 bucks today, because when the dollar dies, and it's the world denomination, it is going to send every commodity to the roof, and gold should be up at 3,000 for conservative inflation from 1980.
[02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:16.400]  Many others are saying 6,000, that's how much real inflation.
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.303]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but I know this, the internationalists cannot devalue.
[02:14:20.303 --> 02:14:20.824]  Ted, go ahead.
[02:14:21.064 --> 02:14:31.731]  Yeah, I was just about to say, anytime you see bailout, when you see these people getting up in front of Congress, hold on to your hat and grab on to your boots, because, you know, that's exactly what causes the problem.
[02:14:31.731 --> 02:14:34.733]  It's exactly what's going to debase the value of the currency.
[02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:38.275]  They want to be able to print money to solve problems that you can't do that.
[02:14:38.275 --> 02:14:40.557]  We need to get back to constitutional money.
[02:14:40.557 --> 02:14:43.799]  I don't care, and the people in this audience here should know better.
[02:14:44.159 --> 02:14:49.081]  Then to think that just because gold and silver goes up and down makes it a bad buy or a great buy.
[02:14:49.081 --> 02:15:00.545]  Right now, people need to get into gold and silver because it's obvious what's going on here, and we should do everything we can to support the people that are in office that are actually trying to get us back on track to the Constitution.
[02:15:00.545 --> 02:15:06.327]  Let me get you both to comment on this, Tim Larson and then Ted, and then we're going to wrap it up.
[02:15:06.327 --> 02:15:09.388]  You have short selling last Tuesday, last Wednesday ban.
[02:15:11.244 --> 02:15:14.806]  And that's a very predatory thing, folks, for those that don't know.
[02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.107]  Very speculative, very dangerous.
[02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:25.913]  But it was only banned for 740-something financial crime institutions to guard them, but not all the real economy.
[02:15:25.913 --> 02:15:27.034]  And I keep going back to this.
[02:15:27.034 --> 02:15:38.080]  So, there's not just a looting of the pension funds going on, and a looting going on of our, you know, future deficit at thousands of times all the real money in the world.
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:39.561]  I mean, this is a total takeover.
[02:15:40.996 --> 02:15:51.804]  The enemy is moving these new billions they get into leverage puts and into shorting the real economy, so they're going for broke.
[02:15:51.804 --> 02:15:57.108]  They're raiding all the real economy, trying to shoot up companies, drive down stock, drive up stock.
[02:15:57.108 --> 02:16:01.032]  I mean, we're seeing an orgy of crime like we've never seen.
[02:16:01.032 --> 02:16:05.515]  While they're robbing the Treasury, they're attacking other sectors of the economy.
[02:16:05.515 --> 02:16:10.379]  They've got rigged games, double rules, insider trading for some, not for others.
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:15.923]  I mean, they are clearly ripping the chandeliers out, ripping the wallpaper out.
[02:16:15.923 --> 02:16:17.704]  They are gutting the palace.
[02:16:17.704 --> 02:16:20.486]  I mean, is that a good way of putting it, Tim Larson?
[02:16:20.486 --> 02:16:22.047]  Pretty much, you're right on the money there.
[02:16:22.047 --> 02:16:26.490]  I mean, these people shorting all of these commodities and such are doing it for one purpose.
[02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:28.852]  They want other people out of them.
[02:16:28.852 --> 02:16:32.915]  They want to rob them of their money and their wealth.
[02:16:32.915 --> 02:16:33.835]  It's real simple.
[02:16:33.835 --> 02:16:38.879]  That's why gold and silver goes down, especially during the main manipulation times like the summer months.
[02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:41.631]  And that's going to continue to happen.
[02:16:41.631 --> 02:16:46.193]  But, you know, it's gotten to the point where all of these banks are folding.
[02:16:46.193 --> 02:16:51.796]  I've talked to I don't know how many clients whose relatives have lost money in these bankruptcies from Lake Lehman's.
[02:16:51.796 --> 02:16:53.877]  And it's going to continue to happen.
[02:16:53.877 --> 02:16:57.119]  So gold and silver can't be held down long.
[02:16:57.119 --> 02:16:58.520]  And neither can the price of oil.
[02:16:59.281 --> 02:17:00.422]  It is what it is.
[02:17:00.422 --> 02:17:01.844]  What about the real economy?
[02:17:01.844 --> 02:17:06.509]  I mean, the economy's already at a standstill and falling apart.
[02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:11.514]  What is this going to do now that everything else is falling apart?
[02:17:11.514 --> 02:17:19.342]  Well, we're headed towards a global depression, and I'm talking about a depression that makes 1933 look like a trip to Disney World.
[02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.349]  Yes, they are.
[02:17:38.207 --> 02:17:40.769]  It's magnifying and amplifying the problems.
[02:17:40.769 --> 02:17:42.990]  It's going to be a tremendous amount worse than it was.
[02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:49.434]  And besides the fact, back in 1933, when we had that depression, most people were living on the farm and they could grow their own food.
[02:17:49.434 --> 02:17:52.276]  That's what I'm afraid of.
[02:17:52.276 --> 02:17:56.879]  I mean, breakdown of cities, marauding people trying to come on your farms and ranches.
[02:17:56.879 --> 02:18:02.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, you better batten down the hatches, because we're going into a very dangerous decade right now.
[02:18:02.082 --> 02:18:03.322]  God knows what's going to happen.
[02:18:03.322 --> 02:18:07.425]  I hope they don't start a war, try to cover all this up, but it looks like they may do that.
[02:18:09.498 --> 02:18:12.479]  Ted, tell folks about the gold and silver offer you've got today.
[02:18:12.479 --> 02:18:24.001]  I know you continue to buy large amounts of gold and silver when it's lower, so that as the market rises, you can offer people deals at spot or below spot that are unprecedented.
[02:18:24.001 --> 02:18:25.921]  And it's first come, first serve, folks.
[02:18:25.921 --> 02:18:27.521]  They have had people there all weekend.
[02:18:27.521 --> 02:18:29.602]  The phones are melting down.
[02:18:29.602 --> 02:18:31.422]  Ted has got 25 brokers.
[02:18:31.422 --> 02:18:33.082]  He's trying to hire more.
[02:18:33.082 --> 02:18:35.623]  They have never had, you know, this type of
[02:18:36.933 --> 02:18:40.036]  Uh, response because people are finally getting it, Ted.
[02:18:40.036 --> 02:18:40.797]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:18:40.797 --> 02:18:45.221]  As a matter of fact, we sold out of Walkers, so I have to move over to the Dimes at this particular time.
[02:18:45.221 --> 02:18:46.403]  They're currently $1.60 or $1,600 per $100 face.
[02:18:46.403 --> 02:18:49.305]  We still have, however, the British Sovereigns at $2.47, and we have the Franks at $1.98.
[02:18:55.231 --> 02:19:05.200]  I can tell you right now that there is a lot of demand coming in, not only just from your audience, Alex, but the whole world right now is looking at gold and silver, and there's just simply not enough to go around.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:09.804]  The physical supply of silver is so tight that last time around we couldn't even sell.
[02:19:09.804 --> 02:19:11.345]  I had to take everything off the market.
[02:19:11.445 --> 02:19:11.845]  That's right.
[02:19:11.845 --> 02:19:14.808]  They can dummy up the price of gold, but they can't dummy up the supply.
[02:19:14.808 --> 02:19:15.889]  No, exactly.
[02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:19.712]  When you're trading futures, it's all paper, and you can watch it go up and down like that.
[02:19:19.712 --> 02:19:24.675]  But when you're talking about actually getting the physicals, there's not a whole lot of out there and available.
[02:19:24.675 --> 02:19:30.560]  And so at this particular time, I'm suggesting that people get as much as they can while the storm is brewing.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:32.001]  But let's explain, Ted.
[02:19:32.001 --> 02:19:34.883]  That's a super deal you're offering on gold and silver at those prices.
[02:19:34.883 --> 02:19:37.185]  You know, stay there briefly, because I want to come back with you and Tim.
[02:19:37.185 --> 02:19:37.966]  This is so important.
[02:19:38.546 --> 02:19:49.016]  I want to come back for the listeners and explain to them, regardless of if you get into metals or not, the type of deals that Ted is offering and then more on what a depression will look like in this country.
[02:19:49.016 --> 02:19:54.080]  Then we have a top academic and professor coming on to tell you exactly what's in your water.
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.702]  It isn't just fluoride.
[02:19:55.702 --> 02:19:57.523]  It isn't just pesticides.
[02:19:57.523 --> 02:19:59.045]  It isn't just Prozac.
[02:19:59.045 --> 02:20:00.206]  Oh no, it's a lot more.
[02:20:01.812 --> 02:20:03.793]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:03.793 --> 02:20:10.757]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:20:10.757 --> 02:20:19.162]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:19.162 --> 02:20:24.885]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:25.185 --> 02:20:25.586]  I don't know.
[02:20:43.766 --> 02:20:46.349]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:47.070]  That's 866-295-5305.
[02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:48.512]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[02:20:48.512 --> 02:20:50.394]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[02:20:50.394 --> 02:20:51.195]  Or HBextract.com.
[02:21:01.613 --> 02:21:08.379]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.379 --> 02:21:11.021]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:11.021 --> 02:21:12.562]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.562 --> 02:21:13.363]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.363 --> 02:21:14.223]  This is his ammo.
[02:21:14.223 --> 02:21:15.725]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.725 --> 02:21:17.306]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.706 --> 02:21:24.869]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.869 --> 02:21:25.349]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:31.712]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.712 --> 02:21:35.153]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.393 --> 02:21:45.677]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.677 --> 02:21:46.897]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:58.021]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:03.211]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.211 --> 02:22:04.991]  September 22nd, 2008.
[02:22:04.991 --> 02:22:06.492]  Gold open this morning at $8.7970.
[02:22:06.492 --> 02:22:10.513]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $9.0545, $4.5273 for half ounce, and $2.2636 for quarter ounce.
[02:22:10.513 --> 02:22:10.933]  That's $9.0545, $4.5273, and $2.2636.
[02:22:19.424 --> 02:22:31.971]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:22:31.971 --> 02:22:35.133]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:22:35.133 --> 02:22:38.474]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:22:38.474 --> 02:22:41.316]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:22:41.576 --> 02:22:44.378]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:22:44.378 --> 02:22:47.279]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.279 --> 02:22:49.580]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:50.421]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.421 --> 02:22:56.164]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.164 --> 02:22:56.364]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.395 --> 02:23:06.218]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[02:23:06.218 --> 02:23:13.203]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:23:13.203 --> 02:23:14.784]  Here is why.
[02:23:14.784 --> 02:23:24.711]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the US.
[02:23:25.231 --> 02:23:27.953]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[02:23:27.953 --> 02:23:30.075]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[02:23:30.075 --> 02:23:31.055]  this fall?
[02:23:31.055 --> 02:23:32.056]  Don't wait.

[02:24:04.804 --> 02:24:05.504]  We're back live.
[02:24:05.504 --> 02:24:07.206]  Here are some of the headlines.
[02:24:07.206 --> 02:24:10.429]  Stocks slide amid bailout jitters.
[02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:11.230]  Oil rally.
[02:24:15.327 --> 02:24:17.068]  Another report here.
[02:24:17.068 --> 02:24:20.089]  Rescue plan equals dollar killer.
[02:24:20.089 --> 02:24:21.649]  That's CNBC.
[02:24:21.649 --> 02:24:24.050]  Japanese bank to buy stake in Morgan Stanley.
[02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:25.370]  Trying to prop that up.
[02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:28.431]  Oil spikes above 117 on banking rescue plan.
[02:24:28.431 --> 02:24:31.352]  Up about $20.
[02:24:31.352 --> 02:24:32.392]  It just goes on and on.
[02:24:32.392 --> 02:24:36.534]  Bailout plan boosts stagflation risk.
[02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:38.414]  It just goes on and on.
[02:24:38.414 --> 02:24:40.915]  And this is going to be very, very serious.
[02:24:42.141 --> 02:24:48.664]  Ted, now understand, listeners, the offer you're getting is lower than even the ads you hear on the air.
[02:24:48.664 --> 02:24:50.685]  Ted, explain the deal people are getting.
[02:24:50.685 --> 02:24:53.506]  I mean, that is a super deal on gold and silver you just offered.
[02:24:53.506 --> 02:24:56.187]  I mean, explain those numbers for people that are laymen.
[02:24:56.827 --> 02:24:57.668]  Here's the point.
[02:24:57.668 --> 02:25:00.772]  I mean, the dimes, obviously, they're U.S.
[02:25:00.772 --> 02:25:01.613]  currency.
[02:25:01.613 --> 02:25:03.635]  It's something that you can use here as money.
[02:25:03.635 --> 02:25:05.157]  People understand what a dime is.
[02:25:05.157 --> 02:25:07.339]  It's back when they're made out of silver.
[02:25:07.339 --> 02:25:08.761]  And it's something that you can put away.
[02:25:08.761 --> 02:25:13.887]  You don't have to worry about the government getting involved with this stuff because we specifically set it aside for those reasons.
[02:25:14.688 --> 02:25:15.348]  I think so.
[02:25:29.424 --> 02:25:31.005]  Just, you know, what do we come up off of?
[02:25:31.005 --> 02:25:33.986]  The 700s, and it's just shot up into the 900s.
[02:25:33.986 --> 02:25:35.206]  Well, guess what?
[02:25:35.206 --> 02:25:38.107]  1050s right around the corner, and that was the last peak.
[02:25:38.107 --> 02:25:39.187]  I can't say it enough.
[02:25:39.187 --> 02:25:49.771]  When you have the Secretary of the Treasury, and you have the Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve System right now telling you, hey boys, buckle down on the hatches here, if we got an economic storm,
[02:25:50.351 --> 02:25:51.152]  It's for real.
[02:25:51.152 --> 02:25:52.353]  This is real serious.
[02:25:52.353 --> 02:25:53.995]  You have to do something.
[02:25:53.995 --> 02:26:01.683]  And if you're looking at your stock portfolio, and you're looking at your bonds, and for God's sakes, if you have annuities right now, they're not insured.
[02:26:01.683 --> 02:26:03.224]  Get yourself... Yeah, that's key.
[02:26:03.224 --> 02:26:04.085]  They are not.
[02:26:04.085 --> 02:26:05.787]  The annuities are not insured.
[02:26:06.614 --> 02:26:17.718]  Uh, the banks are not safe, ladies and gentlemen, and the FDIC is almost out of its $50 billion to pay out to people needing their deposits, and the bank failure's haven't even begun.
[02:26:17.718 --> 02:26:21.520]  We've had a few dozen, and they're talking about a thousand conservatively now.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:38.754]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to transfer money out of the bank into other assets, and I believe gold and silver is what at least 10-20% of what your assets should be in, and I will get into it before it explodes.
[02:26:38.754 --> 02:26:45.760]  Here is the toll-free number to take advantage of the gold and silver offers that Ted has today that are just insanely low prices.
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:45.820]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:26:50.223 --> 02:26:53.006]  I mean, Ted, explain to people.
[02:26:53.006 --> 02:26:54.427]  When did you set this price?
[02:26:54.427 --> 02:26:56.589]  This price is set at what level?
[02:26:56.589 --> 02:26:59.953]  I set it yesterday before the prices went up today.
[02:26:59.953 --> 02:27:06.199]  I mean, I'm always trying to put something together so we can talk about something, and it just happens to be that the markets are cooperating so well.
[02:27:06.539 --> 02:27:09.702]  So when gold was 30 plus dollars lower is when you bought into this gold.
[02:27:09.702 --> 02:27:10.944]  I mean even if you bought it at
[02:27:23.577 --> 02:27:25.038]  Above those levels, it'd be a great deal.
[02:27:25.038 --> 02:27:28.939]  This is below what it's now trading for, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:28.939 --> 02:27:29.620]  That is the key.
[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:29.680]  800-686-2237.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.160]  800-686-2237.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.862]  And it makes me feel good when people go out, liberals go out and buy guns and take a shooting lesson and properly stow them.
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.301]  Makes me feel good when folks start eating organic, stop using cell phones.
[02:27:47.301 --> 02:27:49.202]  It makes me feel good when you get gold and silver.
[02:27:49.202 --> 02:27:50.402]  I believe in this.
[02:27:50.402 --> 02:27:51.742]  I believe in this company.
[02:27:51.742 --> 02:27:53.223]  And I believe it's only going to go up.
[02:27:53.223 --> 02:27:58.564]  But regardless, it can't be devalued overnight like the dollar is and can be.
[02:27:58.564 --> 02:28:00.865]  And so it gives you that sense of security.
[02:28:00.865 --> 02:28:02.126]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:28:02.126 --> 02:28:02.486]  800-686-2237.
[02:28:02.486 --> 02:28:04.466]  And you're listening to this tonight at midnight.
[02:28:07.467 --> 02:28:11.350]  There will still be people there at 10, 11 tonight if you want to call.
[02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:16.673]  Now the way gold is rising, Ted, you keep telling the folks you sell out of this stuff and prices go up.
[02:28:16.673 --> 02:28:20.716]  How long can you hold this at 30-something bucks below what it's trading?
[02:28:20.716 --> 02:28:26.640]  I'm going to hold it until midnight tonight for sure, and then if the markets cooperate, we'll go ahead and do it again tomorrow.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:28.701]  That's midnight Central Standard Time?
[02:28:28.701 --> 02:28:30.242]  Yep, midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:28:30.882 --> 02:28:34.305]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:36.187]  You can talk to Mr. Larson.
[02:28:36.187 --> 02:28:38.228]  Ted, I know, has even been getting in on taking some of the trades.
[02:28:38.228 --> 02:28:39.729]  Things are so busy.
[02:28:39.729 --> 02:28:40.810]  The phones are ringing off the hook.
[02:28:40.810 --> 02:28:42.071]  If they don't answer, leave your name and number.
[02:28:42.071 --> 02:28:42.992]  They'll call you right back.
[02:28:42.992 --> 02:28:43.032]  800-686-2237.
[02:28:48.436 --> 02:28:53.338]  Folks, I wouldn't just sit there like a schmuck, counting on the banks being there, the dollar not being devalued.
[02:28:53.338 --> 02:28:57.420]  It's a guarantee they are going to kill the dollar.
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:29:06.143]  They may remonetize it and call it something else or do something later, but in the next four or five years... Gentlemen, do you disagree with the fact the dollar has got to be toast?
[02:29:07.737 --> 02:29:16.760]  Alex, with what's going on, I mean, we have the lead, the people that had the value of the currency, the Federal Reserve System, they're saying the dollar is going to be toast.
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:24.202]  That we have no choice but then to go in and continue to buy and bail out and cause more economic upheavals.
[02:29:24.902 --> 02:29:27.525]  Now again, they're not going to protect you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:33.451]  They're going to leave you holding the debt and try to have paramilitary police extract it from you at the barrel of a gun through taxation.
[02:29:33.451 --> 02:29:34.432]  They're raping you.
[02:29:34.432 --> 02:29:35.994]  America's going down.
[02:29:35.994 --> 02:29:40.078]  Thousands of times the debt compared to what there really is in real assets.
[02:29:40.078 --> 02:29:40.939]  Get into Real Assets 800-686-2237.
[02:29:40.939 --> 02:29:42.461]  Ted, Tim, thanks for talking to me.
[02:29:46.685 --> 02:29:47.406]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:47.406 --> 02:29:47.827]  Take care, Alex.
[02:29:47.827 --> 02:29:51.993]  All right, folks, we'll be right back with a huge guest, and we'll be live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.993 --> 02:29:53.115]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.115 --> 02:29:55.639]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.639 --> 02:29:58.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.676 --> 02:30:05.101]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:30:05.101 --> 02:30:07.424]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:30:07.424 --> 02:30:10.708]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:30:10.708 --> 02:30:17.597]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:30:17.597 --> 02:30:19.720]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:23.501]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:30:23.501 --> 02:30:28.284]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:30:28.284 --> 02:30:32.205]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:30:32.205 --> 02:30:33.846]  Travel less, meet online.
[02:30:33.846 --> 02:30:36.507]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[02:30:36.507 --> 02:30:42.450]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[02:30:42.450 --> 02:30:43.230]  Remember that code.
[02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:46.411]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:30:46.411 --> 02:30:47.311]  And we knew what to do.
[02:31:09.833 --> 02:31:11.095]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:18.144]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:31:18.144 --> 02:31:23.291]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[02:31:24.252 --> 02:31:27.015]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:27.015 --> 02:31:34.123]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:34.123 --> 02:31:37.286]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:37.286 --> 02:31:42.371]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:31:43.052 --> 02:31:46.155]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:31:46.155 --> 02:31:52.059]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:31:52.059 --> 02:31:55.122]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:31:55.122 --> 02:32:10.053]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:32:10.053 --> 02:32:11.915]  You've heard the commercials on Life Change T.
[02:32:12.782 --> 02:32:16.384]  The all-natural clean your system and lose weight product.
[02:32:16.384 --> 02:32:18.465]  Well, maybe you don't believe.
[02:32:18.465 --> 02:32:21.047]  Or you can go to LifeChangeT.com.
[02:32:21.047 --> 02:32:22.348]  Read up on us.
[02:32:22.348 --> 02:32:29.432]  You have nothing to lose but weight.
[02:32:29.432 --> 02:32:30.472]  Federal agents!
[02:32:30.472 --> 02:32:31.153]  We are armed!
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:47.063]  Well, our guest is Roger D. Masters, Department of Government, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.
[02:32:47.063 --> 02:32:57.750]  He's a research professor at Dartmouth College, a Nelson A. Rockefeller Professor of Government Emeritus at Dartmouth College and President of the Foundation for Neuroscience and Society.
[02:32:58.934 --> 02:33:03.757]  And if I went over his bio, it would take a long time to cover it.
[02:33:03.757 --> 02:33:06.499]  After undergraduate study at Harvard, B.A.
[02:33:06.499 --> 02:33:17.367]  55, and service in the Army, Masters completed graduate work in political philosophy at the University of Chicago, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation under the direction of Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey.
[02:33:18.047 --> 02:33:21.370]  And that's Leo Strauss, the big neocon kingpin.
[02:33:21.370 --> 02:33:28.856]  The central theme of Master's work is the philosophic and scientific exploration of the role of human nature in political and social behavior.
[02:33:28.856 --> 02:33:35.721]  Now, there's so much about this guy, his bio is about 100 pages long, that for the next hour we have him.
[02:33:35.721 --> 02:33:37.202]  I just want to let him introduce himself.
[02:33:39.724 --> 02:34:04.597]  You know, tell you the stuff about him he thinks you should know and then I want to get into one of his big areas of research and in documenting is the fact that when they started putting fluoride and different derivatives of it in the water supply and why they do that and what the facts are you can go check for yourselves and of course his work ties into why is lawn fertilizer different than crop fertilizer?
[02:34:04.597 --> 02:34:08.479]  Well, why do they say with lawn fertilizer don't put it on crops or your garden?
[02:34:09.821 --> 02:34:11.963]  Because it's toxic waste.
[02:34:11.963 --> 02:34:14.544]  It's the same thing with depleted uranium.
[02:34:14.544 --> 02:34:19.808]  They've got all these thousands and tens of thousands, more than that, millions of tons of it.
[02:34:19.808 --> 02:34:20.889]  They've got to put it somewhere.
[02:34:20.889 --> 02:34:22.890]  It's very poisonous and radioactive.
[02:34:22.890 --> 02:34:23.911]  So they put it into weapons.
[02:34:24.853 --> 02:34:26.814]  It's hiding it in plain view.
[02:34:26.814 --> 02:34:38.622]  And so, we will discuss this today because, you see, fluoride is only a catchphrase or an overall name that they were able to pass laws through Congress for.
[02:34:38.622 --> 02:34:46.267]  It's what goes along with what you know as fluoride in the water, and that's what he is an expert on, among other things.
[02:34:46.267 --> 02:34:51.651]  And so, we're very honored to have Roger D. Masters on with us today.
[02:34:51.651 --> 02:34:52.732]  Thanks for coming on, Professor.
[02:34:53.516 --> 02:34:54.577]  It's my pleasure.
[02:34:54.577 --> 02:34:55.998]  Thank you very much for inviting me.
[02:34:55.998 --> 02:34:57.419]  I appreciate it a great deal.
[02:34:57.419 --> 02:34:57.820]  You bet.
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:03.685]  How did somebody who was under Leo Strauss get into the work of trying to warn people about fluoride in the water?
[02:35:03.685 --> 02:35:18.917]  Well, Strauss was an amazing thinker, and he wanted us to read a great book to try and find out what that writer, whether it was Rousseau or Plato or whoever, what he was really trying to say that might be true.
[02:35:20.208 --> 02:35:30.650]  The whole point about Western civilization is that we're a civilization that uses science to try to find out what is nature and human nature, what's the truth about it.
[02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:46.413]  And after a certain time, I realized that I was teaching all these old books like Plato or so, and that sometimes modern biology was, or modern science, was showing that what they were saying in these books was false.
[02:35:48.234 --> 02:35:57.162]  And I thought, gee, you know, I've got to tell people that this book, you know, John Locke saying that the brain is a blank slate.
[02:35:57.162 --> 02:36:00.365]  Well, your brain isn't a blank slate.
[02:36:00.365 --> 02:36:03.627]  It's a much more complicated piece of meat than that.
[02:36:03.627 --> 02:36:06.190]  Jack, I've got to explain that's wrong.
[02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:10.753]  Or, Rousseau says, humans were originally individuals running around all alone in the state of nature.
[02:36:10.753 --> 02:36:13.476]  And then I read about chimpanzees, and oh, they're not like that.
[02:36:13.476 --> 02:36:14.837]  Oh, I've got to explain he was wrong.
[02:36:16.145 --> 02:36:21.446]  And so I've been working on that for a long time, and one thing leads to another.
[02:36:21.446 --> 02:36:27.307]  How did you get into research on, at the end of the Manhattan Project, dumping it in the water supply?
[02:36:27.307 --> 02:36:36.169]  I mean, I want to start at the beginning and walk through that, but first tell us what in your research led you to the mass chemical poisoning of the population?
[02:36:36.169 --> 02:36:44.831]  What happened was I started thinking in just general terms about biology and human nature, and I went to a conference.
[02:36:45.922 --> 02:37:01.867]  And I heard a retired oil executive named Brett Hodges from California give a presentation on how violent criminals have high levels of either lead or manganese in their blood.
[02:37:01.867 --> 02:37:14.951]  And this was very interesting to me, that we were putting pollution in the environment, and everybody said lead toys are bad, and you know, pollution is bad, but they don't talk about how it might change the chemistry of your brain.
[02:37:16.249 --> 02:37:17.429]  And so I decided to study that.
[02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:25.551]  Well, that's the old saying of mad as a hatter, because in the dying process they were using mercury and lead and things, and so you'd be mad as a hatter.
[02:37:25.551 --> 02:37:26.912]  Oh, sure, sure.
[02:37:26.912 --> 02:37:40.735]  And besides, what seems to have happened is that I mentioned this idea of a blind flight, because there's this whole idea that everything we do is stuff we learn, and there's no reason for understanding biology, because it's deterministic or something.
[02:37:40.735 --> 02:37:44.396]  When really, you would say, what, 80% is nature instead of nurture?
[02:37:46.192 --> 02:37:52.996]  Well, I think that we ought to start, just forget that and look at the facts.
[02:37:52.996 --> 02:38:07.543]  One of the things that Mr. Strauss taught us, he advised me when I finished my work, is always teach as if it's a silent student class who knows more than you do.
[02:38:07.543 --> 02:38:15.067]  He wasn't an ideologist himself, some of his students were, but if you imagine that, I have to imagine that there are some of your listeners
[02:38:15.828 --> 02:38:18.289]  We're going to know more than I do.
[02:38:18.289 --> 02:38:21.950]  And if I make mistakes, I want them to correct me.
[02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:39.077]  But if I think what makes our civilization special is this possibility of an open-minded study, so that if the government says, oh, it's a great thing to fluoridate water, and I come across the discovery, wait a second, what counts is which chemical you use,
[02:38:40.536 --> 02:38:45.739]  And we've got to re-look at that, and not just use one word, but say, wait a second, what are we actually doing?
[02:38:45.739 --> 02:38:46.700]  What's the science of it?
[02:38:46.700 --> 02:39:04.830]  So you're talking about kind of the private, individual, mass consciousness, or private intelligence agency, where we all integrate our own research, and then almost have our own private research going on, which then brings it all to a higher level.
[02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:08.892]  So let's get to the point when you bump in... Let me explain how I got into this.
[02:39:09.505 --> 02:39:20.354]  That is, I started to look at pollution with lead and manganese, and I had to figure out, well, what does lead do to the brain?
[02:39:20.354 --> 02:39:34.345]  Now, lead has an effect on a particular chemical in the brain, a neurotransmitter called dopamine, and if you have a disturbed... Dopamine is the chemical that works all the centers of your brain,
[02:39:34.898 --> 02:39:37.179]  They're involved in making judgments.
[02:39:37.179 --> 02:39:43.002]  It controls impulsiveness until you decide what's a good thing to do.
[02:39:43.002 --> 02:39:50.725]  And so, I realized that there was a science about this that Americans had to know about.
[02:39:50.725 --> 02:40:03.831]  Because if Americans don't know why lead is bad, or why manganese is bad, and they don't know that pollution means that a company says, oh, it's too expensive to clean up this pollution.
[02:40:05.256 --> 02:40:09.138]  But they're poisoning the kids!
[02:40:09.138 --> 02:40:12.600]  So I said, well, how is it poisoning the kids?
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:14.061]  And so I began to do studies.
[02:40:14.061 --> 02:40:16.323]  A simple study.
[02:40:16.323 --> 02:40:21.005]  There are some counties in the United States where the EPA reports there's lead pollution.
[02:40:21.005 --> 02:40:24.587]  And other counties where they report there's manganese pollution.
[02:40:24.587 --> 02:40:31.091]  And I said, well, what kind of behavior is connected with lead pollution that we can measure?
[02:40:31.091 --> 02:40:33.853]  Well, I remember, oh, Fred Harker said violent crime, right?
[02:40:34.537 --> 02:40:36.078]  Well, we have good data on violent crime.
[02:40:36.078 --> 02:40:38.178]  You know, we keep track of how many people kill other people.
[02:40:38.178 --> 02:40:45.421]  And so you can take the data on where areas have more lead contamination, and then you look at the areas where they have crime statistics, and voila!
[02:40:45.421 --> 02:40:48.662]  They lay over each other quite nicely, don't they?
[02:40:48.662 --> 02:40:49.982]  Absolutely.
[02:40:49.982 --> 02:40:57.144]  And to give you one example of that, which is just fantastic, we did something that was right when we banned leaded gasoline.
[02:40:57.144 --> 02:41:01.646]  Because when we banned leaded gasoline, it had the effect of reducing the crime rate.
[02:41:02.625 --> 02:41:03.946]  But not right away.
[02:41:03.946 --> 02:41:04.827]  Crime rate dropped in 1991.
[02:41:04.827 --> 02:41:11.134]  It was when the first generation of kids whose mothers weren't exposed to lead when they were pregnant.
[02:41:13.621 --> 02:41:18.204]  And they weren't exposed anymore, so much, because there was no more leaded gas.
[02:41:18.204 --> 02:41:23.308]  And that first generation, when they got to be 17 or 18, their criminal behavior just dropped way off.
[02:41:23.308 --> 02:41:28.371]  And for those that don't know, in the 70s and 80s, it was just liquor store robberies, murder.
[02:41:28.371 --> 02:41:29.872]  The murder rate was a lot higher.
[02:41:29.872 --> 02:41:32.254]  I mean, it was really dangerous.
[02:41:32.254 --> 02:41:32.914]  Absolutely.
[02:41:32.914 --> 02:41:35.696]  And the cars were driving around shooting lead out the back.
[02:41:35.696 --> 02:41:36.757]  That's right.
[02:41:36.757 --> 02:41:40.379]  Which makes you violent, in thousands of studies.
[02:41:40.379 --> 02:41:42.361]  Sure, but I discovered there are lots of other things.
[02:41:43.288 --> 02:42:12.579]  If you live in a community with a lot of old housing, since lead paint is on both the inside and outside of the old housing, and people point out that kids find the taste of lead paint sweet, so they're more likely that the tip of paint actually is something to eat it, but it's also true that, for instance, in the Ninth Ward in New Orleans, which was reputed to be terribly violent, you must have heard of that, there's a scientist down there
[02:42:14.071 --> 02:42:23.198]  We did some work and we found out that the big source of lead in the kids down there on 9th Ward was the grass strip between the sidewalk and the street.
[02:42:23.198 --> 02:42:31.084]  If the lead gas came out of those cars back before lead gas was banned, as particles in the atmosphere, it dropped in the ground and it's inert.
[02:42:31.084 --> 02:42:32.405]  It just stays there forever.
[02:42:32.405 --> 02:42:41.953]  So it gets in the grass and the grass is wet one day and the kid's running down the street and he falls down and they put his hand in the grass and he licks his hand and before you know it, he's got the lead in his body.
[02:42:43.354 --> 02:42:56.622]  That is, you have to realize that there are many ways you can drive, as I put it, there's many ways to drive from Boston to Chicago, and there's many ways that a toxic chemical can get into kids.
[02:42:56.622 --> 02:43:02.686]  And if we get at this, we can cut down the cost of two things.
[02:43:02.686 --> 02:43:03.986]  Three things, actually, that are important.
[02:43:03.986 --> 02:43:06.348]  First, learning disabilities.
[02:43:06.348 --> 02:43:11.191]  Special Ed is about $15,000 a year per kid, on some estimates.
[02:43:11.191 --> 02:43:11.751]  I got evidence
[02:43:16.837 --> 02:43:18.617]  Well obviously, let me stop you.
[02:43:18.617 --> 02:43:34.643]  I mean, lead, arsenic, mercury, fluoride, professor, and of course we should add you've won a lot of international awards for your research, groundbreaking, and now I'm just accepted basically as fact because it is, but they knew 200 years ago that lead and mercury
[02:43:36.414 --> 02:43:39.435]  Well, first of all, I want to raise a question for you with what you just said.
[02:44:06.388 --> 02:44:15.372]  It's not so clear that fluoride itself is always the problem.
[02:44:15.372 --> 02:44:19.854]  I bet you know somebody who uses toothpaste with sodium fluoride in it.
[02:44:19.854 --> 02:44:22.195]  Yes.
[02:44:22.195 --> 02:44:26.618]  And you have to have an awful lot of fluoride to cause a problem.
[02:44:26.618 --> 02:44:31.560]  And obviously if you have too much of anything, get above a certain level, it's really bad news.
[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:43.463]  But see, that's the thing, Professor, people don't know that the word fluoride is a coverall for dumping hundreds of things in the water, so maybe we should get to that and then break down the history of it, but go ahead.
[02:44:43.463 --> 02:44:59.208]  Alright, well, look, the main thing is that in putting fluoride in the water, instead of sodium fluoride, most of it, over 90% of it, uses one of two chemicals, either something called fluorosilicic acid,
[02:45:00.031 --> 02:45:00.431]  We're good.
[02:45:22.354 --> 02:45:28.077]  The fluoride and the fluorine and the sodium atoms separate.
[02:45:28.077 --> 02:45:40.943]  If the fluorine sticks to your teeth, the evidence was at the time that it toughens the surface of your teeth, so it's supposed to cut down cavities.
[02:45:40.943 --> 02:45:50.227]  Now, the whole problem with these other chemicals, generally called silicon fluorides, is that they have this other chunk to them, the two hydrogens, the silicon,
[02:45:50.808 --> 02:45:52.650]  And actually one or two fluorides.
[02:45:52.650 --> 02:45:54.651]  It's a chemical.
[02:45:54.651 --> 02:45:59.716]  The chemist I work with, everything in this is done with a chemist named Mark A. Copeland.
[02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:06.122]  I really owe him a great deal because he's the one who got me started on looking at fluoride compounds.
[02:46:06.122 --> 02:46:17.952]  He calls it an oligomer of silicic acid, which is a fancy word for just saying there's a chemical there that's left over after you put the silico fluoride into the water.
[02:46:18.855 --> 02:46:22.898]  The real question is, why are we putting them in the water?
[02:46:22.898 --> 02:46:24.519]  And so I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:46:24.519 --> 02:46:35.847]  What agency of the federal government do you think decided to design the idea and got people to start putting a fluoride compound, not fluoride, it's a fluoride compound, in water supply?
[02:46:35.847 --> 02:46:47.936]  The Department of Energy, after they had all these millions of tons of toxic waste piled up, and they had some spills in Tennessee and other places, that
[02:46:49.079 --> 02:46:59.244]  Well, I know that it was the Department of Energy that went around all the cities and lobbied everybody, but, I mean, go ahead, give us the history, Professor.
[02:46:59.244 --> 02:47:04.747]  The history goes back to World War II.
[02:47:04.747 --> 02:47:12.631]  Yeah, the Manhattan Project, but I'm saying after... Actually, the history goes back before that, because... Well, tell us the whole history, then.
[02:47:12.631 --> 02:47:13.492]  That's why we've got you here.
[02:47:13.492 --> 02:47:15.313]  You're the expert on this.
[02:47:15.313 --> 02:47:17.934]  Well, the history begins, actually,
[02:47:18.981 --> 02:47:26.223]  With Einstein coming to the United States and writing that letter to Roosevelt about the possibility of making a bomb that would make a huge explosion.
[02:47:26.223 --> 02:47:33.425]  You know, Einstein wrote Roosevelt a letter about the possibility of having a nuclear bomb.
[02:47:33.425 --> 02:47:38.227]  Then the Germans took over Czechoslovakia, called the Anschluss.
[02:47:38.227 --> 02:47:45.269]  That was one of the things that triggered World War II, but when the Nazis went into Czechoslovakia, why'd they pick that place?
[02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:46.509]  They occupied the place
[02:47:47.406 --> 02:47:51.029]  With the best uranium in Europe.
[02:47:51.029 --> 02:48:01.678]  Now, one thing we forget is that when Einstein came to the United States as a brilliant physicist, there are other brilliant physicists who stayed in Germany.
[02:48:01.678 --> 02:48:03.579]  Like Max Planck!
[02:48:03.579 --> 02:48:09.204]  Yeah, and Hitler began a nuclear weapons project.
[02:48:09.204 --> 02:48:16.370]  Now, in fact, we know two things about that worth mentioning, because I want the audience to have in mind that
[02:48:17.472 --> 02:48:20.775]  This is all secret during World War II.
[02:48:20.775 --> 02:48:26.279]  This question of whether Hitler had the bomb, whether we didn't want anybody to know we were working on a bomb.
[02:48:26.279 --> 02:48:27.100]  Well, he really did.
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:33.004]  We only had enough to test one at the end of the... near the end of the war, they did that secret deal.
[02:48:33.004 --> 02:48:39.509]  I'm sure you know about this, Professor, with the U-boat trading in exchange for safety in South America.
[02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:44.293]  Sure, but the question is, first of all,
[02:48:47.698 --> 02:49:14.979]  What is not generally known is that there's a question of why Hitler didn't make more progress with the Great Physicist, and there's a rumor, it's never been proved, we have no evidence for it, it's a guess, that some nuclear physicist, and perhaps the Great Physicist, Heisenberg, arranged for the experiments to fail, because they didn't want Hitler to have
[02:49:16.519 --> 02:49:24.324]  Well, the one thing we do know is that Hitler had a huge supply of uranium that he had separated.
[02:49:24.324 --> 02:49:27.286]  You have to separate uranium from other elements in rock.
[02:49:27.286 --> 02:49:29.047]  It's a little difficult to enrich it.
[02:49:29.047 --> 02:49:32.129]  You know, all this stuff we hear about the centrifuges now.
[02:49:32.129 --> 02:49:37.192]  You have to do something to make the uranium into a state where it can cause a bomb.
[02:49:37.192 --> 02:49:45.497]  And Hitler put his uranium in a place in Norway called Penemun, where he put the uranium in something called heavy water, which was
[02:49:46.477 --> 02:49:49.459]  Which absorbs radiation so it couldn't explode.
[02:49:49.459 --> 02:49:53.122]  They weren't sure what to do with their uranium so it wouldn't have an accident.
[02:49:53.122 --> 02:49:57.386]  And it didn't want to be in Germany because they were afraid it would vomit, so they put it in Norway.
[02:49:57.386 --> 02:49:58.386]  And so they sent in U.S.
[02:49:58.386 --> 02:50:02.489]  forces that followed it when it went across the lake on the barge and sunk it.
[02:50:02.489 --> 02:50:04.031]  That's right.
[02:50:04.031 --> 02:50:09.115]  So we destroyed his uranium and that set that whole thing way back.
[02:50:09.115 --> 02:50:12.918]  Hitler himself was apparently not as good as there are some reports.
[02:50:13.968 --> 02:50:23.334]  As interested in that as some of the scientists anyway, so... Uh, we were lucky, I suppose, on that score, but... Well, have you seen the German maps on what their A-bomb is gonna do to Manhattan?
[02:50:23.334 --> 02:50:25.475]  But it was so late in the war, they decided the U.S.
[02:50:25.475 --> 02:50:29.878]  would annihilate them with conventional weapons, so they made a deal.
[02:50:29.878 --> 02:50:34.080]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar, or your own financial future?
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:37.282]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line?
[02:50:37.282 --> 02:50:41.145]  It is uranium, and that set that whole thing way back.
[02:50:41.145 --> 02:50:43.286]  Uh, Hitler himself was apparently not as...
[02:50:45.326 --> 02:50:57.798]  Well, we've seen the German maps on what their A-bomb is going to do to Manhattan, but it was so late in the war they decided the U.S.
[02:50:57.798 --> 02:51:00.400]  would annihilate them with conventional weapons, so they made a deal.
[02:51:02.108 --> 02:51:06.311]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[02:51:06.311 --> 02:51:11.295]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[02:51:11.295 --> 02:51:16.619]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[02:51:16.619 --> 02:51:18.540]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:27.222]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[02:51:27.222 --> 02:51:32.183]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[02:51:32.183 --> 02:51:38.405]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[02:51:38.405 --> 02:51:43.846]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[02:51:43.846 --> 02:51:48.307]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.

[02:51:57.214 --> 02:51:59.656]  1-866-323-5665.
[02:51:59.656 --> 02:52:08.844]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:08.844 --> 02:52:10.525]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:11.466 --> 02:52:13.007]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:13.007 --> 02:52:13.807]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.807 --> 02:52:14.847]  This is his ammo.
[02:52:14.847 --> 02:52:16.187]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:16.187 --> 02:52:18.168]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:18.168 --> 02:52:25.310]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:25.310 --> 02:52:25.810]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.810 --> 02:52:31.432]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:32.152 --> 02:52:35.635]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.635 --> 02:52:38.458]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:53:01.972 --> 02:53:04.934]  Every week, thousands of violent crimes are committed.
[02:53:04.934 --> 02:53:07.055]  Don't let yourself become a statistic.
[02:53:07.055 --> 02:53:07.936]  Be smart.
[02:53:07.936 --> 02:53:08.716]  Be safe.
[02:53:08.716 --> 02:53:11.038]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[02:53:26.648 --> 02:53:26.788]  99.88 today.
[02:53:35.495 --> 02:53:37.578]  Roger Masters is our guest.
[02:53:37.578 --> 02:53:40.601]  A lot of his material is published online.
[02:53:40.601 --> 02:53:55.298]  He's a top academic and professor at Dartmouth School of Government, Department of Government, with an Elson A. Rockefeller Professor of Government chair, basically, and he was under the
[02:53:57.133 --> 02:53:59.374]  Head honcho of the neocons, Leo Strauss.
[02:53:59.374 --> 02:54:03.656]  Before he leaves us, I'll get him to diverge and get a little bit into that.
[02:54:03.656 --> 02:54:09.539]  But he got into researching what is fluoride, what are the different types of fluoride, why is it being put in the water.
[02:54:09.539 --> 02:54:15.682]  We now have all these studies from all over the world, what it does, and boy, it is not pretty.
[02:54:15.682 --> 02:54:19.324]  But he doesn't even want to get into that issue, he just wants to get into why it was put there.
[02:54:19.324 --> 02:54:20.924]  And so, okay, but please continue.
[02:54:20.924 --> 02:54:23.926]  You've gotten up to the German atomic program.
[02:54:24.793 --> 02:54:27.573]  I want to get through why it was put there and focus on what it does.
[02:54:27.573 --> 02:54:30.414]  I want to spend most of this time on what it does.
[02:54:30.414 --> 02:54:37.335]  I want to explain, though, that the start of putting any fluoride in water was super secret.
[02:54:37.335 --> 02:54:39.556]  Because the Manhattan Project had a problem in the 1940s.
[02:54:39.556 --> 02:54:47.097]  They didn't want anybody to know how far advanced we were in making a bomb.
[02:54:47.097 --> 02:54:52.758]  And we only had a very poor level of a supply of uranium in the United States.
[02:54:52.758 --> 02:54:53.958]  It's in rocks.
[02:54:54.736 --> 02:55:04.079]  I mean, kind of granite rocks that you have to break down and grind up and then put an acid in to separate the various elements.
[02:55:04.079 --> 02:55:12.161]  And so it's a little bit complicated to get the uranium out compared to what Hitler had in Czechoslovakia.
[02:55:12.161 --> 02:55:18.983]  And the consequence of that is that you had a waste product that was a very powerful acid.
[02:55:18.983 --> 02:55:21.964]  And the scientist who was responsible for
[02:55:22.668 --> 02:55:27.270]  The machinery to separate out that toxic acid from the sludge.
[02:55:27.270 --> 02:55:30.852]  A man named Byron Copeland.
[02:55:30.852 --> 02:55:31.572]  Chemical engineer.
[02:55:31.572 --> 02:55:33.433]  Brilliant chemical engineer.
[02:55:33.433 --> 02:55:41.777]  When he heard that I was doing work on how love and manganese caused crime, or is associated with crime, he got in touch and said, do I know anything about silico fluorides?
[02:55:41.777 --> 02:55:43.558]  I said, I didn't know anything.
[02:55:43.558 --> 02:55:45.299]  I'd never even heard of them.
[02:55:45.299 --> 02:55:48.580]  And so I did all the work with him.
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:49.641]  This is all
[02:55:50.262 --> 02:55:50.702]  I think so.
[02:56:15.629 --> 02:56:27.198]  Who isn't afraid of saying, we're on a phone call like this, and he'll say, hey Roger, shut up and listen to me, because I've made a mistake in chemistry, and I make mistakes in chemistry, I rely on him.
[02:56:27.198 --> 02:56:41.230]  Science is about being able to engage in discussion, and so you should stop me any time when I get into the facts of the case that I've discovered, and say, well, what do I mean, or what about what, and so forth.
[02:56:41.230 --> 02:56:42.971]  Still, the big thing is that
[02:56:44.676 --> 02:56:55.419]  Because putting fluoride in water had to be secret, so people in Germany or Japan didn't know how much uranium we were processing.
[02:56:55.419 --> 02:56:58.399]  Everybody talked about putting fluoride in water.
[02:56:58.399 --> 02:57:05.701]  And the Manhattan Project started by putting sodium fluoride, which is the simple thing we have in toothpaste, in a couple of places.
[02:57:05.701 --> 02:57:09.082]  They compared two towns in New York, and there was no problem.
[02:57:09.082 --> 02:57:12.503]  And once they got it approved, they switched.
[02:57:12.503 --> 02:57:13.583]  And then they could dump
[02:57:14.341 --> 02:57:15.462]  Now let's be specific.
[02:57:15.462 --> 02:57:16.483]  You can have all the secret
[02:57:37.057 --> 02:57:52.943]  Operations you want, but if you've got so many thousand drums of this by-product at this plant, the Germans can come take photographs of it, observe it, and then know how much of the isotopes you need that you're able to extract.
[02:57:52.943 --> 02:58:01.327]  So they, quote, secretly start dumping it in the water, and then at the end of the war they've got to get rid of the toxic waste.
[02:58:01.327 --> 02:58:03.628]  So they just say, ah, it's nutritious!
[02:58:04.568 --> 02:58:07.410]  We'll be right back with our guests in just 70 seconds.
[02:58:07.410 --> 02:58:10.291]  Stay with us.
[02:58:10.291 --> 02:58:12.772]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:12.772 --> 02:58:25.239]  So many thousand drums of this by-product at this plant, the Germans can come take photographs of it, observe it, and then know how much of the isotopes you need that you're able to extract.
[02:58:25.239 --> 02:58:28.901]  So they, quote, secretly start dumping it in the water
[02:58:29.870 --> 02:58:33.611]  And then at the end of the war, they've got to get rid of the toxic waste.
[02:58:33.611 --> 02:58:36.872]  So they just say, ah, it's nutritious!
[02:58:36.872 --> 02:58:39.652]  We'll be right back with our guests in just 70 seconds.
[02:58:39.652 --> 02:58:40.492]  Stay with us.
[02:58:40.492 --> 02:58:43.253]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.253 --> 02:58:47.554]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.554 --> 02:58:48.634]  It is a big idea.
[02:58:48.634 --> 02:58:49.375]  A new world order.
[02:58:56.315 --> 02:59:01.223]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:59:01.223 --> 02:59:03.167]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:59:03.167 --> 02:59:06.853]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:59:06.853 --> 02:59:09.237]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:59:10.007 --> 02:59:20.355]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:59:20.355 --> 02:59:24.578]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for corruption.
[02:59:24.578 --> 02:59:36.527]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:36.527 --> 02:59:38.689]  We're about to get to the key of this interview.
[02:59:40.816 --> 02:59:47.261]  And that is the name fluoride blurring the whole debate.
[02:59:47.261 --> 02:59:48.642]  And we're not talking about fluoride.
[02:59:48.642 --> 02:59:52.165]  And as my guest was saying during the break to me, he said, look, it's not true.
[02:59:52.165 --> 02:59:55.968]  There hasn't been a lot of studies of what's actually being put in the water.
[02:59:55.968 --> 02:59:58.090]  There's been studies of sodium fluoride alone.
[02:59:58.090 --> 03:00:00.972]  He's actually absolutely right.
[03:00:00.972 --> 03:00:10.020]  The studies show that sodium fluoride alone, and he could differ, but the studies show increases in bone cancers in males, calcification of glands,
[03:00:11.755 --> 03:00:18.820]  But then he's going to come back and say, well, those are studies calling it fluoride, but it's really this other chemical compound that's a mixture of fluoride and other things.
[03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:26.166]  So, you know, really one of the world experts on this with the chemist, top chemist he's been working with.
[03:00:26.166 --> 03:00:27.007]  Please continue, sir.
[03:00:27.007 --> 03:00:28.688]  Let's get right into it.
[03:00:28.688 --> 03:00:29.048]  Okay.
[03:00:29.048 --> 03:00:34.312]  Well, look, let me start explaining things very simply.
[03:00:34.312 --> 03:00:41.318]  This silico fiber breaks down, first of all, it has the effect, which is very big, of increasing
[03:00:41.997 --> 03:00:49.944]  The amount of lead that a child will absorb if he's living in an old house with lead paint or any place in the environment where there's lead.
[03:00:49.944 --> 03:01:00.413]  So we did some studies in places where there was evidence of children's blood level by the community where they lived.
[03:01:00.413 --> 03:01:08.480]  Three big samples, one in Massachusetts, by county, one in New York State, by county, and then the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey is the third study.
[03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:17.634]  And three different, big, huge samples, uh, you know, one of 400,000 kids, and you just do statistical analysis.
[03:01:17.634 --> 03:01:30.060]  Okay, what's the average level, a percent of kids, for instance, who have more than, uh, what was the, the, uh, conventional level of danger, which is 10 micrograms per deciliter.
[03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:34.063]  That is, how many kids have high blood lead, or what's the average blood lead?
[03:01:34.063 --> 03:01:38.065]  What we found is that where there's silicon fluoride in the water,
[03:01:39.315 --> 03:01:44.637]  I've taken everything into consideration, like economics and race and everything else.
[03:01:44.637 --> 03:01:48.438]  Where there's silicone flying in the water, there's more lead in the kids.
[03:01:48.438 --> 03:01:59.141]  And it's partly because silicone is a complicated atom that combines a lot of other things, and the chemistry of that, that's not my business.
[03:01:59.141 --> 03:02:01.522]  What's my business is the effects of it.
[03:02:01.522 --> 03:02:06.003]  And all the statistics involve taking lots of things into consideration,
[03:02:06.852 --> 03:02:32.020]  And what we then found was that, oh, where there's pollution with lead, if there's also silicofluoride in the water compared to where there's pollution with lead and no silicofluoride, oh, where there's lead and silicofluoride, that adds another, roughly speaking, another 100 or 150 violent crimes for every 100,000 people drinking the water.
[03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:32.360]  Amazing.
[03:02:37.310 --> 03:02:42.074]  Interviewing chemists and doctors on this subject, they describe fluoride and the different variants of it.
[03:02:42.074 --> 03:02:44.856]  That's why Prozac's made out of it and so many other things.
[03:02:44.856 --> 03:02:49.680]  It's amazing because it's electrically basically charged and it just binds to everything.
[03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:51.381]  It goes through everything.
[03:02:51.381 --> 03:02:55.664]  It's really an active volatile thing to put that in dumbed-down layman's terms.
[03:02:55.664 --> 03:02:58.066]  Is that accurate?
[03:02:58.066 --> 03:03:00.428]  My concern is not with the fluoride.
[03:03:00.428 --> 03:03:06.873]  It's with this other chemical and the point is that this other chemical, silicon fluoride,
[03:03:07.577 --> 03:03:19.541]  When you put them in water, the German study by Westendorf in 1975 is the only major study in the literature, and it showed it had big effect on brain chemistry.
[03:03:19.541 --> 03:03:25.583]  Okay, so separately... Okay, we keep calling it fluoride, but there's a different family of different compounds.
[03:03:25.583 --> 03:03:28.384]  What are they putting in the water in the cities?
[03:03:28.384 --> 03:03:36.387]  Over 90% of water fluoridation uses one of these two silica fluorides, either phosphoric acid, which is a liquid,
[03:03:37.253 --> 03:03:43.977]  Or sodium silico fluoride, which is very close, closely resembles it, but it's solid and it's in pebbles.
[03:03:43.977 --> 03:03:45.258]  In little pebbles.
[03:03:45.258 --> 03:03:59.066]  But these silico fluorides are totally different from sodium fluoride, and they have these harmful effects on children or adults, and they have never been tested.
[03:03:59.066 --> 03:04:02.688]  The key thing, first of all, that they've never been tested.
[03:04:02.688 --> 03:04:03.969]  Don't take that, that's not my word.
[03:04:04.665 --> 03:04:13.993]  The National Toxicology Program, 2002, nominated these two chemicals for study on the grounds that their toxicology was not known.
[03:04:13.993 --> 03:04:18.096]  That is, the study of how they harm the brain or the body was not known.
[03:04:18.096 --> 03:04:19.857]  But it is known that they harm.
[03:04:19.857 --> 03:04:20.678]  Stay there.
[03:04:20.678 --> 03:04:21.078]  Stay there.
[03:04:21.078 --> 03:04:21.699]  A quick break.
[03:04:21.699 --> 03:04:22.820]  We'll be right back, Professor.
[03:04:29.878 --> 03:04:34.902]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll... ...that they've never been tested.
[03:04:34.902 --> 03:04:36.904]  Don't take that, that's not my word.
[03:04:36.904 --> 03:04:44.409]  The National Toxicology Program, in 2002, nominated these two chemicals for study on the ground.
[03:04:44.409 --> 03:04:46.111]  Their toxicology was not known.
[03:04:46.111 --> 03:04:50.394]  That is, the study of how they harm the brain or the body was not known.
[03:04:50.394 --> 03:04:52.135]  But it is known that they harm.
[03:04:52.135 --> 03:04:52.976]  Stay there.
[03:04:52.976 --> 03:04:53.396]  Stay there.
[03:04:53.396 --> 03:04:55.118]  A quick break, we'll be right back, Professor.
[03:05:02.091 --> 03:05:12.078]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scamming the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[03:05:12.078 --> 03:05:15.660]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:20.303]  Spray Your Plate is a spray on photoblocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[03:05:20.303 --> 03:05:26.788]  Spray Your Plate photoblocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images, making your plate unreadable.
[03:05:26.788 --> 03:05:31.971]  One can of photoblocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever, and is completely unreadable.
[03:05:32.071 --> 03:05:33.692]  Don't give your money to the state.
[03:05:33.692 --> 03:05:34.452]  Spray your plate!
[03:06:02.102 --> 03:06:08.870]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:11.513]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.513 --> 03:06:13.055]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:13.055 --> 03:06:13.876]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.876 --> 03:06:14.737]  This is his ammo.
[03:06:14.737 --> 03:06:16.239]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:16.239 --> 03:06:17.821]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:18.201 --> 03:06:25.365]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:25.365 --> 03:06:25.845]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.845 --> 03:06:32.189]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:32.189 --> 03:06:35.651]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.891 --> 03:06:46.178]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:46.178 --> 03:06:47.399]  Fabled enemies.

[03:06:54.944 --> 03:06:58.547]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:03.729 --> 03:07:09.370]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:07:09.370 --> 03:07:12.011]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:07:12.011 --> 03:07:15.672]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[03:07:15.672 --> 03:07:26.855]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[03:07:34.039 --> 03:07:35.340]  Big Brother.
[03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:37.120]  Mainstream media.
[03:07:37.120 --> 03:07:38.881]  Government cover-ups.
[03:07:38.881 --> 03:07:40.462]  You want answers?
[03:07:40.462 --> 03:07:42.002]  Well, so does he.
[03:07:42.002 --> 03:07:46.204]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:46.204 --> 03:07:50.266]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:04.634 --> 03:08:08.156]  This is really important information, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:08.156 --> 03:08:10.217]  I've got some more vital information.
[03:08:10.217 --> 03:08:13.218]  It'll be a surprise at the bottom of the hour after our guest leaves us.
[03:08:13.218 --> 03:08:17.440]  We've got to move quick, Professor, because we've only got about 21 minutes left with you.
[03:08:17.440 --> 03:08:25.083]  I think for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com listeners, though, I'm going to skip this next break coming up, because this is so important.
[03:08:25.083 --> 03:08:32.347]  And I've also got one of your studies here, the silico fluorides in higher blood lead, a national problem that particularly harms blacks.
[03:08:33.207 --> 03:08:42.750]  This is online as well, so before you leave, I want people to be able to go and read for themselves the different studies that you and your colleagues have done.
[03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:44.091]  Okay, continuing.
[03:08:44.091 --> 03:08:45.831]  Now, we kind of skipped ahead here.
[03:08:45.831 --> 03:08:52.313]  When did they decide to put these two different chemical compounds that they use publicly?
[03:08:52.313 --> 03:08:56.354]  The cover story is it's fluoride, but it's even more than that.
[03:08:56.354 --> 03:08:59.976]  And the studies that it's binding other heavy metals, bringing things in.
[03:09:02.022 --> 03:09:10.506]  You know, the reports I've got, too, is that they also took, you know, other compounds of toxic waste and called it fluoride and put that directly into the water.
[03:09:10.506 --> 03:09:13.067]  So, I mean, you know, hit all the key points for us, please, sir.
[03:09:13.067 --> 03:09:18.429]  I understand it's academic and there's different facets to each little sub-area, but give us an overview.
[03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:24.012]  I'll have to commit that I don't know some of the things that you have mentioned at all.
[03:09:24.012 --> 03:09:29.174]  Maybe it's just the professors that cut tunnel vision, but all I've focused on is that
[03:09:29.798 --> 03:09:50.520]  But once we started to get rid of this waste from separating uranium from the rock, and decided to just throw that in the water supply, because it was assumed that they would all come apart, and it was never tested, and as I said, the National Toxicology Program in 2002,
[03:09:52.775 --> 03:09:53.916]  Now what, two years ago?
[03:09:53.916 --> 03:10:04.922]  Well, I was going to say, they're just now looking and studying it thanks to your work and others, but what, two years ago the American Dental Association said children shouldn't be brushing their teeth with fluoride until they're what, six or seven?
[03:10:20.805 --> 03:10:22.146]  We're good to go.
[03:10:37.410 --> 03:10:39.611]  Of the safety of the silica fluoride.
[03:10:39.611 --> 03:10:42.091]  All the studies were on the safety of sodium fluoride.
[03:10:42.091 --> 03:10:42.852]  Now let's be clear.
[03:10:42.852 --> 03:10:51.134]  It's as if... I tell you, well, it's a good thing to have, let's say, a calcium pill in the morning.
[03:10:51.134 --> 03:10:53.595]  Here's another pill, and it turns out to have arsenic in it.
[03:10:53.595 --> 03:10:56.476]  Well, you know, one thing is good doesn't mean another thing is good.
[03:10:57.936 --> 03:10:58.456]  Exactly.
[03:10:58.456 --> 03:11:03.079]  They say milk is good, but it isn't milk, it's battery acid the kids are drinking.
[03:11:03.079 --> 03:11:12.025]  So let's say sodium fluoride is good for your teeth and good for you, which there are studies on and it shows they're not, but regardless, let's just say it's good.
[03:11:12.025 --> 03:11:23.412]  What you're saying is, what we're hearing as, quote, fluoridation isn't even that at all, and the studies are clear it's bad, they just don't know why, and now that's being looked at.
[03:11:25.022 --> 03:11:29.686]  Yeah, and look, let me give some concrete numbers.
[03:11:29.686 --> 03:11:39.854]  When you have lead in the water, or in the environment, the pollution in the environment, there's a higher lead in the kids.
[03:11:39.854 --> 03:11:43.036]  But when you have the silica fluoride, it goes up.
[03:11:43.036 --> 03:11:52.283]  So that, just the lead alone, that increases the lead in kids' blood, okay?
[03:11:52.283 --> 03:11:52.743]  It's about
[03:11:55.554 --> 03:11:58.797]  The measure of, is in micrograms per deciliter.
[03:11:58.797 --> 03:12:00.178]  It's about one of those measures.
[03:12:00.178 --> 03:12:22.917]  Is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is it, is
[03:12:24.678 --> 03:12:28.441]  It way increases the vulnerability of blacks.
[03:12:28.441 --> 03:12:30.763]  Oh, it just so happens to hurt blacks?
[03:12:30.763 --> 03:12:35.867]  I'm sure that hurts the feelings of the eugenicists that happen to run our entire government.
[03:12:35.867 --> 03:12:50.319]  Well, look, let me not get into eugenicists and just get into science because the main thing is that the effects of lead include learning disabilities, substance abuse, and violent behavior.
[03:12:50.319 --> 03:12:50.419]  Oh!
[03:12:51.158 --> 03:12:57.779]  Because lead destroys the ability of the brain chemicals that inhibit your behavior.
[03:12:57.779 --> 03:13:01.140]  It just slows down your impulsiveness.
[03:13:01.140 --> 03:13:06.241]  The brain chemicals aren't working right if you've got a lot of lead in your system.
[03:13:06.241 --> 03:13:08.962]  If you have a lot of it, it'll kill you.
[03:13:08.962 --> 03:13:18.344]  When I was on the Get the Lead Out of Vermont Task Force, the government task force in Vermont, we looked at this tradition of saying that, well,
[03:13:19.372 --> 03:13:23.356]  Only get worried if there's over 10 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood.
[03:13:23.356 --> 03:13:29.903]  And we found there was no level of lead in the blood that was completely without action, and we lowered the state
[03:13:31.328 --> 03:13:33.990]  The state level of concern from 10 to 5.
[03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:39.893]  Because where you have silico fluorides, then the whole scale has to be changed because it boosted.
[03:13:39.893 --> 03:13:42.334]  How much does it boost?
[03:13:42.334 --> 03:13:43.034]  That's right.
[03:13:43.034 --> 03:13:46.296]  I know you were just giving us the numbers, Professor, but give us those numbers again.
[03:13:46.296 --> 03:13:56.861]  Let's say you've got a Caucasian versus a Negroid, you know, in the same city with a set amount, and then give us the differences there.
[03:13:56.861 --> 03:13:59.342]  Well, if you take the...
[03:14:01.374 --> 03:14:16.418]  White kids who have both silicon fluoride and lead, they get up to about three and a half from two to three or something like that.
[03:14:16.418 --> 03:14:19.619]  The black kids, it goes up from five and a half to eight.
[03:14:19.619 --> 03:14:22.500]  So that blacks are just much more vulnerable.
[03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:25.321]  Partly this is poverty.
[03:14:25.321 --> 03:14:26.421]  And it's calcium.
[03:14:27.859 --> 03:14:30.480]  In particular, but lots of other things.
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:33.162]  The chemistry of the body... Well, are there studies on that?
[03:14:33.162 --> 03:14:40.665]  I mean, you're saying it's the diets of the blacks, or is it on average the metabolic difference?
[03:14:40.665 --> 03:14:45.387]  When I do these studies, I'm just doing population studies to find out where it's bad.
[03:14:45.387 --> 03:14:50.470]  But certainly you've had other scientists contact you that have an idea why it's so much more worse for blacks.
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:15:16.743]  When we take the best evidence we've got and look at the difference between poor kids and kids who have average or above average income, poor kids, whether they're white or black, whether they're exposed to silico friars or not, it's always the poor kids who are most vulnerable to lead, and those vulnerabilities are much worse for blacks, and for everybody they're much worse for the silico
[03:15:17.196 --> 03:15:18.057]  Well, here's an example.
[03:15:18.057 --> 03:15:25.122]  There's more diabetes in, quote, Hispanics that have the, you know, Native American bloodline.
[03:15:25.122 --> 03:15:35.570]  And then certainly, you know, the cliché is true that, quote, natives can't drink as much whiskey as, say, a Northern European who's had in their development, you know, generationally more drinking.
[03:15:36.090 --> 03:15:38.951]  And of course that gets into, you know, development and species.
[03:15:38.951 --> 03:15:45.574]  But I understand it's too many disciplines here and you're a scientist, you like to, or a professor who likes to look at the science and just go with what you have.
[03:15:45.574 --> 03:15:49.975]  So you're saying it's not a genetic difference, or you don't know, between blacks and whites.
[03:15:49.975 --> 03:15:56.097]  Well, actually the point is we think about genes versus environment.
[03:15:56.097 --> 03:16:03.000]  The phrase genes versus environment is like saying when you write an answer in long division,
[03:16:03.829 --> 03:16:09.673]  Do you use the even numbers only when you write the answer, or the odd numbers only?
[03:16:09.673 --> 03:16:14.837]  You're going to say, Masters, you idiot, I use both even and odd numbers.
[03:16:14.837 --> 03:16:17.999]  And I could say, oh, you could use both even and odd ones.
[03:16:17.999 --> 03:16:23.903]  The point is that everything in life involves what are called interactions between people and the environment.
[03:16:23.903 --> 03:16:24.483]  No, I agree.
[03:16:24.483 --> 03:16:32.169]  And that's the problem with most professors and academics and scientists, is they do narrowly only look at one little area, instead of that integration of the info.
[03:16:33.191 --> 03:16:43.974]  That's what I'm trying to do with my last year's research, is to try and show how, once you look at the integration, sometimes you find that there's one thing that's easy to change.
[03:16:43.974 --> 03:16:48.116]  The message I want your listeners to hear is simple.
[03:16:48.116 --> 03:16:51.717]  This stuff in the water has never been tested for safety.
[03:16:51.717 --> 03:16:53.237]  Turn it off!
[03:16:53.237 --> 03:16:58.979]  And make sure it isn't put back in the water until it's tested and proven to be safe by utterly independent people.
[03:16:58.979 --> 03:17:01.160]  And I don't mean the bureaucrats and government agencies.
[03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:10.623]  Because they like to cover up mistakes, as I keep on asking people, when was the last time you heard of a bureaucrat who admitted his pants were around his ankles?
[03:17:10.623 --> 03:17:22.227]  Well, why is it that it's known that these fluoride compounds that resemble Prozac are being put in the water, and it just accidentally does all of this?
[03:17:22.227 --> 03:17:28.589]  And then the original studies I saw, and Pulitzer Prize winning books from World War II, is the Soviets and Germans believed
[03:17:29.542 --> 03:17:36.268]  But let me ask you a question, because chemical compounds that differ, and when they differ they have different effects.
[03:17:51.839 --> 03:18:02.143]  It's like, by asking the question when I'm talking to students, tell me, if you drink scotch, bourbon, and vodka in the same night, is that different than just drinking one scotch?
[03:18:02.143 --> 03:18:02.523]  Yes.
[03:18:02.523 --> 03:18:09.306]  I never know a student who didn't admit that, well, mixing scotch, bourbon, and vodka was a very bad idea.
[03:18:09.306 --> 03:18:10.086]  I tried it once.
[03:18:10.086 --> 03:18:15.728]  My parents had a cocktail party when I was just going into my sophomore year of high school.
[03:18:16.147 --> 03:18:18.730]  They went out after the cocktail party and left a lot of glasses around.
[03:18:18.730 --> 03:18:20.832]  I decided to try them all at one night.
[03:18:20.832 --> 03:18:21.672]  Oh boy!
[03:18:21.672 --> 03:18:23.394]  Good morning?
[03:18:23.394 --> 03:18:24.115]  Boy!
[03:18:24.115 --> 03:18:27.618]  I did the exact same thing a few times, yeah.
[03:18:27.618 --> 03:18:32.382]  I didn't dare tell my mother what happened, but I thought I'd roll my head down the sidewalk nice.
[03:18:32.382 --> 03:18:34.765]  But don't mix your drinks.
[03:18:34.765 --> 03:18:40.230]  And in the same way, when we mix chemicals, we have effects that we don't have one at a time.
[03:18:41.249 --> 03:18:49.731]  This is important because, basically, the government regulates the EPA one thing at a time.
[03:18:49.731 --> 03:19:03.955]  And there's another thing, which is just in the paper today about, I think it's in the report, there's a, the EPA has found a compound that seemed to be really dangerous, and they wanted to have some rules on it, and the White House intervened,
[03:19:04.634 --> 03:19:08.335]  And change the document to take some of the stuff out.
[03:19:08.335 --> 03:19:08.796]  That's right.
[03:19:08.796 --> 03:19:15.298]  Now the White House, now the White House is practicing medicine, science.
[03:19:15.298 --> 03:19:18.039]  They just decide on a whole host of issues.
[03:19:18.039 --> 03:19:19.639]  We're going to skip this break with our guest.
[03:19:19.639 --> 03:19:21.480]  We have a full ten minutes left with him.
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:23.261]  Got to go to Infowars.com to hear this part.
[03:19:23.261 --> 03:19:26.302]  For the MNFM stations, we'll be back in just a few minutes.
[03:19:26.302 --> 03:19:29.443]  Roger D. Masters, research professor at Dartmouth College, is our guest.
[03:19:30.223 --> 03:19:32.726]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break and talk to him.
[03:19:32.726 --> 03:19:40.315]  Look, bottom line, I want to explain to the listeners out there, and this is a fact, that we're told it's just fluoridation.
[03:19:41.428 --> 03:19:44.070]  They can argue about that and then argue about what type of fluoride.
[03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:46.091]  Calcium, Stannous, Sodium.
[03:19:46.091 --> 03:19:48.512]  But it's mainly, quote, Sodium they claim they put in the water.
[03:19:48.512 --> 03:19:51.895]  But when you really look at it, it's the same thing I see with DU.
[03:19:51.895 --> 03:19:53.516]  They got a toxic waste, got to get rid of it.
[03:19:53.516 --> 03:19:56.657]  They just put it in weapon systems and spray it around everywhere.
[03:19:56.657 --> 03:20:08.705]  Or they've got to get rid of all the heavy metals and stuff that are left over from aluminum plants and also the manufacture of different chemicals and the breakdown
[03:20:09.485 --> 03:20:34.304]  Petrochemicals making gasoline and they just put that into lawn fertilizer and say well it doesn't get in our crops you know don't put it on crops you eat but but but put on your yard and it's lead and arsenic and all these toxins and your dog lays in it and its hair falls out and and but it still runs right into your aquifer so you drink it so I mean what I'm really interested in professor is this practice of claiming a dangerous expensive
[03:20:34.844 --> 03:20:35.204]  For sure.
[03:20:35.204 --> 03:20:43.048]  The point is, when you think of humans, say, 200,000 years ago, if you had some junk, I suppose you might throw it in the water and say, well, it would float down in the river and be gone.
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:10.224]  But, uh, we now have a highly technical society.
[03:21:10.224 --> 03:21:16.669]  They thought just throwing this in the water supply, it would disappear and it would be gone, but it turned out to be dangerous.
[03:21:16.669 --> 03:21:19.952]  And let me give a couple other statistics.
[03:21:19.952 --> 03:21:24.255]  Where this is in the water, there's a higher rate of cocaine use.
[03:21:24.255 --> 03:21:34.803]  Now, we measured that by the arrests, the proportion of people who are, uh, when you arrest violent criminals, who test positive for cocaine.
[03:21:35.785 --> 03:22:02.637]  Where there's, uh, where there's, uh, you can go from two people who are violent with, uh, uh, two out of a thousand criminals, uh, testing positive for cocaine, where there's no silico fluoride, and, and, uh, you go up by a couple where there, uh, there's silico fluoride, and you go up by even a little bit more if there's both silico fluoride and lead.
[03:22:02.637 --> 03:22:04.018]  So what I'm trying to get to
[03:22:04.804 --> 03:22:05.064]  Yeah.
[03:22:05.064 --> 03:22:05.184]  Yeah.
[03:22:30.689 --> 03:22:35.552]  One thing to remember is Einstein's advice about working in science.
[03:22:35.552 --> 03:22:38.134]  He said that you had to be intelligent.
[03:22:38.134 --> 03:22:39.775]  Very, very stubborn.
[03:22:39.775 --> 03:22:41.116]  A chemical engineer is intelligent.
[03:22:41.116 --> 03:22:42.096]  I'm just very stubborn.
[03:22:42.096 --> 03:22:52.343]  But the critical thing here is that when you have a new idea, what Einstein pointed out is at first you're completely ignored.
[03:22:52.343 --> 03:22:54.344]  Nobody pays attention to you.
[03:22:54.344 --> 03:22:57.366]  We've been working on this for over 10 years and at first absolutely nobody paid attention.
[03:22:58.277 --> 03:22:59.177]  Then you're attacked.
[03:22:59.177 --> 03:23:00.538]  Oh, this is junk science.
[03:23:00.538 --> 03:23:01.979]  This is foolish.
[03:23:01.979 --> 03:23:04.740]  And then ultimately, everybody's going to agree it's true.
[03:23:04.740 --> 03:23:07.382]  That's what Einstein had with relativity.
[03:23:07.382 --> 03:23:13.265]  And I think once people begin to ask the question, have you tested this stuff for safety?
[03:23:13.265 --> 03:23:15.266]  What's the evidence?
[03:23:15.266 --> 03:23:19.167]  My website, http://www.dartmouth.com.
[03:23:27.148 --> 03:23:30.132]  We're going back to the full audience.
[03:23:30.132 --> 03:23:31.153]  Here we go.
[03:23:53.294 --> 03:23:56.097]  Professor Masters wants you to go to his website.
[03:23:56.097 --> 03:24:03.024]  It's http://www.dartmouth.edu.
[03:24:03.024 --> 03:24:13.053]  It's much easier just to type in Roger D. Masters into Google and it's the top link that comes up.
[03:24:13.053 --> 03:24:14.294]  You can read his research papers.
[03:24:14.935 --> 03:24:16.095]  And so much more.
[03:24:16.095 --> 03:24:27.120]  I mean, this is a nightmarish compound that they just accidentally decided out of the Manhattan Project to put in our water supplies.
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:29.240]  It was all just an accident.
[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:36.823]  And it accelerates absorbing heavy metals and other toxins, causes massive increases in the brain, being drug addicted to cocaine.
[03:24:36.823 --> 03:24:39.184]  He was just going all over the study numbers on that.
[03:24:39.184 --> 03:24:41.565]  Massive increases in violent crime.
[03:24:41.565 --> 03:24:43.886]  It's all just an accident, you know.
[03:24:44.486 --> 03:24:49.449]  Again, it's a complete accident that any of this is going on.
[03:24:49.449 --> 03:24:53.812]  And, of course I'm being sarcastic, but he just covers the scientific fact.
[03:24:53.812 --> 03:24:56.514]  Okay, you were plugging your website as we came out of the break.
[03:24:56.514 --> 03:25:00.636]  Why do folks need to go there, Professor Masters?
[03:25:00.636 --> 03:25:13.084]  I was going to say, the website, the way I usually cite it is after the tilde R Masters slash, the letter is A-H-A-B-S slash.
[03:25:14.404 --> 03:25:14.825]  I think so.
[03:25:29.224 --> 03:25:32.267]  I found with radio, you try to give out long addresses, it doesn't work.
[03:25:32.267 --> 03:25:38.412]  Folks need to Google, you know, fluoride, Roger D. Masters, and they will, because I'm doing it here.
[03:25:38.412 --> 03:25:39.833]  I'm testing it on Google.
[03:25:39.833 --> 03:25:40.954]  It's all you.
[03:25:40.954 --> 03:25:43.356]  People can read the studies and see the information.
[03:25:43.356 --> 03:25:45.338]  I've got to get you back up for a part two.
[03:25:45.338 --> 03:25:49.681]  We really appreciate you doing this tirelessly to try to warn the public.
[03:25:49.681 --> 03:25:56.247]  But you were making the point a few minutes ago, and I want you to take us out with this and any other points you want to make, sir, that this is forced medicating.
[03:25:56.707 --> 03:26:03.771]  Which something they know has bad effects, but don't know the full bad effects of, and you're saying needs to be taken out.
[03:26:03.771 --> 03:26:04.931]  Do you see that happening?
[03:26:04.931 --> 03:26:13.616]  I see more and more of citizens who are concerned, and some people in the public area.
[03:26:13.616 --> 03:26:19.579]  But I think one of our problems is the way we talk about, they did this, they did that.
[03:26:19.579 --> 03:26:21.881]  They are human beings like us.
[03:26:21.881 --> 03:26:25.963]  I think it's only fair to say that most of the people in the public health sphere
[03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:29.355]  I don't know much about the details of this research.
[03:26:29.355 --> 03:26:30.476]  It's not that wide.
[03:26:30.476 --> 03:26:33.838]  Yeah, they're compartmentalized.
[03:26:33.838 --> 03:26:42.842]  And if you are in the medical profession, you've always been taught that fluoridation is a very good public step.
[03:26:42.842 --> 03:26:47.104]  You've never heard of a difference between sodium fluoride and silico fluoride.
[03:26:47.104 --> 03:26:55.849]  You think that fluoride is putting fluoride... Nobody puts pure fluorine in the water, for a lot of technical reasons that my chemical colleague Mike Copeland would explain.
[03:26:56.525 --> 03:27:03.068]  But the key, as we've told me, the key thing is that there's some new scientific evidence.
[03:27:03.068 --> 03:27:11.231]  We've published in journals like Neurotoxicology, which is the best journal in the world on how toxic chemicals harm the brain.
[03:27:11.231 --> 03:27:13.252]  Published two papers in that.
[03:27:13.252 --> 03:27:17.774]  So it's not just a funny professor from the Ivy League.
[03:27:17.774 --> 03:27:19.875]  And if I'm wrong, I want to know I'm wrong.
[03:27:19.875 --> 03:27:25.738]  But I think the crucial thing is, when in doubt, for anything that harms health,
[03:27:26.930 --> 03:27:37.594]  Yeah, I mean, if they, quote, haven't studied it, which is their official story, why put it in when all the evidence shows it's not good for you?
[03:27:37.594 --> 03:27:49.278]  But separately, they have studied different types of fluoride and what it does, and it calcifies bones, causes bone fractures, cancers radically shoot up in boys.
[03:27:49.898 --> 03:28:05.867]  I mean, you know, just like all these studies on cell phones, my God, frying the testicles, frying the breast, frying any fast-growing cells that have a lot of hormonal flux going on that are already, you know, leaning towards being places where you'll have a cancer problem.
[03:28:05.867 --> 03:28:11.029]  I mean, bottom line, Professor, they know what's going on at the top.
[03:28:11.029 --> 03:28:13.671]  You're right, people mid-level and different compartments don't.
[03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:21.193]  I mean, look how much trouble they go to to keep this stuff in the water.
[03:28:21.193 --> 03:28:23.514]  I guess it's because they love us?
[03:28:23.514 --> 03:28:30.118]  No, I think a lot of it is simply that people don't like to admit they made a mistake.
[03:28:30.118 --> 03:28:33.941]  That is, a lot of it is just people want to have the idea.
[03:28:33.941 --> 03:28:39.624]  You're in a bureaucracy, and a bureaucrat is a kind of territorial animal.
[03:28:39.624 --> 03:28:42.606]  He owns his desk, and you better not get near it.
[03:28:42.606 --> 03:28:45.708]  He's got a bunch of things, and he's in charge of that, and that's his stuff.
[03:28:46.724 --> 03:28:50.865]  Well, my experience in the Army is... Copy your ass.
[03:28:50.865 --> 03:29:00.928]  Well, I think actually we ought to go back and have a draft, because I think not only do we destroy military manpower, but it's a very good thing for people to discover.
[03:29:00.928 --> 03:29:04.109]  First of all, the country has to have people to protect them.
[03:29:04.109 --> 03:29:05.629]  Hold on, I'm going to skip this break, too.
[03:29:05.629 --> 03:29:14.812]  I'm going to do three more minutes with our guests if you're listening on InfoWars.com.
[03:29:14.812 --> 03:29:15.132]  Okay.
[03:29:18.408 --> 03:29:21.549]  Professor, you're there, right?
[03:29:21.549 --> 03:29:22.369]  Yeah.
[03:29:22.369 --> 03:29:32.632]  Look, in closing, I want to get you back up on all these issues, but I wanted to talk to you about Leo Strauss, The End Justifies the Means.
[03:29:32.632 --> 03:29:36.854]  What do you think of the fruit of Leo Strauss and the neocons?
[03:29:36.854 --> 03:29:39.535]  Leo Strauss wasn't a neocon.
[03:29:39.535 --> 03:29:47.257]  He was a believer in the need to read a great writer in the past, a great writer like Plato,
[03:29:48.118 --> 03:29:50.019]  Trying to figure out what he was trying to say.
[03:29:50.019 --> 03:29:51.179]  Or Machiavelli.
[03:29:51.179 --> 03:29:52.680]  Or Machiavelli.
[03:29:52.680 --> 03:30:05.185]  And you have to figure out when you go to read Machiavelli, you have to realize that everything he says, on the surface of it, have some meaning.
[03:30:05.185 --> 03:30:06.526]  It's a little subtle.
[03:30:06.526 --> 03:30:07.566]  That's not trivial.
[03:30:07.566 --> 03:30:12.408]  Machiavelli, the year before he wrote The Prince, he was tortured for a full year and in jail.
[03:30:13.382 --> 03:30:14.604]  Because there was a change of government.
[03:30:14.604 --> 03:30:16.327]  He's been a government official.
[03:30:16.327 --> 03:30:26.483]  It was a very rebellious thing to do, to put out a blueprint of the black nobility's tactics.
[03:30:26.483 --> 03:30:28.326]  He was letting out the trade secrets.
[03:30:28.840 --> 03:30:30.601]  No, he wasn't at all.
[03:30:30.601 --> 03:30:35.464]  What he was trying... Well, I got something... Machiavelli was a very... Machiavelli was a very devious man.
[03:30:35.464 --> 03:30:37.305]  I've written... I've studied him a lot.
[03:30:37.305 --> 03:30:39.286]  Well, I mean, I've read both his books, but that's it.
[03:30:39.286 --> 03:30:46.790]  But, I mean, I take away from it that, you know, he was just kind of pissed off, locked up in his house, kind of, you know, spilling the beans.
[03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:48.751]  Are you saying it was propaganda against people?
[03:30:48.751 --> 03:30:49.331]  No, no, no.
[03:30:49.331 --> 03:30:54.774]  He was worried because he saw... Alright, I'll put it bluntly.
[03:30:54.774 --> 03:30:58.116]  Machiavelli thought Christianity as a religion was bad.
[03:30:59.474 --> 03:31:04.038]  Because it denied the natural desires, like sex, sinful.
[03:31:04.038 --> 03:31:04.558]  It was satanic.
[03:31:04.558 --> 03:31:06.640]  He thought that was a bad thing to do.
[03:31:06.640 --> 03:31:07.240]  Do as thou will.
[03:31:07.240 --> 03:31:09.562]  He thought the church was corrupt.
[03:31:09.562 --> 03:31:18.109]  He was trying to encourage people to go back to secular government that separated religion from politics, which we now do and take for granted.
[03:31:18.109 --> 03:31:20.851]  They don't do that in the Muslim world all the time, right?
[03:31:20.851 --> 03:31:25.915]  So we better remember that there was a time, even in Western history,
[03:31:26.912 --> 03:31:31.653]  When the church had essentially a lot of political power.
[03:31:31.653 --> 03:31:36.235]  Yeah, so it's kind of a pre-Illuminati type deal.
[03:31:36.235 --> 03:31:44.097]  No, what he was trying to do was to figure out a way to get back to the frame of reference of pagan antiquity.
[03:31:44.097 --> 03:31:44.677]  That's what I just said.
[03:31:44.677 --> 03:31:46.778]  The only way he thought to do that was to shock people.
[03:31:46.778 --> 03:31:47.998]  I know, pagan antiquity.
[03:31:47.998 --> 03:31:50.299]  That's what the Illuminati wants.
[03:31:50.299 --> 03:31:56.581]  Well, all I'm saying is that he thought he was a Republican who believed in Republican government.
[03:31:57.845 --> 03:32:00.607]  But utterly secular Republican government.
[03:32:00.607 --> 03:32:02.548]  So you like Machiavelli?
[03:32:02.548 --> 03:32:10.131]  I think he's a very, very powerful thinker because he makes you ask questions about things you don't want to ask questions about.
[03:32:10.131 --> 03:32:12.172]  That's what Charles tried to teach us.
[03:32:12.172 --> 03:32:14.714]  Sure, the hypocrisy of the time.
[03:32:14.714 --> 03:32:21.057]  If you ask questions about things, the crucial thing for me is not what some thinker in the past said or didn't say.
[03:32:21.618 --> 03:32:26.404]  But how you can use that to learn how to read a book, to read science... Hold on, Professor.
[03:32:26.404 --> 03:32:26.964]  Hold on.
[03:32:26.964 --> 03:32:27.385]  Hold on.
[03:32:27.385 --> 03:32:30.708]  I mean, it appears to the core of things through the propaganda.
[03:32:30.708 --> 03:32:31.389]  I gotcha.
[03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.690]  Hold on.
[03:32:31.690 --> 03:32:36.575]  Let's do one more minute here.
[03:32:36.575 --> 03:32:40.580]  I got into Straussian ideas.
[03:32:40.580 --> 03:32:42.161]  The Professor's saying he's not a neocon.
[03:32:44.448 --> 03:32:47.710]  Whatever, he hatched that, he's the presenter of it.
[03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:59.719]  And I brought up Machiavelli, and the professor got very possessive, I think is the word, and like, I'm an expert on Machiavelli, he was disagreeing with me, and I'm sure he's right about the main reason Machiavelli wrote those books.
[03:32:59.719 --> 03:33:02.541]  I mean, I read them like 15, 20 years ago.
[03:33:02.541 --> 03:33:09.767]  The point is, and I've seen more modern forms of subterfuge, more subtle, he was saying that he wanted us to go back to pagan antiquity,
[03:33:10.367 --> 03:33:14.869]  Oh, the point is that Machiavelli was a friend of somebody named Leonardo da Vinci.
[03:33:39.827 --> 03:33:55.836]  When he was in power in the Republic of Florence, he tried with Leonardo to design, to change the bed of the River Arno to make the city of Florence a seaport.
[03:33:55.836 --> 03:34:07.203]  Because with the discovery of America in 1492, the idea of making Florence a seaport, which could then engage in transatlantic trade, was very attractive.
[03:34:08.562 --> 03:34:09.203]  Yes, we are.
[03:34:30.524 --> 03:34:33.785]  No, because they don't pay enough attention to read them very carefully.
[03:34:33.785 --> 03:34:48.790]  No, I remember seeing that, talking about how basically a bunch of twittering, you know, people, religionists, were blocking progress, and you're talking about the Renaissance, aren't you?
[03:34:48.790 --> 03:35:00.013]  Oh yeah, but I mean, I wrote a couple of them in my book, Machiavelli, Leonardo, and the Science of Power, which I tried to deal with how Machiavelli and Leonardo represent two aspects of
[03:35:01.027 --> 03:35:02.768]  The beginning of modern society.
[03:35:02.768 --> 03:35:06.429]  Modern society is unique in the world.
[03:35:06.429 --> 03:35:19.552]  The idea of using science the way we use science and we take it for granted, I don't realize that the way we take science for granted is, for a lot of people elsewhere in the world, particularly in the Middle East, is all heresy.
[03:35:19.552 --> 03:35:20.152]  Well, I understand.
[03:35:20.152 --> 03:35:22.953]  Tell me about this going back to the pagan roots.
[03:35:22.953 --> 03:35:24.354]  Tell me about that.
[03:35:24.354 --> 03:35:28.955]  Well, the main point is that Machiavelli thought you had to understand
[03:35:29.952 --> 03:35:39.478]  Human nature as best you could without reading it through the filter of some book by somebody else.
[03:35:39.478 --> 03:35:41.139]  Yeah, getting it from some religion.
[03:35:41.139 --> 03:35:43.020]  Getting it from the oracles.
[03:35:43.020 --> 03:35:59.089]  And in particular, he was worried about the way in which the Christian view of original sin, going back to the Hebrew view in the Bible of original sin, raised questions about things that were utterly natural.
[03:36:00.228 --> 03:36:04.352]  And the point of this, St.
[03:36:04.352 --> 03:36:15.361]  Paul wrote these letters and claimed that the word of Jesus as God had to be sent to all tribes, all nations.
[03:36:15.361 --> 03:36:16.062]  That was what St.
[03:36:16.062 --> 03:36:19.384]  Paul said.
[03:36:19.384 --> 03:36:25.830]  What did Machiavelli realize when Amerigo Vespucci realized that this wasn't just an island, it was a continent?
[03:36:26.826 --> 03:36:31.268]  MacIntyre was the first thinker to know there was a continent between Europe and Asia.
[03:36:31.268 --> 03:36:38.210]  Because his secretary, his assistant, Augustino Vespucci, was Americo Vespucci's cousin.
[03:36:38.210 --> 03:36:45.173]  And so he knew right away that there was this whole continent where people had never heard about Christianity.
[03:36:45.173 --> 03:36:47.874]  Well, how could God have been just because
[03:36:49.274 --> 03:36:54.596]  No, I understand.
[03:36:54.596 --> 03:37:01.899]  No, no, I understand the whole argument.
[03:37:01.899 --> 03:37:04.379]  That's the induction into the Illuminati speech.
[03:37:04.379 --> 03:37:05.800]  I understand all that.
[03:37:05.800 --> 03:37:07.220]  I mean, listen, we've got to get you back up.
[03:37:07.220 --> 03:37:13.883]  I didn't know you wrote a book about that, Professor, and we appreciate you coming on to explain to us that it's something far more
[03:37:14.483 --> 03:37:18.806]  Well, thank you very much for giving me a chance to perhaps encourage stopping the use of a dangerous chemical.
[03:37:18.806 --> 03:37:20.907]  Well, good luck and good health to you all!
[03:37:42.002 --> 03:37:43.123]  Well, there we have it.
[03:37:43.123 --> 03:37:45.745]  It's always back to the same thing.
[03:37:45.745 --> 03:37:47.907]  Oh, man.
[03:37:47.907 --> 03:37:52.371]  And let me tell you, they will have you believe that they are not religionist.
[03:37:52.371 --> 03:38:01.038]  I don't know about him particularly, but they are religious in every sense of the word, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:38:01.038 --> 03:38:02.819]  Okay, look, I wanted to play both these clips.
[03:38:02.819 --> 03:38:04.080]  They're both like 10 minutes long.
[03:38:04.080 --> 03:38:06.082]  They're up on Infowars.com.
[03:38:06.082 --> 03:38:09.845]  I may play one now and then do an overdrive.
[03:38:11.545 --> 03:38:17.207]  I've got to go to a meeting about the TV studio they're building.
[03:38:17.207 --> 03:38:20.169]  Let's do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[03:38:20.169 --> 03:38:22.590]  Can you do 10 minutes of overdrive?
[03:38:22.590 --> 03:38:33.695]  The problem is the network has the clip, and I guess you can't keep my ISDN from Minnesota down here, can you?
[03:38:33.695 --> 03:38:34.535]  To go into overdrive?
[03:38:36.260 --> 03:38:37.400]  John?
[03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:38.521]  Actually, no, we cannot.
[03:38:38.521 --> 03:38:39.961]  Hey, do me a favor then.
[03:38:39.961 --> 03:38:42.763]  Email me that other clip, both the clips, the URLs.
[03:38:42.763 --> 03:38:45.504]  Do you have those or did you flush those?
[03:38:45.504 --> 03:38:47.885]  I can send you the links through Instant Messenger.
[03:38:47.885 --> 03:38:54.947]  Yeah, we'll play part one here and we'll play part two in Overdrive from my studio.
[03:38:54.947 --> 03:38:58.049]  Hell, I may just start doing five or six hours every day, you know?
[03:38:58.049 --> 03:39:02.790]  There's too much... Look, I know I opened the phones up hours ago and only took like five calls.
[03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:04.151]  They're not people still holding, are they?
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:12.124]  Yep, I gave you the fresh list on your... Oh, goodness gracious, these poor people have been holding for hours and hours and hours.
[03:39:12.124 --> 03:39:14.346]  And I've got an important meeting I've got to go to.
[03:39:14.346 --> 03:39:15.266]  You know what?
[03:39:15.266 --> 03:39:19.609]  We'll take their calls, too, before the show ends.
[03:39:19.609 --> 03:39:23.192]  Joe, Mike, Mike, Billy, and Dr. Kelly.
[03:39:23.192 --> 03:39:24.352]  Right?
[03:39:24.352 --> 03:39:25.053]  Yep, that's the right one.
[03:39:27.193 --> 03:39:36.660]  Okay, well, anybody, it won't be on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Internet or satellite, but it will be on the internet, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:38.441]  You will be able to see the clip.
[03:39:38.441 --> 03:39:41.643]  I'll just play it from there.
[03:39:41.643 --> 03:39:43.444]  Let's go ahead now and do this.
[03:39:43.444 --> 03:39:49.848]  I wanted to spend a whole show on this, and I think tomorrow I'm going to comment on this more.
[03:39:51.127 --> 03:39:58.654]  But I found all these old militia clips from Donahue and other shows, and Donahue is acting like a complete clown.
[03:39:58.654 --> 03:40:08.844]  I used to really hate him for this, but then, because I'd seen these, you know, back in the early 90s, this was like in 94, right after the Waco butchering, and I'd seen these clips going around then on VHS tapes and things passed around.
[03:40:09.525 --> 03:40:11.728]  Where he's going, you live in the woods, don't you?
[03:40:11.728 --> 03:40:12.249]  The woods!
[03:40:12.249 --> 03:40:16.093]  Like these militia guys, and they're just totally calm, making him look like a fool.
[03:40:16.093 --> 03:40:24.444]  I know two other guys that are up on stage, and they're laying out, they're coming for your guns, it's a new world order, they're gonna do this and that, and then now look!
[03:40:24.444 --> 03:40:24.844]  Let me see.
[03:40:26.352 --> 03:40:29.614]  Fourteen years later, this is in 1994.
[03:40:29.614 --> 03:40:33.376]  Fourteen years later, how much of this has come true?
[03:40:33.376 --> 03:40:34.396]  How much of this happened?
[03:40:34.396 --> 03:40:36.677]  Because they were only going off government documents.
[03:40:36.677 --> 03:40:38.558]  And just how right the militia movement was.
[03:40:38.558 --> 03:40:47.403]  But then a year later, after this TV show, the feds bombed OKC, and Bill Clinton blamed it on the militia, when it was a federal operation, and that's when the militia went underground.
[03:40:48.183 --> 03:40:53.267]  So, government-sponsored terror is used to head off movements that could stop their tyranny.
[03:40:53.267 --> 03:40:57.931]  So, let's go ahead, but they only do it because it justifies the means.
[03:40:57.931 --> 03:41:02.094]  They want to bring us enlightenment and they've got to kill a lot of us to do that first.
[03:41:02.094 --> 03:41:09.220]  It's the great work we're talking about here for Lucifer, they believe.
[03:41:09.220 --> 03:41:11.702]  So, let's go ahead and play the militia.
[03:41:11.702 --> 03:41:14.844]  The video is even more incredible up on InfoWars.com.
[03:41:14.844 --> 03:41:17.046]  Actually, for PrisonPlanet.tv, let's punch this up.
[03:41:18.712 --> 03:41:23.896]  And I will play clip two in overdrive so people can actually see the video over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:41:23.896 --> 03:41:25.877]  Just have it where I can get to it later.
[03:41:25.877 --> 03:41:26.337]  Good.
[03:41:26.337 --> 03:41:30.020]  Yeah, yeah, later I'm going to have that for everybody.
[03:41:30.020 --> 03:41:30.881]  Now, folks get confused.
[03:41:30.881 --> 03:41:35.084]  There's all these other internet streams and little radio networks, internet things that carry the show.
[03:41:35.084 --> 03:41:36.545]  And there's scores of them.
[03:41:36.545 --> 03:41:39.107]  And Ted's always let a lot of them do it.
[03:41:39.107 --> 03:41:42.029]  The problem is some then hold out that they are us.
[03:41:42.029 --> 03:41:45.171]  And because we're so lenient with things, it's kind of like, make copies of my film.
[03:41:45.171 --> 03:41:46.372]  People say, well, they're now in my film.
[03:41:46.912 --> 03:41:49.873]  And I copyright your film, you know, and then, well, no, that's my film!
[03:41:49.873 --> 03:41:50.854]  How dare you!
[03:41:50.854 --> 03:41:52.274]  No, the film's mine now!
[03:41:52.274 --> 03:41:54.916]  So we have to kind of explain to you, this is the Genesis Network.
[03:41:54.916 --> 03:41:56.696]  This is where this show originates from.
[03:41:56.696 --> 03:42:00.318]  And on those other networks and things, you won't be hearing my show when it ends.
[03:42:00.318 --> 03:42:03.779]  You've got to go to mfowars.com when we go into overdrive.
[03:42:03.779 --> 03:42:05.840]  The only place that listens is on the internet or at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:42:08.692 --> 03:42:17.578]  All of the schooning pilot fish are trying to attach themselves, which I don't mind a few pilot fish hanging off me.
[03:42:17.578 --> 03:42:21.380]  But if they bite me and hate me while they're sucking my blood, it makes me angry.
[03:42:21.380 --> 03:42:29.506]  And they always squeal and yell and pull their hair out and make up a bunch of stuff about me and engage in blackmail and all this other crap.
[03:42:29.506 --> 03:42:30.847]  I'm not going to be too friendly towards you.
[03:42:32.472 --> 03:42:34.573]  I mean, your own delusional BS.
[03:42:34.573 --> 03:42:39.996]  You can lie to yourself all day about the stuff you've done, but the truth is I know the truth and that's what matters.
[03:42:39.996 --> 03:42:41.237]  And that's why I'm going to defend myself.
[03:42:41.237 --> 03:42:42.818]  But I'm already digressing.
[03:42:42.818 --> 03:42:45.599]  Listen at how the militia was so right.
[03:42:45.599 --> 03:42:46.560]  Now these are real guys.
[03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:47.941]  John Trotman and others.
[03:42:47.941 --> 03:42:50.302]  These are all great guys up there on stage.
[03:42:50.302 --> 03:42:52.123]  I know two of them personally.
[03:42:52.123 --> 03:42:52.983]  And I want to get them on.
[03:42:52.983 --> 03:42:56.825]  I want to track them down and get both these guys back on.
[03:42:56.825 --> 03:42:59.067]  But Bob Flesher and Trotman.
[03:43:00.418 --> 03:43:02.039]  I know they're still around.
[03:43:02.039 --> 03:43:03.060]  Just amazing guys.
[03:43:03.060 --> 03:43:05.301]  This is 14 years ago.
[03:43:05.301 --> 03:43:07.402]  These guys, 20 years ago, were telling the truth.
[03:43:07.402 --> 03:43:08.843]  Now, listen to it.
[03:43:08.843 --> 03:43:11.185]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:11.185 --> 03:43:20.470]  The United States of America, they believe that the United States government is prepared to usurp the Constitution and break down doors and confiscate guns.
[03:43:20.470 --> 03:43:23.412]  Am I lying to these people, Bob Fletcher and Jim Trockman?
[03:43:23.412 --> 03:43:24.032]  John Trockman.
[03:43:24.032 --> 03:43:26.214]  John, sorry, it says John here.
[03:43:26.214 --> 03:43:27.434]  You believe this?
[03:43:27.434 --> 03:43:28.395]  No, not quite like that.
[03:43:29.395 --> 03:43:30.415]  Not the U.S.
[03:43:30.415 --> 03:43:31.736]  government.
[03:43:31.736 --> 03:43:32.356]  Which government?
[03:43:32.356 --> 03:43:33.417]  The One World Government?
[03:43:33.417 --> 03:43:34.677]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:34.677 --> 03:43:35.677]  The United Nations?
[03:43:35.677 --> 03:43:36.398]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:36.398 --> 03:43:37.458]  And you're in the woods now?
[03:43:37.458 --> 03:43:39.579]  And you're not, neither of you, you're not in the woods?
[03:43:39.579 --> 03:43:40.279]  No, no, no.
[03:43:40.279 --> 03:43:42.080]  Yeah, you're from Montana.
[03:43:42.080 --> 03:43:43.320]  The city of Noxon?
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:43.660]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:43.660 --> 03:43:45.521]  The little town of Noxon.
[03:43:45.521 --> 03:43:46.581]  350 people?
[03:43:46.581 --> 03:43:47.022]  Maximum.
[03:43:47.022 --> 03:43:47.582]  Uh-huh.
[03:43:47.582 --> 03:43:49.082]  And you're living in the woods?
[03:43:49.082 --> 03:43:49.383]  No.
[03:43:49.383 --> 03:43:50.343]  No, you're not.
[03:43:50.343 --> 03:43:52.424]  Is anybody in Montana?
[03:43:52.424 --> 03:43:53.364]  Just their plain homes.
[03:43:53.364 --> 03:43:56.365]  You're sitting next to Ray Southwell, who does, from Michigan.
[03:43:56.365 --> 03:43:58.546]  You gather in the woods, don't you?
[03:43:59.452 --> 03:43:59.932]  In Michigan?
[03:43:59.932 --> 03:44:00.772]  When we train?
[03:44:00.772 --> 03:44:01.673]  Yeah.
[03:44:01.673 --> 03:44:02.293]  That's correct.
[03:44:02.293 --> 03:44:03.913]  But you're not living there.
[03:44:03.913 --> 03:44:06.354]  I don't quite understand... Stop right there!
[03:44:06.354 --> 03:44:09.975]  See, this propaganda wouldn't sell today.
[03:44:09.975 --> 03:44:11.876]  Like, you live in the woods, you're some kind of hillbilly.
[03:44:11.876 --> 03:44:14.997]  And then they go to the black guy, well these are white supremacists, what are you doing with them?
[03:44:14.997 --> 03:44:16.137]  And the black guy's like, no they're not.
[03:44:16.137 --> 03:44:19.138]  In fact, if you go watch their videos, they all speak out against it.
[03:44:19.138 --> 03:44:22.259]  But that's the whole point, is that's what they would tell the public.
[03:44:22.259 --> 03:44:26.901]  And this was running up, the demonization of the militia, started a year before the feds bombed OKC.
[03:44:27.861 --> 03:44:28.522]  Yeah, that's correct.
[03:44:28.522 --> 03:44:29.503]  But you're not living there?
[03:44:29.503 --> 03:44:32.426]  I don't quite understand when you say living there.
[03:44:32.426 --> 03:44:36.130]  I live in northern Michigan, and I have 20 acres that I live on, and there's a house there.
[03:44:36.130 --> 03:44:36.390]  Right.
[03:44:36.390 --> 03:44:38.452]  You're with Ken Adams and Doug Hall here?
[03:44:51.656 --> 03:44:56.959]  As well as the ever popular, highly regarded Jim Johnson.
[03:44:56.959 --> 03:44:58.299]  You're from Ohio, are you?
[03:44:58.299 --> 03:44:59.640]  That's correct, Columbus to be exact.
[03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:00.160]  Yeah.
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:01.481]  You're in a militia, are you?
[03:45:01.481 --> 03:45:04.663]  The Ohio Unorganized Militia, duly elected communications officer.
[03:45:04.663 --> 03:45:05.263]  Yeah.
[03:45:05.263 --> 03:45:08.725]  What do you, incidentally, I thought this was an all-white area.
[03:45:08.725 --> 03:45:09.525]  By the way, start again.
[03:45:09.705 --> 03:45:11.486]  I mean, Donahue's extremely manipulative.
[03:45:11.486 --> 03:45:22.771]  You know, speaking out against the war now, he seems good, but he was puffing up, getting in their face, growling at them with the body language, trying to manipulate them into a fight, and the guys were all laughing at him, so Donahue looked like a complete fool.
[03:45:22.771 --> 03:45:24.132]  Back to it.
[03:45:24.132 --> 03:45:24.372]  Yes, sir.
[03:45:24.372 --> 03:45:25.032]  Yeah.
[03:45:25.032 --> 03:45:31.815]  What do you—incidentally, I thought this was an all-white, Aryan nation, don't tread on me kind of group.
[03:45:31.815 --> 03:45:34.337]  Yeah, well, the state in the country doesn't have an affirmative action program.
[03:45:34.337 --> 03:45:34.917]  All are invited.
[03:45:36.063 --> 03:45:43.667]  And you're here, among other things, to say that you share their concern about the pending crisis that's coming to this country?
[03:45:43.667 --> 03:45:45.128]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:45:45.128 --> 03:45:53.032]  Being a minority in our community, we've seen certain actions that these conspiratorial theorists have talked about actually happen in our communities.
[03:45:53.032 --> 03:45:53.973]  Tell us what they are.
[03:45:53.973 --> 03:45:55.994]  I'm having a little trouble getting it from the civilians here.
[03:45:57.035 --> 03:45:59.796]  You look like you're from IBM compared to the rest of the group.
[03:45:59.796 --> 03:46:00.397]  I guess so.
[03:46:00.397 --> 03:46:02.898]  We can spot you from the air, Bob.
[03:46:02.898 --> 03:46:04.900]  You better get yourself your fatigues here.
[03:46:04.900 --> 03:46:06.181]  I'm going to get spotted from the air.
[03:46:06.181 --> 03:46:07.702]  Yes, you are.
[03:46:07.702 --> 03:46:08.642]  You're serious about this.
[03:46:08.642 --> 03:46:10.243]  Please, I want this audience to know.
[03:46:10.243 --> 03:46:11.004]  Oh, show them the film.
[03:46:11.004 --> 03:46:12.044]  This is from Michigan.
[03:46:12.044 --> 03:46:14.366]  Let me just, while we're showing it, you can make your case.
[03:46:14.366 --> 03:46:19.970]  The basic problem is rather simple, and Americans have become concerned
[03:46:20.660 --> 03:46:25.846]  That here in the United States, we're losing our constitutional rights.
[03:46:25.846 --> 03:46:35.258]  We are slowly being moved into what amounts to being a one world, and that's George Bush and Gorbachev's words, a one world, new world order.
[03:46:36.343 --> 03:46:40.405]  And what that amounts to, basically, is socialism.
[03:46:40.405 --> 03:46:42.005]  One world socialism.
[03:46:42.005 --> 03:46:46.907]  And if you don't like it, you're going to be moved off someplace where they can control you.
[03:46:46.907 --> 03:46:53.449]  And the problem is, in terms of the militia across the United States, this is exactly what we're addressing.
[03:46:53.449 --> 03:46:54.970]  It has nothing to do with racism.
[03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:59.752]  As, I guess, our compadre from Ohio would testify.
[03:46:59.752 --> 03:47:07.955]  It has nothing to do with a handful of crazy people running through the woods and practicing to shoot unknown, mysterious people.
[03:47:07.955 --> 03:47:18.099]  We already are witnessing, as we talk today, Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico is under martial law, folks, that everybody said would never happen.
[03:47:18.099 --> 03:47:19.160]  That's as we speak today.
[03:47:19.160 --> 03:47:21.701]  This has to do with the sweep of
[03:47:23.130 --> 03:47:27.452]  Uh, public housing for drugs and, uh, weapons in Puerto Rico.
[03:47:27.452 --> 03:47:28.213]  That's the excuse.
[03:47:28.213 --> 03:47:30.234]  That's the excuse that's being used.
[03:47:30.234 --> 03:47:40.640]  Now, the only point they don't make is that the tremendous tonnage of cocaine and narcotics coming into the United States is being done on C-130 military aircraft.
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:48.264]  It's been that way since, uh, all the way back in the 80s, and it was part of the Oliver North business with bringing in the drugs and the guns down to the countries.
[03:47:49.945 --> 03:47:54.907]  You're afraid of the suspension of what you believe is your right to bear arms.
[03:47:54.907 --> 03:47:57.308]  That's really at the root of this.
[03:47:57.308 --> 03:48:00.130]  You're afraid the feds are coming along to take your guns away.
[03:48:00.130 --> 03:48:06.153]  My basic concern is what kind of a country am I going to leave my children?
[03:48:06.153 --> 03:48:08.514]  I am very, very concerned about that.
[03:48:09.651 --> 03:48:15.377]  And that's the reason that I'm in the militia, is what kind of a country am I going to leave for my children?
[03:48:15.377 --> 03:48:17.739]  That's the same way with me, Phil.
[03:48:17.739 --> 03:48:20.702]  You're the chaplain, right?
[03:48:20.702 --> 03:48:23.105]  At 63, my youngest daughter just had a little girl.
[03:48:23.105 --> 03:48:25.427]  Well, she's a year old now.
[03:48:25.427 --> 03:48:31.233]  And I was amazed that at 63, I started to really appreciate
[03:48:31.989 --> 03:48:32.069]  No.
[03:48:32.069 --> 03:48:32.189]  No.
[03:48:32.189 --> 03:48:32.269]  No.
[03:48:50.357 --> 03:48:50.678]  I don't
[03:49:14.762 --> 03:49:17.686]  How will this express itself, this preservation?
[03:49:17.686 --> 03:49:18.587]  This preservation?
[03:49:18.587 --> 03:49:22.513]  What we do in Ohio is we arm people with knowledge, is what we do.
[03:49:23.197 --> 03:49:26.238]  The knowledge that your rights are eroding.
[03:49:26.238 --> 03:49:26.798]  That is correct.
[03:49:26.798 --> 03:49:27.439]  You've got to say that.
[03:49:27.439 --> 03:49:28.739]  Alright, stop it right there.
[03:49:28.739 --> 03:49:30.059]  I'm going to come back and play more.
[03:49:30.059 --> 03:49:35.441]  We're going to Overdrive today and tomorrow I'll probably play this for the full AM and FM audience.
[03:49:35.441 --> 03:49:40.323]  If you just Google American Militia Media Spin into Google, it'll come up.
[03:49:40.323 --> 03:49:42.244]  American Militia dash Media Spin.
[03:49:42.244 --> 03:49:44.705]  You can go to Infowars.com and watch.
[03:49:44.705 --> 03:49:46.765]  Well, there's links to hours of this stuff if you want.
[03:49:49.448 --> 03:49:52.750]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with here.
[03:49:52.750 --> 03:49:54.432]  Just the outright demonization.
[03:49:54.432 --> 03:49:57.454]  See, most of these guys were former military intelligence.
[03:49:57.454 --> 03:50:05.519]  Well, they had sources in that, and that's when Delta Force started buying off local governments, CIA takeover, government narcotics trafficking expanding.
[03:50:06.520 --> 03:50:09.562]  And they were doing drills for gun confiscation.
[03:50:09.562 --> 03:50:16.285]  And I then woke up a few years right after this, about a year after this, started going and videotaping these drills and seeing it for myself.
[03:50:16.285 --> 03:50:20.987]  And I found out, my God, these old guys on TV are telling the truth.
[03:50:20.987 --> 03:50:26.850]  And then here we are a few years later, 15 years later, right down getting our throats slit.
[03:50:26.850 --> 03:50:27.930]  It's all coming to a head.
[03:50:27.930 --> 03:50:28.330]  Stay with us.
[03:50:29.983 --> 03:50:36.148]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.

[03:53:34.516 --> 03:53:38.459]  Final segment for folks listening on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:53:38.459 --> 03:53:42.701]  But I'm going to go into overdrive, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 minutes.
[03:53:42.701 --> 03:53:43.562]  One place only.
[03:53:45.874 --> 03:53:47.815]  Infowars.com.
[03:53:47.815 --> 03:53:49.777]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:53:49.777 --> 03:53:51.358]  One stream only.
[03:53:51.358 --> 03:53:54.380]  One place to get it is the internet at those specific streams.
[03:53:54.380 --> 03:53:55.500]  Not the Genesis streams.
[03:53:55.500 --> 03:53:58.843]  Not any other streams.
[03:53:58.843 --> 03:54:01.545]  You know, just to see how right these men were.
[03:54:01.545 --> 03:54:04.206]  To see how on target they were.
[03:54:04.206 --> 03:54:09.370]  And to see how they were ridiculed and laughed at by the brainwashed, dumbed down mass of people in that audience.
[03:54:11.018 --> 03:54:16.520]  But now you go to YouTube and Google and you see these clips and every single person's agreeing.
[03:54:16.520 --> 03:54:21.582]  Unless it's some CENTCOM handle guy getting paid a hundred grand a year to bring his country down.
[03:54:21.582 --> 03:54:30.845]  I am sick of all the people in government who still go along with this evil, claiming you're the patriots, claiming you're the good guys, that you're getting rid of our freedom for America.
[03:54:30.845 --> 03:54:35.027]  You're doing that to make sure the bankers can rob the living daylights out of us.
[03:54:35.027 --> 03:54:37.048]  Let's play a few more minutes of this clip.
[03:54:37.048 --> 03:54:37.368]  Here it is.
[03:54:38.254 --> 03:54:43.736]  This preservation... What we do in Ohio is we arm people with knowledge, is what we do.
[03:54:43.736 --> 03:54:46.817]  The knowledge that your rights are eroding.
[03:54:46.817 --> 03:54:47.237]  That is correct.
[03:54:47.237 --> 03:54:48.477]  You gotta say this, friends.
[03:54:48.477 --> 03:54:54.079]  If you don't say this, this audience is gonna not know what... You look like a barbershop quartet singer.
[03:54:54.079 --> 03:54:54.959]  No, you're a sex guy.
[03:54:54.959 --> 03:54:55.399]  Go ahead.
[03:54:55.399 --> 03:54:55.739]  Go ahead.
[03:55:03.402 --> 03:55:15.446]  Every day American people from all across the country call us and they tell us two things.
[03:55:15.446 --> 03:55:17.167]  One, there's too much government.
[03:55:17.167 --> 03:55:22.229]  There's too much federal intervention into our states and in our personal lives that our states are losing our sovereignty.
[03:55:22.890 --> 03:55:23.650]  Back up.
[03:55:23.650 --> 03:55:26.311]  Give the control back to our local elected officials.
[03:55:26.311 --> 03:55:27.451]  Let's uphold our sheriffs.
[03:55:27.451 --> 03:55:34.053]  Let's give power back to our sheriffs who we esteem highly, who's our only elected law official in this country.
[03:55:34.053 --> 03:55:35.394]  Back off federal government.
[03:55:35.394 --> 03:55:37.094]  Give the states some power again.
[03:55:37.094 --> 03:55:38.595]  That's what the people are concerned about.
[03:55:38.595 --> 03:55:48.938]  And by the way, in reference to that, in reference to the possibility of them being a quartet, we have turned it into a huge singing organization of governors.
[03:55:48.938 --> 03:55:52.479]  As of today, the governors are wrapping up a convention.
[03:55:53.059 --> 03:55:54.101]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:55:54.101 --> 03:55:54.921]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:56:10.579 --> 03:56:11.760]  Okay, that's good.
[03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:12.060]  That's good.
[03:56:12.060 --> 03:56:18.928]  When we go into overdrive, I'll play the last three minutes of that clip and then ten minutes more of the other clip from Donahue.
[03:56:18.928 --> 03:56:19.649]  And there's more.
[03:56:19.649 --> 03:56:26.016]  There's more to the show online at InfoWars.com and there's a bunch of other Donahues and other programs where they're viciously
[03:56:27.074 --> 03:56:28.394]  Attacking the militia.
[03:56:28.394 --> 03:56:36.836]  And Sean Hannity says, arrest all militia members, anybody that talks about a New World Order, every child should have a microchip, and that's conservative.
[03:56:36.836 --> 03:56:40.357]  No, these are New World Order dirtbags in both parties.
[03:56:40.357 --> 03:56:52.399]  By the way, the stock market right now is down over 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and that is with hundreds of billions being pumped in today.
[03:56:52.399 --> 03:56:54.380]  They're talking about the dollar completely dying.
[03:56:56.013 --> 03:56:58.514]  Now is the time to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[03:56:58.514 --> 03:57:00.695]  I'm telling you, we're in prime territory for that.
[03:57:00.695 --> 03:57:02.676]  Please go to InfoWars.com.
[03:57:02.676 --> 03:57:03.697]  Do not wait.
[03:57:03.697 --> 03:57:08.779]  Get fabled enemies exposing how they carried out the attacks with intelligence ops.
[03:57:08.779 --> 03:57:12.101]  Get Truth Rising so people really know who the 9-11 Truth Movement is and why.
[03:57:12.101 --> 03:57:13.682]  I didn't even get into it today.
[03:57:13.682 --> 03:57:16.063]  YouTube openly announcing censorship.
[03:57:16.063 --> 03:57:19.345]  Other websites banning 9-11 Truth.
[03:57:19.345 --> 03:57:24.827]  Openly admitting that Lieberman sends them, the staff basically tells them what to ban and what not to ban.
[03:57:26.288 --> 03:57:28.991]  Uh, the media running around attacking 9-11 Truth.
[03:57:28.991 --> 03:57:30.892]  You can also tell operatives in our own movement.
[03:57:30.892 --> 03:57:34.936]  They're all activating right now with their disinfo.
[03:57:34.936 --> 03:57:36.677]  We're winning, thank God.
[03:57:36.677 --> 03:57:37.398]  The hearts and minds.
[03:57:37.398 --> 03:57:40.601]  But the enemy can stage terror attacks, economic collapse, you name it.
[03:57:40.601 --> 03:57:44.484]  So please visit InfoWars.com and don't forget, it's up to you to carry the ball.
[03:57:44.484 --> 03:57:51.070]  You can't just passively sit here and listen and then hope that everything works out and thinking, oh, good, Alex is on the air.
[03:57:51.070 --> 03:57:51.510]  No, no, no, no.
[03:57:51.690 --> 03:57:52.910]  Tell more people about the show.
[03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:54.170]  Tell them about the free podcast.
[03:57:54.170 --> 03:57:57.571]  Tell them we're coming back up live right now in one minute at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:57.571 --> 03:57:58.951]  But start your own radio shows.
[03:57:58.951 --> 03:57:59.551]  Take action.
[03:57:59.551 --> 03:58:01.052]  Your own websites.
[03:58:01.052 --> 03:58:04.652]  People are really listening right now because everything we've said has come true.
[03:58:04.652 --> 03:58:06.653]  So now's the time to strike while the iron's hot.
[03:58:06.653 --> 03:58:08.873]  We'll see you back on the other side at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:08.873 --> 03:58:09.693]  We're live.
[03:58:09.693 --> 03:58:11.294]  Stay with us.
[03:58:11.294 --> 03:58:12.934]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:12.934 --> 03:58:13.414]  All right.
[03:58:13.414 --> 03:58:14.194]  Take care, Alex.
[03:58:14.194 --> 03:58:14.734]  Good job.
[03:58:14.734 --> 03:58:15.174]  Hey, John.
[03:58:15.174 --> 03:58:15.714]  Appreciate it.
[03:58:15.714 --> 03:58:16.655]  I'll see you tomorrow, bubba.
[03:58:16.655 --> 03:58:17.135]  Anytime.
[03:58:17.135 --> 03:58:17.775]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[03:58:17.775 --> 03:58:18.095]  Take care.
[03:58:18.095 --> 03:58:18.415]  Bye-bye.
[03:58:19.640 --> 03:58:20.661]  Alright, buh-bye.
[03:58:20.661 --> 03:58:22.283]  He's good at those buh-byes.
[03:58:22.283 --> 03:58:24.185]  Hey, you know what?
[03:58:24.185 --> 03:58:28.490]  Let's not even do intro music here as we go into Overdrive.
[03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:32.635]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv Live or watching on the Archive there,
[03:58:34.669 --> 03:58:45.183]  For folks that don't know about PrisonPlanet.tv, that's where all my films are in super high quality, where we do the live streams every day, and it's 15 cents a day, and that pays for the big servers and the crew and everything we're doing.
[03:58:45.183 --> 03:58:50.670]  We're pretty low budget, but it still costs a lot, so we want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members that are out there.
[03:58:53.283 --> 03:59:08.147]  Okay, I want to go ahead and finish up this clip, and then there's another clip from the same show, but just look at how calm they are, how well-spoken, how focused, how serious they were, and how they were talking about martial law was being beta-tested then.
[03:59:08.147 --> 03:59:09.748]  Now, fast forward 14 years, 15 years,
[03:59:10.988 --> 03:59:15.770]  Army Times comes out and says, yeah, we're going to use regular army brigades in the U.S.
[03:59:15.770 --> 03:59:25.392]  to combat people rioting or civil disturbance, and we hope we don't have to kill Americans, and we're going to use microwave guns, and this is Homeland Security, and NORTHCOM runs America.
[03:59:25.392 --> 03:59:28.994]  Just like Iraq's occupied, the United States is now being occupied.
[03:59:28.994 --> 03:59:30.574]  This is third-world country stuff.
[03:59:30.574 --> 03:59:34.515]  Congress has been told, you're not involved in the bailouts and the corporate looting.
[03:59:34.515 --> 03:59:35.936]  Nobody's going to jail for it.
[03:59:35.936 --> 03:59:39.517]  We're not going to bail your houses out, we're just going to take your money and bail the bankers out.
[03:59:40.157 --> 03:59:40.898]  But it's not a bailout.
[03:59:40.898 --> 03:59:42.561]  They've already secured all their assets.
[03:59:42.561 --> 03:59:43.603]  It's a consolidation.
[03:59:43.603 --> 03:59:44.885]  It's a new world order.
[03:59:44.885 --> 03:59:47.609]  So let me go ahead and punch up this screen for me.
[03:59:47.609 --> 03:59:51.496]  I'll go ahead and play this for the viewers out there.
[03:59:51.496 --> 03:59:53.880]  We'll play the other clip for everybody as well.
[03:59:53.880 --> 03:59:54.220]  Here it is.
[03:59:55.838 --> 03:59:56.539]  It's much smaller.
[03:59:56.539 --> 03:59:57.259]  Anarchy, yeah.
[03:59:57.259 --> 03:59:59.621]  And so, training in the woods, what?
[03:59:59.621 --> 04:00:02.124]  In other words, you really think this is going to come down here?
[04:00:02.124 --> 04:00:08.089]  You have to understand that in the area that I live, it is woods.
[04:00:08.089 --> 04:00:10.691]  My closest neighbor is a half a mile away.
[04:00:10.691 --> 04:00:13.934]  I don't understand how higher interest rates and a big...
[04:00:18.021 --> 04:00:19.042]  I gotta say something here.
[04:00:19.042 --> 04:00:21.885]  Look how domesticated Donahue is.
[04:00:21.885 --> 04:00:25.829]  I mean, he's going, you live in the woods!
[04:00:25.829 --> 04:00:26.850]  A house in the woods!
[04:00:26.850 --> 04:00:28.032]  Oh my God!
[04:00:28.032 --> 04:00:30.634]  You should be like 90% of people in an urban area!
[04:00:30.634 --> 04:00:38.723]  So when we have a Great Depression, instead of 80% being rural and being able to survive and only 7 million starved in the Great Depression, tens of millions more will starve!
[04:00:38.723 --> 04:00:39.444]  It's so crazy!
[04:00:39.804 --> 04:00:40.505]  Oh my God!
[04:00:40.505 --> 04:00:42.126]  I live in the woods and have guns!
[04:00:42.126 --> 04:00:44.127]  You're not a domesticated slave like me!
[04:00:44.127 --> 04:00:50.152]  It's so shocking to see someone that's somewhat free and informed and 15 years before their time!
[04:00:50.152 --> 04:00:51.012]  Oh my God!
[04:00:51.012 --> 04:00:51.893]  It's so scary!
[04:00:51.893 --> 04:00:53.955]  Oh my God!
[04:00:53.955 --> 04:00:58.298]  But he sees a cop or a guy in a black ski mask in New York with a machine gun.
[04:00:58.298 --> 04:00:59.839]  He feels safe.
[04:00:59.839 --> 04:01:01.580]  Oh, FEMA camps.
[04:01:01.580 --> 04:01:04.242]  Cops with machine guns and black masks.
[04:01:04.242 --> 04:01:05.163]  And cameras everywhere.
[04:01:05.163 --> 04:01:07.065]  It makes me feel so safe to have a criminal government.
[04:01:09.167 --> 04:01:12.348]  To see citizens with guns!
[04:01:12.348 --> 04:01:13.809]  They live in the woods!
[04:01:13.809 --> 04:01:15.009]  They have water wells!
[04:01:15.009 --> 04:01:17.190]  They're not drinking their fluoride!
[04:01:17.190 --> 04:01:20.131]  Dear God, they're crazy people!
[04:01:20.131 --> 04:01:22.192]  Let's go back to these dangerous people!
[04:01:22.192 --> 04:01:23.392]  You live in the woods, though!
[04:01:23.392 --> 04:01:24.513]  The woods!
[04:01:24.513 --> 04:01:26.393]  My God, it's crazy!
[04:01:26.393 --> 04:01:28.574]  Oh my God, this guy's out of his mind!
[04:01:28.574 --> 04:01:31.195]  I bet he doesn't think GMO's good for him!
[04:01:31.195 --> 04:01:33.456]  Oh God, help us!
[04:01:33.456 --> 04:01:34.136]  It's all over!
[04:01:34.136 --> 04:01:36.377]  There it is, folks.
[04:01:41.054 --> 04:01:43.696]  Oh, for some reason the YouTube clip's not playing.
[04:01:43.696 --> 04:01:44.717]  Good old YouTube.
[04:01:44.717 --> 04:01:45.678]  I tell ya, it tortures me.
[04:01:45.678 --> 04:01:50.222]  Here, I'll just play it from here.
[04:01:50.222 --> 04:01:52.844]  The economic situation of this country.
[04:01:52.844 --> 04:01:55.827]  We're four and a half trillion dollars in debt.
[04:01:55.827 --> 04:01:58.649]  We're going in debt at a billion dollars a day.
[04:01:58.649 --> 04:02:04.674]  What will happen when all of the money collected on taxes goes to interest on the debt?
[04:02:05.595 --> 04:02:11.861]  If you look at Argentina and Brazil, you have hyperinflation, an economic situation.
[04:02:11.861 --> 04:02:14.223]  Collapse of the economy, rioting in the streets.
[04:02:14.223 --> 04:02:15.824]  Anarchy, yeah.
[04:02:15.824 --> 04:02:18.186]  And so, training in the woods, what?
[04:02:18.186 --> 04:02:20.769]  In other words, you really think this is going to come down here?
[04:02:20.769 --> 04:02:22.710]  You have to understand that in the area that I live, it is woods.
[04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:23.811]  My closest neighbors are half a mile away.
[04:02:29.356 --> 04:02:38.727]  I don't understand how higher interest rates and a big service load on the debt is going to be cured by wearing fatigues and running around the woods as a grown man huffing and puffing.
[04:02:44.193 --> 04:02:49.381]  If we were not dressed like this, if we were not dressed like this in training, we wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today.
[04:02:49.381 --> 04:02:53.987]  And we want the American people to pull together, contact their elected officials... And tell them what?
[04:02:53.987 --> 04:02:59.675]  Tell them what the problems are, and let's sit down and let's start working out the problems instead of just... John, here's what you told us.
[04:02:59.675 --> 04:03:00.756]  Here's what you told us.
[04:03:01.618 --> 04:03:05.683]  No, but John, I think, said this to us.
[04:03:05.683 --> 04:03:08.967]  It's about informing the public about what's going on in this country.
[04:03:08.967 --> 04:03:14.515]  You say it's a sell-out, the government is selling us out, the Constitution's in peril.
[04:03:14.515 --> 04:03:17.319]  You believe that our government is involved in a population reduction.
[04:03:18.399 --> 04:03:19.600]  Come on.
[04:03:19.600 --> 04:03:25.825]  Our government wants to disarm the citizens, create a one world government, then do a world reduction of the population.
[04:03:25.825 --> 04:03:32.811]  And what we're seeing now is foreign military equipment and chemical warfare equipment being brought into our country.
[04:03:32.811 --> 04:03:34.192]  Come on.
[04:03:34.192 --> 04:03:38.076]  Okay, if I might respond, I'm going to step on John's toes here.
[04:03:39.346 --> 04:03:46.768]  You've got to ask yourself, and you folks that are finding some of this humorous, number one, this was photographed in Texas a couple of weeks ago.
[04:03:46.768 --> 04:03:47.008]  Yeah.
[04:03:47.008 --> 04:03:53.270]  Alright, this is a Frog short-range Russian chemical biological missile.
[04:03:53.270 --> 04:03:55.050]  We have photographed several of these.
[04:03:55.050 --> 04:03:57.751]  We also have this equipment on videotape.
[04:03:57.751 --> 04:03:59.431]  With a red star and a gold finish.
[04:03:59.431 --> 04:04:02.132]  Sorry about that, folks, but this is in Texas.
[04:04:02.132 --> 04:04:05.653]  If that doesn't bother you, then maybe we should be... How do you know that?
[04:04:05.653 --> 04:04:06.473]  Okay, excuse me.
[04:04:07.453 --> 04:04:09.655]  By the way, I'm going to hit pause again.
[04:04:09.655 --> 04:04:11.696]  I mean, I've got to get out here and go to a meeting.
[04:04:11.696 --> 04:04:15.819]  I've got about ten more minutes to play of this, but this is what's incredible.
[04:04:15.819 --> 04:04:28.988]  Now, in 2008, we knew NORTHCOM did this five years ago, officially, but they didn't advertise it, said Canadian and Mexican and Eastern Bloc troops will be used to patrol America during an economic collapse for martial law.
[04:04:29.801 --> 04:04:31.164]  Or terrorist attack.
[04:04:31.164 --> 04:04:38.902]  Then, in early 2008, the NORTHCOM publicly signed a deal with the Canadian and Mexican generals on Canadian TV.
[04:04:40.031 --> 04:04:42.092]  And then Congress said, we'd like to be able to see that.
[04:04:42.092 --> 04:04:44.172]  We're supposed to fund that or agree to that.
[04:04:44.172 --> 04:04:45.433]  We passed the laws.
[04:04:45.433 --> 04:04:48.293]  And they said, nope, continuity of government, sit down and shut up.
[04:04:48.293 --> 04:04:51.554]  And now Paulson comes out and says trillions in bailouts.
[04:04:51.554 --> 04:04:53.655]  It's not 700 billion, it's trillions and trillions.
[04:04:53.655 --> 04:04:56.156]  And Congress started talking a week and a half ago saying, well, we have to look at that.
[04:04:56.156 --> 04:04:58.196]  And he said, sit down and shut up.
[04:04:58.196 --> 04:05:01.437]  Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[04:05:01.437 --> 04:05:02.998]  Everything these guys said in 1994.
[04:05:02.998 --> 04:05:04.058]  What is that, 14 years ago?
[04:05:09.969 --> 04:05:11.610]  Everything came true.
[04:05:11.610 --> 04:05:15.052]  And now it's all declassified about the population reduction?
[04:05:15.052 --> 04:05:16.653]  The public just can't deal with it.
[04:05:16.653 --> 04:05:18.494]  It's your fault out there, folks.
[04:05:18.494 --> 04:05:29.361]  We have given you all the information, and there's clips of me in 95, 96, 97 saying this stuff, and these guys all over the place before that, you know, in the 80s saying it.
[04:05:29.361 --> 04:05:30.221]  And other people.
[04:05:30.221 --> 04:05:31.602]  I mean, they've all been right.
[04:05:31.602 --> 04:05:33.223]  They told you!
[04:05:33.223 --> 04:05:36.105]  And you laugh at them!
[04:05:36.105 --> 04:05:37.426]  Let's just go back to it.
[04:05:37.426 --> 04:05:38.726]  Unbelievable.
[04:05:38.726 --> 04:05:39.467]  Unbelievable.
[04:05:41.653 --> 04:05:47.175]  Flatbeds of Russian tanks and armament that they brought into Montana.
[04:05:47.175 --> 04:05:49.016]  Our own people photographed this.
[04:05:49.016 --> 04:05:50.397]  I'm sorry about that.
[04:05:50.397 --> 04:05:52.117]  The Russians are coming again, you're telling me?
[04:05:52.117 --> 04:05:52.237]  No, no.
[04:05:52.237 --> 04:05:53.158]  They're here.
[04:05:53.158 --> 04:05:54.178]  Oh, they're here.
[04:05:54.178 --> 04:05:54.578]  I see.
[04:05:54.578 --> 04:05:56.259]  While you're still handling your microphone.
[04:05:56.259 --> 04:05:58.600]  There are millions of Americans rising up in the militia.
[04:05:58.600 --> 04:05:58.920]  Right.
[04:05:58.920 --> 04:06:01.101]  There's two ways to defuse the militia.
[04:06:01.101 --> 04:06:08.044]  Number one is people like you taking the information, taking our fears and proving that we're wrong.
[04:06:08.044 --> 04:06:08.984]  Prove us wrong.
[04:06:08.984 --> 04:06:10.945]  That will defuse the militia movement or
[04:06:11.845 --> 04:06:19.550]  People like you and the mainstream news media shine a light on this information and find out it's true, then let's get the country back on its true course.
[04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:24.212]  Why is it so easy for us to glean support from the public?
[04:06:24.212 --> 04:06:25.653]  We don't even have to go after them.
[04:06:25.653 --> 04:06:26.514]  People are calling us.
[04:06:26.514 --> 04:06:27.514]  Let me tell you why.
[04:06:27.514 --> 04:06:30.296]  Because I think you're stocking ammunition.
[04:06:30.296 --> 04:06:32.197]  I think you have semi-automatic.
[04:06:32.197 --> 04:06:33.357]  I think you've got automatic.
[04:06:35.438 --> 04:06:38.521]  I mean, listen to what a raving loony he is.
[04:06:38.521 --> 04:06:39.922]  I know why they're calling you.
[04:06:39.922 --> 04:06:42.144]  I think you're stuck in ammunition.
[04:06:42.144 --> 04:06:45.387]  I think you got it in there like it's illegal.
[04:06:45.387 --> 04:06:49.130]  He's like a totally domesticated creature, man.
[04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:51.512]  But, you know, all the liberals I know now are buying guns.
[04:06:51.512 --> 04:06:53.053]  They finally get it.
[04:06:53.053 --> 04:06:55.175]  They finally broke their conditioning.
[04:06:55.175 --> 04:06:59.339]  And most of the Kool-Aid drinking's going on from the Sarah Palin crowd.
[04:06:59.339 --> 04:07:01.461]  Yeah, by the... Oh, it's... This country's so gone.
[04:07:03.437 --> 04:07:06.858]  Go ahead and punch me up on screen here.
[04:07:06.858 --> 04:07:11.240]  We're not going to look at this hot booty video right here that's beside it.
[04:07:11.240 --> 04:07:17.783]  I'm going to give Paul a laugh in there, being stupid.
[04:07:17.783 --> 04:07:24.305]  You've got to laugh about some of this while the stock market's plunging and the bankers are raping the living daylights out of our entire country.
[04:07:24.305 --> 04:07:25.586]  I'm going to play this 10-minute clip.
[04:07:26.431 --> 04:07:27.532]  And then we're just going to end the show.
[04:07:27.532 --> 04:07:28.793]  It's going to go into retransmission.
[04:07:28.793 --> 04:07:34.778]  I had a bunch of big guests, key economic analysis, a ton of info about cell phones coming out, and a lot more.
[04:07:34.778 --> 04:07:35.879]  I meant to get into the sun.
[04:07:35.879 --> 04:07:41.623]  NASA's having a special announcement on Friday about the future of the sun, and they say they're really worried about it.
[04:07:41.623 --> 04:07:47.768]  It's cooling off, and in 300 years of being recorded, never done this.
[04:07:47.768 --> 04:07:51.972]  It's snowing in South Africa right now, normally about 100 degrees there, but they're in feet of snow.
[04:07:53.493 --> 04:07:54.713]  But it's global warming, man!
[04:07:54.713 --> 04:08:00.455]  You better pay a global tax to them or everything's over.
[04:08:00.455 --> 04:08:09.137]  Let's go ahead and go to this page and play this clip for everybody that is out there.
[04:08:09.137 --> 04:08:17.039]  Let's go ahead and show this fool, Donahue, really making a fool out of himself.
[04:08:17.039 --> 04:08:17.399]  Here it is.
[04:08:20.376 --> 04:08:31.140]  I think you've got hardware on tripods, and you're looking out, you probably have night vision glasses, and every time you hear a tree crack in the woods, you're gonna blow half the forest away!
[04:08:31.140 --> 04:08:31.980]  Where did that happen?
[04:08:31.980 --> 04:08:34.661]  Where did that happen in America?
[04:08:34.661 --> 04:08:37.842]  You know what, I got a comment on this too, I'm just gonna back it up.
[04:08:38.789 --> 04:08:40.130]  I got a comment on this.
[04:08:40.130 --> 04:08:47.893]  People always tell me, oh, you're afraid, you're paranoid, you're scared, you hear a creak at night, you shoot bullet holes in the wall.
[04:08:47.893 --> 04:08:49.054]  No, it's the opposite.
[04:08:49.054 --> 04:08:52.996]  We know we have a criminal government, we know they're so evil, it's incalculable.
[04:08:54.591 --> 04:09:01.514]  We know, because we've been so gullible, we know that they've gotten away with so much, and then we have the courage to come up and fight them head-to-head.
[04:09:01.514 --> 04:09:07.857]  And these guys have the courage to, way before their time, to go on TV and warn everybody about exactly what was going to happen.
[04:09:07.857 --> 04:09:11.279]  Talking about hyperinflation and devaluation coming for his kids.
[04:09:11.279 --> 04:09:14.261]  Now his kids, who were five, are now twenty.
[04:09:14.261 --> 04:09:14.801]  And he was right.
[04:09:14.801 --> 04:09:18.062]  I mean, this is like prophecy, but it wasn't.
[04:09:18.062 --> 04:09:19.943]  It was all in the documents.
[04:09:19.943 --> 04:09:22.064]  That's why they were right then, I'm right now.
[04:09:22.064 --> 04:09:22.825]  And I was right then.
[04:09:23.848 --> 04:09:25.530]  And many other people were right then.
[04:09:25.530 --> 04:09:28.292]  This is when I was waking up when stuff like this was on TV.
[04:09:28.292 --> 04:09:29.373]  This is what I looked into.
[04:09:29.373 --> 04:09:31.936]  I remember watching stuff like this on television.
[04:09:31.936 --> 04:09:36.040]  And I was on air just a year later, when the Feds bombed OKC, to go expose that.
[04:09:37.338 --> 04:09:40.861]  So here he is going, you're scared, you're creeping around.
[04:09:40.861 --> 04:09:44.023]  No, they're bold on TV, knowing they were going to get heat.
[04:09:44.023 --> 04:09:47.526]  Some of these guys got set up and sent to prison and all sorts of stuff happened.
[04:09:47.526 --> 04:09:48.727]  My God.
[04:09:48.727 --> 04:09:51.889]  Feds would plant pipe bombs on militia leaders' property.
[04:09:51.889 --> 04:09:54.971]  It was hellish what they went through and I salute them.
[04:09:54.971 --> 04:09:59.895]  I salute you for what you've done defending this republic in the great spirit of our forefathers.
[04:09:59.895 --> 04:10:00.316]  I really do.
[04:10:00.996 --> 04:10:07.483]  So I'm going to go ahead and finish this clip, and then when this clip's over, we'll go to rebroadcast right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[04:10:07.483 --> 04:10:11.468]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[04:10:11.468 --> 04:10:13.090]  Here it is, my friends.
[04:10:15.069 --> 04:10:26.315]  Because I think you've got hardware on tripods, and you're looking out, you probably have night vision glasses, and every time you hear a tree crack in the woods, you're going to blow half the forest away!
[04:10:26.315 --> 04:10:27.035]  Your fears... Where did that happen?
[04:10:27.035 --> 04:10:27.616]  That happened in America!
[04:10:27.616 --> 04:10:29.017]  You must be talking... You must be a little bit, uh, paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:29.017 --> 04:10:30.037]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:30.037 --> 04:10:31.078]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:31.078 --> 04:10:31.978]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:31.978 --> 04:10:33.039]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:33.039 --> 04:10:33.879]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:33.879 --> 04:10:34.780]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:34.780 --> 04:10:35.560]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:35.560 --> 04:10:36.461]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:36.461 --> 04:10:37.341]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:37.341 --> 04:10:38.222]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:38.222 --> 04:10:39.022]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:39.022 --> 04:10:39.982]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:39.982 --> 04:10:40.903]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:40.903 --> 04:10:41.883]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil!
[04:10:41.883 --> 04:10:42.824]  You must be a little bit paranoid
[04:10:43.260 --> 04:10:44.841]  Makes your case, don't you?
[04:10:44.841 --> 04:10:45.541]  Absolutely.
[04:10:45.541 --> 04:10:50.344]  That the federal government is coming down, they've got all the weapons... That's the problem, Phil.
[04:10:50.344 --> 04:10:54.407]  The problem is, regardless of what anyone in this audience... One show at a time, this young man is speaking.
[04:10:54.407 --> 04:10:55.767]  Can't be heard if you talk.
[04:10:55.767 --> 04:11:03.732]  No matter what anyone in this audience feels, or anyone in the country feels about David Koresh and his followers, whether they're innocent or guilty, they deserve due process.
[04:11:03.732 --> 04:11:05.773]  And they didn't receive that.
[04:11:05.773 --> 04:11:09.976]  And regardless of what you felt about the adults, the children certainly weren't guilty of anything.
[04:11:09.976 --> 04:11:10.776]  And that's what we're concerned about.
[04:11:11.116 --> 04:11:16.362]  This is evidence of what the federal government is capable of.
[04:11:16.362 --> 04:11:21.749]  And you are concerned about house-to-house sweeps for armament aren't you?
[04:11:21.749 --> 04:11:23.931]  You think the feds are capable of that aren't you?
[04:11:27.215 --> 04:11:29.717]  We don't think that the feds are capable of it.
[04:11:29.717 --> 04:11:39.845]  As I said two minutes ago, martial law in San Juan, Puerto Rico, folks, with full military force, dragging men, women, and children from their apartments.
[04:11:39.845 --> 04:11:40.286]  It is true.
[04:11:40.286 --> 04:11:41.567]  With no warrants whatsoever.
[04:11:41.567 --> 04:11:42.327]  It is true.
[04:11:42.327 --> 04:11:46.371]  And when a young woman asks, what's going on at four in the morning?
[04:11:47.151 --> 04:11:48.513]  She said, where are your warrants?
[04:11:48.513 --> 04:11:57.183]  They smashed her door down with a sledgehammer and said to her, this is our warning, dammit, this is our warrant, bring your stuff out.
[04:11:57.183 --> 04:12:00.387]  And they went completely and dragged them out in the street.
[04:12:00.387 --> 04:12:03.031]  What happened to the tenant that a man's home is his castle?
[04:12:03.031 --> 04:12:03.912]  And a woman's as well.
[04:12:04.392 --> 04:12:10.317]  And Anson, I'll give you a chance, hang on just a second, I promise, we'll get the charts on in just a second.
[04:12:10.317 --> 04:12:16.783]  It is true, you know, you turn on the evening news, you know, you see them, boy those guys are knocking them doors down and there's, you know, people inside in their underwear.
[04:12:16.783 --> 04:12:19.445]  And you're on Channel 7 Action Evening News!
[04:12:19.445 --> 04:12:23.208]  It does seem, now, you, I assume you're upset about this as well.
[04:12:23.208 --> 04:12:28.253]  But the excuse of public housing is ridiculous because when you're done with that, it'll be your private homes.
[04:12:28.573 --> 04:12:29.754]  They'll come door to door.
[04:12:29.754 --> 04:12:36.279]  Those of you that are finding humor in it, you better never take your clothes off, so you're not in underwear on the next evening news.
[04:12:36.279 --> 04:12:47.167]  What is true, we've got, and you see this, and this is what happens when the country gets fearful, and you guys are ready for this, and you're not gonna let it happen, including the man of God here, the good old Chaplin.
[04:12:47.167 --> 04:12:51.770]  And when they come and kick your doors in, you better damn well hope some of these guys are handy.
[04:12:51.770 --> 04:12:52.211]  Yeah.
[04:12:52.211 --> 04:12:54.933]  Otherwise, you better have your own semi-automatic.
[04:12:54.933 --> 04:12:57.675]  Now, when they come for you guys, when they come for you guys,
[04:12:58.015 --> 04:12:59.236]  You're gonna be ready, aren't you?
[04:12:59.236 --> 04:13:01.458]  When they come for us, we won't be there.
[04:13:01.458 --> 04:13:03.519]  I bet you know how to use a gun, though.
[04:13:03.519 --> 04:13:03.860]  Yeah, I do.
[04:13:03.860 --> 04:13:06.402]  Well, if the government costs my gun, I'm simply gonna let them have it.
[04:13:12.014 --> 04:13:13.314]  Funny, funny joke.
[04:13:13.314 --> 04:13:14.215]  You're serious?
[04:13:14.215 --> 04:13:16.396]  You pull the trigger on a federal agent coming up to your place?
[04:13:16.396 --> 04:13:17.816]  30 minutes as I can.
[04:13:17.816 --> 04:13:18.176]  I will.
[04:13:18.176 --> 04:13:19.297]  A man home is his castle.
[04:13:19.297 --> 04:13:21.257]  If I have to die proving that, so be it.
[04:13:21.257 --> 04:13:26.539]  And how many folks, are there more, just a minute, are there more and more people interested in the militia now?
[04:13:26.539 --> 04:13:28.300]  Let me tell you, let me give you a general gist of it.
[04:13:28.300 --> 04:13:29.320]  Give me some numbers.
[04:13:29.320 --> 04:13:31.181]  Let me give you a general gist of it.
[04:13:31.181 --> 04:13:34.342]  A year and a half ago, there was not a heck of a lot.
[04:13:34.342 --> 04:13:37.823]  And some of us were out there trying to let people know what was going on.
[04:13:38.283 --> 04:13:46.025]  Right now, across the United States, we calculate active members meeting probably in a neighborhood of 10 million.
[04:13:46.025 --> 04:13:46.625]  How's that, Greg?
[04:13:46.625 --> 04:13:47.665]  Nah, nah, nah.
[04:13:47.665 --> 04:13:48.085]  Okay, fine.
[04:13:48.085 --> 04:13:48.685]  No, no.
[04:13:48.685 --> 04:13:49.466]  Hang on a minute.
[04:13:49.466 --> 04:13:49.786]  Sure.
[04:13:49.786 --> 04:13:50.746]  Just hang on a second.
[04:13:50.746 --> 04:13:53.086]  Boy, I'll tell you, you and your charts here.
[04:13:53.086 --> 04:13:58.507]  Bob Fletcher and John Trotman are from Montana, I'll give you a chance.
[04:13:58.507 --> 04:14:00.828]  Yes, they do feel that the Bill of Rights
[04:14:00.828 --> 04:14:08.310]  This is being eroded, that protections of privacy are being undermined in the name of the law.
[04:14:08.310 --> 04:14:10.290]  They love their local sheriff.
[04:14:10.290 --> 04:14:11.410]  Let me tell you about my sheriff.
[04:14:11.410 --> 04:14:12.291]  Let me tell you about my sheriff.
[04:14:12.291 --> 04:14:13.071]  I'll come back on your knees.
[04:14:26.917 --> 04:14:39.348]  The sheriff in my county has told me that if he comes to my house, he will show me a warrant, his officers will identify themselves, and I will be more than happy to allow them to come into my house.
[04:14:39.348 --> 04:14:41.910]  They treat me as a human being with respect.
[04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:42.671]  What will the feds do?
[04:14:42.671 --> 04:14:54.181]  Well, when we have a government that is on the verge of being completely out of control, they allow tyrants to come in with hooded masks on, unidentified,
[04:14:55.120 --> 04:14:57.141]  Bust down your door.
[04:14:57.141 --> 04:15:00.183]  It's happened all over America.
[04:15:00.183 --> 04:15:01.964]  And we're going to all say that's okay.
[04:15:01.964 --> 04:15:03.646]  Our neighbor wasn't any good anyways.
[04:15:03.646 --> 04:15:09.649]  In other words, the local, or the federal agent, you're saying, often wears a mask.
[04:15:09.649 --> 04:15:12.691]  And they don't even let your sheriff know that they're doing it.
[04:15:12.691 --> 04:15:17.254]  When he shoots your kid's sister, nobody's going to know who it is because he's got a mask.
[04:15:17.254 --> 04:15:21.097]  And this is the one world government coming down on you.
[04:15:21.097 --> 04:15:22.318]  First they take your taxes.
[04:15:23.158 --> 04:15:24.818]  Then they take your privacy.
[04:15:24.818 --> 04:15:28.679]  Then they take all the power away from the local sheriff and the local police department.
[04:15:28.679 --> 04:15:35.621]  Phil, if we were on stage without ID cards or without names and masks, would that be a concern of yours?
[04:15:35.621 --> 04:15:36.001]  Yeah.
[04:15:36.001 --> 04:15:39.321]  Why isn't it a concern with the federal government?
[04:15:39.321 --> 04:15:40.662]  These are undercover narcs.
[04:15:40.662 --> 04:15:42.082]  They don't want to be caught.
[04:15:42.082 --> 04:15:45.543]  Why is the sheriff not afraid?
[04:15:45.543 --> 04:15:52.304]  Half of the undercover narcs are the ones that brought the dope in 90 days earlier and using it now as an excuse.
[04:15:53.124 --> 04:15:55.927]  This, this guy, what's wrong with this picture?
[04:15:55.927 --> 04:16:01.274]  When you were a kid, when you were a kid, your mother told you go to the friendly policeman if you got lost.
[04:16:01.274 --> 04:16:04.437]  Can you imagine sending your kid to this yahoo over here?
[04:16:04.437 --> 04:16:05.499]  Yeah, how much time we got?
[04:16:05.499 --> 04:16:05.819]  Okay.
[04:16:05.819 --> 04:16:07.962]  How much time we got, you figure, before the yahoos come?
[04:16:08.712 --> 04:16:14.759]  I'll give you a chance to answer that.
[04:16:14.759 --> 04:16:21.606]  I ask you a 3-ounce question, I get a 10-pound answer here.
[04:16:21.606 --> 04:16:22.888]  How much time have we got?
[04:16:25.731 --> 04:16:35.178]  The Grace Commission in 1984 told us that by 1996, the economic collapse, the economic problems... So we're gonna go down and anarchy's gonna ensue and you're the guys that are gonna be ready.
[04:16:35.178 --> 04:16:36.679]  And you're gonna help protect me, I think you're saying.
[04:16:36.679 --> 04:16:37.579]  Can I say something about this?
[04:16:37.579 --> 04:16:38.940]  Yes you can, you really can.
[04:16:38.940 --> 04:16:39.621]  I'll give you a chance.
[04:16:39.621 --> 04:16:41.222]  That's law enforcement right there, okay?
[04:16:41.222 --> 04:16:43.303]  They're wearing hoods, they're legal, they're protecting the law.
[04:16:43.303 --> 04:16:43.784]  What's wrong with that?
[04:16:43.784 --> 04:16:47.486]  We're out here in the open, we identify ourselves, and they're saying we're illegal?
[04:16:47.486 --> 04:16:51.829]  This is the new thing in America, as recently reported on the front page of the New York Times.
[04:16:51.829 --> 04:16:54.191]  It's called the militia.
[04:16:55.465 --> 04:16:57.267]  No, they say they're not racist.
[04:16:57.267 --> 04:17:01.950]  It's not just about guns and possession of guns, but the Second Amendment is involved here, definitely.
[04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:03.732]  They're proud of their Second Amendment.
[04:17:03.732 --> 04:17:06.514]  It's about provisions, it's about protecting your neighbor.
[04:17:06.514 --> 04:17:09.856]  They're neighbors, they feel like they're together, they're gonna help.
[04:17:09.856 --> 04:17:15.501]  And by God, no constable's gonna come from some faraway place and break their door down.
[04:17:15.501 --> 04:17:17.202]  They'll shoot them first.
[04:17:17.202 --> 04:17:18.723]  He did.
[04:17:18.723 --> 04:17:19.904]  He did.
[04:17:19.904 --> 04:17:24.408]  He said, I'll give you a chance to talk all you want when we come back in just a moment.
[04:17:54.379 --> 04:18:00.082]  You've met the good brother Doug Hall, member of the Michigan Militia.
[04:18:00.082 --> 04:18:04.684]  Okay, so you don't sleep in the woods, you maneuver in the woods.
[04:18:04.684 --> 04:18:09.666]  And you say Michigan is quite wooded, especially the northern part.
[04:18:09.666 --> 04:18:11.487]  Here's the Reverend speaking to the troops.
[04:18:11.487 --> 04:18:14.649]  I guess this is a weekend gathering for... Go get them, Reverend.
[04:18:14.649 --> 04:18:16.349]  Praise the Lord.
[04:18:16.349 --> 04:18:21.652]  I felt that the Lord was saying, this is... this group...
[04:18:23.007 --> 04:18:26.468]  Because, you know, the way it's growing across the nation is phenomenal.
[04:18:26.468 --> 04:18:30.470]  I go to staff meetings and can't believe what I hear is going on.
[04:18:30.470 --> 04:18:36.733]  But I felt like the Lord is saying, this is the army of the Lord in the United States for this moment.
[04:18:39.416 --> 04:18:41.397]  That's the Army of the Lord, is it?
[04:18:41.397 --> 04:18:42.958]  That's the Army of the Lord.
[04:18:42.958 --> 04:18:43.938]  Yeah.
[04:18:43.938 --> 04:18:47.900]  Well, that's the Army I want to be in.
[04:18:47.900 --> 04:18:52.322]  I don't want to laugh at these people, but I feel that they're all weird.
[04:18:52.322 --> 04:18:55.163]  But I don't think it's that bad.
[04:18:55.163 --> 04:18:59.525]  And as for him saying he's religious and it's the Army of the Lord, it's something else.
[04:18:59.525 --> 04:19:01.005]  And I don't think it's that serious.
[04:19:01.005 --> 04:19:02.586]  I don't think it's that bad.
[04:19:02.586 --> 04:19:05.407]  And I would like to know if they plan on maybe taking over the government.
[04:19:05.407 --> 04:19:06.668]  Maybe do like they did in Haiti.
[04:19:07.068 --> 04:19:08.530]  You know what?
[04:19:08.530 --> 04:19:09.410]  We are the government.
[04:19:09.410 --> 04:19:10.792]  The same as you're the government.
[04:19:10.792 --> 04:19:11.933]  You are the government.
[04:19:11.933 --> 04:19:14.916]  And the problem is who did take over Haiti, ma'am?
[04:19:14.916 --> 04:19:16.798]  Who took over Haiti a couple weeks ago?
[04:19:16.798 --> 04:19:18.620]  No, I'm talking about before.
[04:19:18.620 --> 04:19:18.820]  No, no.
[04:19:18.820 --> 04:19:19.861]  Who took over Haiti?
[04:19:19.861 --> 04:19:20.782]  You mentioned it.
[04:19:20.782 --> 04:19:22.103]  You know who took over Haiti?
[04:19:22.103 --> 04:19:23.705]  An out-of-control government.
[04:19:24.085 --> 04:19:40.548]  They did not do anything other than go to some unknown entity called the United Nations, has nothing to do with your representative, congressional representative, and went in there and just took them over and stuck who they wanted in there, who, by the way, is now a dope-drop operation in between South America.
[04:19:40.548 --> 04:19:43.909]  You keep giving us lectures about world... That's who Eddie is.
[04:19:43.909 --> 04:19:45.830]  We want to know about this, Bob.
[04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:46.870]  Do you understand that?
[04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:48.550]  We want to know what motivates you.
[04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:50.110]  Hey, I want to say something on this.
[04:19:50.110 --> 04:19:51.671]  Well, hey, now, Reverend, hey.
[04:19:52.691 --> 04:19:54.331]  Hey, hey, it's for horses, Reverend.
[04:19:54.331 --> 04:19:55.212]  Oh, well, straw, whatever.
[04:19:55.212 --> 04:19:55.592]  Go ahead, Reverend.
[04:19:55.592 --> 04:19:55.852]  Go ahead.
[04:19:55.852 --> 04:20:03.514]  This was taken out of context.
[04:20:03.514 --> 04:20:06.295]  This is another one of these bites that's taken out of context.
[04:20:06.295 --> 04:20:08.875]  I set the condition, number one.
[04:20:08.875 --> 04:20:14.057]  I told these militiamen, if you are going to be the army of the Lord, you better be living right in your own homes.
[04:20:15.626 --> 04:20:18.587]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is that.
[04:20:18.587 --> 04:20:20.228]  But there's more of that online.
[04:20:20.228 --> 04:20:23.609]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[04:20:23.609 --> 04:20:24.630]  But look at their courage.
[04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:25.590]  Look how they're bold.
[04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:34.333]  Look how upright they were being attacked by that lesser man who was laughing and mocking them with that mindless group of people pilloring them and booing them and laughing at them.
[04:20:34.333 --> 04:20:40.236]  And a lot of these guys got set up, went to prison, had pipe bombs buried on their property, hundreds of them.
[04:20:40.236 --> 04:20:43.577]  Feds infiltrated, tried to begin to be violent, never worked.
[04:20:45.779 --> 04:20:52.441]  Just amazing people, everything that they've done, and all I can do is commend the American militia.
[04:20:52.441 --> 04:21:03.065]  And it's in the Second Amendment, all men 18 to 49 are supposed to be part of it, 18 to 44, and instead we've got illegal aliens and foreign felons making up a lot of our military now.
[04:21:03.065 --> 04:21:08.447]  We can't have the citizens involved in saying we'll defend our local governments and communities against corporate tyranny.
[04:21:09.367 --> 04:21:15.350]  But you can have aggravated felons in your military and illegal aliens in them, and if you didn't know, folks, they're recruiting them.
[04:21:15.350 --> 04:21:16.190]  You're blind to that.
[04:21:16.190 --> 04:21:18.111]  But just everything they're saying has come true.
[04:21:18.111 --> 04:21:19.412]  Everything they warned.
[04:21:19.412 --> 04:21:24.094]  And they deserve the respect of the people.
[04:21:24.094 --> 04:21:26.875]  As I said, we're going to go into retransmission now.
[04:21:26.875 --> 04:21:31.878]  Let me just go another two, three minutes, and we'll just come right out when the show comes back out of rebroadcast.
[04:21:32.678 --> 04:21:34.901]  It's usually about 30 seconds ahead on the internet refeed, so at T-324.30.
[04:21:34.901 --> 04:21:36.823]  I will end this transmission.
[04:21:44.298 --> 04:21:49.163]  There was some news I didn't get to today, as well, that I needed to get to.
[04:21:49.163 --> 04:21:55.150]  This story about, clearly, globalist-backed forces trying to bomb and kill the new Pakistan government.
[04:21:55.150 --> 04:21:57.792]  They're saying Al-Qaeda was behind it.
[04:21:57.792 --> 04:22:00.675]  Al-Qaeda always attacking the New World Order's enemies.
[04:22:00.675 --> 04:22:03.478]  Good little dutiful creatures.
[04:22:03.478 --> 04:22:04.980]  The sun is going crazy.
[04:22:06.317 --> 04:22:08.038]  I meant to get to that.
[04:22:08.038 --> 04:22:11.499]  In financial news, dollar may get crushed as traders weigh up bailout.
[04:22:11.499 --> 04:22:12.539]  That's mainstream news.
[04:22:12.539 --> 04:22:13.379]  Bloomberg.
[04:22:13.379 --> 04:22:15.900]  Bloomberg also reports Bush now has dictatorial powers.
[04:22:15.900 --> 04:22:17.401]  That's a headline.
[04:22:17.401 --> 04:22:19.321]  Fairy godmother taxpayer face funding.
[04:22:19.321 --> 04:22:20.982]  200 billion pound.
[04:22:20.982 --> 04:22:22.502]  That's 400 billion British bailout.
[04:22:22.502 --> 04:22:25.703]  400 billion in US dollars.
[04:22:25.703 --> 04:22:26.944]  Bailout of greedy bankers.
[04:22:28.084 --> 04:22:29.305]  It goes on and on.
[04:22:29.305 --> 04:22:34.008]  Where is my story about the sun?
[04:22:34.008 --> 04:22:37.150]  Because now that I... and I forgot all the callers, too.
[04:22:37.150 --> 04:22:38.531]  I mean to take more calls on the show.
[04:22:38.531 --> 04:22:41.653]  I just get stuck in covering news.
[04:22:41.653 --> 04:22:46.756]  No, that's cell phones, giving kids five times the rate of brain tumors, hundreds of studies.
[04:22:46.756 --> 04:22:49.018]  No.
[04:22:49.018 --> 04:22:52.360]  That's forced drugging of children in schools to make them smarter.
[04:22:52.360 --> 04:22:55.702]  Can't make that up.
[04:22:55.702 --> 04:22:56.683]  Again, you just cannot...
[04:22:57.671 --> 04:22:59.392]  Make this stuff up.
[04:22:59.392 --> 04:23:01.333]  It's so crazy.
[04:23:01.333 --> 04:23:02.654]  NASA.
[04:23:02.654 --> 04:23:04.394]  This is from the NASA.
[04:23:04.394 --> 04:23:07.576]  NASA to hold press conference on the state of the sun.
[04:23:07.576 --> 04:23:15.000]  The sun in 300 years being measured has never been this cool or releasing this low level of heat.
[04:23:15.000 --> 04:23:20.082]  It's one of the most and most early studied things by scientists and they've had accurate readings for 300 years or more.
[04:23:22.426 --> 04:23:25.089]  NASA will hold a media conference Tuesday, September 23rd.
[04:23:25.089 --> 04:23:32.557]  It's tomorrow to discuss the data from the joint NASA-European Space Agency Ulysses missions reveal the solar wind, the 50-year low.
[04:23:32.557 --> 04:23:39.765]  Then it goes deeper into the article to say 300 years of measurements, but since they've been measuring solar winds, it's the 50-year low.
[04:23:39.765 --> 04:23:42.689]  The sun's current state could result in changing conditions in the solar system.
[04:23:43.203 --> 04:23:46.208]  Yeah, and it gets into all that, so I'll be covering that tomorrow.
[04:23:46.208 --> 04:23:49.413]  Retransmission starts now on the InfoWars.com streams.
[04:23:49.413 --> 04:23:51.997]  I want to thank everybody for spreading the word about the radio show.
[04:23:51.997 --> 04:23:55.543]  That's how we reach more people, and that's our goal, is to be able to warn them.
[04:23:55.543 --> 04:23:56.544]  God bless you all!
