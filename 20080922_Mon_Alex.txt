[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:40.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.960 --> 00:49.040]  well ladies and gentlemen gold is up at $900 an ounce right now as we speak on
[00:49.040 --> 00:55.480]  this 22nd day of September 2008 the stock market is down right now as they
[00:55.480 --> 00:59.880]  await the quote bailout and now the bailout is not the bailout it is the
[00:59.880 --> 01:06.160]  cancer in the heart of the country preparing to send out its spores
[01:06.160 --> 01:13.000]  metastasizing this is the metastasization of the new world order
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.920]  you're about to see the birth of the new world order out of chaos out of pain
[01:18.920 --> 01:26.200]  out of all of you in the western world having your entire future pledged as
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.440]  chattel property of the international crime syndicate that is the bottom line
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.400]  and even a lot of mainstream media sources are having to admit that this is
[01:36.400 --> 01:44.360]  a massive bank robbery this is not a bailout as the people have been told
[01:44.360 --> 01:48.760]  meanwhile we've got lots of propaganda out of Israel and the United States about
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.920]  Iran having nuclear weapons they're now back to their old tricks completely
[01:52.920 --> 01:59.240]  lying saying they've got to be struck and and don't think they won't hit Iran I
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.680]  mean I don't know if it's gonna happen but the point is these people fly planes
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.280]  in the buildings and blame it on imaginary enemies to take liberties and
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.840]  freedoms and launch wars and grab oil and no big weapons contracts they implode
[02:11.840 --> 02:17.360]  economies and suck pension funds dry in the government and private industry they
[02:17.360 --> 02:23.680]  are bold if the new world order is anything it is bold beyond imagination
[02:23.680 --> 02:32.080]  just hubris on top of hubris stacked on top of arrogant wicked desire to feed on
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.400]  populations you have some guests coming up later in the show I'll tell you about

[03:00.960 --> 03:06.040]  bankers everything and then they turn loose army brigades on us that that's
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.160]  how it works we bail them out when that I give them everything we've gotten
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.840]  become their chattel slaves on paper and and then they take our houses and then
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.840]  if you can't pay the taxes to them they take your houses and they send in army
[03:22.840 --> 03:28.600]  brigades to make sure you pay them and if you don't know what the brigades are
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.920]  that the federalized local police they are federal just as the Capitol building

[08:57.080 --> 09:01.960]  just leave it at that and tell that information when he joins us coming up
[09:01.960 --> 09:08.960]  later in the meantime let me give you a preview of some of the news we have in
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.320]  front of us today as the New World Order instigated global crises both the
[09:16.320 --> 09:23.080]  military economic and social as they turn the heat up to boil off what's left of
[09:23.080 --> 09:30.200]  freedom and to solidify the toxic brew known as the New World Order technological
[09:30.200 --> 09:36.520]  control grid enslavement system Pakistani troops fire on intruding US
[09:36.520 --> 09:41.160]  helicopters for the second time in several weeks this is out of Reuters
[09:41.160 --> 09:45.160]  Pakistan troops fired on two US helicopters intruding the Pakistani
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.400]  territory last night forcing them to turn back to Afghanistan a senior
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.600]  Pakistani security official set on Monday so that's a regular Pakistani
[09:55.600 --> 10:06.400]  troops that are in control of the US transfer nukes now England the United
[10:06.400 --> 10:12.200]  States and Israel in order of culpability according to James weapons
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.880]  quarterly and many others and what's admitted by our own media England the
[10:18.880 --> 10:24.480]  United States than Israel gave the nuclear weapons oh not just atomic
[10:24.480 --> 10:31.520]  hydrogen as well thermal nuclear to them and then they also helped them through
[10:31.520 --> 10:38.760]  the Chinese Clinton Laurel Hughes and others to the Chinese and then to the
[10:38.760 --> 10:44.680]  Pakistanis with the blessing of the United States continuing with George
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.760]  Bush in 2001 to give nuclear weapons and they reportedly have upwards of 20 of
[10:50.760 --> 10:58.560]  them warheads menacing India and surrounding neighbors and meanwhile
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.440]  their troops every time the US forces come into the country shoot at the
[11:04.440 --> 11:11.000]  helicopters and the United States has been launching rocket and bomb attacks
[11:11.000 --> 11:18.800]  into several different regions of Pakistan now that's going on you have
[11:18.800 --> 11:24.760]  the United States a month and a half ago through its proxy backed up by NATO
[11:24.760 --> 11:28.940]  and Israel 1000 Israeli troops according to the Jerusalem post and
[11:28.940 --> 11:35.600]  Harat's launching a sneak attack on the Russian held enclaves of South Ossetia
[11:35.600 --> 11:43.160]  and the Gorge leading into Abkhazia the average zombie yuppie stumbling around
[11:43.160 --> 11:47.000]  thinks that Russia launched a sneak attack and falls down before Sarah Palin
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.320]  when she talks about how war with Russia may be needed that is a quote by the
[11:53.320 --> 12:00.080]  beauty queen Barack Obama basically says the same thing God help us ladies and
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.680]  gentlemen we are going to hell in a handbasket is the only way to describe it
[12:05.680 --> 12:14.920]  Pakistani troops fire on intruding US helicopters so a country with nuclear
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.720]  weapons that finally threw out the US back dictator and God knows is running
[12:20.720 --> 12:25.920]  things over there I can't even nail that down right now US troops are basically
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.560]  in control the perimeter in a Mexican standoff at two different Pakistani
[12:30.560 --> 12:38.040]  bases where the nuclear missile silos are based and of course the jets that
[12:38.040 --> 12:44.760]  can carry the bombs upwards of 2000 miles Pakistani troops fired on two
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.040]  US helicopters that intruded into Pakistan territory on Sunday night
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.200]  forcing them to turn back in Afghanistan is here Pakistan's security official
[12:51.200 --> 12:58.080]  said on Monday the helicopters violated the border area of Loarda Monde 80
[12:58.080 --> 13:06.600]  kilometers west of Miran Ashar the main town in the North Tribal region around
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.400]  9 p.m. on Sunday the official said speaking on condition around remedy
[13:10.400 --> 13:15.800]  because of the severity sensitivity of the subject there was no official
[13:15.800 --> 13:18.920]  confirmation we don't have any information on border violation by
[13:18.920 --> 13:24.440]  American helicopters Major Murad Khan military spokesman said relations
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.680]  between the two allies became frayed earlier this month after US commandos
[13:28.680 --> 13:35.240]  raided a border village of South Waziristan and killed 20 people including
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.360]  women and children on September 3rd Pakistanis were outraged by the
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.080]  incursion and the six-month-old civilian government issued a diplomatic
[13:43.080 --> 13:48.360]  protest it was the first overt incursion by US ground troops Pakistan
[13:48.360 --> 13:51.440]  territory through the US military has conducted numerous missile strikes
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.880]  against al-Qaeda please ladies and gentlemen I mean against the Easter
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.280]  bunny and pop by the sailor man they launched numerous missile strikes
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.960]  against pop by the sailor man and Taliban targets in Pakistan tribal lands
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.120]  Pakistani troops fired on two US helicopters that crossed the border at
[14:11.120 --> 14:17.560]  the same village and Gore added a week ago again to forcing them to turn back
[14:17.560 --> 14:21.520]  according to residents and security officers through both Pakistan and US
[14:21.520 --> 14:27.600]  officials issue denials oh god they deny everything that's admitted in true and
[14:27.600 --> 14:33.000]  public and then the makeup stuff about pop by the al-Qaeda man Pakistani
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.840]  president Asif Ali Zadari is due to meet president George W. Bush on Tuesday in
[14:41.840 --> 14:51.800]  the United States haven't helped us now remember where the hijackers funding
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.600]  came from that they came out of Saudi Arabia who always matches money with
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.280]  backstanding in dozens ISI there's been MI6 for close to a century that's just
[15:01.280 --> 15:11.560]  a mainline history British intelligence fraud and then they wire $100,000 of
[15:11.560 --> 15:14.360]  Muhammad out in one payment alone you've got the head of Pakistani
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.000]  intelligence in the second trip of his tenure to the United States the week

[15:24.200 --> 15:32.720]  Graham in a high security area of the Capitol for a national security meeting

[15:39.160 --> 15:43.640]  got Mossad crawling all over it you got the hijackers or US government agents
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.560]  no doubt training US military bases with high security clearances that's all
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.160]  mainstream by the way don't roll your eyes out there police and others you know
[15:52.160 --> 15:57.960]  we told you Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would go under eight years ago and we
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.640]  break it all down here we're talking about reality Associated Press
[16:04.360 --> 16:13.480]  Pensacola News Journal MSNBC San Jose Mercury News Toronto Star BBC all
[16:13.480 --> 16:19.880]  admitting that the hijackers were US government agents I came on the first few
[16:19.880 --> 16:23.280]  weeks and those stories got shut down you understand laughing and giggling
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.680]  about this only means the tyranny is going to win and that hurts us all you
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.680]  can't live and denial anymore confusing television in your make-believe world of
[16:32.680 --> 16:38.360]  eight hours of TV watching a day with reality you can't choose what reality is
[16:38.360 --> 16:43.320]  that's delusional perception isn't reality as Madison Avenue says
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.200]  perception is reality for jackasses that don't count and don't matter and
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.640]  aren't history's actors and that's why the establishment laughs at you because
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.480]  you believe a false paradigm not just a tainted view of the world and a
[16:57.480 --> 17:03.040]  distorted view of the world all views are distorted limited perspectives but
[17:03.040 --> 17:08.280]  you are in a completely false paradigm and you enjoy going through life being
[17:08.280 --> 17:15.400]  being idiots being schmucks I mean is that fun I mean do you like being conned
[17:15.400 --> 17:19.840]  and being suckers is that is that funny and then giggling and laughing about

[17:30.080 --> 17:34.320]  they lie to themselves and they always have that self-assured giggling smirk
[17:34.320 --> 17:38.640]  on their faces hey wipe it off your face okay it's enough that we basically
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.120]  already have no economic future now it could be World War 3 and you laughing
[17:43.120 --> 17:49.000]  about it doesn't make it better it makes it worse and even though you're stupid
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.520]  and like to be a slave it doesn't mean I want you to be hurt because we're all
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.800]  in this together and if I'm gonna be free and have any liberty or any future
[17:56.800 --> 18:03.440]  you're gonna have to have it to jackass that's why I'm angry with you this isn't

[18:32.680 --> 18:36.240]  killers and control the western governments orchestrating World War 3
[18:36.240 --> 18:45.600]  how did it happen now sucking every financial system dry and we're signing
[18:45.600 --> 18:53.280]  the bill the point is Pakistan's brimming with nukes on the edge of civil war
[18:53.280 --> 18:58.120]  God knows what globalist intelligence operations are doing no doubt they're
[18:58.120 --> 19:03.560]  in control of the situation over there they're creating a crisis you've got
[19:03.560 --> 19:07.400]  them starting wars with the Russians kicking that off the economy is
[19:07.400 --> 19:13.960]  imploding the dollar is dying right now in front of us the Pakistani troops are
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.000]  shooting at US forces on every other day that we know of and then meanwhile this
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.080]  is what we get from the news you see you have to understand a wider reach of
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.520]  news and information have a background and research all these issues to then
[19:27.520 --> 19:35.440]  know when the AP reports a plane crashed and some rock band barely lived you
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.160]  know that really happened because there's witnesses there's TV cameras you
[19:38.160 --> 19:42.800]  can verify it from other local sources but then you know when the mainstream

[25:02.240 --> 25:05.240]  Come as a man of peace
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.240]  Now, first he's in the back
[25:08.240 --> 25:11.240]  Well, first he's in the background
[25:11.240 --> 25:14.240]  And then he's in the front
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.240]  Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt
[25:18.240 --> 25:21.240]  Nobody has seen through him
[25:21.240 --> 25:24.240]  Not even the chief of police
[25:24.240 --> 25:27.240]  Not even the chief of police
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.240]  Yeah, there's sometimes they come
[25:31.240 --> 25:52.240]  Come as a man of peace
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.240]  Look, my whole point is this
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.240]  You've got Pakistan completely corrupt
[26:23.240 --> 26:25.240]  Completely run by Western intelligence
[26:25.240 --> 26:27.240]  And what does Western intelligence do
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.240]  When they've got control of something
[26:29.240 --> 26:31.240]  What does England and Israel do
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.240]  When they've got control of a country
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.240]  What do they do?
[26:35.240 --> 26:37.240]  They just hand them nuclear weapons
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.240]  Put the most violent factions in control
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.240]  And then now there's some type of mafia war
[26:43.240 --> 26:46.240]  Going on between the US and Pakistan
[26:46.240 --> 26:49.240]  While the United States controls the airfields
[26:49.240 --> 26:52.240]  With the nukes, with the Pakistani troops
[26:52.240 --> 26:54.240]  Inside the airfields sitting on the nukes
[26:54.240 --> 26:58.240]  With special forces outside of them
[26:58.240 --> 27:00.240]  I mean, this isn't funny
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.240]  Okay, that's a real national security threat
[27:03.240 --> 27:05.240]  Which is exactly what the New World Order does
[27:05.240 --> 27:07.240]  They go around stirring up crises
[27:07.240 --> 27:09.240]  So they can scare the daylights out of everybody
[27:09.240 --> 27:11.240]  Oh, we've got a world financial crisis
[27:11.240 --> 27:13.240]  We need a world government
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.240]  And a new world order financial system
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.240]  We need the world financial banks to run things
[27:19.240 --> 27:21.240]  If they had total control, this wouldn't happen
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.240]  One of the ones that did it
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.240]  We need a world government to regulate
[27:25.240 --> 27:27.240]  Different bioweapon components
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.240]  Because they're spreading
[27:28.240 --> 27:29.240]  Meanwhile, who's spreading it?
[27:29.240 --> 27:31.240]  The elements of the global government
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.240]  We need to have a world government
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.240]  To stop nuclear weapons proliferation
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.240]  Who's proliferating the Anglo-American establishment
[27:38.240 --> 27:40.240]  The axis of evil
[27:40.240 --> 27:45.240]  It's just, I mean, who gave North Korea nukes
[27:45.240 --> 27:47.240]  When he was the chairman of the board of the Swiss company
[27:47.240 --> 27:51.240]  That was given authorization by the G7 at the time
[27:51.240 --> 27:54.240]  Now G8, and it was given authorization
[27:54.240 --> 27:57.240]  By the National Security Council
[27:57.240 --> 27:59.240]  With Bill Clinton
[27:59.240 --> 28:00.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:00.240 --> 28:01.240]  And I've said this
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.240]  It's like in an old 50s movie
[28:03.240 --> 28:06.240]  Where the devil appears out of a poof of smoke
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.240]  Anything earth-changing, anything very dangerous
[28:09.240 --> 28:10.240]  That threatens the whole planet
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.240]  You will always find Donald Rumsfeld
[28:13.240 --> 28:15.240]  In studies to get cell phones approved
[28:15.240 --> 28:16.240]  So he wouldn't give you cancer
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.240]  Rumsfeld
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.240]  Getting Aspartame approved
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.240]  That's killed tens of millions
[28:19.240 --> 28:21.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:21.240 --> 28:23.240]  Getting Prozac approved in 1982
[28:23.240 --> 28:24.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.240]  Handing out nukes to North Korea
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:29.240 --> 28:32.240]  Helping give nukes to Pakistan
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:33.240 --> 28:34.240]  Helping arm Saddam
[28:34.240 --> 28:36.240]  And setting him up to attack Iran
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.240]  In the early 80s
[28:37.240 --> 28:38.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:38.240 --> 28:39.240]  I mean Donald Rumsfeld
[28:39.240 --> 28:40.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:40.240 --> 28:41.240]  Getting the Terminator seeds approved
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.240]  Now spreading into the plant genomes
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.240]  Infecting all sorts of plants of the same species
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.240]  All sorts of environmental crises
[28:48.240 --> 28:49.240]  Donald Rumsfeld
[28:49.240 --> 28:52.240]  Donald Rumsfeld is a Sith Lord, ladies and gentlemen
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.240]  To use a popular pop culture metaphor
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.240]  Before the New York Times quotes me
[28:58.240 --> 28:59.240]  I mean that figuratively
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.240]  But I mean he might as well wear a black hood
[29:03.240 --> 29:06.240]  And look out from the darkness of it
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.240]  And say a new apprentice, young guy
[29:08.240 --> 29:10.240]  More powerful
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.240]  I mean this guy is pure evil
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.240]  I'm telling you
[29:15.240 --> 29:18.240]  He is directly plugged into the New World Order
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.240]  When that guy was 30-something years old he was
[29:21.240 --> 29:24.240]  It just never ends with this guy
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.240]  He is an imperial legged
[29:26.240 --> 29:29.240]  Once an imperial legged in the Roman system
[29:29.240 --> 29:31.240]  There were usually just a few people
[29:31.240 --> 29:33.240]  Trusted old wise men of the emperor
[29:33.240 --> 29:35.240]  Could sin to speak with the power of the emperor
[29:35.240 --> 29:37.240]  To far away lands
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.240]  Or to lead armies
[29:39.240 --> 29:41.240]  And Donald Rumsfeld
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.240]  Even more than Cheney
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.240]  Cheney's protege has been the president
[29:45.240 --> 29:47.240]  For the last seven and a half years

[34:24.240 --> 34:28.240]  And that's really what they are is another floating fortress
[34:28.240 --> 34:30.240]  Another tectonic fortress
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.240]  Another giant aircraft carrier like Israel for the Anglo-American establishment
[34:35.240 --> 34:39.240]  Israel with 400 plus nukes ready to nuke, ready to rock and roll
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.240]  Crazy members of the Knesset routinely talking about nuking Europe if they want to
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.240]  You've got Pakistan running around a floating fortress of the New World Order

[34:57.240 --> 34:59.240]  George won
[34:59.240 --> 35:02.240]  And I'm really getting tired of this
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.240]  Because I see this every few days an AP headline that's similar
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.240]  Iran may be hiding secret nukes
[35:09.240 --> 35:11.240]  Iran soon to have nukes
[35:11.240 --> 35:13.240]  Iran has nukes
[35:13.240 --> 35:17.240]  Iran may activate nukes
[35:17.240 --> 35:19.240]  Iran may use nukes
[35:19.240 --> 35:24.240]  I mean Google all these, you will see AP are the biggest liars
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.240]  When it comes to this specific news about Iran
[35:28.240 --> 35:30.240]  People say well you keep using AP
[35:30.240 --> 35:33.240]  You have to get a large breadth and width of knowledge
[35:33.240 --> 35:35.240]  And then double check it with local publications
[35:35.240 --> 35:37.240]  And then you can find out if a story is accurate
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.240]  Or you can read three or four stories to get a better picture
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.240]  That's analyzing things
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.240]  But when it comes to war news it's generally a ball-faced deception or lie
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.240]  Now this is a simple lie
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.240]  This is a simple semantical play on words
[35:57.240 --> 35:59.240]  You can catch them doing this
[35:59.240 --> 36:01.240]  Newspapers do this, the TV does this
[36:01.240 --> 36:03.240]  They're coming up and singing in the night
[36:03.240 --> 36:05.240]  Iran about to go nuclear
[36:05.240 --> 36:08.240]  Nuclear Iran tonight on Fox
[36:08.240 --> 36:10.240]  Chief Inspector
[36:10.240 --> 36:13.240]  Iran about to use their hiding nukes
[36:13.240 --> 36:16.240]  Iran about to activate secret nukes
[36:16.240 --> 36:18.240]  About to use their secret nukes
[36:18.240 --> 36:20.240]  And you hear about the user's secret nukes
[36:20.240 --> 36:22.240]  And then 30 minutes later at the Fox Newspiece they say
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.240]  About to activate their nuclear reactors
[36:27.240 --> 36:29.240]  Which by the way are peaceful
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.240]  But see for 30 minutes of the person cooking dinner or whatever
[36:33.240 --> 36:35.240]  Ended up not paying attention they say
[36:35.240 --> 36:36.240]  Iran nukes
[36:36.240 --> 36:40.240]  See it's all designed for people who are mesmerized by TV
[36:40.240 --> 36:42.240]  In a subconscious mindset
[36:42.240 --> 36:44.240]  Which you go into in just a few minutes of watching TV
[36:44.240 --> 36:46.240]  That's admitted you go into a dream state
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.240]  Or people who are passively watching
[36:48.240 --> 36:49.240]  Passively listening
[36:49.240 --> 36:50.240]  Or in a restaurant
[36:50.240 --> 36:52.240]  Seeing it on the ticker tape
[36:52.240 --> 36:55.240]  Or someone parrot said it worked
[36:55.240 --> 36:58.240]  Or you hear the earlier part of the newscast
[36:58.240 --> 37:00.240]  They announce five times
[37:00.240 --> 37:02.240]  Coming up at the end of the show
[37:02.240 --> 37:04.240]  Iran and its nukes
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.240]  Will they use them
[37:06.240 --> 37:08.240]  And then you read
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.240]  And it's peaceful
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.240]  But the headline sounds like
[37:13.240 --> 37:14.240]  I mean you read this headline
[37:14.240 --> 37:15.240]  Chief Inspector
[37:15.240 --> 37:16.240]  Oh that does it
[37:16.240 --> 37:17.240]  The Chief Inspector
[37:17.240 --> 37:20.240]  Says they've got them
[37:20.240 --> 37:22.240]  Iran maybe hiding secret nukes
[37:22.240 --> 37:23.240]  Oh that's it
[37:23.240 --> 37:24.240]  The secret nukes
[37:24.240 --> 37:27.240]  And then the secret nukes
[37:27.240 --> 37:29.240]  Aren't nukes
[37:29.240 --> 37:31.240]  The head of the international atomic energy agency
[37:31.240 --> 37:33.240]  Warned Monday that Iran may be hiding
[37:33.240 --> 37:35.240]  Secret nuclear activities
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.240]  See oh nuclear activities not nukes
[37:38.240 --> 37:41.240]  Comments that appear to reflect a high level
[37:41.240 --> 37:44.240]  Of frustration with stonewalling of its investigators
[37:44.240 --> 37:46.240]  Now see they know people forget
[37:46.240 --> 37:48.240]  What happened five years ago
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.240]  You can either take total UN domination
[37:51.240 --> 37:53.240]  Have them in your country controlling what you can
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.240]  And can't do
[37:54.240 --> 37:57.240]  Or you can be bombed into the stone age
[37:57.240 --> 37:59.240]  But the Russians the Chinese are in there
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.240]  It's peaceful systems unlike the US
[38:01.240 --> 38:04.240]  And others handing out real systems in North Korea
[38:04.240 --> 38:10.240]  And Pakistan and others
[38:10.240 --> 38:13.240]  These are type reactors that cannot be used
[38:13.240 --> 38:14.240]  In nuclear weapons production
[38:14.240 --> 38:17.240]  They don't get anywhere near the purification
[38:17.240 --> 38:19.240]  Of the isotopes they need
[38:19.240 --> 38:22.240]  And Iran has a fraction of the centrifuges they need
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.240]  I mean you don't just hide this stuff in a shed
[38:26.240 --> 38:29.240]  Like CNN said when they invented Iraq in 2003
[38:29.240 --> 38:32.240]  They said look in this shed was a secret
[38:32.240 --> 38:34.240]  Nuclear weapons program
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.240]  And then under this rose bush
[38:36.240 --> 38:39.240]  Was the piece of equipment that made the nuclear bomb
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.240]  And then more credible mainstream news
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.240]  Reported a week later actually
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.240]  Here's a photograph of a factory in Russia
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.240]  And a factory in the US that produces this part
[38:49.240 --> 38:51.240]  Of a nuclear weapon and it's the size of
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.240]  You know hundreds of football fields
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.240]  But again you have a public that doesn't know
[38:56.240 --> 38:58.240]  How all of this works or the scale of it
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.240]  So you can lie to them
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.240]  There's still a lot of people going around
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.240]  Saying Saddam had nukes
[39:05.240 --> 39:06.240]  They haven't gotten the new download
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.240]  Of corporate tyranny propaganda
[39:09.240 --> 39:11.240]  Brainwashing
[39:11.240 --> 39:14.240]  So see maybe hiding secret nuclear facilities
[39:14.240 --> 39:16.240]  Because Iran totally let them in
[39:16.240 --> 39:18.240]  Gave them more access than any country ever has
[39:18.240 --> 39:20.240]  To world government
[39:20.240 --> 39:23.240]  They had moderates in that were being pro-US
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.240]  And the United States said
[39:26.240 --> 39:28.240]  And the G8 said well we don't care
[39:28.240 --> 39:30.240]  If it's totally peaceful and the UN admits it is
[39:30.240 --> 39:32.240]  And Russia is selling you this
[39:32.240 --> 39:34.240]  You're now not allowed to have it
[39:34.240 --> 39:37.240]  And Iran said but we agreed and signed agreements
[39:37.240 --> 39:40.240]  With U11 inspectors in for the last decade
[39:40.240 --> 39:42.240]  We did this and you promised
[39:42.240 --> 39:44.240]  And then the people got real mad and Iran
[39:44.240 --> 39:46.240]  And swept in Ahmed Denizhan
[39:46.240 --> 39:49.240]  It was a lot more rabid and hardcore
[39:49.240 --> 39:51.240]  Because what do you expect?
[39:51.240 --> 39:52.240]  So they signed the agreements
[39:52.240 --> 39:54.240]  Did the deals, bought, spent millions of dollars
[39:54.240 --> 39:56.240]  Buying the peaceful systems and were told
[39:56.240 --> 39:58.240]  Okay now you can't have that
[39:58.240 --> 40:00.240]  And they said my god you're completely treacherous
[40:00.240 --> 40:02.240]  And they said that's right we are
[40:02.240 --> 40:04.240]  And so they said that's it
[40:04.240 --> 40:06.240]  Inspectors get out of here
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.240]  That's it
[40:08.240 --> 40:11.240]  And the inspectors have cameras in all their offices
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.240]  And we're going through all the presidential files
[40:13.240 --> 40:15.240]  And doing things our criminal government
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.240]  Or Israel would never allow
[40:17.240 --> 40:20.240]  Their nuclear program is completely sacred
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.240]  They don't have to be under any treaty
[40:24.240 --> 40:26.240]  A senior Iranian envoy accused the United States
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.240]  Of trying to use the IAEA as a tool
[40:29.240 --> 40:31.240]  In Washington's confrontation with Tehran
[40:31.240 --> 40:33.240]  Iran he said has demonstrated full cooperation
[40:33.240 --> 40:35.240]  With the agency
[40:35.240 --> 40:37.240]  Allegations of nuclear weapons work by Tehran
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.240]  Is based on forged documents
[40:39.240 --> 40:41.240]  And the issue is closed the envoy said
[40:41.240 --> 40:43.240]  Has admitted those were forged
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.240]  By the same folks that brought you forged uranium
[40:45.240 --> 40:47.240]  Documents and aluminum tubes
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.240]  Or they would take real
[40:51.240 --> 40:53.240]  U.S. moles deputy head of the army
[40:53.240 --> 40:55.240]  Was their mole going back to when they put him
[40:55.240 --> 40:57.240]  In the 80s was a U.S. operation
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.240]  So of course they had moles inside the Iraqi government
[41:00.240 --> 41:03.240]  And they just took his all of his reports
[41:03.240 --> 41:05.240]  When he defected saying no they have no nuclear programs
[41:05.240 --> 41:07.240]  Abandoned in 1991
[41:07.240 --> 41:10.240]  And then they just forged it with his signature
[41:10.240 --> 41:13.240]  At the bottom and had it say huge nuclear program
[41:13.240 --> 41:16.240]  Just added that and then brought it to Congress
[41:16.240 --> 41:18.240]  And then got caught
[41:18.240 --> 41:21.240]  I mean these people are incredible
[41:21.240 --> 41:23.240]  It doesn't matter if they get caught
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.240]  The public doesn't even know what getting caught is
[41:25.240 --> 41:27.240]  They don't even know what Iraq is
[41:27.240 --> 41:29.240]  They just know it's brown people
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.240]  And it feels tough to watch TV with them dying
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.240]  And dead kids with their arms and legs blown off
[41:33.240 --> 41:35.240]  It's fun
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.240]  I mean these guys are all over their websites
[41:37.240 --> 41:39.240]  And military websites bragging about dead kids
[41:39.240 --> 41:41.240]  Laughing
[41:41.240 --> 41:43.240]  I'm going to take down all the video of them killing kids
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.240]  Hey let us see what the good guys do
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.240]  No, I'm not the anti-American you bastards
[41:48.240 --> 41:51.240]  I'm the one that would never let anybody act like that
[41:51.240 --> 41:53.240]  Or do that to destroy our name
[41:53.240 --> 41:55.240]  And by the way
[41:55.240 --> 41:58.240]  Don't you get the trap you idiots in the military
[41:58.240 --> 41:59.240]  I don't mean the majority of them
[41:59.240 --> 42:00.240]  The majority of you are awake
[42:00.240 --> 42:02.240]  But those sickos that think it's cute and funny
[42:02.240 --> 42:03.240]  To kill little kids
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.240]  That was a New World Order trap
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.240]  That was a New World Order trap
[42:07.240 --> 42:10.240]  This was all meant for the world to see your crimes
[42:10.240 --> 42:11.240]  Idiots
[42:11.240 --> 42:13.240]  That's why the White House released the secret memos
[42:13.240 --> 42:15.240]  About torturing kids
[42:15.240 --> 42:18.240]  They want to bring the country down you see
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.240]  They're bringing the country down
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.240]  We the patriots are the ones trying to save it
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.240]  It's not macho to shoot families
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.240]  Driving along in their minivans
[42:29.240 --> 42:31.240]  To church
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.240]  To the mosque
[42:32.240 --> 42:34.240]  It's not funny to shoot little dogs
[42:34.240 --> 42:36.240]  And throw little dogs off cliffs
[42:36.240 --> 42:38.240]  You fools
[42:38.240 --> 42:42.240]  The CIA released the Abu Ghraib photos
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.240]  They let the army put out the report about the torture
[42:46.240 --> 42:49.240]  All part of a sick double game
[42:49.240 --> 42:51.240]  And only by admitting it
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.240]  And only by going deep into it
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.240]  And only by admitting the horror
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.240]  But then understanding that it has been done systematically
[42:58.240 --> 43:01.240]  If you understood the evil alchemy we're dealing with
[43:01.240 --> 43:04.240]  The complex psychological operations
[43:04.240 --> 43:06.240]  That are all interwoven
[43:06.240 --> 43:08.240]  It would stun you and then you would hit your knees
[43:08.240 --> 43:10.240]  And ask God for forgiveness
[43:10.240 --> 43:13.240]  But instead you just get more satanic tattoos
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.240]  And you just kneel down to darkness
[43:15.240 --> 43:16.240]  And you think it's tough
[43:16.240 --> 43:18.240]  Well you're going to find out
[43:18.240 --> 43:19.240]  When you're crying for mommy
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.240]  When that cancer they shot you up with
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.240]  When you hit 44, 45
[43:23.240 --> 43:25.240]  When that stuff's eating you alive
[43:25.240 --> 43:27.240]  You just remember tough guy
[43:28.240 --> 43:31.240]  I'm sure some of you out there may kill me
[43:31.240 --> 43:33.240]  Or kill other patriots some day or imprison us
[43:33.240 --> 43:36.240]  Don't worry your master's going to hurt you too
[43:38.240 --> 43:42.240]  Because the new world order hates your guts
[43:42.240 --> 43:44.240]  And they're going to bring you down
[43:44.240 --> 43:46.240]  So you just remember that
[43:49.240 --> 43:51.240]  You will not escape judgment
[43:51.240 --> 43:53.240]  And I don't mean in the afterlife
[43:53.240 --> 43:55.240]  You will not escape it in this life
[43:57.240 --> 43:59.240]  The only way you can escape judgment
[43:59.240 --> 44:01.240]  In this life
[44:01.240 --> 44:03.240]  And the life after that
[44:04.240 --> 44:06.240]  Is to repent of what you've done
[44:06.240 --> 44:08.240]  And then selflessly sacrifice yourself
[44:08.240 --> 44:10.240]  In the fight against the new world order
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.240]  That is the only way
[44:13.240 --> 44:15.240]  For you to turn it around
[44:15.240 --> 44:17.240]  If you've done these great acts of evil
[44:17.240 --> 44:19.240]  People can say well there's grace
[44:19.240 --> 44:20.240]  Well absolutely
[44:20.240 --> 44:21.240]  But if you have the grace
[44:21.240 --> 44:23.240]  You're going to fight the evil
[44:23.240 --> 44:24.240]  If you're not fighting evil
[44:24.240 --> 44:25.240]  If you're sucking your thumb
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.240]  In one of these 50 million dollar churches
[44:27.240 --> 44:28.240]  With helicopter pads
[44:28.240 --> 44:29.240]  And swimming pools
[44:29.240 --> 44:31.240]  And shopping malls and RFID
[44:31.240 --> 44:33.240]  Scanner chips to get in
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.240]  And your church isn't out there
[44:36.240 --> 44:37.240]  Feeding the homeless every weekend
[44:37.240 --> 44:38.240]  And if you're not out there
[44:38.240 --> 44:39.240]  Fighting corruption
[44:39.240 --> 44:40.240]  And if you're preacher
[44:40.240 --> 44:41.240]  And speaking out against the war
[44:41.240 --> 44:42.240]  And torture
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.240]  You are in the wrong place
[44:44.240 --> 44:46.240]  So don't sit there
[44:46.240 --> 44:48.240]  With your slack job
[44:48.240 --> 44:50.240]  Baloney about how you're a Christian
[44:54.240 --> 44:56.240]  The only way for you to reprieve yourselves
[44:56.240 --> 44:58.240]  For the crimes you've committed
[44:58.240 --> 44:59.240]  Is to start doing good
[44:59.240 --> 45:01.240]  And start doing it right now
[45:02.240 --> 45:03.240]  I'll tell you a little secret
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.240]  It'll feel so good
[45:05.240 --> 45:06.240]  When you actually start doing good
[45:06.240 --> 45:08.240]  I don't mean some evil
[45:08.240 --> 45:09.240]  That you've been told's good
[45:09.240 --> 45:10.240]  But things don't feel right
[45:10.240 --> 45:12.240]  When you're doing it do that
[45:12.240 --> 45:13.240]  There's a lot of good people
[45:13.240 --> 45:15.240]  Who are sucked into evil incrementally
[45:15.240 --> 45:17.240]  Who are seduced
[45:17.240 --> 45:18.240]  And then by the time
[45:18.240 --> 45:19.240]  They've turned over to the dark side
[45:19.240 --> 45:21.240]  It's too late
[45:22.240 --> 45:23.240]  But there's still time
[45:23.240 --> 45:24.240]  For a lot of you to turn back
[45:24.240 --> 45:26.240]  And that's what really matters here
[45:26.240 --> 45:28.240]  Flesh and bone will fall away
[45:28.240 --> 45:30.240]  Flesh and bone will not survive
[45:30.240 --> 45:32.240]  But the flesh you pass on
[45:32.240 --> 45:35.240]  Your progeny will go on forever
[45:37.240 --> 45:38.240]  Will go on forever
[45:38.240 --> 45:40.240]  It's a very old species
[45:40.240 --> 45:42.240]  And it's gonna go on, God willing
[45:42.240 --> 45:44.240]  And you live on through your progeny
[45:44.240 --> 45:47.240]  You, who are alive today
[45:48.240 --> 45:50.240]  You are your ancestors living on
[45:50.240 --> 45:53.240]  And that's something that even a secular humanist
[45:53.240 --> 45:55.240]  Someone who doesn't believe in creation
[45:55.240 --> 45:58.240]  Or God should be able to understand
[45:58.240 --> 46:00.240]  There are many lives
[46:00.240 --> 46:02.240]  But not in the reincarnation sense
[46:02.240 --> 46:05.240]  There are many lives through the human capacity
[46:05.240 --> 46:07.240]  And through the human mind
[46:07.240 --> 46:08.240]  And that's why the New World Order
[46:08.240 --> 46:09.240]  Seeks to destroy it
[46:09.240 --> 46:11.240]  Seeks to attack the genetic code
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.240]  Seeks to create abominations
[46:17.240 --> 46:19.240]  Because they hate what humanity is
[46:19.240 --> 46:22.240]  So you read this deceptive headline
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.240]  Chief Inspector, Iran may be hiding secret nukes
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.240]  The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency
[46:28.240 --> 46:30.240]  Warned Monday that Iran may be
[46:30.240 --> 46:33.240]  Hiding secret nuclear facilities
[46:33.240 --> 46:35.240]  Comments that appear to reflect a
[46:35.240 --> 46:37.240]  High level of frustration
[46:37.240 --> 46:40.240]  With stonewalling of his investigators
[46:42.240 --> 46:43.240]  The two men spoke at length
[46:43.240 --> 46:45.240]  About the 35 Nation Board of IEA
[46:45.240 --> 46:47.240]  Meaning, with time running out
[46:47.240 --> 46:49.240]  Before Tehran developed potential
[46:49.240 --> 46:51.240]  Nuclear weapons capability
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.240]  Somewhere that Israel or U.S.
[46:53.240 --> 46:54.240]  Might resort to military strikes
[46:54.240 --> 46:56.240]  They believe all diplomatic options
[46:56.240 --> 46:57.240]  Have been exhausted
[46:57.240 --> 46:59.240]  So later they admit they don't have
[46:59.240 --> 47:00.240]  Secret nukes
[47:00.240 --> 47:01.240]  They're not close to having nukes
[47:01.240 --> 47:02.240]  But if you read the headline
[47:02.240 --> 47:04.240]  You think they already have secret nukes
[47:04.240 --> 47:05.240]  Now here's the Jerusalem Post
[47:05.240 --> 47:07.240]  Being more accurate
[47:07.240 --> 47:09.240]  Military and intelligence
[47:09.240 --> 47:12.240]  Iran halfway to first nuclear bomb
[47:12.240 --> 47:14.240]  Yeah, it's taken them decades
[47:14.240 --> 47:15.240]  To get halfway there
[47:15.240 --> 47:17.240]  Now take them another eight years
[47:17.240 --> 47:19.240]  That meshes with the internal CIA reports
[47:19.240 --> 47:20.240]  To have one
[47:20.240 --> 47:22.240]  Iran is halfway the nuclear bomb
[47:25.240 --> 47:26.240]  And it goes on
[47:31.240 --> 47:32.240]  Oh, my goodness
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.240]  You know, I want to cover some cell phone news
[47:35.240 --> 47:37.240]  And then I'll get into financial news
[47:37.240 --> 47:39.240]  After that, and we'll start taking your phone calls
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.240]  At 1-800-259-9231
[47:43.240 --> 47:45.240]  First-time callers
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.240]  First-time callers
[47:46.240 --> 47:47.240]  And that's all
[47:47.240 --> 47:48.240]  First-time callers
[47:48.240 --> 47:50.240]  I want new callers to have a chance to get in
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.240]  1-800-259-9231
[47:57.240 --> 47:59.240]  About the, not even hypocrisy
[47:59.240 --> 48:03.240]  But the, what do you think of Pakistan
[48:03.240 --> 48:04.240]  Shooting at the U.S.
[48:04.240 --> 48:05.240]  The U.S. bombing them
[48:05.240 --> 48:08.240]  And again, it's even wrong to use the term U.S.
[48:10.240 --> 48:12.240]  Globalist forces
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.240]  Using American, basically mercenaries
[48:15.240 --> 48:17.240]  That's what the all-volunteer military is
[48:17.240 --> 48:19.240]  They're just now fully converting it over to Merck Force
[48:19.240 --> 48:22.240]  So it can now be blackwater worldwide
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.240]  And Titan worldwide
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  You know, they all go offshore now
[48:27.240 --> 48:28.240]  Because they're done
[48:28.240 --> 48:30.240]  The Ponzi scheme's coming to the end
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.240]  They've fattened up the USA hog
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.240]  And now it's time to butcher
[48:38.240 --> 48:39.240]  It's all about being hard and tough
[48:39.240 --> 48:40.240]  And not caring
[48:40.240 --> 48:42.240]  And that's just the way things are
[48:44.240 --> 48:45.240]  All the dumb sheep
[48:45.240 --> 48:46.240]  Are getting what they deserve
[48:46.240 --> 48:47.240]  Is the attitude
[48:47.240 --> 48:49.240]  Look at them believing all this bull
[48:49.240 --> 48:51.240]  That the president actually runs something
[48:52.240 --> 48:53.240]  That's the attitude of people
[48:53.240 --> 48:54.240]  That work for the system
[48:54.240 --> 48:55.240]  Yeah, it's all a scam
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.240]  So what?
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.240]  I'm taking care of myself
[48:57.240 --> 48:58.240]  You know what?
[48:58.240 --> 49:00.240]  You're not going to change nothing
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.240]  Oh yeah, when everybody has that attitude
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.240]  Society just completely breaks down
[49:04.240 --> 49:05.240]  Like Mexico
[49:05.240 --> 49:07.240]  With over a thousand murders a month now
[49:07.240 --> 49:09.240]  2,000 murders the last time
[49:09.240 --> 49:10.240]  3,000 murders the last nine months
[49:10.240 --> 49:12.240]  Just on the Texas border
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.240]  Rocket attacks
[49:14.240 --> 49:15.240]  Hangar net attacks
[49:15.240 --> 49:16.240]  Car bombs going off
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.240]  You've got to dig for it in local newspapers
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.240]  I mean, it's war on the streets
[49:20.240 --> 49:21.240]  Millions protesting
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.240]  A total breakdown of society
[49:23.240 --> 49:25.240]  Paramilitary forces everywhere
[49:25.240 --> 49:27.240]  That's how America's going to be
[49:28.240 --> 49:29.240]  That's how these criminals operate
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.240]  First they create a black market
[49:31.240 --> 49:33.240]  They control it's how they brought China down
[49:33.240 --> 49:35.240]  Look at how the west set up
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.240]  And brought China down
[49:36.240 --> 49:39.240]  They introduced heroin
[49:39.240 --> 49:41.240]  First opium then heroin
[49:41.240 --> 49:43.240]  To get control of the criminal gangs
[49:43.240 --> 49:44.240]  The Asian gangs
[49:45.240 --> 49:47.240]  Then they corrupted local police
[49:47.240 --> 49:48.240]  And local instabularies
[49:48.240 --> 49:50.240]  Then they brought the country down
[49:50.240 --> 49:51.240]  Using rival drug gangs
[49:51.240 --> 49:52.240]  Giving them different sectors
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.240]  Divide and conquer
[49:55.240 --> 49:57.240]  That's why they made drugs illegal here
[49:57.240 --> 49:58.240]  That was their cover to militarize
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.240]  The police and federalize them
[50:01.240 --> 50:03.240]  Then it energizes the drug gangs
[50:03.240 --> 50:05.240]  Which are controlled by the intelligence agencies
[50:05.240 --> 50:06.240]  It corrupts the police
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.240]  With the asset for which it sees your money
[50:08.240 --> 50:09.240]  On the surface
[50:09.240 --> 50:10.240]  Then there's all the drug dealing
[50:10.240 --> 50:11.240]  About police below that
[50:12.240 --> 50:13.240]  It scares the public
[50:13.240 --> 50:15.240]  Into accepting paramilitary police
[50:15.240 --> 50:17.240]  Then the next phase is staged terror
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.240]  To get the public to accept open intelligence
[50:20.240 --> 50:21.240]  Gathering secret police
[50:21.240 --> 50:24.240]  Spying on the public that's non drug related
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.240]  That's a way to an excuse for them
[50:26.240 --> 50:27.240]  To get involved in your life
[50:27.240 --> 50:28.240]  A cover
[50:29.240 --> 50:30.240]  Special forces
[50:31.240 --> 50:33.240]  CIA pay off local governments
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.240]  Set up command centers
[50:36.240 --> 50:37.240]  Start running open operations
[50:37.240 --> 50:39.240]  Like we were a third world country
[50:39.240 --> 50:41.240]  Next phase, economic collapse
[50:41.240 --> 50:43.240]  And the paramilitary police are there
[50:43.240 --> 50:44.240]  Again, to block the public
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.240]  From ever seizing control of their government again
[50:46.240 --> 50:48.240]  So the criminals are safe
[50:48.240 --> 50:50.240]  To extract all the wealth
[50:50.240 --> 50:52.240]  And then just take the cream off the top
[50:52.240 --> 50:55.240]  Of a peon slave neosurf system
[50:56.240 --> 50:58.240]  Come back into cell phone radiation
[50:58.240 --> 50:59.240]  Frying your children's brains
[50:59.240 --> 51:01.240]  I know you don't care, you're gonna keep doing it
[51:01.240 --> 51:02.240]  You invest, you buy insurance
[51:02.240 --> 51:03.240]  You wear your seatbelt
[51:03.240 --> 51:06.240]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection
[51:06.240 --> 51:07.240]  But why?
[51:07.240 --> 51:08.240]  Just in case?

[52:01.240 --> 52:04.240]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[52:04.240 --> 52:07.240]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.240]  The enemies struck America on September 11th
[52:10.240 --> 52:12.240]  But who is the enemy?
[52:12.240 --> 52:13.240]  Bin Laden
[52:13.240 --> 52:14.240]  This is his MO
[52:14.240 --> 52:15.240]  We have to look to the Middle East
[52:15.240 --> 52:17.240]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[52:17.240 --> 52:19.240]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film

[52:21.240 --> 52:24.240]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[52:24.240 --> 52:27.240]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[52:27.240 --> 52:31.240]  Very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[52:31.240 --> 52:35.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[52:35.240 --> 52:37.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[52:37.240 --> 52:39.240]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[52:39.240 --> 52:40.240]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[52:40.240 --> 52:42.240]  The Israeli intelligence network
[52:42.240 --> 52:43.240]  Warnings and war games
[52:43.240 --> 52:44.240]  The shadow government
[52:44.240 --> 52:45.240]  And much, much more

[53:05.240 --> 53:07.240]  I can't find my wallet
[53:07.240 --> 53:08.240]  Sound familiar?

[53:24.240 --> 53:26.240]  Your keys to find the remote control
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.240]  Or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone
[53:29.240 --> 53:30.240]  The possibilities are endless
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.240]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets
[53:33.240 --> 53:34.240]  Up to 30 feet
[53:34.240 --> 53:36.240]  And projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep
[53:36.240 --> 53:38.240]  Got the remote!
[53:38.240 --> 53:40.240]  Oh, my keys

[54:10.240 --> 54:13.240]  Yeah, the song says it all
[54:13.240 --> 54:16.240]  There must be some kind of way out of here
[54:16.240 --> 54:19.240]  Only death
[54:19.240 --> 54:23.240]  There must be some kind of way out of here
[54:23.240 --> 54:27.240]  Said I'd jump up to the beat
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.240]  There's too much confusion
[54:32.240 --> 54:37.240]  I can't get no relief
[54:37.240 --> 54:40.240]  That's really 101 in high level intelligence operations
[54:40.240 --> 54:43.240]  To create that artificial communication
[54:46.240 --> 54:48.240]  In fact British intelligence had a line
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.240]  Going back over 20 years ago about may our enemies be
[54:52.240 --> 54:56.240]  Confounded, confused
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.240]  But if you study them
[54:58.240 --> 55:01.240]  When you look at them long term
[55:01.240 --> 55:04.240]  It's crystal clear you can see all of it
[55:04.240 --> 55:06.240]  And understand it all
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.240]  Really quite simple
[55:08.240 --> 55:09.240]  History
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.240]  No reason to get excited
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.240]  Use the gauge, use the lens
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.240]  Through which it becomes
[55:17.240 --> 55:21.240]  It's clear
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.240]  There's a mountain sky
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.240]  And oh, you are some wicked bastards
[55:29.240 --> 55:33.240]  I see you
[55:33.240 --> 55:38.240]  More and more people see you
[55:38.240 --> 55:41.240]  My God, you've committed crime
[55:41.240 --> 55:44.240]  Against humanity
[55:44.240 --> 55:46.240]  Against the soul
[55:46.240 --> 55:48.240]  Against the meek
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.240]  The innocent
[55:49.240 --> 55:52.240]  The good
[55:52.240 --> 55:54.240]  The decent
[55:54.240 --> 55:56.240]  The upright
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.240]  You have waged war against all that is good
[56:01.240 --> 56:03.240]  You have committed crimes
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.240]  Against God's creation
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.240]  You are deformed in spirit
[56:11.240 --> 56:13.240]  And you have already fallen
[56:13.240 --> 56:16.240]  But you will fall further
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.240]  You were born to lose
[56:37.240 --> 56:40.240]  You're avarice, you're grasping
[56:40.240 --> 56:44.240]  Desire to pull down those better than you
[56:44.240 --> 56:49.240]  We'll consume you
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.240]  Oh, oh, oh, the white power
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.240]  Braces kept the view
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.240]  While all the women came and went
[57:01.240 --> 57:03.240]  They're foot servants
[57:03.240 --> 57:06.240]  They're foot servants too
[57:06.240 --> 57:11.240]  Well, I'm not in the wrong distance
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.240]  I walk past this world
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.240]  To ride in one emotion
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.240]  And the wind begins to howl
[57:22.240 --> 57:24.240]  All of you that think evil is beautiful
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.240]  That love the black sunshine
[57:28.240 --> 57:30.240]  We've looked at the surface of the water
[57:30.240 --> 57:33.240]  And wanted to swim in its depths
[57:33.240 --> 57:35.240]  We will now be bound in chain
[57:35.240 --> 57:37.240]  And propped into its depths
[57:37.240 --> 57:40.240]  We will cry out forever
[57:40.240 --> 57:45.240]  Wishing that you would have gone the other way
[57:48.240 --> 57:50.240]  Wishing that you would have done something
[57:50.240 --> 57:52.240]  While you're still at time
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.240]  Now, there are things we can do
[58:00.240 --> 58:03.240]  I've got an expert coming on about sodium fluoride
[58:03.240 --> 58:06.240]  Not just the fluoride, but the lead mercury arsenic
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.240]  They put in the water
[58:07.240 --> 58:10.240]  That's official, hidden in plain view
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.240]  So huge, people can't deal with it
[58:12.240 --> 58:15.240]  That's coming up after some calls and economic news
[58:15.240 --> 58:18.240]  But to first, mobile phones use raises
[58:18.240 --> 58:21.240]  Children's risk of brain cancer five-fold
[58:21.240 --> 58:24.240]  That's why I see six, seven, eight-year-olds
[58:24.240 --> 58:25.240]  Everywhere with cell phones
[58:25.240 --> 58:28.240]  And don't dare tell their parents
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.240]  Last night, I mentioned a lady
[58:30.240 --> 58:33.240]  Now I'm trying to rest her on, I said, you know, cell phones aren't good for children
[58:33.240 --> 58:35.240]  She just laughed at me
[58:36.240 --> 58:38.240]  That's fine, be an arrogant bitch
[58:42.240 --> 58:45.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[58:45.240 --> 58:48.240]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today
[58:51.240 --> 58:54.240]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[58:54.240 --> 58:57.240]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[58:57.240 --> 58:59.240]  And we knew what to do
[58:59.240 --> 59:00.240]  At least we thought we did
[59:00.240 --> 59:03.240]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[59:03.240 --> 59:05.240]  That finally gives first responders a platform
[59:05.240 --> 59:07.240]  To tell their story
[59:07.240 --> 59:11.240]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT
[59:11.240 --> 59:16.240]  Made a statement that the air was safe to breathe
[59:16.240 --> 59:19.240]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[59:19.240 --> 59:21.240]  As brave souls throughout the world
[59:21.240 --> 59:23.240]  Take action against their global masters
[59:23.240 --> 59:25.240]  He had his hand over the radio
[59:25.240 --> 59:26.240]  While he was getting a countdown
[59:26.240 --> 59:29.240]  He takes his hand off and you hear it, 3, 2, 1
[59:29.240 --> 59:32.240]  And it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[59:32.240 --> 59:35.240]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide
[59:35.240 --> 59:39.240]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[59:39.240 --> 59:41.240]  And aggressively spread it worldwide
[59:41.240 --> 59:44.240]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com
[59:44.240 --> 59:46.240]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror
[59:46.240 --> 59:56.240]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:31.240]  We are now into hour number two of transmission
[1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:37.240]  I apologize for calling that lady a mild name
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:39.240]  That was another lady I was driving home last night
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:41.240]  Getting gas and she was freaking out
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.240]  Up here from Milano trying to get her baby
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.240]  I think she said like a six-month-old baby to the doctor
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:51.240]  And she was asking where the hospital was
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:57.240]  And I was drawing a map for her in there in the gas station
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:00.240]  Because the guy behind the counter couldn't speak English
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:04.240]  And I said, you didn't just vaccinate the baby
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:07.240]  Out in Milano in the last week, did you?
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.240]  And she just looked at me and her eyes got real big
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:16.240]  How do you know that?
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:21.240]  Because I know, lady, that's why
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:27.240]  Your child's reacting badly to its chemical lobotomy
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:33.240]  So your child can join the ranks of the zombie force
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:35.240]  Oh, God help us
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:37.240]  I don't even know why I have to even do a radio show
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:42.240]  And every instinct I've got is to haul butt
[1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:44.240]  I mean, every instinct I've got
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:46.240]  And every day I look at my children
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:49.240]  And I just want to get them out of this country
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:51.240]  But then I know there's nowhere to run
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:55.240]  And my destiny is to stand and fight and do whatever I can
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:02:03.240]  I just can't believe we have to even explain any of this to people
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:11.240]  God help us
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:12.240]  God help us
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.240]  God help all the evil people that serve the system
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:18.240]  The drug dealing CIA and sheep dip, special forces
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:20.240]  And all the corrupt mafia
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:21.240]  It just, it's all
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:23.240]  I mean, look what you've done
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.240]  And that's really the key
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.240]  The point I never make is that
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:30.240]  I need to make more often
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:34.240]  The reason corruption always accelerates and expands and grows
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.240]  Even if the elite is trying to contain low-level corruption
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:41.240]  Is that when higher-ups engage in corruption
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:43.240]  Whether it's in a local police force
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:44.240]  Or a state legislature
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:45.240]  Or the Congress
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:47.240]  Or international bodies
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:50.240]  Is that everybody's basically corrupt
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:52.240]  Because the system itself is corrupt
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:55.240]  And so even if you're only into a low-level corruption
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:59.240]  You don't ever want to blow the whistle on somebody else's big-time corruption
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:02.240]  Because they may come back and burn you
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:07.240]  And then there becomes kind of a false instinct to never stand up to evil
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.240]  That's how corruption works
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  It starts with one little thing
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.240]  And next thing you know, you're as bad as it gets
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:17.240]  And we all have those decisions daily in our own lives
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:18.240]  Corruption is growing everywhere
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.240]  And private business and life everywhere
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:23.240]  I mean, we're becoming an evil culture
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.240]  That's why Mexico's broke back
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:28.240]  I mean, Mexico's got triple the resources we've got
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:32.240]  Both mineral
[1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:36.240]  And then there are the soils, the volcanic soils
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:37.240]  The climate
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:40.240]  They've got three growing seasons a year in Mexico
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.240]  We've only got one and a half here
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.240]  North America, on average
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.240]  But they can't get anything done
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:51.240]  Because they've got a corrupt elite that keeps their people down
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:52.240]  And their people have given into corruption
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:54.240]  And think it's funny and cute
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:57.240]  No, it's not funny and cute
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:03:59.240]  And it turns into caveman land
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:04.240]  It turns into complete breakdown of society
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  And that's going to happen here
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:07.240]  And let me tell you, the yuppies and people
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:09.240]  When they have all their pension funds and bank accounts taken
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:11.240]  They are going to be monsters
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.240]  I'm not worried about the inner city people
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:14.240]  And the illegal aliens
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.240]  As much as I'm worried about mainline middle class people
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:18.240]  And working class people
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.240]  They are going to turn into, especially the yuppies
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.240]  They're going to be demons
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:24.240]  And Homeland Security is going to say
[1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:27.240]  We've got jobs for you running FEMA camps
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:28.240]  Tatling on neighbors
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.240]  Running your neighborhood
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:32.240]  And they're shutting it all up for them
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:35.240]  And now that slack-jawed know-it-all piece of garbage
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  That you know at work
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.240]  That's going to be your commasar
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:43.240]  Well, they send any neighbors to FEMA camps
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:46.240]  They need to have a little something
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:49.240]  This all goes into the dark zone
[1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:52.240]  Something might happen to those people
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:53.240]  And that will teach them
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:55.240]  If not, they're going to win completely
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:56.240]  And God help us
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:58.240]  We'll be right back, stay with me
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:02.240]  Today, unlike any other
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.240]  In the long course of American history
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:07.240]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:10.240]  The enemies struck America on September 11th
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:12.240]  But who is the enemy?
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.240]  Bin Laden
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.240]  This is his MO
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:15.240]  We have to look to the Middle East
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.240]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:19.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:21.240]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:24.240]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:26.240]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  Again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:34.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:36.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA

[1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:05.240]  When it comes to this economy
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:07.240]  The banks are crashing
[1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:08.240]  The stock market's a mess
[1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:10.240]  There's the mortgage crisis
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:12.240]  There's the lending crisis

[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:18.240]  And we are paralyzed a little bit
[1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:20.240]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it
[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:21.240]  I don't know what to say
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:22.240]  What can you do?
[1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:23.240]  Do what you can do

[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  What I can do is I can put some food away
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:28.240]  I know there's a global food shortage

[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:12.240]  Okay, I'm watching all the big economic developments
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:14.240]  Stock market going way down
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:15.240]  Gold exploding
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:16.240]  Other commodities going up in price
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:17.240]  We're gonna cover it all up
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:21.240]  We're gonna take some calls from John, David, Jim, Jeff, Matthew and others
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  Here's an example of cell phones
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:26.240]  Something we've habitualized
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:28.240]  That is, you've got a habit
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:30.240]  You're trained to use the cell phone
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  It's your little friend
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:34.240]  It takes photos, it records things
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:36.240]  It's got video games on it
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.240]  Photos, movies you watch
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.240]  The center of your life is a little portable computer
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  That also is a high-powered microwave transmitter
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.240]  That around computers and wiring
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  You never notice it makes other electronics make noise, speaker systems, buzz
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:54.240]  You hear it, you know, every minute or so
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:56.240]  That's it, logging back in with a cell tower
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.240]  Telling the NSA where you are under federal law
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  Oh yeah, a total grid
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:04.240]  They knew when they got it approved back in the 80s
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:08.240]  That it gave laboratory rats, brain tumors and other tumors
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:11.240]  They would just keep cell phones on a few hours a day
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:15.240]  Back then the battery pack, you know, transmitter units
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.240]  On a few hours a day near the rats
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.240]  And then they would test it with rats
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.240]  At the same typing for the same thing
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  And the same lighting and the same food
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  And the same vitamins in another facility next door
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  And they would find that, depending on the study
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:35.240]  The power of the cell phone, I mean, these rats were completely fried
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:37.240]  And they found it heated up their brains
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.240]  They found it, it gave them brain tumors
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:42.240]  They found it gave them all different forms of blood diseases
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  Different, you know, types of blood cancers
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:51.240]  On and on and on
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  Thousands of studies, I mean, this was heavily studied
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:58.240]  By the British and Dutch and Swedish and US government
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:00.240]  Canadian government, before they allowed it
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.240]  Because they knew about people at radar installations
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:05.240]  And microwave installations, the old things in, you know, Korean war
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  People cooking their food on top of them
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  You know, just the radio waves cooking food
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:12.240]  And, you know, how the guys would all go home two years later
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  And die of cancer and they taught them, hey, you got to stay away from this
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:20.240]  But knowing all this, what'd they do?
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:23.240]  They stuck cell towers on almost every major private school
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:26.240]  And public school in the country to, quote, get some money
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:31.240]  And now they give the children, as young as three, four years old
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  Their own cell phones for their safety
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:36.240]  It's advertised, you know, get a family plan
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  Give your children cell phones
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:40.240]  I mean, look, if you're in the habit of using a cell phone
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:43.240]  And you want to die of a brain tumor, an excruciating, horrible death
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.240]  That's your business
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  You know, I've got a cell phone
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:50.240]  But because I've read all the studies about it frying your testicles
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  It is in another room, sitting on a table, charged, off
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:58.240]  And I will check messages on it once today
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:01.240]  The problem is I've gotten habitualized to not using it now
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:03.240]  Instead of the way I was before
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:07.240]  And so I might use it two or three times a week and I forget to get the messages off of it now
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  So that's a problem
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  I've missed a couple of coast-to-coast AM interviews
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:13.240]  Because, by the way, I'm on Three Hours Wednesday
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:16.240]  Because they'll call up as part of the moment and I'm going to answer my cell phone
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:19.240]  My wife's not listening to the phone at home and I missed the interview
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:23.240]  But hey, familiarity breeds contempt, so whatever
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  The point is that I have gotten away from using
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:33.240]  Because I made a commitment about a year and a half ago to really cut back
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  And so it's a convenience, it's good for emergencies
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.240]  Sometimes I use it
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.240]  When I have to, I was late to pick up Jim Mars yesterday, like five minutes late
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  And so I called him at the hotel he was at and said, I'll be about five minutes late
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:50.240]  Walk out at 105 instead of one and he came walking out right as I pulled up
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.240]  So I did use a cell phone and then I was going to be home late
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  Because I've been doing late interviews with him after the radio show
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:02.240]  And I was going to take him to eat before he left back to Fort Worth
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.240]  Or where he lives outside Fort Worth
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.240]  So I did call my wife, 60-second call, hey, I'll be home about nine or ten
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:14.240]  So that's too much though because I've noticed my children see me using it
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  So they're going to habitualize thinking it's okay to use it
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:26.240]  Here's an example, Rob Jacobson right outside the studio has a Edit Bay cubicle
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:32.240]  And he has a nice phone, long distance, international calling, everything on it
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.240]  He will not use it
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  Now before he had Bias Cubicle, another cubicle that was kind of shared in this area of the office
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  That has a phone and he wouldn't use that
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:46.240]  So I got him his own phone right there at his desk and he never uses it
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.240]  It's got dust on it, he's out there right now using it
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  Because he's in a habit
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  They'll tell you half a cigarette addiction isn't even nicotine
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  It's the breathing in
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  It's the putting something in your mouth, they'll tell you chew gum, use a toothpick
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:06.240]  I've quit smoking many times and gone back many times
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  The point is I always just quit with gum or the patches, I quit with a toothpick
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:12.240]  Chewing on it
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  Or pretending I'm smoking and then it's easy
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  Until I just am out late night working and go, okay, give me a cigarette and then it's over
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:25.240]  And yeah, I'll just drink one beer, those ice cold beers look good
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  Friends will talk me into going to see a fight or something at a restaurant bar
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  Everybody's drinking big tall frosty beer and I'll drink one and then three days later I'm drinking Jack Daniels
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:42.240]  But anyways, that's how habits work, you've got to stay away from the cell phones
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:45.240]  But hey, if you're going to use cell phones and use them all day long
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:49.240]  You might as well just start smoking cigarettes, drinking whiskey and I'm joking
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:53.240]  The point is they're worse for you than that and there's been studies on that
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:57.240]  I mean it's far worse
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  But you know cell phones are bad for you
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  I mean cops know radar guns are frying their testicles, they don't care, they keep using them
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.240]  They're in the habit of doing it, they're like, I'll just be macho, it's fine
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:13.240]  No, it's time to say no to all this, it's time, these radiation devices, that's what they do
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.240]  They emit waves, high powered waves
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  You need to just be aware of it
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  And you need to know that even if you've got hands free and the cell phones like two, three feet away from you
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:26.240]  It's emitting
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  So they don't charge you for those minutes but it's always transmitting back home
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  Intermittently, every minute
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  So I keep the cell phone off, that's when it's not transmitting
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:40.240]  And I only use it when I need to and that's bad enough
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.240]  Because now there's all the other frequency pollution going on
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:47.240]  You're not going to have big giant wireless units in my new office and save money
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  I'm not, we're wiring the whole thing
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.240]  Because those wireless systems are bad for you as well
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  Nothing like a cell phone but it's still bad
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  So children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop brain tumors
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:04.240]  This is why I wish I was on 500 radio stations
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:08.240]  This is why 60 something men enough
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  This is, I mean I want to warn people
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:13.240]  I want to warn them
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:17.240]  Children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop brain tumors
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:22.240]  A study suggests that children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop a type of brain tumor
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:26.240]  Children who use mobile phones are five times more likely to develop a type of brain tumor research
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  As shown, the Swedish study indicates that under 16s are at risk for radiation from mobile phones
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:36.240]  Because their brains or nervous systems are still developing
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  Because their heads are smaller and their skulls are thinner
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:41.240]  The radiation penetrates deeper into their brains
[1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:46.240]  It goes on after presenting their findings
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:50.240]  The scientists said that children who are 12 should only use mobile phones for emergencies
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:55.240]  They added that teenagers should use hands-free devices and try to restrict themselves to texting
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:59.240]  But other researchers goes on to say cast doubts on their findings
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:05.240]  Saying that mobile devices have not been on the market long enough to test accurately the risk associated with them
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:11.240]  About 90% of the under 16s in Britain have a mobile phone
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:14.240]  As do 40% of the primary school children, good god
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:20.240]  And man, they'll all basically get brain tumors and they'll blame it on the parents or something
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:23.240]  Say they shuck them and arrest them, that's what they do
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:26.240]  It just goes on and on
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:31.240]  It was held at the London's Royal Society by the Radiation Research Trust Independent Organization
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:36.240]  It goes on, researching electromagnetic radiation effects
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:41.240]  Here's another one, this cites a whole bunch of big studies
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:48.240]  Daily tech, new studies show cell phones are no friends to your testicles
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:51.240]  They use the scientific name of gonads
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:58.240]  There's been plenty of hearty debate between cell phone proponents and critics about potential cancer risk
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.240]  After one study claims cell phones had more detrimental health effects than smoking
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:04.240]  There you go, what I mentioned earlier
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  A major cancer doctor came forward stating that there was strong upcoming evidence of cell phone cancer link
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:13.240]  And it goes on
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:19.240]  Now another new study has been released citing a direct, decidedly different hazard of cell phone use
[1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:21.240]  Well, there's a whole bunch of these
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:25.240]  The new study shows that cell phones are no friends to the testicles
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  And it goes on about how it literally fries them
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  Listen, anything with radiation, any of the fields of radiation, the whole spectrum
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:39.240]  Fast growing cells, that's why, you know, if you're in the fallout of a nuke, your teeth fall out
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:43.240]  Your intestines start bleeding, they've got fast growing cells
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:46.240]  Finger nails fall out
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:51.240]  Fast growing cells, well the testicles are producing sperm
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:53.240]  Millions of them every week
[1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:59.240]  And so, they're even outside the body, so they can have a cooler temperature to operate in
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:05.240]  Okay, it's basically ovaries on the outside, but a woman's born with all of her eggs intact
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:07.240]  Which is an age factor
[1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:13.240]  Not a lot of age factor in men's sperm is a big age factor in women's eggs
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:16.240]  Mainly space radiation, X-raying you naturally
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:18.240]  So we're designed to handle some of this
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:22.240]  But you add a whole bunch more into it, you've got a major problem
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.240]  And it just goes into it
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:29.240]  Folks, testicular cancer is no joke, and so you just need to be made aware of that
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.240]  Okay
[1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:37.240]  Alright, I'm going to come back and go to John, David, Jeff, Gina, Matthew, I promise on the other side
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:42.240]  Here's another one, school children should be given smart drugs and a bid to boost brain power
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:48.240]  I love it, they've got three-year-old girls going into puberty, and so they give them hormones to block it
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:56.240]  Instead of getting the girls off the GMO of food and GMO milk, that's got the growth hormone
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:05.240]  And the plastics, which is an absolute fact, the plastics leaching and makes the girls hyper-female and the boys feminine
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:09.240]  You wonder why your boy is feminine
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:14.240]  And it looks like a little girl, it's because they are basically
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:22.240]  About hell, don't listen to me, it's easier just to listen to CNBC that said poison food is good
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:27.240]  They said poison food is good, and then if we don't have poison food and toys, the market will crash
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:32.240]  By the way, I haven't played that in six months, people won't believe me, will you find that, John?
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:36.240]  I remember the CNBC about poison being good for us
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:38.240]  Thank you, people won't believe me
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:43.240]  They have another newscast about mercury being good for your brain, you know, you can't make this stuff up
[1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:47.240]  Alright, I promise we're going to get to John, David, everybody else on the other side of this break
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:51.240]  Then all the financial news is coming up, I'm staying abreast of that, stay with me
[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:05.240]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts

[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:16.240]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the US
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:23.240]  Though the people of the US, where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:27.240]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:31.240]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  They oppose everything that is God and truth
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:38.240]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:43.240]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:47.240]  The poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:51.240]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us

[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.240]  Property of the New World Order
[1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:10.240]  That's another interesting point because a lot of people like to say
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  Scaremonger about China, right? A lot of politicians
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:15.240]  And I know you talk about that issue all the time
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:17.240]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:19.240]  If China were to revalue its currency
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  Or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.240]  Or food that isn't poisonous
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:26.240]  Their costs of production are going to go up
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:29.240]  And that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up too
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:32.240]  So I would say China is our greatest friend right now
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:35.240]  They're keeping prices low and keeping prices for mortgages low too
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:40.240]  Yeah, if China was to stop making poison food or toys that don't have lead
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.240]  We wouldn't have a good market
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:44.240]  Things wouldn't be cheap at Walmart
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:48.240]  They don't want to pay 10 more cents for that toothbrush or that can
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.240]  So it doesn't have melamine in it
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:53.240]  Thousands of children are sick in China
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:57.240]  Plastic actually has a high protein value
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:01.240]  Melamine does also fry your kidneys and accelerated aging
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.240]  Kill your dead in a hammer
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:05.240]  And we eat melamine over here
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:08.240]  Just China, you know, it comes out there, they report it in the news
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:10.240]  But melamine is in a lot of your food
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:12.240]  In fact, it helps your boys be girls
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:14.240]  And your girls die when they're 25 of breast cancer
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.240]  But hey, hey, let's party time, yeah
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  I love the New World Order
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  Man, everything's good
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:24.240]  That Alex Jones is evil
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  I'm not going to listen to him
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:28.240]  John and Florida, you're on the air, go ahead
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:31.240]  Hey, thanks Alex for being out there
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.240]  I'd love to listen to you
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.240]  Just a poor Catholic here trying to love my neighbor here
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:39.240]  And they had a great show on Coast to Coast
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:41.240]  You mentioned them last night that these two monks
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:43.240]  Well, they called themselves monks
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:45.240]  They just surfed the internet
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:47.240]  And they've seen 9-11 coming
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:49.240]  And what they do is they observe
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:51.240]  And see how humans use words
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:53.240]  Kind of like looking at animals before an earthquake
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:56.240]  And they said, right now, starting today, September 22
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:25:59.240]  We're on the verge of an epic event
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:01.240]  World-changing practically
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:03.240]  There's a separate program
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:05.240]  It's got millions of dollars of funding
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:09.240]  I forget where the computer tracks the buzz
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  And words that keep showing up
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.240]  Kind of like a...
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:15.240]  I think that's it
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:19.240]  A way of tracking the group consciousness
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:20.240]  Right, right
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:21.240]  That sounds like it
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:22.240]  Yeah, they surfed the internet
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:23.240]  And they said...
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:25.240]  Well, that sounds like surfing
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:26.240]  And that's one thing
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:29.240]  This is kind of like a massive NSA private deal
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:32.240]  Where it's scanning for key buzzwords
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:34.240]  Well, maybe more government-based, I don't know
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:37.240]  But also, you know, I was at a
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  Prepared in a conference in 98
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:41.240]  With Bo Greit
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  And I never heard you mention Don McEvaney
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:46.240]  And I'll be like...
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:48.240]  And Don McEvaney, you know, he's real...
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:49.240]  Real estate
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:50.240]  He predicted the bubble
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:52.240]  He saw the bubble real stable coming back then
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:56.240]  But he said he saw the receipt
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.240]  That Janet Reno signed under Clinton
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:01.240]  To bring 5,000 guillotines into the United States
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  So these people are definitely into death
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:06.240]  And the FEMA camps, they're ready for it
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:08.240]  Well, they do have the crematoriums
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:10.240]  That's been in the mainstream news
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  And they do have mass FEMA camps
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:14.240]  I appreciate your call
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:16.240]  Absolutely
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:18.240]  Going back 10, 15 years ago
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.240]  There were thousands of times the derivatives
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:23.240]  And there is all the real assets in the world
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:26.240]  Now it's just hundreds of times worse than that
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:29.240]  So we could have had this economic collapse at any time
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:32.240]  Any time the globalists decided to pull the plug
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:35.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Ohio
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:36.240]  David, you're on the air
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:38.240]  Hey, how you doing there, Alex?
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:39.240]  Good, sir
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:43.240]  Now, who do you have coming on to talk about the hydrofluorosilic acid there?
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:45.240]  I'm going to get into it later
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:47.240]  Oh, okay, I was just wondering who it was, the person
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:49.240]  But that's not what I wanted to talk about
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.240]  I was on the U.N. website a minute ago
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:54.240]  And I wondered if...
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:55.240]  I'd never read this
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.240]  Because I just started researching this stuff recently
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:03.240]  The United Nations Global Counterterrorism Strategy
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:05.240]  I was reading it
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:08.240]  And the wording in it is just ridiculous
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.240]  They don't ever define terrorism
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:13.240]  I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.240]  Well, terrorism is defined in Section 802
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.240]  The U.S. Patriot Act as basically any misdemeanor
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:22.240]  Or any threat to commit a misdemeanor
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:25.240]  And that's why you can Google a headline like
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:27.240]  Patriot Act used in non-terror cases
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:30.240]  Patriot Act used in thousands of drug cases
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:32.240]  I mean, and you'll read
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:35.240]  In West Virginia it was used 25,000 times
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.240]  In Texas it was used, and there's just hundreds of articles
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:40.240]  Where they say no due process, no nothing
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:42.240]  They're just getting rid of everything
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:45.240]  And we're going into hardcore tyranny
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:46.240]  Yeah, I was just...
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:48.240]  This thing that the U.N. wrote, though
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:51.240]  It bothers them to me because I'm sitting here reading it
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:53.240]  They don't ever have to define anything
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:56.240]  And there's all these little things that they put in
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:58.240]  Like every paragraph where it says
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:02.240]  We encourage nations to comply with our strategies
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:04.240]  You know, towards globalism or whatever
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.240]  But then if you say you don't want it
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:08.240]  They say it doesn't exist
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.240]  You know, our government's under treaty
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.240]  Following the every order of the U.N.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:14.240]  Not because the U.N. runs America
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.240]  The global corporate state that runs America
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:18.240]  Also runs the U.N.
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:20.240]  The U.N. was founded with U.S. money
[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:22.240]  And set up at the Presidio Naval Base
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.240]  And then of course with the Rockefeller land
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:26.240]  But...
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:28.240]  Look, there's another big article
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:30.240]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com right now
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.240]  Where YouTube is now openly admitting
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:35.240]  That anybody Lieberman staff says
[1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:38.240]  Band on YouTube is banned
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:41.240]  And they're banning hundreds of 9-11 truth accounts
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.240]  Other major websites are doing it
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:47.240]  They're implementing the Violent Radicalization Act
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:49.240]  Right now because they're going down
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:52.240]  We're on the march
[1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:54.240]  The Empire's on the run
[1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:58.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:00.240]  A day unlike any other
[1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:02.240]  In the long course of American history
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:05.240]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:07.240]  The enemies struck America on September 11
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:09.240]  But who is the enemy?
[1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:10.240]  Bin Laden
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:11.240]  This is his MO
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:13.240]  We have to look to the Middle East
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:15.240]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden
[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:17.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:19.240]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:22.240]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:23.240]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:25.240]  That there are Israelis again
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:29.240]  Very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:32.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:33.240]  Have been detained
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:35.240]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:37.240]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:38.240]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.240]  The Israeli intelligence network
[1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:41.240]  Warnings and war games
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:42.240]  The shadow government
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:43.240]  And much, much more

[1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:04.240]  Where everything goes right?
[1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:06.240]  First, I get the best parking space at work
[1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:09.240]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:12.240]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:14.240]  Finalized the contract in London
[1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:16.240]  And demoed our new product in Boston
[1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:19.240]  Online from my desk with Webex
[1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:20.240]  Webex lets me take meetings
[1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:22.240]  And give presentations from my desk
[1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:24.240]  I just talked to clients on the phone
[1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:26.240]  And they watch what's happening on my desktop
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:27.240]  From their desktop

[1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:30.240]  And still be here for my date tonight
[1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:31.240]  With Rachel

[1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:06.240]  Most of you have been hearing my ads
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:07.240]  For the past few months
[1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:09.240]  And it's no secret that the economy
[1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:12.240]  Is failing and prices are rising in all sectors
[1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:14.240]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:17.240]  Daily food source and a storable food
[1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:18.240]  For yourself and family
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:20.240]  The time to act is now

[1:32:57.240 --> 1:33:01.240]  Or visit us at HempUSA.org today
[1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:07.240]  Well, you were sleeping
[1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:11.240]  They came and took it away
[1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:16.240]  I'm going to get into the financial news
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:21.240]  Stock market is down 237.27 on the down
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:25.240]  NASDAQ down 54.48
[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:32.240]  S&P down 28.70
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:35.240]  Hey, you think the criminals that run our government
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:37.240]  We're just going to fly airplanes into buildings
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:39.240]  And say Al Qaeda did it
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:41.240]  And they publicly run that organization
[1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:43.240]  Just to launch a few wars
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:48.240]  We were always at the target
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:50.240]  And this is business as usual
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:52.240]  What's going on right now with the banks
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:54.240]  Bail out
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.240]  This is a scam out
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:02.240]  This is the big theft
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  And they're sending in the regular army
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:08.240]  To be garrison in our cities
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:15.240]  Everybody doesn't like it
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:17.240]  But take a deep breath
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:29.240]  Because this is the moment before the plunge
[1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:32.240]  The New World Order loves hurting people
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.240]  They love ruthlessly consolidating power
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:37.240]  And they've never found such arrogant
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:41.240]  Know-it-all sheep
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:44.240]  And never found a people more ready to be hustled
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.240]  More ready to be taken
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:51.240]  We have to get to the point where we can look at ourselves
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:53.240]  Because the New World Order is an inside job
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:56.240]  But we have to, as the song says, change ourselves on the inside
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:58.240]  That's also an inside job
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.240]  We have to get fired up and angry and focused
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:03.240]  And say no to them and say we know you're behind the bailout
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.240]  We know you're behind the scams
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:06.240]  We have your own documents
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:07.240]  We know you're terrorist
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:09.240]  We know you're illegitimate
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.240]  Let's run through some more calls and we'll get into financial news
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:14.240]  Jim in Kansas, you're on the air
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:15.240]  Thanks for holding
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:16.240]  Hello, Alex
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.240]  Why don't you sue the insiders who brought about 9-11?
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:22.240]  You know, I get these calls from people
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  Maybe even from you before saying you need to sue these people
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.240]  You need to do more, Mr. Jones
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:30.240]  You need to take action and go in and stop them
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:35.240]  Actually, I have supported three different groups of people
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  On-air and tried to get my great listeners
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:42.240]  We go to that well so much to donate money to them
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.240]  Berg and Mariani and, of course, Stanley Hilton
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:52.240]  And the judges just throw it out and declare national security
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:56.240]  We tried to get German talists who they beat up
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  And then Fox News framed him for attacking some woman in a wheelchair
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.240]  We got him a lawyer, but then he basically got his head blown off two weeks ago
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:05.240]  The lawyer did, for whatever reason, his lawyer's dead
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:06.240]  They said, suicide
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:10.240]  And I try to fund stuff for the firefighters and police and emergency workers
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:13.240]  And I know this shows, raised more than 50 grand for them
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:18.240]  But, hey, why don't you, Jim?
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:20.240]  Good answer
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:24.240]  Next question is, are you going to change frequencies during the daylight hours
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  Like you were before the daylight savings time?
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  You know, I don't even micro-manage WWCR
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:36.240]  And I know that they've told me that I am like a count for half their listening now
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:40.240]  I mean, it's the main popular show, that's why they re-air it
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:45.240]  I don't know, I think I'm on there like 12 hours a day or something on different frequencies
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:48.240]  And I just don't control winter where they put it on
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:50.240]  But if you're having problems, call them
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:53.240]  Okay, all right, keep up the good work
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.240]  Thank you, sir, I appreciate the call, Jim
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.240]  Jeff in Florida, you're on the air
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:00.240]  Hi, Alex, first time long time, how are you?
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:01.240]  I'm doing pretty good, sir
[1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:03.240]  Excellent, I just wanted to let you know
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:06.240]  And thank you for the work that you've done, true patriot
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:09.240]  And I'd like to let you know that I've illuminated many as well
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.240]  Let me be clear, I'm not a true patriot
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:16.240]  I mean, if I know that cell phones are frying little kids' brains and are going to kill them
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:21.240]  I mean, I would be the most wicked, heartless bastard on earth
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:23.240]  If I didn't get on air and freak out
[1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:24.240]  But go ahead
[1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:28.240]  Alex, very true, and you've got to remember, they like to make us believe that it's our fault
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  You know, when they do this for us, like the bailout
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:36.240]  Like, oh yeah, it's our fault that we, you know, let people take loans like that, you know
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:37.240]  So I agree with what you're saying
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:41.240]  They're going to say, okay, there's 20 million brain tumors like that, Kennedy
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  And all in the same lobe
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.240]  Well, you know what, it's your fault
[1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.240]  You were told what cell phones were going to do
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:49.240]  Absolutely
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:54.240]  I wanted to quickly, I know you had some things going on around 9-11 and whatnot
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:59.240]  Ron Paul could have dropped a Carol Quigley bombshell video on YouTube that I recently saw
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:04.240]  And it takes Ron Paul's quote that he used for the one-party system from Carol Quigley
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:08.240]  From his book, Tragedy and Hope
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:11.240]  I just wish he would have kind of gone into it a little bit further
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:15.240]  And talked about the domination of world economies that Carol Quigley pointed out into
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:17.240]  Into the world of hope
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:23.240]  So Ron Paul has said this is a stage collapse and he said that we have a secret government running everything
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:28.240]  That's not even secret now, I mean, it's admitted
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:33.240]  That's right, and I think this video will help people understand that, hey, Ron Paul said it
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  Carol Quigley said it, I even had, there's footage on that video of Bill Clinton even praising Carol Quigley
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.240]  And then it has a bunch of the quotes from the book
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:46.240]  So if people could check out, Ron Paul could have dropped the Carol Quigley bombshell
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:49.240]  A lot of people are waking up as it is right now
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:52.240]  But need to find out further information, this is a great start
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:54.240]  And listening to your show, obviously, of course
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.240]  Well, I appreciate your recommendations and I appreciate your call
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:04.240]  He's absolutely right, we need to get the word out about who's behind this
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:06.240]  In fact, I was thinking about it this weekend
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:09.240]  We had a 9-11 truth move, but not just to expose 9-11
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:15.240]  But that Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center attack, the Madrid bombing, the 7-7 bombing
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:22.240]  You know, as this continues, as this happens, we are able to then expose government-sponsored terror
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:28.240]  And as the public becomes more aware of false flag terrorism, or provocateur terrorism
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:32.240]  Then there's more eyes on the ground and more people recording what happens
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:36.240]  And more people paying attention because they know what to look for when something happens
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:41.240]  Like there's been this giant bomb blast in Pakistan
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:47.240]  And remember, when pro-globalist forces, machine gun Benazar Budo
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:52.240]  Come out and said that Ben Laden was basically a U.S. government asset and it died
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.240]  You know, I guess she was jumping over to somebody else's side, they had to kill her
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  Right on TV cameras, they just machine gun her
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:02.240]  She gets splattered up against the car like in a movie
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:07.240]  But worldwide they said she was machine gunned, only the American cattle
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:10.240]  They said she hit her head
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.240]  I laughed because it's so painful and sick
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:17.240]  But later, it was even admitted here, okay, that report was wrong
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:22.240]  She didn't hit bumper, little head and kill herself
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:24.240]  Pretty soon they'll just say the person's not dead
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.240]  And then if you say the person was killed, they'll say that's a conspiracy theory
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:33.240]  I mean, you know, they're really trying to train us with just the most baseline propaganda
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:37.240]  Why would terrorists want to decapitate anti-U.S. leadership in Pakistan?
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:41.240]  There's all these bombings and shootings and killings and stabbings and kidnappings
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:45.240]  Of anybody anti-New World Order in Pakistan right now
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:53.240]  Every time they say Al-Qaeda is killing the anti-U.S. group
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:57.240]  Which is true, Al-Qaeda always strikes the Serbs who are anti-globalists
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  Or they strike the Russians, they're always used
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  But why would Al-Qaeda, because Al-Qaeda is Al-Caeda, a group that is supposedly the prime target of the U.S. initiated war on terror
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:13.240]  Commit a terrorist attack against a country that has recently changed its government
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:17.240]  All but renounced its role as a U.S. ally in the war on terror
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:23.240]  Well, you got U.S. helicopters and predators bombing and killing and shootouts with the Pakistani military
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:26.240]  So Al-Qaeda's going to go into action against their enemy
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:29.240]  They work for the globalists, so of course they're going to attack the Pakistan government
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  Oh, that's sick! Man, it's sick!
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.240]  But somebody's after going out of the Middle East and they're shut up
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:41.240]  They're not in the Middle East, it's Central Asia
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:43.240]  It's Eastern Central Asia
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:47.240]  The mass media has already blamed the Marriott Hotel Bombing
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:52.240]  Which killed at least 53 people on Al-Qaeda a routine reflex action
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:56.240]  Despite the lack of any real investigation and no claim of responsibility
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:03.240]  On Saturday morning, newly elected Pakistan president, Asif Ali Zardiai
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  About announcing that right
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:08.240]  Zardari told his parliament
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:13.240]  We will no longer tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:17.240]  By any power in the name of combating terrorism
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:21.240]  And then, well, you know who hits
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:27.240]  And he says, you're not going to, in the name of fighting terror, take any more of our country's sovereignty
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.240]  Oh, really? How about Al-Qaeda kill you?
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:32.240]  How about anybody that supports you?
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:34.240]  Dies
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:37.240]  And then we'll tell our schmucks back home, Al-Qaeda's hitting
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:39.240]  And then they'll give up even more rights
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:43.240]  Ha ha ha ha! Oh, it's so genius!
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:48.240]  When you have fat dumb cattle begging to be slaves
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.240]  Hours later, presto! Al-Qaeda provides the perfect pretext for the U.S. to violate
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:43:03.240]  Pakistan territorial integrity in the name of, you guessed it, combating Al-Qaeda!
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:11.240]  And that was the 6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:13.240]  That were flown in the airlift of evil
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:18.240]  Yeah, I mean, it's hit in plain view that U.S. special forces would capture the top Taliban general
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:19.240]  Or the number two in Al-Qaeda
[1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:22.240]  And then they'd be ordered by the command, okay, put them in a convoy
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.240]  Give them a bunch of money and weapons
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:26.240]  And let them go and escort them to the border
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:30.240]  Or load them on C-130s and fly 6,000 out of them
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:32.240]  Always the same story
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:37.240]  And then now they are nesting in Pakistan
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.240]  And launching attacks against the Pakistani government
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:44.240]  And then the U.S. goes in and attacks regular Pakistani military
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:48.240]  And tells our people that they're Al-Qaeda
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:50.240]  Guys in army uniforms
[1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:53.240]  And the public believes it, of course
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.240]  Because they love being raped
[1:43:55.240 --> 1:44:01.240]  They love it, they love it so much, being losers
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:04.240]  I'm trying to get you to wake up out there and stop being losers
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:05.240]  Am I talking to my general audience?
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:09.240]  I'm talking to those out there snickering and picking their nose right now
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:11.240]  More telling than that
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:14.240]  Had the leadership of Pakistan not canceled their plans to dine
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  The Marriott Hotel at the last minute
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  Oh, that was a good thing
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:24.240]  The entire command structure of the whole country would have been decapitated
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:26.240]  What's our congress under?
[1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:30.240]  They're under PDD 51, COG doctrine
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:33.240]  They've been told they run nothing
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:36.240]  And if they get too uppity, they've been quietly told
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:37.240]  And this has even come out
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:40.240]  The congressmen have said this, that they will be decapitated
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:45.240]  Al-Qaeda, Al-CIAida, will set off a neutron bomb
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:47.240]  Or a small nuke when they're in session
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:50.240]  Ooh, we gotta make the president a dictator
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:52.240]  Or whatever president's coming
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:54.240]  The National Security Council
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  Under shadow government because Al-Qaeda hit our capital
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:03.240]  I've had enough of it, I've had enough of you, not 11 truthers
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.240]  Arrest every single one of them
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  You didn't let us fight, Al-Qaeda
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:10.240]  Now they've hit our capital
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:15.240]  That's the general public like lobotomized seals
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:21.240]  Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar
[1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:24.240]  It's believing anything and everything
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:28.240]  Meanwhile, public Pentagon plans, British Pentagon perspectives
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:33.240]  openly state that they might use neutron weapons against rogue congresses
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:37.880]  or parliaments or peoples, and they surveil the Congress in parliament.
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:43.900]  Rogue, criminal, iron-fisted, with weapon systems, with nukes.
[1:45:43.900 --> 1:45:45.400]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:50.800]  That's why they don't care of you, no.
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:55.040]  You got just the cops and the public, you're, argh, argh, argh, argh, argh, believing any
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:57.040]  of it.
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:03.320]  In our news, Al Qaeda tried to blow up the Marriott and hurt civilians, and you actually
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:08.440]  read it was a government meeting there of the new government.
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:13.640]  Oh, my goodness.
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:18.480]  Pakistan's top leaders were to dine at the Marriott Hotel that had devastated by a truck
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:22.920]  bombing over the weekend, but changed the venue in the last minute as senior government
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.600]  official said Monday reports the Associated Press today.
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:30.840]  Perhaps the terrorists knew that the Marriott was the venue of the dinner for all the leadership
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:36.200]  where the president, prime minister, speaker, and the entire leadership were to be present.
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:41.400]  Interior Minister Chief Raymond Maliki told reporters at the 11th hour the president and
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:45.040]  the prime minister decided that the venue would be the prime minister's house.
[1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:47.520]  It saved the entire leadership.
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:49.020]  Indeed.
[1:46:49.020 --> 1:46:53.000]  It seems the terrorists did know that their prime objective was to completely wipe out
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:58.440]  the most influential players in the government that just so happened to be anti-Al Qaeda
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:03.480]  that have seemingly vowed to break away from the years of Paris Mesharev's mandating lapdogs
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:06.240]  of servings to U.S. imperial limbs.
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:12.760]  The timing of the weekend's Al Qaeda bombing coincides with a buildup in tensions over
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:16.920]  the past month, not between Pakistan and Al Qaeda, but between Pakistan and the United
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:17.920]  States government.
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:18.920]  And it goes on.
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:19.920]  I'm going to get Paul Watson on.
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:22.640]  Let's try to set him up the last 30 minutes.
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:23.640]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:27.480]  I'm going to get to you all when we start the next hour, about 15 minutes, about 12
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:29.480]  minutes to be technical.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:33.600]  But there's all this financial news, and I'm going to go over it after Ted and Tim
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:41.120]  Larson come on with us, because the stock market is down 240 points.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:48.040]  The Dow is about 60 points on the Nasdaq, 30 points on S&P, a little over that.
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:53.520]  Gold jumps way back up to 114 as bailout weighs on dollar.
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:58.560]  Look, if there was any doubt the dollar was going to die, it's all out the window.
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.480]  And again, they'll probably resuscitate it again a few points, but then it'll plunge
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:02.640]  even further.
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:06.000]  You look at the graph, the one year, the two year, the five year, it's straight down.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:07.560]  You look at a month to month, it's up and down.
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:10.000]  But you look at the big graph, it's down.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:13.200]  And well, look, as an audience, you know what's going on.
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:19.080]  They're talking about ABC News, Paulson was on ABC News yesterday, and he said, we're
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:20.760]  going to bail out all the foreign banks.
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:24.840]  Now bailout means let them all share and suck on its drive.
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:27.520]  The housing thing's a few hundred billion bucks, folks.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:29.440]  That's just the excuse to say the people did it.
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:32.720]  Okay, this is trillions and trillions.
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:36.120]  And now when they announced they're going to, quote, bail the whole world out, the
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:39.880]  dollar started plunging again, and that's why gold is shot up to 900 bucks an ounce
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:41.240]  today.
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:46.360]  And let's go to Ted Anderson and the chief market analyst in this business for decades
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:50.920]  and also an author on economics, Tim Larson.
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:53.840]  Let's bring up Ted Anderson and Tim Larson.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:56.640]  Gentlemen, either one of you can go first.
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.600]  Tell us what we're seeing happen today.
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  Well, Alex, we are seeing just the tip of the iceberg.
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:08.800]  I mean, the banking system is falling apart, like I've been predicting for a long time.
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:14.440]  You've got laymans that went belly up, I mean, that dwarfed anything that has been out there.
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:15.880]  You can talk about WorldCom.
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:18.320]  You can talk about Anron and Tyco.
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:21.760]  You can add up all of their totals for their bankruptcies.
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:30.120]  You can multiply that by six and you're talking not even what layman went belly up for, $613
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.960]  billion.
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:34.400]  So I mean, this is going to continue.
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:38.600]  I mean, this is all of the housing bubble that's burst.
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.160]  I mean, they took all these subprime loans and guess what?
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:45.520]  This is put the bank in the situations and they're not going to be able to bail out of
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:46.520]  it.
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:47.520]  It's simple as that.
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:52.960]  But, Tim, when you look at the IMF and World Bank strategies, when you look at what the
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:58.480]  Financial Times of London has said, the larger mega-institutions are engineering this for
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:03.640]  a consolidation and the real threat isn't the subprime mortgages.
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:08.840]  It was the fact that they were packaged and sold and then leveraged to the 10th degree
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:09.840]  out.
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  Ted Anderson?
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.960]  Well, you know, Alex, the biggest laugh to this is the $700 billion bailout that they're
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:16.960]  talking about right now.
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:22.040]  I mean, I'm reading down through just CNN's report and what they want.
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.360]  I mean, they want the United States government to buy all the bad debts.
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  So it's just the companies are left with the good debt.
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:31.760]  And they're saying that if we don't do this, we're going to run into an economic crisis
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:34.600]  like we had the Depression of the 1930s.
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:38.160]  Taxpayer collections are going to go down, the dole's going to go up because everybody's
[1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:41.000]  going to be drawn on employment, the government's going to implode.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.800]  This is like a full collapse.
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:45.720]  And they're saying, hey, just pour on the presses, man.
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:47.280]  Let's just print as much as it takes.
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:50.560]  What they're doing is they're blowing it all out now like an engine they know is going
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:51.560]  to blow.
[1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:55.040]  They're just having fun with it, you know, putting it in first gear and flooring it.
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:59.760]  They're just ripping the engine of pieces, laughing and giggling, hiring more SWAT teams,
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:02.880]  more prisons.
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:05.440]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:08.960]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.120]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week a whole
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:14.520]  week in advance?
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:17.280]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:21.880]  The guys over at e-miniforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:26.120]  They call it a G line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:27.120]  in advance.
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:28.120]  Impossible?
[1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:33.640]  Head over to e-miniforecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.

[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:56.040]  Again, that's e-miniforecaster.com.
[1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:59.920]  This is Rob at e-miniforecaster.com and I approve this message.
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:02.920]  May I have everyone's attention, please?
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:05.440]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:08.040]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:09.560]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:11.040]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:14.120]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:18.360]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Farlatter Commission, the C.A.
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:27.160]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:33.320]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:35.880]  An inside job?
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:37.000]  How dare you?
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.880]  I don't want to keep looking at the topic suggestion at 9-11.
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:43.480]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:46.280]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:51.880]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:57.800]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:00.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:03.000]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:09.960]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:15.080]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases.
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:18.120]  From these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:22.760]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:25.480]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:31.080]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:37.000]  By mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:27.000]  Oh, we got interesting times ahead. In a way, I'm kind of looking forward.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.080]  Deccan and people out there have been living in denial.
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:38.840]  Having to live in reality like everybody else in the third world has been living.
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:47.080]  But a lot of innocent people are going to get hurt in the process. That's why I'm trying to stop it as best I can.
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:52.840]  That's why we've desperately been trying to warn you.
[1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:58.120]  Ted Anderson and Tim Larson of Minus Resources.
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:03.880]  For those that don't understand what's happened, every couple of weeks they have hundreds of
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:11.400]  billions in bailout. Again, I keep using their term bailout, scam out. And they know that the
[1:55:11.400 --> 1:55:16.600]  dollars never coming back. So while it's still got some value, they are just creating hundreds
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:21.320]  and hundreds and hundreds of billions in more liquidity for themselves a day. And then they're
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:25.960]  raiding the real economy by real economy, companies that actually manufacture things,
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:32.520]  700 plus companies that are financial brokerage houses, banks, they're not allowed to be
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:39.320]  shorted. But they are going out and attacking the real economy. So this is a looting orgy of death.
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:46.360]  Exterminating the buffalo right now, basically. The scamming and thieving and pension fund stealing
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:50.360]  going on right now dwarfs anything that's ever happened in history. All the scamming in the
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:58.200]  last decade, it's nothing, nothing compared to it. Now, on the surface they say, oh, we're going to
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:02.360]  guarantee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac market goes up for a few days and plunges. Oh, now we're going
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:06.280]  to bail out all these other big brokerage firms goes up for a few days starts plunging again.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:12.120]  Because the world knows what this means. Now the Japanese and Chinese are buying into US banks,
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.880]  you know, on the surface to prop them up. No, they just want to be part of the
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:21.080]  power play of consolidation of who's left on the other side. So this is an incredible
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:27.640]  in the line predatory system where they're being gobbled up basically into one new world order
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:33.160]  system. And then while they're doing it, they're running out the debt on us forever. Bottom line,
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:38.760]  Tim Larson, Ted Anderson, what is your timeframe? What do you see happening? How long until this
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:43.320]  goes into a full board depression and destroys what's left of the physical economy? Well,
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:48.200]  I can add in right here now, you know, that this is like the, the mark of the end when you see the
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:53.720]  United States government being sold by the central bank that they got a step in and pick up an
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.760]  institution that bails out their buddy's bad debt, the bad loans that they've made, the United
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:04.440]  States covered the economy is in trouble. It's all based upon this debt that comes from the
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:09.160]  Federal Reserve System and our own central bank. And each one of those bank members right now are
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:14.760]  crying wolf saying, Hey, we need help. This is like what happened in 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:19.720]  was in the office and we're running into the depression of the 1930s and the liability of
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:24.680]  the banks to pay the people their gold back that they've deposited was a big problem to them. So
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.800]  they went to the United States president and said, we need you to bail us out. And the president
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:34.040]  signed an executive order to force the people to turn the goal over to the banks. This is what's
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:38.600]  going on right now. The bankers have a lot of bad debt, a lot of bad mortgages that they're trying
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:43.800]  to collect. But let's explain the owners of these banks and the shareholders quietly have
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:48.920]  been moving all the real assets out the back door and buying infrastructure and commodities
[1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:54.920]  for decades. They've been quietly planning this for decades. This is the birth of the new world order.
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:00.040]  Most certainly is Alex. I can tell you right now, they are asking that the United States
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:06.200]  government come in and buy all their bad debts so they can keep the good debt. And it is a sad
[1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:11.000]  situation. And even the LA Times yesterday I covered it on the Sunday show said there's no checks
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.840]  and balances. Congress is out of the loop and that Bush is now a dictator. So there you go.
[1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:22.760]  Voila. In fact, Bloomberg last night had the headline that Bush is now a dictator. I mean folks,
[1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:28.360]  you're like, well, that's good. He's a Republican. No, he doesn't run anything. He's a gun grabbing,
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:32.920]  open border promoting person. It won't matter if it's Barack Obama or John McCain. Get ready,
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:37.880]  ladies and gentlemen, the heavy armor brigades are moving into the US. Stay there, Tim Larson,
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:46.120]  Ted Anderson. I want to talk more in one minute. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:48.120]  visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:25.240]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:53.880 --> 1:59:59.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks.
[2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:13.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:21.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:27.080]  In the last week, I've seen no fewer than, I don't know, it's more than 10 headlines going,
[2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:31.560]  this is the new world order. Prepare for it to be born, an international banking order
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:38.600]  with a global control. Out of England, we must run everything and currencies all pegged to one
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:44.120]  system. Only that will save us. So again, they run the Ponzi scheme up. They get all these countries,
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.520]  trillions of dollars in debt. We have the IMF World Bank documents on this when they planned
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:53.160]  all this. And I keep warning people since we learned this six years ago, intensely. I mean,
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:01:02.280]  we knew this was the game a long time ago. And folks, they are pulling out all the stops right
[2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:07.160]  now. I mean, they announced that the government will bail out any foreign banks that basically
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:11.400]  want it. But remember, nobody gets prosecuted. Nobody gets investigated. That's why you know,
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:16.440]  it's an inside job, plus their own documents. But nobody gets in trouble. Later, they'll burn
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:21.240]  a few little low level janitors or something and dress them up in suits and call them, you know,
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:25.560]  big guys. And I mean that figuratively, but some low level broker. But but nobody's getting in
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:29.640]  trouble. They're telling you nobody's anything wrong. Just a mistake. But they're going to
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:34.440]  repossess your house. You're not getting bailed out. You're, you're just giving all of your future
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:41.000]  money and pledging, you know, all of your taxes to the private bankers. This is the New World Order.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:46.440]  Tim Larson, what do you see happening in the short term? Well, in a short term, I seriously
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:50.360]  don't see the banking system lasting another year. And I'm going to be surprised if it's got
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.960]  another six months. You know, people need to put some of these numbers in perspective here real
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:03.000]  quickly. So real quickly, let me explain what a billion and a trillion dollars is. All right,
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.560]  now you can sit down with the dollar bills in front of you. You can count a dollar bill every
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:14.040]  second. And it'll take you 12 days to get to a million. You will get to a billion. It's going
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:22.600]  to take you with 34 years to get to a trillion. You're talking 3400 years. These are incredible
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:26.760]  numbers. And there's not enough money out there to do it. They're going to run the printing presses
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:32.200]  as long as they want. But it's not going to save it. By the way, the numbers we're talking about
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:38.360]  is going to dwarf the Weimar Republic and, you know, 2 million percent inflation. I mean, that's
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:43.000]  and there's, I've got a big stack of news where countries are seriously debating getting rid of
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:48.120]  the US triple A rating. Ted, if they get rid of the triple A rating, it's all over. It's insolvency.
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.760]  It is bankruptcy. Well, that just means that the interest rate on a US government security is
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:59.000]  going to have to go up. And the whole manipulation scheme that we've had here, Alex, is that the
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.440]  Federal Reserve system is pushing money into the system and lending money and buying US government
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:09.080]  bonds so it doesn't, the open market doesn't push the interest rates up. Right now, the US
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:14.680]  interest rate is so far below inflation that nobody in the right mind wants to lend money in
[2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:19.640]  this country anymore. And that's why we're having so much problem because there's too much manipulation.
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:24.120]  Now, let's explain. The people can't get any credit. Small corporations and businesses can't
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:30.200]  get credit. But the big boys, the windows open and the Fed, private Fed is saying and the Treasury
[2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:36.200]  saying whatever you want. And the only big brokerage house of the big five that's halfway left is the
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:41.880]  one that Henry Paulson came from. You want to talk about that to Larson? Well, yeah, I mean, and
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:47.640]  that is it. I mean, the Federal Reserve system just keeps pumping in money and it's just not going
[2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:54.200]  to do any good because unless, like Ted says, we start raising our debt prices, you know, our bonds
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:59.880]  and our Treasuries, nobody wants them. China quit buying our debt here. Oh, God, a year and a half
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:07.480]  ago. You know, we need to borrow $2.2 billion or $3.2 billion a day to keep this whole thing afloat.
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:12.280]  And it's not happening because nobody wants our debt any longer. And again, they put banking elites
[2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:17.080]  in who would do this to us. This is what the United States and England used to do to third world
[2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:24.360]  countries under the last wave of neo colonialism was oh, it's not a colonial power, you just owe us
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:29.560]  money. And then they would set things up and it was in agreements that the leadership would not pay
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:35.320]  it back because the banks wanted the assets. That's been done there. Stay there, gentlemen.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:37.800]  We're going to do five more minutes on economic news with our guest,
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:43.080]  Jim Larson, Ted Anderson. And then we're going to go to your phone calls. I know we had a lot of
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:49.080]  phone calls there. And then we have a guest coming on dealing with sodium fluoride. It's not just
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:54.520]  sodium fluoride. That's a catch all name the government uses. It's lead. It's mercury. It's
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:59.240]  arsenic in hundreds of times safe levels for you and your family.
[2:05:01.320 --> 2:05:06.200]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty

[2:05:11.240 --> 2:05:15.880]  are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's

[2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:07.400]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here recently and she
[2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:11.480]  was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices,
[2:06:11.480 --> 2:06:15.720]  this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where
[2:06:15.720 --> 2:06:19.480]  we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in
[2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:23.400]  those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they
[2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:27.240]  could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:31.000]  areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  they didn't have the chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them. Well we know one
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.400]  thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:43.880]  shortage now what can you do to prepare do what I did sell some toys off in the garage go to the

[2:08:55.080 --> 2:09:00.760]  people that's their enemy attacking the russians that's their enemy attacking the serbs that's their
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:08.440]  enemy attacking sudam that's their enemy on and on and on and then i hear talk radio i see the
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:15.160]  financial news and they're still engaged in so much deception ted i mean what is it like knowing
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:20.200]  how the markets really work knowing how commodities really work and and and and i mean for me i've
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:23.080]  got you know some knowledge of this interviewing all these financial experts over the years and
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:27.160]  studying it and to see them getting away with it i mean they're getting away with the bailout
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:32.920]  they're getting away as if all their other thieving and scamming and everything they caused
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:38.920]  wasn't bad enough now you know they're getting multi-billion dollar bonuses some of these CEOs
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:42.600]  that you know have been paid three billion dollars the last few years i mean they are
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:47.960]  raping the daylights out of us well 17 thousand dollars an hour is what the guy from aig was
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:52.040]  getting i mean could you imagine getting that kind of money uh... you're talking about paulson and
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:56.440]  you know and and benarki both of them address congress and if congress was just dumbfounded
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:01.080]  they don't even know what's going on uh... you know they're talking about in a frozen credit
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:05.640]  market right now because in the banks are afraid to to enter into deals with each other because
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:10.040]  they don't know which one's gonna kill them and uh... with frozen credit markets that mean there's
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:14.600]  no money coming into the system the federal reserve system only has the ability to get money into
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:18.920]  the system of people willing to take it on loan and that's why they want the u.s government to
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:23.320]  step into it because that's how the money has to get into the system to free up the uh... to
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:28.200]  free up this frozen not credit market it's crazy alex we should have a free market system the
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:34.760]  united states government has been commissioned by our forefathers to not have central banking
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:40.200]  systems and to be able to get our money through the creation uh... you know bring gold and silver
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:44.440]  out of the ground that's how we should have it and and this is crazy the whole thing is nuts
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:49.320]  and then you have people who blame the free market for this no this is government that is
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:55.080]  allowing this government that engineered this in partnership with the big banks that's called
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:11:00.440]  fascism as alex this has nothing to do with freedom at all it's been manipulated manipulated
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:05.400]  since nineteen uh... nineteen thirteen certainly the nineteen twenties roaring twenties was created
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:10.200]  by easy credit and then we ran into the depression the nineteen thirties this this it's been going
[2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:14.600]  on and on and on and right now we're bailing out problems that were created by the uh...
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:20.040]  by the easy credit of the of the nineteen nineties i mean come on i we definitely have to get away
[2:11:20.040 --> 2:11:24.520]  from the system that's why it makes me so happy to see that twelve thousand people showed up
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:29.320]  at the uh... at the liberty campaign thing for thron paul you know definitely folks now are
[2:11:29.320 --> 2:11:33.000]  finding out about the private federal reserve they're finding out about the new world order the
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:39.160]  problem is people that have saved who have lived in their means they're being penalized uh...
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:42.440]  the you know the poor folks that went and lied on their applications
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:46.600]  in the system allowed them to that flipped houses now they just walk away
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:50.440]  but people that want to be solvent folks that haven't lived outside their means people that
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:55.320]  have businesses and companies that are solvent they're going to be punished but the crooks of
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:12:01.880]  every stripe from the international bankers down to slobs in this country uh... and then down to
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:06.280]  those that got tricked and over leveraged or lost their jobs they're going to get punished too but
[2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:11.960]  but but criminals are going to be rewarded in folks if you think things are bad now
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:15.800]  uh... there is no doubt this is going to get deeper this is going to get more intense every
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:22.520]  analyst we have on says it is a virtual certainty barring miracles that we are not going to have
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:28.200]  a sustained deep uh... depression that will probably go into a full economic collapse
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:33.080]  people are not self-sufficient their spoiled rotten uh... they're moving in army brigades
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:38.360]  you can't make this type stuff up i mean that they openly say army brigades to deal with the
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:43.400]  american people for an economic collapse we hope we don't have to shoot americans that's the army
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:47.960]  times and oh by the way we're going to have the jaws of life out helping the police so that's for
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:53.640]  p r all of the armies here to help me get with a car wreck i mean this is black ops taking over
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:57.720]  we're going into third world receivership it's in all the i'm at world bank plans
[2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:04.040]  they've done this in hundreds of nations and enclosing with you gentlemen um... i know ted
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:07.960]  that you have been getting into the position this is the right kind of market to be in because
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:13.320]  you're able as gold climbs seventy dollars and eighty dollars and a hundred dollars the last
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:20.040]  time i checked it was up over a hundred and what twenty nine dollars from last wednesday
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:25.080]  i haven't looked in the last thirty minutes or so where is gold right now ted the last time i
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:30.200]  looked at gold gold was at nine oh three ten silvers even higher thirteen forty nine it's
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:35.320]  not up like crazy both of them and i don't blame so that's up a hundred and thirty uh... gold is
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:40.440]  up a hundred and thirty silver is up how much silver right now is up to thirteen forty nine it's
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:45.640]  up seventy eight cents so it's up like three plus dollars from its low gold's a hundred and thirty
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:50.920]  plus from its low i guess even more from its low but from its low last week and and ladies and
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:56.120]  gentlemen it may go down again though i doubt it well i mean historically the winner is when the
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:01.560]  fallen winners when it goes crazy ladies and gentlemen all the commodities go oil surge like
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:07.160]  eighteen bucks today because when the dollar dies and it's the world's a nomination it is going to
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:11.560]  send every commodity to the roof and gold should be up at three thousand uh... for conservative
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:16.200]  inflation from nineteen eighty many others are saying six thousand that's how much real inflation
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:20.120]  i don't know that's going to happen but i know this the internationalist cannot devalue uh...
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:24.600]  jed go ahead yeah i was just about to say anytime you see bailout when you see these people getting
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:29.560]  up in front of congress hold on to your hat and grab on your boats because you know it right
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:34.120]  that's exactly what causes the problem it's exactly what's going to debase the value of the
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.520]  currency they want to be able to print money to solve problems that you can't do that we need to
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:43.080]  get back to constitutional money i don't care and the people of this the in this audience here
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:47.800]  should know better than to think that just because golden silver goes up and down makes it a bad buy
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:52.600]  or a great buy right now people need to get into golden silver because it's obvious what's going
[2:14:52.600 --> 2:14:57.720]  on here and we should do everything we can to support uh... the people that are in office
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:01.400]  that are actually trying to get us back on track to the constant to let me give you both a comment
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:07.960]  on this ten larson and then ted and and and then we're gonna wrap it up you have short selling last
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:14.680]  tuesday last wednesday band and that's a very predatory thing folks of those that don't know
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:19.240]  very speculative very dangerous but it was only banned for seven hundred and forty something
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:26.520]  financial crime institutions to guard them but not all the real economy and i keep going back
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:33.000]  to this so there's not just a looting of the pension funds going on and a looting going on of our
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:38.200]  you know future deficit uh... at thousands of times all the real money in the world
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:45.480]  i mean this is a total takeover the enemy is is moving these new billions they get into leverage
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:53.080]  puts and into shorting the real economy so they're going for broke they're rating all the real
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:58.680]  economy trying to shoot up companies drive down stock drive up stock i mean we're seeing a orgy
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.040]  of crime like we've never seen while they're robbing the treasury they're they're attacking other
[2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:10.360]  sectors of the economy they've got rigged games double rules insider trading for some not for others
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:15.800]  uh... i mean they are clearly ripping the chandeliers out ripping the wallpaper out
[2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:20.440]  they are gutting the palace i mean is that a good way of putting a dim larson uh... pretty
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:24.280]  pretty much you're right on the money there i mean these people shorting all of these commodities
[2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:29.880]  and such are doing it for one purpose they want other people out of them they want to
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:35.480]  rob them of their money and their wealth it's real simple that's why gold and silver goes down
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:40.920]  especially during the main manipulation times like the summer months and that's going to continue
[2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:46.040]  to happen but you know it's gotten to the point where all of these banks are folding you've got
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:50.120]  i've talked i don't know how many clients who relatives have lost money in these bankruptcies
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:56.920]  from lake lamens and it's going to continue to happen so golden silver can't be held down long
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:17:02.760]  and neither can the price of oil it is what it is what about the real economy i mean this is
[2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:07.320]  if the economy's already at a standstill and and falling apart what is this going to do
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:12.920]  now that everything else is is is falling apart well we're headed towards a global
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:19.320]  depression and i'm talking about a depression that makes 1933 look like a trip to disney world
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:24.120]  and it's going to happen one way or the other they're in a panic stage they're going to make it
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:29.320]  worse out yes they are tim tim and teddy both agree it's going to make it much more severe
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:33.800]  that they're doing this mass riping right now oh without a question alex right now i can tell you
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:37.960]  that the manipulation that's going on to try to bail and bail and bail is just going to
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:42.840]  it's magnifying and amplifying the problems it's going to be a tremendous amount worse than it was
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:47.880]  and besides the fact back in 1933 when we had that depression most people are living on the farm
[2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:52.440]  and they could grow their own food that's what i'm that that's what i'm afraid of uh i mean
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:57.480]  breakdown of cities were rotting people trying to come on your farms and ranches ladies and gentlemen
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:18:02.280]  you better batten down the hatches because we're going into a very dangerous decade right now god
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:06.360]  knows what's going to happen i hope they don't start a war try to cover all this up but it looks
[2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:12.760]  like they may do that um ted tell folks about the gold and silver offer you've got today i know you
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:18.520]  continue to buy large amounts of gold and silver when it's lower so that as the market rises you
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:25.480]  can offer people deals at spot or below spot that are unprecedented and it's first come first serve
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:31.320]  folks they have had people there all weekend the phones are melting down ted has got 25 brokers
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:37.960]  who's trying to hire more uh they have never had uh you know this type of uh uh response because
[2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.440]  people are finally getting it ted yeah that's true as a matter of fact we sold out of walkers
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:46.360]  so i have to move over to the dimes at this particular time they're currently a dollar
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:53.400]  60 or 1600 per $100 face we still have however the british sovereigns at 247 and we have the
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:58.920]  francs at 198 i can tell you right now that there is a lot of demand coming in not only just from
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:03.320]  your audience alex but the whole world right now is looking at gold and silver and there's just
[2:19:03.320 --> 2:19:08.920]  simply not enough to go around the physical supply of silver is so tight that last time around we
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:12.600]  couldn't even sell i had to take everything off the marketplace that's right they can dummy up the
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:17.400]  price of gold but they can't dummy up the supply no exactly when you're trading futures it's all
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:21.320]  paper and you can watch it go up and down like that but when you're talking about actually getting
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:25.720]  the physicals uh there's not a whole lot of out there and available and so at this particular
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:30.840]  time i'm suggesting that people get as much as they can while the storm is brewing i mean but
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:34.760]  let's explain ted that's a super deal you're offering on gold and silver at those prices
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:38.360]  you don't stay there briefly because i want to come back with you and tim this is so important
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:43.080]  i want to come back for the listeners and explain to them regardless of if you get into metals or
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:47.800]  not the type of deals that ted is offering and and then more on what a depression will look

[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:13.880]  government getting involved in this stuff because we specifically set it aside for those reasons
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:19.640]  and it's it is a great deal I mean silver right now shooting up I'm picking up this stuff as it
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:25.960]  goes with today alone silver one up like crazy gold today gold went up over 30 bucks an ounce
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:32.120]  today just just on today's movement I mean just you know what we come up off of the 700s and it's
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:36.680]  and it's just shot up into the 900s well guess what a thousand and fifties right around the corner
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:41.640]  and that was last peak I can't say it enough when you have the secretary of the treasury
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:46.040]  and you have the chairman of the board of the federal reserve system right now telling you
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:51.720]  hey boys buckle it down on the hatches here if we got an economic storm it's for real this is real
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:56.360]  serious you have to do something and if you're looking at your stock portfolio and you're looking
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:01.720]  at your bonds and for god's sakes if you have annuities right now they're not insured get
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:08.520]  yeah that's key they are not the annuities are not insured the banks are not safe ladies and
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:16.040]  gentlemen and the fdic is almost out of its 50 billion to pay out to people needing their deposits
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:20.280]  and the bank failure is having begun we've had a few dozen and they're talking about a thousand
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:28.760]  conservatively now ladies and gentlemen it is very important to transfer money out of the bank
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:34.760]  into other assets and I believe gold and silver is is is what at least 10 20 percent
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:39.560]  of what your asset should be in and I would get into it before it explodes here's the toll free
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:44.840]  number to take advantage of the gold and silver offers that Ted has a day that are just insanely
[2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:53.960]  low prices 1-800-686-2237 and I mean Ted explain to people uh... you know when did you set this
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:59.720]  price this price is set at what level I I said I said it yesterday before the prices went up today
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:03.640]  I mean I'm always trying to put something together so we can talk about something and then just
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:08.840]  happens to be that the markets are cooperating so well so so you made this by when gold was it
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:15.080]  what it was what do I what we had 901 I guess it was right around that 870 range okay so when
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:21.960]  gold was 30 plus dollars lower is when you bought into this gold I mean even if you bought it at
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:28.360]  you know above those levels would be a great deal this is below what it's now trading for ladies
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:38.360]  and gentlemen that is the key 800-686-2237-800-686-2237 and it makes me feel good when people go out
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:43.880]  liberals go out and buy guns and take a shooting lesson and properly stow them makes me feel good
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:48.520]  when folks start eating organic stop using cell phones it makes me feel good when you get gold
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:53.160]  and silver I believe in this I believe in this company and I believe it's only going to go up
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:59.560]  but regardless it can't be devalued overnight like the dollar is and can be and so it gives you that
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:06.040]  sense of security and that's what this is all about 800-686-2237 if you're listening to this
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:11.480]  tonight at midnight there will still be people there at 10 11 to 9 if you want to call now the

[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:21.400]  long can you hold this at 30 something bucks below what it's trading I'm going to hold it till
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:26.440]  midnight tonight for sure and then if the markets cooperate we'll go ahead and do it again tomorrow

[2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:59.480]  they're they are going to kill the dollar they may remonetize it and call it something else
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:04.600]  or do something later but in the next four or five years gentlemen do you disagree with the
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:11.000]  fact the dollar's got to be toast that Alex with what's going on I mean we have the lead of the
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:15.080]  people that had the the value of the currency the federal reserve system they're saying the
[2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:21.000]  dollar is going to be toast that we have no choice but then do go in and continue to buy

[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:15.000]  your garden because it's toxic waste it's the same thing with depleted uranium they've got all
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:20.360]  these thousands and tens of thousands more than that millions of tons of it they got to put it
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:25.880]  somewhere it's very poisonous and radioactive so they put it into weapons it's hiding it in plain
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:33.880]  view and so we will discuss this today because you see fluoride is only a catchphrase or a
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:39.800]  a a a overall name that they were able to pass laws through congress for it's what goes along with
[2:34:39.800 --> 2:34:46.200]  what you know as fluoride in the water and that's what he is an expert on among other things and
[2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:52.680]  so we're very honored to have a roger d masters on with us today thanks for coming on professor
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:57.240]  it's my pleasure i thank you very much for inviting me i appreciate a great deal
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:01.400]  you bet how did somebody who was under leo strauss get into the work of trying to warn people about
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:10.920]  fluoride in the water well strauss was an amazing thinker uh and he wanted us to read a great book
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:16.840]  trying to find out what that writer whether it was so or played over whatever what he was really
[2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:22.840]  trying to say that might be true because the whole point about western civilization is that we're
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:28.520]  a civilization that uses science to try to find out what is nature and human nature what's the
[2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:35.240]  truth about it and after a certain time i realized i was teaching all these old books like played
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:43.800]  out so and that uh sometimes modern biology was in decor more modern science was showing that
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:49.880]  that uh what they were saying these books was false uh and i thought gee you know i gotta tell
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:57.320]  uh tell people that uh this book you know john lock saying that the brain is a blank slate well
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:02.040]  it's very very your brain is no blank slate it's much more complicated piece of meat than that
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:08.440]  but check i gotta explain that's wrong or research says humans originally individuals
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:12.600]  running around all alone in the state of nature and then i read about chimpanzees and oh they're
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:18.280]  not like that oh i gotta explain he was wrong and so i've been working on that for a long time
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:24.680]  and one thing leads to another uh how did you get into research on um at the end of the Manhattan
[2:36:24.680 --> 2:36:28.920]  project dumping it in the water supply i mean i want to start at the beginning and walk through
[2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:34.520]  that but first tell us what in your research uh led you to the mass chemical poisoning of the
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:43.400]  population what happened was i uh started thinking in just general terms about uh biology and human
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:50.520]  nature and i went to a conference and i heard a retired oil executive named red Hodges from
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:56.920]  california give a presentation on how violent criminals have high levels of either lead
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:05.240]  or manganese in their blood and this was very interesting to me that we were putting pollution
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:11.160]  in the environment never so led toys are bad and you know so what a pollution is bad but they
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:17.400]  don't talk about how it might change the chemistry of your brain and so decided to study that well
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:22.520]  that's the old saying of mad as a hatter because in the dying process they were using mercury and
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:29.160]  lead and things and so you'd be mad as a hatter oh sure sure and besides uh what what seems to
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:34.520]  have happened is that uh i mentioned this idea of a blank slate because uh there's this whole idea
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:38.440]  that well everything we do is stuff we learn and there's no reason for understanding biology
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:43.720]  because it's deterministic or something when really you would say what 80 percent is uh
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:50.440]  is nature instead of a nurture well i think that we ought to start just to forget that and look at
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:38:00.920]  the facts uh one of the things that mr. Strauss taught us uh he advised me uh when i finished my
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:07.880]  work i always teach as if it's a silent student class who knows more than you do he wasn't an
[2:38:07.880 --> 2:38:14.120]  ideologist himself some of the students were but if you imagine that i have to imagine that there's
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:20.120]  some of your listeners we're going to know more than i do and if i make mistakes i want them to
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:28.600]  correct me but if i think what makes our civilization special is this possibility of an open-minded
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:34.920]  study so that if the government says oh it's a great thing to fluoridate water and i come across
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:42.360]  the discovery wait a second what counts is which chemical you use and we gotta relook at that and
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:46.600]  not just use one word but say wait a second what are we actually doing what's the science of it
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:52.600]  so you're talking about kind of the private individual mass consciousness or private intelligence
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:59.320]  agency where where we all integrate our own research and and then almost have our own private
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:05.960]  research going on which then brings it all to a higher level so so let's get to the point when
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:14.840]  you bump in let me explain how i got into this that is uh i i started to look at pollution with
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:21.160]  lead and manganese and i had to figure out well what does lead do to the brain now lead has an
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:27.720]  effect on a particular chemical in the brain a neurotransmitter called dopamine and uh if you
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:34.760]  have uh a disturbance dopamine is the is the chemical that works all the centers of your brain
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:41.160]  they're involved in making judgments it controls impulsiveness until you decide what's a good thing
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:49.400]  to do and so i realized that there was a science about this that americans had to know about
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:58.760]  because if americans don't know why lead is bad or why manganese is bad and they don't
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:03.800]  know that pollution means that a company says oh it's too expensive to clean up this pollution
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:11.400]  but they're poisoning the kids and i so i say well how is that how is it poisoning the kids
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.320]  and so i began to do studies and a simple study uh where there are some counties in the united
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:22.280]  states for the epa reports there's lead pollution and other counties where they report there's
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:27.880]  manganese pollution i said well what kind of behavior do we is is connected with lead
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:33.720]  pollution that uh we can measure well i remember oh red heart just said violent crime right
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:38.040]  well we got good data on violent crime you know we keep track of how many people kill other people
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:42.840]  and so you can take the data on where areas i have more lead contamination and then you look at the
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:47.880]  areas where they have crime statistics and voila they lay over each other quite nicely don't they
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:53.160]  absolutely and to give you one example of that which is just fantastic we did something that was
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:41:00.520]  right when we banned lead gasoline because when we banned lead gasoline it had the effect of
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:07.560]  reducing the crime rate but not right away crime rate dropped in 1991 it was when the first generation
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:15.000]  of kids whose mothers weren't exposed to lead when they were pregnant and they weren't exposed anymore
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:19.800]  because so much because there was no more lead gas and that first generation when they got to be
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:24.760]  17 or 18 their criminal behavior just dropped way off and for those that don't know in the 70s
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:30.280]  and 80s it was just liquor store robberies murder the murder rate was a lot higher i mean it was
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:35.800]  really dangerous absolutely and the cars were driving around shooting lead out the back that's
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:41.400]  right which which makes me violent in every thousands of studies sure but you i discovered
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:46.360]  there are lots of other things for instance if you live in a community with a lot of old housing
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:54.840]  it's lead paint in the both the inside and outside of the old housing and people point out that
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:42:01.000]  kids find the taste of lead paint sweet so they're more likely that the tip of paint actually something
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:08.040]  to eat it but it's also true that for instance in the the the ninth ward in orleans which was
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:13.880]  repeatedly terribly violent must have heard of that uh there's a scientist down there uh
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:19.000]  who did some work and he found out that uh the big source of lead and the kids down there the ninth
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.600]  ward was the grass strip between the sidewalk and the street if the lead gas came out of those
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:30.120]  cars back back before lead gas was was banned as particles in the atmosphere it dropped in the
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:34.680]  ground and it's inert it just stays there forever until so it gets in the grass and the grass is
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:38.840]  wet one day and kids running down the street and falls down and they put his hand in the grass
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:45.320]  and i think he licks his hand before you know he's got the lead in his body uh that is you have to
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:50.120]  realize that there are many ways you can drive as i put it there's many ways to drive from
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:55.160]  boston to chicago and uh there's many ways that a toxic chemical can can get into kids
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:43:03.560]  and if we get at this we can cut down the cost of two things three things actually that are
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:10.120]  important first learning disabilities especially at about 15 grand a year per kid on some estimates
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:16.680]  i got evidence that these toxic chemicals increase the rates of learning disabilities
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:24.520]  well obviously let me let me stop you i mean lead arsenic mercury fluoride professor and
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:28.760]  of course we should add you want a lot of international awards for your research groundbreaking
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:33.240]  and now i'm just accepted you know basically as as fact because it is but they knew up 200
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:39.240]  years ago that lead mercury had all sorts of problems made you go insane you know they knew
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:44.680]  100 years ago uh what fluoride uh did i mean fc university of texas studies and german studies
[2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:52.520]  from 80 90 100 years ago so i mean here you are discovering that this really is increasing
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:58.200]  crime and antisocial behavior and a dumbing down but but now let's look at why they decided to
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:05.080]  put it in the water so i want i want to raise a question for you with what you just said
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:17.160]  it's not so clear that fluoride itself is always the problem uh i bet uh you know somebody who
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:24.600]  uses toothpaste sodium fluoride in it yes uh and this uh you have to have an awful lot of fluoride
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:30.440]  that to cause a problem and obviously if you have too much of anything get above a certain level
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:36.520]  it's really bad news but see that's the thing professor people don't know that the word fluoride
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:40.280]  is a cover all for dumping hundreds of things in the water so maybe we should
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:44.600]  get to that and then break down the history of it but but go ahead all right well look the
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:52.680]  the main thing is that uh in putting fluoride in the water uh instead of sodium fluoride most
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:58.920]  of it over 90 percent of it uses uh one of two chemicals either something called fluorosyllicic
[2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:04.520]  acid which has got two atoms of hydrogen and silicon and six atoms of fluoride or sodium
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:10.920]  silico fluoride which is two atoms of sodium silicon and six fluorides that's a more complicated
[2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:17.240]  compound than sodium fluoride which is sort of one sodium one fluoride and the sodium fluoride
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:24.120]  was first tested it was tested for safety you put that in the water the the fluoride and the and
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.720]  the fluorine and the and the sodium uh atoms separate the if the fluorine sticks to your teeth
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:36.760]  the evidence was at the time that it toughens the surface to your teeth so it cuts down uh
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:44.040]  it's supposed to cut down uh uh cavities now the whole problem with these other chemicals
[2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:49.400]  generally called silico fluorides is that they have this other chunk to them the the two hydrogens
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:56.520]  the silicon and actually one or two fluorides is it's a chemical chemist I work with everything
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:01.640]  in this is done with a chemist named Marquis Copeland I really owe him a great deal because
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:07.400]  he's the one who got me started on looking at fluoride compounds he calls it an oligomer of
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:15.400]  solicic acid the fancy word but just saying there's a chemical there that's left over after you put
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:21.000]  the silico fluoride into the water and so the real question is why are we put them in the water
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:26.600]  and so I'm going to ask you a question what agency of the federal government do you think
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:33.480]  decided to design the idea and got people to start putting a fluoride compound not fluoride it's a
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:40.520]  fluoride compound in water support the department of uh energy after they had uh you know had all
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:46.360]  these millions of tons of toxic waste piled up and they had some spills in Tennessee and other
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:53.400]  places that killed some of the rivers actions before that well I know that it was department
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.800]  of energy that went around all the cities and lobbied everybody but but i mean go ahead give
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:05.960]  us the history professor the history goes back to uh uh world war two yeah the manhattan project
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:11.880]  but i'm saying after because actually the people's back before that because okay well tell us the
[2:47:11.880 --> 2:47:16.120]  whole history then that's why we've got you here you're the expert on this well well the history
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:22.200]  begins actually uh with Einstein coming to the United States and writing that letter to Roosevelt
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:29.720]  about possibility of making this bomb make a huge explosion you know Einstein wrote Roosevelt a letter
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:36.600]  about the possibility of having a nuclear bomb then the Germans took over Czechoslovakia called
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:42.280]  the answer that was one of the two triggered world war two but when the when the Nazis wanted
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:49.320]  Czechoslovakia why they picked that place they occupied the place with the best uranium in Europe
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:58.600]  now one thing we forget is that when Einstein came to the United States as a brilliant physicist
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:05.400]  there are other brilliant physicists who stayed in Germany like Max Planck yeah and Hitler began
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:13.240]  a uh a nuclear weapons project uh now in fact we know two things about that which we're mentioning
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:19.560]  because i want the audience to have in mind that this is all secret during world war two
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:24.920]  this question of whether Hitler had the bomb whether we were we didn't want anybody know we
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:29.160]  were working on a bomb well he really did we only had enough to test one at the end of them
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:34.360]  near the end of the war they did that secret deal i'm sure you know about this professor with the
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:44.200]  U-boat trading um in exchange for safety in South America but sure but but the question is first of all
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:55.640]  uh what we uh what what uh is not generally known is that uh there's a question why Hitler
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:49:01.640]  didn't make more progress with the great physicist and there's a rumor it's never been proved we have
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:08.360]  no evidence for it it's it's a guess that some nuclear physicist and perhaps the great physicist
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:14.840]  Heisenberg arranged for the experiments to fail because they didn't want Hitler to have
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:24.280]  one the one thing we do know is that Hitler had a huge supply of uranium that he had separated
[2:49:24.280 --> 2:49:29.240]  you have to separate uranium from other elements and rock a little difficult to enrich it you know
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:33.880]  all this stuff we hear about the centrifuges now you have to do something to make the uranium
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:42.200]  into a state where it can cause a bomb and Hitler put his uranium in a place in Norway called
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:47.160]  penamon where he put the uranium in something called heavy water which was which absorbs
[2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:52.040]  radiation so it couldn't explode they were sure what to do with their uranium so it wouldn't have
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:56.200]  an accident and they didn't want to be in Germany because they're afraid we'd bomb it so they put
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:00.680]  it in Norway and so they sent in US forces that followed it when it went across the the lake on
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:07.320]  the barge and sunk it that's right so we destroyed his uranium and that set that whole thing way back
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:14.440]  uh Hitler himself was apparently not as that is their summer report that he wasn't as interested
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.560]  in that as some of the scientists anyway so uh we were lucky I suppose on that score but
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:23.720]  well have you seen the german maps on what their a bomb is going to do to manhattan but it was so
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:28.040]  late in the war they decided the US would annihilate them with conventional weapons so they made a deal
[2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:33.880]  do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:38.280]  is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line it is uranium and that
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:45.000]  set that whole thing way back uh Hitler himself was apparently not as that is their summer report
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:50.920]  that he wasn't as interested in that as some of the scientists anyway so uh we were lucky I suppose
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:55.480]  on that score but let me see in the german maps on what their a bomb is going to do to manhattan
[2:50:55.480 --> 2:50:59.480]  but it was so late in the war they decided the US would annihilate them with conventional weapons
[2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:05.480]  so they made a deal do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:10.200]  future is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement
[2:51:10.200 --> 2:51:14.600]  savings account do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:19.000]  some or all of your hard earned savings you can turn adversity into opportunity good your

[2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:30.280]  hey
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:41.960]  roger masters is our guest a lot of his material is published online is a top academic and professor
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:48.440]  at dartmouth school of government department of government with an lsn a rockefeller professor
[2:53:48.440 --> 2:53:59.240]  of government chair basically and uh he was under the head honcho the neocons leo strauss
[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:04.760]  before he leaves us all get him to diverge and get a little bit into that but uh he he got into
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:08.760]  researching what is fluoride one of the different types of fluoride why is it being put in the water
[2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:15.480]  we now have all these studies from all over the world what it does and boy it is it is not pretty
[2:54:15.480 --> 2:54:19.080]  but he doesn't want to get into that issue he just wants to get into why it was put there
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:23.960]  and so uh okay but please continue you've gotten up to the uh german atomic program
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:28.360]  i want to get through why it was put there and focus on what it does i want to spend most of
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:34.440]  this time on what it does just i want to explain though that uh the start of putting any fluoride
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:40.840]  water was super secret because the Manhattan project had a problem in the 1940s they didn't
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:49.560]  want anybody to know how far advanced we were in making the bomb and we only had very poor
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:55.800]  level of a supply of uranium in the united states it's in rocks and you kind of grant rocks that
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:55:03.880]  you have to break break down and grind up and then put an acid in to separate the various elements
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:09.080]  and so it's a little bit complicated to get the uranium out compared to what Hitler had in
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:15.800]  uh in Czechoslovakia and uh the consequence of that is that you had a waste product that
[2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:23.960]  was a very powerful acid and the scientist who was responsible for the machinery to separate
[2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:31.800]  out that that toxic acid from the sludge then they Byron Copeland chemical engineer brilliant
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:37.880]  chemical engineer when he heard that i was doing work on on how love and manganese caused crime
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  or was associated with crime he got in touch and said do i know anything about silico fluoride
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:49.400]  i said i didn't find anything i never even heard and so i did all the work with him this is all
[2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:55.080]  of research project that comes from somebody else telling me oh i wasn't paying attention to
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:56:01.240]  something important and he knew about that because he was the chemical engineer involved in the whole
[2:56:01.240 --> 2:56:06.760]  process and so everything i say is the result of what two people have done
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:11.000]  is i've been working with somebody else and i should tell you one thing
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:19.160]  mike is a kind of scientist who isn't afraid of saying run a phone call like this and he'll say
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:23.880]  hey roger shut up and listen to me because i've made a mistake in chemistry and i make mistakes
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:30.680]  in chemistry i rely on him uh science is about being able to engage in discussion and so you
[2:56:30.680 --> 2:56:36.600]  should stop me anytime when i get into the facts of the case uh that i've discovered and and
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:43.960]  say what do i mean or why about what about what and so forth uh still the big thing is that uh
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:51.000]  because putting fluoride in water was had to be secret so people in germany or came in and
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:57.400]  didn't know how much uranium we were processing everybody talked about putting fluoride in water
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:03.240]  and the manhattan project started by putting manhattan putting sodium fluoride which is the
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:07.480]  simple thing we have in toothpaste in a couple of places they compared two towns in new york and
[2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:13.560]  there was no problem and once they got it proved they switched and they then they could dump
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:21.240]  glosalic acid into a water supply because they were assuming that it would dissolve or dissociate
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:29.080]  into its elements and since they assume it literally the approval was based on the assumption
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:33.240]  that all of the fluoride would come off the molecule without any reference to the rest of
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:39.160]  the molecule now let's be specific you can have all the secret operations you want but if you've
[2:57:39.160 --> 2:57:45.720]  got uh you know so many thousand drums of this byproduct at this plant the germans can come
[2:57:45.720 --> 2:57:51.480]  take photographs of it observe it and then know how much uh of the isotopes you need that you're
[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:58.520]  able to extract so they quote secretly start dumping it in the water and uh then they fit
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:03.160]  at the end of the war they've got to get rid of the toxic waste so they just say ah it's nutritious
[2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:11.880]  we'll be right back with our guests in just 70 seconds stay with us thank you for listening to gca
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:19.080]  so many thousand drums of this byproduct at this plant the germans can come take photographs of
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:25.160]  it observe it and then know how much uh of the isotopes you need that you're able to extract
[2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:31.400]  so they quote secretly start dumping it in the water and uh then they fit the end of the war
[2:58:31.400 --> 2:58:37.400]  they've got to get rid of the toxic waste so they just say ah it's nutritious we'll be right back
[2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:44.200]  with our guests in just 70 seconds stay with us thank you for listening to gcn
[2:58:44.200 --> 2:59:00.200]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:59:00.200 --> 2:59:07.400]  government it's known as the builder bird but their objective being world domination for thousands
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:14.040]  of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream
[2:59:14.040 --> 2:59:17.240]  of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:26.840]  for the first time in history the elites plan for and corruption alex jones on the gcn radio
[2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:41.320]  network we're about to give us a key of this interview and that is
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:48.840]  this the name fluoride blurring the whole debate when we're not talking about fluoride and as my
[2:59:48.840 --> 2:59:52.840]  guest was saying during the break to me he said look it's not true there hasn't been a lot of
[2:59:52.840 --> 2:59:57.960]  studies of what's actually being put in the water there's been studies of sodium fluoride alone
[2:59:57.960 --> 3:00:04.840]  he's actually absolutely right uh the studies show that sodium fluoride alone and you know he
[3:00:04.840 --> 3:00:12.200]  could differ but the studies show increases in bone cancers and males calcification of glands but then
[3:00:12.200 --> 3:00:15.720]  he's gonna come back and say well those are studies calling it fluoride but it's really
[3:00:15.720 --> 3:00:18.840]  this other chemical compound that's a mixture of fluoride other things so
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:25.320]  uh you know really one of the world experts on this with the chemist top chemist he's been working
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:31.240]  with uh please continue sir let's get right into it okay well look well let me start explaining
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:38.600]  things very simply uh this silica fiber breaks down first of all it has the effect which is
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:46.360]  very big of increasing the amount of lead that a child will absorb if he's living in an old house
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:52.520]  with lead paint or any place in the environment where there's lead so we did some studies uh
[3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:59.000]  in places where there was evidence of children's blood level by the community where they lived
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:04.680]  three big samples one in massachusetts by county one in new york state by county
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:08.440]  and then the national health nutrition and evaluation survey is a third study
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:16.920]  and three different big huge samples uh you know one of 400,000 kids and you just do statistical
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:25.000]  analysis okay what's the average level a percent of kids for instance who have more than uh what was
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:30.840]  the the uh conventional level of danger which is 10 micrograms per deciliter that is how many
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:36.680]  kids have high blood lead or what's the average blood lead what we found is that where there's
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:43.720]  silico fire in the water taking everything into consideration like economics and race and everything
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:49.160]  else where there's silico fire in the water there's more lead in the kids and it's partly because
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:57.800]  silico silicon is a complicated atom but combines a lot of other things and uh the chemistry of that
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:02.440]  is that's not my business my what my business is the effects of it and all the statistics
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:09.080]  they involve taking lots of things into consideration and what we then found was that oh where there's
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:15.560]  pollution with lead if there's also silico fluoride in the water compared to where there's
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:22.680]  pollution with lead and no silico fluoride oh where there's lead and silico fluoride
[3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:34.120]  that adds another roughly speaking another 100 or 150 uh violent crimes for every 100,000 people
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:40.200]  drinking the water amazing now interviewing chemists and doctors on this subject they describe
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:44.600]  fluoride and the different variants of that's why prozac's made out of it and some of the things
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:49.960]  is amazing because it's electrically basically charged and it just binds to everything it goes
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:55.640]  through everything it's really an active volatile thing to put that in dumb down layman's terms is
[3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:03.880]  that accurate uh my concern is not with the fluoride it's with this other chemical and the
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:09.800]  point is that this other chemical silico fluoride when you put them in the water the german study
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:17.240]  by westendorf in 1975 the only major study in the literature and it showed it had big effects on
[3:03:17.240 --> 3:03:23.880]  brain chemistry okay so separately uh okay we keep calling it fluoride but there's a different
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:29.960]  family of different compounds what are they putting in the water in the cities over 90 percent of
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:36.360]  water fluoridation uses one of these two silico fluorides either frosalic acid which is a liquid
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:42.440]  or sodium silico fluoride which is very close uh closely resembles it but it's it's solid and
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:49.480]  it's in petals in petals but these silico fluorides are totally different from sodium fluoride
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:57.160]  and they have these harmful effects on children or adults and they have never been tested
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:04.680]  the key thing first of all that they've never been tested don't take that's not my word the
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:12.040]  national toxicology program in 2002 nominated these two chemicals for study on the ground
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:16.840]  their toxicology was not known that is the the study of how they harm the brain or the body
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:22.280]  was not known but it is known that they harm stay there stay there a quick break we'll be right back
[3:04:22.280 --> 3:04:35.160]  professor cameras are everywhere above stoplights on top that they've never been tested don't take
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:42.920]  that's not my word the national toxicology program in 2002 nominated these two chemicals
[3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:48.280]  for study on the ground their toxicology was not known that is the study of how they harm the brain

[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:16.920]  the enemy bin laden this is his ammo we have to look to the middle east we have to look to his
[3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:22.120]  home of bin laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:27.080]  to intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:33.960]  israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s. i'm aware that some israeli
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:39.720]  citizens have been detained in laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the

[3:06:57.320 --> 3:07:07.160]  are with the terrorists are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming but it will be
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:13.720]  available sometime in the future at laze med ink the future is here now it's cancer's turn to die
[3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:19.480]  with our patented methodology without cutting bleeding drugs or damaging radiation we can kill
[3:07:19.480 --> 3:07:24.920]  skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side
[3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:38.840]  effects at our outpatient facility today big brother mainstream media government cover ups you
[3:07:38.840 --> 3:07:48.440]  want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas
[3:07:48.440 --> 3:08:10.120]  this is really important information ladies and gentlemen i've got some more vital information
[3:08:10.120 --> 3:08:14.440]  it'll be a surprise the bottom of the hour after our guest leaves us we got to move quick professor
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:19.080]  because we've only got about 21 minutes left with you i think we're prison planet dot tv viewers
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:23.800]  and info wars dot com listeners though i'm going to skip this next break coming up because this is
[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:29.880]  so important and i've also got one of your studies here the silico fluorides and higher blood lead
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:36.760]  a national problem that particularly harms blacks this is online as well so before you leave
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:41.960]  on people to be able to go and read for themselves the different studies that you and your colleagues
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:48.120]  have done okay continuing now we kind of skipped ahead here when did they decide to put these two
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:53.960]  different chemical compounds that they use publicly the other cover story is its fluoride
[3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:59.400]  but it's even more than that and then the studies that it's binding other heavy metals bringing
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:06.280]  things in you know the reports i've got to is that they also took you know other compounds
[3:09:06.280 --> 3:09:11.320]  of toxic waste and called it fluoride and put that directly into the water so i mean you know
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:14.600]  get all the key points for us place or understand it's academic and there's
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:19.720]  different facets to each little sub area but give us an overview i'll have to commit that i don't
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:25.400]  know some of the things that you have mentioned at all uh maybe it's just the professors that
[3:09:25.400 --> 3:09:33.720]  could come in but well our focus on is that but once we started to get rid of this waste from
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:42.600]  separating uranium from the rock uh and decided to throw that in the water supply uh because it
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:49.240]  was assumed that that they would all come apart and uh it was never tested as i said the national
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:09:56.840]  toxicology program in 2002 formerly nominated a chemical to be studied because it's how toxic
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:01.560]  it was wasn't really understood how it worked now what two years ago it's since the 40s well
[3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:06.280]  it started in the 40s putting it in the water what i was going to say uh they're just now
[3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:11.160]  looking at studying and thanks to your work and others but what two years ago the american dental
[3:10:11.160 --> 3:10:15.800]  association said children shouldn't be brushing their teeth with fluoride until they're what six
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:24.680]  or seven well one of the things that has been a problem is that the american dental association
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:33.240]  and the am a have repeatedly spoken about fluoridation as good and they have not dealt with the fact
[3:10:33.960 --> 3:10:40.360]  that uh there were no studies of the safety of these chemical fluoride all the studies were
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:46.280]  on the safety of sodium fluoride now let's be clear so it's it's as if i tell you well it's
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:51.880]  a good thing to to have uh let's say a calcium pill in the morning so here's another pill and
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.520]  it turns out to have arsenic in it well you know you know because some one thing is good doesn't
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:01.880]  mean another thing is good exactly they say milk is good but it isn't milk it's it's battery acid
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:05.800]  the kids are drinking you know i mean and so let's say sodium fluoride is good for your teeth and
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:11.160]  good for you which there are studies on it shows they're not uh but but regardless let's just say
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:18.200]  it's good what you're saying is what we're hearing as quote fluoridation isn't even that at all and
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:25.320]  the studies are clear it's it's bad they just don't know why and now that's being looked at uh yeah
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:35.160]  and let me give a some concrete numbers uh when you have lead in the water uh or in the environment
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:40.920]  the pollution in the environment there's a higher higher lead in the kids but when you have the
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:50.520]  silico fluoride it goes up so that uh just the lead alone that increases the lead in in in kids
[3:11:50.520 --> 3:11:59.640]  blood okay it's about uh the measure of uh isn't micrograms per deciliter it's about one of those
[3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:06.840]  measures is is is is increased by by lead alone the silico fluorides boost these these other
[3:12:06.840 --> 3:12:14.200]  poisons that's right it goes up in whites by another microgram per deciliter from about
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:20.920]  two point three to three point five in blacks it goes up about two and a half from five point
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:29.480]  five to eight that is it way increases the vulnerability of blacks oh it just so happens
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:34.840]  to herd blacks i'm sure that hurts the feelings of the eugenicist that happened to run our entire
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:40.280]  government well it look like let's let me not get into eugenicist and just get into science
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:46.680]  because okay the main the main thing is that the effects of lead include learning disabilities
[3:12:46.680 --> 3:12:55.320]  substance abuse and violent behavior oh because lead destroys the ability of the brain chemicals
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:13:02.040]  that it that inhibit your behavior just slows down your impulsiveness the the brain chemicals
[3:13:02.040 --> 3:13:06.760]  aren't working right if you've got a lot of lead in your system but if you have a lot if you have
[3:13:06.760 --> 3:13:13.080]  a lot of it it'll kill you but mad as i ever when i was on the get the lead out of vermont task force
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:19.640]  the government task force in vermont we looked at this uh tradition of saying that well i only get
[3:13:19.640 --> 3:13:24.680]  worried if there's over 10 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood and we thought there was no
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:31.240]  level of lead in the blood that was completely without action and we lowered the state the
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:37.400]  the state level of concern from 10 to 5 because where you have a silico fluorides then the whole
[3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:43.160]  scale has to be changed because it boosted how much does it right now i don't know i know you
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:47.080]  were just giving us the numbers professor but give us those numbers again let's say you've got a
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:54.600]  caucasian versus a negroid uh you know in the same city with a set amount and then and then and then
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:14:08.280]  give us the differences there well if you take the uh right kids who have uh both silico fluoride
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:15.080]  and lead they got about three and a half from from two people two people or something like that
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:22.360]  the black kids it goes up from five and a half to eight so that blacks are just much more vulnerable
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:30.200]  partly this is poverty uh and it's calcium in particular but and lots of other things
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:34.920]  the chemistry of the body well other studies on that i mean i mean i'm so you're saying it's the
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:41.800]  diets of the blacks or is it on average the the metabolic difference when i do these studies
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:46.520]  i'm just doing population studies to find out where it's bad but certainly you've had other
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:52.600]  scientists contact you that have an idea why it's so much more worse for blacks when when we take
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:58.360]  the best evidence we've got and look at the difference between poor kids and kids who have
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:04.520]  uh average or above average income so it's associated with the poor kids whether they're
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:08.600]  white or black whether they're exposed to silico fluoride or not it's always the poor kids who
[3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:15.480]  are most vulnerable to lead and those vulnerabilities are much worse for blacks and for everybody
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:19.320]  they're much worse with the silico fluoride well here's an example there's more diabetes in
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:25.880]  quote hispanics that have the you know uh native american uh bloodline and then certainly you know
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:31.880]  the cliche is true that quote natives can't drink as much whiskey as say a northern european who's
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:37.160]  had their development um you know generationally more drinking and of course that gets into you
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:41.800]  know development species but i i understand it's too many disciplines here and you're a scientist
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:45.560]  you like to or a professor who likes to look at the science and just go with what you have so
[3:15:45.560 --> 3:15:50.680]  you're saying it's not a genetic difference or you don't know between blacks and whites well
[3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:58.280]  actually the point is we think about genes versus environment the phrase genes versus environment
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:05.960]  is like saying when you write an answer in long division do you use the even numbers only when
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:12.840]  you write the answer or the odd numbers only you're going to say masters you idiot i use both
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:19.000]  even in odd numbers and i just say oh you can use both even in odd ones the point is that
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:24.360]  everything in life involves what are called interactions no i agree from the environment
[3:16:24.360 --> 3:16:28.200]  and that's the problem with most professors and academics and scientists is they do narrowly
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:33.960]  only look at one little area instead of that that that integration of the info that's what i'm trying
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:39.960]  to do with with my last years of research is to try and show how once you look at the integration
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:46.200]  sometimes you find there's one thing that's easy to change the message i want your listeners to hear
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:54.120]  is simple this stuff in the water has never been tested to safety turn it off and make sure it isn't
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:59.000]  put back in the water until it's tested and proven to be saved by utterly independent people and i
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:04.600]  don't mean the bureaucrats and government agencies because they like to cover up mistakes as i keep
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:08.840]  on asking people if it wasn't the last time you heard of a bureaucrat who admitted his pants
[3:17:08.840 --> 3:17:14.600]  were around his ankles well why is it that it's known that these fluoride compounds that are
[3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:23.160]  resemble prozac are being put in the water and it just accidentally does all of this and and then
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:27.480]  the original studies i saw and pulled surprise winning books from world war two is the soviets
[3:17:27.480 --> 3:17:34.600]  and germans believed different fluoride compounds had a calming effect but your studies and real
[3:17:35.160 --> 3:17:40.520]  you know peer reviewed studies show that actually it binds heavy metals and toxins that are associated
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:46.840]  with violent behavior because of suppression of well no but let me ask you a question because
[3:17:46.840 --> 3:17:50.920]  chemical chemical compounds that differ and when they differ they have different effects
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:56.840]  it's like my asking the question when i'm talking to students tell me if you drink scotch
[3:17:56.840 --> 3:18:01.080]  bourbon and vodka in the same night is that different than just drinking at one start
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:07.560]  yes i never know a student didn't admit that well mixing scotch bourbon and vodka was a
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:14.520]  very bad idea i tried it once my parents had a at a cocktail party when i was just going into
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:18.600]  my sophomore year high school they went out after the cocktail party left a lot of glasses around
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:24.600]  i decided to try them all at one night oh boy you should know i did morning boy i did the exact
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:29.800]  same thing a few times yeah i didn't dare tell my mother what happened but i thought i'd roll
[3:18:29.800 --> 3:18:37.480]  my head down the sidewalk ties uh but don't mix your drinks and in the same way when we mix chemicals
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:45.160]  we have effects that we don't have one at a time this is important because basically the government
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:51.880]  regulates the epa one thing at a time and is another thing which is just in the paper today
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:57.960]  about i think it's part of this there's a the epa has found a compound that seemed to be really
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:05.720]  dangerous and they wanted to have some rules on it and the white house intervened and changed
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:12.680]  the document to take some of the stuff out that's right now the white house now the white house is
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:18.680]  practicing medicine science they just decide on a whole host of issues we're going to skip this
[3:19:18.680 --> 3:19:22.920]  break with our guests we have a full 10 minutes left with him gotta go to m4wars.com be here this
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:27.640]  part of the M and FM stations we'll be back in just a few minutes uh roger d masters research
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:32.040]  professor at dartwood college is our guest more than seven okay i'm gonna skip this break and talk
[3:19:32.040 --> 3:19:38.280]  to him look bottom line i want to explain to the listeners out there uh and and and this is a fact
[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:42.920]  that that we're told it's just fluoridation when they can argue about that and then argue about
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:47.800]  what type of fluoride calcium stanis sodium that's mainly quote sodium they claim they put in the
[3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:52.680]  water but when you really look at it that's the same thing i see with du they got a toxic waste
[3:19:52.680 --> 3:19:56.840]  gotta get rid of it they just put in weapon systems and spread around everywhere or they've
[3:19:56.840 --> 3:20:04.200]  got to get rid of uh all the heavy metals and stuff uh that uh are left over from aluminum plants
[3:20:04.200 --> 3:20:10.040]  and also uh the the the manufacturer of different chemicals and and the breakdown of petrochemicals
[3:20:10.040 --> 3:20:15.480]  making gasoline and they just put that into lawn fertilizer and say well he doesn't get in our crops
[3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:20.680]  you don't put it on crops you eat uh but but but put it on your yard and it's lead and arsenic and
[3:20:20.680 --> 3:20:25.560]  all these toxins and your dog lays in it and its hair falls out and and but it still runs right
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:31.320]  into your aquifer so you drink it so i mean what i'm really interested in professor is this practice
[3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:38.280]  of claiming a dangerous expensive toxic waste that for the strategic reasons in the economy
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:43.320]  they want to de-list as a toxic waste and then they put you know use things as a cover
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:50.520]  to put it into and that's what i see is the story of uh chemicals they were using you know uh uh
[3:20:50.520 --> 3:20:56.440]  during the atomic bomb production any comments on that front for sure the the point is that
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:21:02.200]  when you think of humans say 200 000 years ago if you had some junk i suppose you might throw it
[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:09.080]  water and say well it'll float down the river and be gone but uh we now have a highly technical
[3:21:09.080 --> 3:21:13.960]  society they thought just throwing this in the water uh supply it would disappear and it would
[3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:19.080]  be gone but it turned out to be dangerous and let me let me give a couple of other statistics
[3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:27.080]  where this is in the water is higher rate of cocaine use now we measured that by the arrests
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:34.200]  the proportion of people who are uh when you arrest violent criminals who test positive for
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:42.120]  cocaine where there's uh where there's uh you can go from two people who are violent with uh
[3:21:44.440 --> 3:21:49.800]  two out of a thousand criminals testing positive for cocaine where there's no
[3:21:49.800 --> 3:21:58.680]  silico fluoride and and uh you go up by a couple where there uh there's silico fluoride and you
[3:21:58.680 --> 3:22:03.480]  go up by even a little bit more if there's both silico fluoride and lead so what i'm trying to
[3:22:03.480 --> 3:22:10.760]  get to is that we've got to put the dots together and be aware that when you have dangerous things
[3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:16.920]  don't use them until you've tested them for safety we think of that obviously if somebody starts
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:22.440]  selling a pill to cure a head cold but why is it any different for putting something in the water
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:27.720]  i mean you can brush your teeth for goodness sakes yeah that is the scientific community
[3:22:27.720 --> 3:22:34.520]  hasn't studied this and one thing to remember is einstein's advice about working in science
[3:22:35.400 --> 3:22:40.920]  he said uh that you had to be intelligent very very stubborn a chemical engineer is intelligent
[3:22:40.920 --> 3:22:49.320]  i'm just very stubborn but uh the critical thing here is that when you have a new idea what
[3:22:49.320 --> 3:22:54.440]  einstein pointed out is at first you're completely ignored nobody pays attention to you we've been
[3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:58.600]  working on this for over 10 years and at first absolutely nobody paid attention then you're
[3:22:58.600 --> 3:23:04.280]  attacked oh this is junk science this is foolish and then ultimately everybody's going to agree
[3:23:04.280 --> 3:23:10.120]  it's true that's what einstein had with relativity and i think once people begin to ask the question
[3:23:10.760 --> 3:23:15.960]  have you tested this stuff for safety what's the evidence of my website
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:30.520]  h2tp now pull it back back back slash w w w dot darkness dot edu darkness is dar t mo uth
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:40.520]  college dot edu slash now a little tilde r masters forward slash pin fo dot htm we're
[3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:53.080]  going back to the full audience here we go
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:56.920]  professor masters wants you to go to his website it's http
[3:23:57.560 --> 3:24:04.280]  colon forward slash forward slash w w dot dartmouth dot edu forward slash tilde r masters
[3:24:04.280 --> 3:24:11.400]  forward slash pin fo dot htm it's much easier just to type in roger d masters into google and
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:17.480]  it's the top link that comes up you can read his research papers and so much more um i mean this is
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:25.400]  a a a a nightmarish uh compound that they just accidentally decided out of the manhattan project
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:30.920]  to put in our water supplies it was all just an accident and it accelerates absorbing heavy
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:36.600]  metals and other toxins causes massive increases in the brain uh being drug addicted to cocaine
[3:24:36.600 --> 3:24:41.320]  he was just going all over the study numbers on that massive increases in violent crime
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:47.320]  it's it's it's all just an accident uh you know again it's a complete accident uh that
[3:24:47.320 --> 3:24:53.080]  any of this is going on and uh of course i'm being sarcastic but he just covers the scientific
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:57.560]  fact okay you were plugging your website as we came out of the break uh what do folks need to
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:04.360]  go there professor masters i was going to say that the uh the the website that uh
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:14.760]  i the way i usually say it is after the tilde r masters slash letters a h a b s slash uh at the
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:21.560]  very end so if you have trouble getting me with uh some thing at the end go back to to cut off the
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:27.160]  end so you get to the r masters slash and let us a h a b s and if that's the problem just go back to
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:31.880]  our man the tilde r masters i found the radio you try to give out long addresses doesn't work
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:38.280]  now folks need to google you know fluoride roger d masters and they will because i'm doing it here
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:43.320]  i'm testing it on google it's it's all you people can read the studies and see the information i've
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:48.200]  got to get you back up for a part two and really appreciate you doing this tirelessly to try to
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:52.680]  warn the public uh but you were making the point uh a few minutes ago and i want you to take us out
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:57.080]  with us any other points you want to make sir that this is forced medicating which something
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:01.480]  they know has bad effects but don't know the full bad effects of and you're saying needs to be taken
[3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:09.320]  out uh but i mean do you see that happening because you know i i see more and more uh of uh
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:15.640]  citizens were concerned and some people in the public area uh but i think one of our problems
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:22.200]  is the way we talk about they did this they did that they are human beings like us i think it's
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:28.040]  only fair to say that most of the people in the public health sphere don't know much about the
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:33.080]  details of this research it's not that one yeah they're compartmentalized they you know them and
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:38.680]  and and they will and and if you are in the medical profession and you've always been taught that
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:46.120]  fluoridation is a very good public staff you never heard of a difference between sodium fluoride
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:50.040]  and silico fluoride you think that fluoride is putting fluoride nobody puts pure fluorine in
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:55.400]  the water for a lot of technical reasons that my chemical a chemical colleague by copeland would
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:27:01.560]  explain uh but the key piece that please told me the key thing is that there's some new scientific
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:07.640]  evidence we've published in journals like neurotoxicology which is the best journal in the
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:13.400]  world on how chemical chemicals are in the brain how there's two papers in that uh so it's it's not
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:20.120]  just uh a funny professor from the ivy and if i'm wrong i want to know i'm wrong but i think the
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:28.760]  crucial thing is when in doubt for anything the farms health behavior stop doing it yeah i mean
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:34.360]  if they quote haven't studied it which is their official story why put it in when all the evidence
[3:27:34.360 --> 3:27:40.360]  the evidence shows it's uh not good for you but but but separately they have studied different
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:47.320]  types of fluoride and what it does and it calcifies bones causes bone fractures cancers
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:53.160]  radically shoot up in boys i mean you know just like all these studies on cell phones my god
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:57.800]  frying the testicles frying the brass frying any fast growing cells that have a lot of
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:04.280]  hormonal flux going on that are already uh you know leaning towards uh being places where you'll
[3:28:04.280 --> 3:28:10.840]  have a cancer problem i mean bottom line uh professor they know what's going on at the top
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:17.000]  you're right people mid-level and different compartments don't uh but uh i mean look how
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:22.280]  much trouble they go to to keep them to keep this stuff in the water i guess it's because they love us
[3:28:22.280 --> 3:28:28.280]  no i think i think a lot of it is simply that people don't like to admit that
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:35.960]  that is a lot of this is just people want to have the idea you're in a bureaucracy
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:42.440]  and a bureaucrat kind of territorial animal he owns his desk and you better not get near it
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:47.320]  you've got a bunch of things and he's in charge of that and that's his stuff now my experience
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:53.080]  in the army is was that uh copy your ass well i i think is i think actually we ought to go back
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:58.440]  and having a draft so because i think we normally we try to admit military manpower but it's a very
[3:28:58.440 --> 3:29:04.120]  good thing for people to discover first of all the country has to have people to protect them hold
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:07.560]  on i'm going to skip this break too i'm going to do three more minutes with our guests for
[3:29:07.560 --> 3:29:23.320]  listening on info wars dot com okay uh professor you're there right yeah i look in closing i want
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:29.080]  to get you back up on all these issues but but i wanted to talk to you about leo strauss the
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:35.640]  injustice defies the means uh what do you think of the fruit of leo strauss in the neocones
[3:29:35.640 --> 3:29:45.480]  the leo strauss wasn't a neocone he was a believer in the need to to read a great writer in the past
[3:29:45.480 --> 3:29:51.000]  a great writer like like played out to try and figure out what he was trying to say or maccubelli
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:55.640]  or maccubelli and you had to figure out when you're going to read maccubelli you have to realize
[3:29:55.640 --> 3:30:06.360]  uh does everything he says on the surface of it have some meaning it's a little subtle
[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:11.800]  that's not trivial maccubelli the year before he wrote the prince he was tortured for a full year
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:16.120]  and in jail because there was a change of government he'd been a government official
[3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:21.960]  there was a no no i mean it was a very rebellious thing to do to put out a blueprint of the uh
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:28.120]  uh the black nobility's uh uh the tactics he was letting out this the trade secrets
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:33.880]  no he wasn't at all what he was trying well i got something i got something he was a very
[3:30:33.880 --> 3:30:38.040]  baggy but he was a very devious man i've written i've studied a lot well i mean i've read both
[3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:42.760]  his books but that's it but i mean i i mean i take away from it uh that uh you know he was
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:47.000]  just kind of pissed off locked up in his house kind of you know spilling the beans are you saying
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:53.800]  it was propaganda against people no no no he was worried because he saw all right i'll put it
[3:30:53.800 --> 3:31:01.560]  bluntly maccubelli thought christianity as a religion was bad because it denied the natural
[3:31:01.560 --> 3:31:07.400]  desires like sex sinful he was satan he thought that was a bad thing to do he was not well he thought
[3:31:07.400 --> 3:31:13.800]  the church was corrupt he was trying to encourage people to go back to secular government that
[3:31:13.800 --> 3:31:19.560]  separated religion from politics we now do and take for granted they don't do that in the muslim
[3:31:19.560 --> 3:31:25.880]  world all the time right so uh we we better remember that there was a time even in western history
[3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:33.560]  when the church had essentially a lot of political power yeah so it's kind of a pre kind of a
[3:31:33.560 --> 3:31:41.560]  pre-illuminati type deal no he what he was trying to do is to figure out a way to get back to the
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:45.800]  frame of reference of pagan antiquity that's what i just said he thought to do that with the
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:52.600]  shocked people i know pagan antiquity that's what the illuminati wants well uh all i'm saying is
[3:31:52.600 --> 3:31:59.400]  that he thought he was a republican he believed in republican government uh but but utterly secular
[3:31:59.400 --> 3:32:05.320]  republican government so you like maccubelli i think he's a very very powerful thinker because
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:10.600]  he makes you ask questions about things you don't want to ask questions about sure that's
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:16.920]  a sharp try to teach us sure the hypocrisy of the time yum if you ask questions about things
[3:32:17.560 --> 3:32:21.480]  the the crucial thing for me is not what some thinker in the past said or didn't say
[3:32:21.480 --> 3:32:26.840]  but how you can use that to learn how to read a book to read science hold on professor hold on
[3:32:26.840 --> 3:32:31.720]  hold on yet i mean appears to the core of things through the propaganda i got you hold on let's
[3:32:31.720 --> 3:32:42.120]  do one more minute here i got into uh straussian ideas or the professor saying he's not a neocon
[3:32:44.280 --> 3:32:49.480]  whatever he hatched that he he's the pretender of it and i brought up maccubelli and the professor
[3:32:49.480 --> 3:32:54.840]  got very uh possessive i think is the word and like i'm an expert on maccubelli he was disagreeing
[3:32:54.840 --> 3:32:59.480]  with me and i'm sure he's right about the main uh you know reason maccubelli wrote those books
[3:32:59.480 --> 3:33:05.560]  i mean i read them like 15 20 years ago uh the point is uh and i've seen more modern forms of
[3:33:05.560 --> 3:33:10.440]  subterfuge more subtle he was saying that he wanted us to go back to pagan antiquity and
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:15.800]  something more pure i guess and that's what i was saying the illuminati and you know all those
[3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:19.240]  guys that you know that came a few hundred years later that's what they said they were doing you
[3:33:19.240 --> 3:33:24.600]  were kind of saying no no no i mean i said i was saying the illuminati you said pagan antiquity
[3:33:24.600 --> 3:33:31.080]  uh you know i guess kind of this do as thou wilt or or see through all the bs conventions
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:38.280]  i mean i mean expound on that for us oh the point is that maccubelli was a friend of something
[3:33:38.280 --> 3:33:45.960]  named leonardo da Vinci when he was in power in the republic of florida he tried with leonardo
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:53.160]  to design a loop to change the the the road the the bed of the river arno to make the city of
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:34:02.520]  florida a seaport because with the discovery of america 1492 the idea of making florida a seaport
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:09.560]  which could then engage in transatlantic trade was very attractive and maccubelli
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:16.520]  as as a politician thought that was a very important thing he got leonardo da Vinci to
[3:34:16.520 --> 3:34:22.040]  design this thing it would have worked except that the engineers grouped up and it failed but
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:27.800]  maccubelli was interested in connecting science and public policy and that's something that the
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:33.640]  people who read maccubelli don't know because they don't pay enough attention to read him very carefully
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:40.680]  no i don't i remember seeing that talking about how basically a bunch of twittering uh you know
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:47.720]  people uh religionist were blocking progress and you're talking about the renaissance aren't you
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:53.080]  oh yeah but i mean i wrote i wrote a couple of my book maccubelli leonardo and the science
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:35:01.320]  power which i tried to deal with how maccubelli and leonardo represent two aspects of the beginning
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:07.960]  of modern society modern society is is unique in the world this would be the idea of using science
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:13.320]  the way we use science and we take it for granted uh don't realize that the way we take science for
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:18.200]  granted is in a lot of a lot of people elsewhere in the world living in the middle east it's all
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:23.560]  heresy well understand tell me about this going back to the pagan roots tell tell me about that
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:32.760]  well the the main point is that maccubelli thought he had to understand human nature as best you could
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:40.280]  without reading it through the filter of some book by somebody else yeah getting it from the
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:46.680]  some religion getting it from the oracles and and in particular he was worried about the way in
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:54.280]  which the christian view of original sin going back to the hebrew view in the bible of original
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:36:01.880]  sin raised questions about things that were utterly natural and the the the point of this
[3:36:01.880 --> 3:36:12.360]  is st paul wrote these letters and and claimed that the word of jesus as god had to be sent to
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:22.360]  all tribes all nations that was what st paul said what did what did maccubelli realize
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:25.800]  when america was future realized that this wasn't just an island it was a continent
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:30.440]  maccubelli was the first thinker to know there was a continent between europe and asia
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:36.920]  because he's a secretary his assistant augustino vestige was a miracle vestige cousin
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:42.840]  and so he knew right away that there was this whole continent where people had never heard
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:50.440]  about christianity well how could god have been just because according to medieval christianity
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:55.960]  no i understand not baptized you stayed in purgatory forever what kind of justice would god have if
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:01.160]  you left those people in this continent in purgatory forever with no chance at no no i understand
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:06.040]  the whole argument that's the induction under the illuminati speech i understand all that i mean
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:10.200]  listen we got to get you back up i didn't know you wrote a book about that professor and we
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:16.040]  appreciate you coming on to explain to us that it's something far more complex than what we hear
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:21.800]  of is sodium fluoride being put in the water supply and i hope you'll spend time with us again
[3:37:21.800 --> 3:37:27.000]  people can just google roger d masters and find out about your prolific work and i appreciate your
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:33.720]  time well thank you very much for giving me a chance to uh perhaps encourage stopping the use
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:37.640]  of a dangerous chemical all right thank you we appreciate your time well good luck and good
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:44.520]  health to you all thank you appreciate it well there we have to always back to the same thing
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:52.760]  oh man and let me tell you they will have you believe that they are not religionist i don't
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:59.400]  know about him particularly but they are religious in every sense of the word ladies and gentlemen
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:04.440]  okay look i wanted to play both these clips they're both like 10 minutes long they're up on

[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:59.320]  my studio hell i may just start doing five or six hours every day you know there's too much i look i
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:03.800]  know i opened the phones up hours ago and only took like five calls they're not people still holding
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:09.400]  are they yep i gave you the fresh list on your goodness gracious these poor people have been
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:14.440]  holding for hours and hours and hours and i've got an important meeting i've got to go to you know
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:21.800]  what we'll take their calls to before the show ends just joe mike mike billy and dr kelly
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:30.840]  right yep that's right one okay well anybody it won't be on the amon fm dial go before we've
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:34.840]  internet or satellite but it will be on the internet info wars dot com and prison planet
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:42.440]  dot tv you will be able to uh see the clip i'll just play it from there um let's go ahead now
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:49.240]  and do this i i wanted to spend a whole show on this and i think tomorrow i'm going to comment on
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:57.560]  this more but i found all these old militia clips from donahue and other shows and donahue is acting
[3:39:57.560 --> 3:40:01.640]  like a complete clown i used to really hate him for this but then because i'd seen these you know
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:06.040]  back in the early 90s this was like a 94 right after the wake up butchering and i'd seen these
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:10.520]  clips going around then on vhs tapes and things passed around where he's going you hot you live
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:15.160]  in the woods don't you the woods like these militia guys they're just totally calm make him look like
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:20.360]  a fool i know two of the guys that are up on stage and they're laying out they're coming for your
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:26.760]  guns it's a new world order they're going to do this and that and then now look let me see 10 14
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:33.960]  years later this is a 1994 14 years later how much of this has come through how much of this
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:38.200]  happened because they were only going off government documents and just how right the militia movement
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:43.640]  was but then a year later after this tv show the feds bombed okc and bill clinton playing on the
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:48.520]  militia when it was a federal operation and that's when the militia went underground so government
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:54.600]  sponsored terror is used to head off movements that could stop their tyranny so let's uh go ahead
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:40:59.640]  but they only do it because it's injustice to means they want to bring us enlightenment and
[3:40:59.640 --> 3:41:04.520]  they got to kill a lot of us to do that first it's you know it's a it's a great work we're talking
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:12.120]  about here for lucifer uh they believe so uh let's go ahead and play the militia with the the
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:16.520]  video is even more incredible up on info wars dot com actually for prison planet dot tv let's punch
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:22.840]  this up and i will play clip to an overdrive so people can actually see the video over prison
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:27.320]  planet dot tv just just have us where i can't get to it later good yeah yeah later i'm gonna
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:32.280]  have that for everybody uh now folks get confused there's always other internet streams and little
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:37.480]  radio networks internet and things that carry the show and there's scores of them and they and
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:41.160]  the deads always let a lot of them do it the problem is some then hold out that they are us
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:45.320]  and because we're so lenient with things just kind of like make copies of my film people say
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:50.120]  well they're now my film and i copyright your film you know and then well no that's my film how dare
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:54.840]  you you know the film's mine now so we have to kind of explain to you this is the genesis network
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:59.320]  this is where the show originates from and on those other networks and things you won't be hearing
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:04.120]  my show on an inch you've got to go to info wars dot com when we go into overdrive the only place
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:12.520]  that listens on the internet or at prison planet dot tv all of the uh schooning pilot fish uh are
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:16.840]  you know trying to attach themselves which which i don't mind a few pilot fish hanging off me
[3:42:16.840 --> 3:42:21.640]  but if they bite me and hate me while they're sucking my blood it makes me angry and they you
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:26.440]  know they always squeal and yell and pull their hair out and i mean you know make up a bunch of
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:29.960]  stuff about me and engage in blackmail and all those other crap you're i'm not going to be too
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:35.720]  friendly towards you it's i mean your own delusional bs you can lie to yourself all day about the
[3:42:35.720 --> 3:42:40.200]  stuff you've done but the truth is i know the truth and that's what matters and that's why

[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:22.360]  out against it but but but that's the whole point is that's what they would tell the public and this
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:27.880]  was running up the demonization of the militia started a year before the feds bombed okc just
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:33.800]  like the demonization of al-ciyeda began right before 9 11 so you could see the build up but i
[3:44:33.800 --> 3:44:39.320]  mean just listen how ridiculous filled on a u.s here it is yeah that's correct but you're not
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:43.960]  living there i don't quite understand when you say you're living there i live in northern michigan

[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:02.840]  that's correct columbus to be exact yeah you're in a militia are you the ohio unorganized militia
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:07.880]  duly elected communications officer yeah what's what are you uh incidentally i thought this was a
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:11.880]  all-white by the way start again i mean donahue is extremely manipulative you know speaking out
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:16.840]  against the war now he seems good but he was puffing up getting in their face growling at him
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:20.440]  with the body language trying to manipulate him into a fight and the guys were all laughing at him
[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:27.000]  so donahue looked like a complete fool back to it yeah what's what are you uh incidentally i thought
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:32.840]  this was a all-white area nation don't try it on me kind of group yeah well the saving the country
[3:45:32.840 --> 3:45:38.040]  doesn't have an affirmative action program all are invited and uh you're here among other things to
[3:45:38.040 --> 3:45:43.480]  say that you share their concern about uh the pending crisis that's coming to this country
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:50.440]  oh absolutely uh being a minority in our community we've seen certain actions that these conspiratorial
[3:45:50.440 --> 3:45:54.120]  theorists have talked about actually happen in our communities tell us what they are i'm having
[3:45:54.120 --> 3:45:58.760]  little trouble getting it from the civilians here well the you look like you're from ibm compared to
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:03.960]  the rest of the rest of the show we can spot you we from the air bob you better get yourself your
[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:09.160]  fatigues here i want to get spotted from here yes you are you're serious about this please
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:12.600]  i want this audience to know oh show them the film this is from michigan let me just while
[3:46:12.600 --> 3:46:17.800]  while we're showing you can make your case the basic problem is rather simple and americans
[3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:25.720]  have become concerned that here in the united states we're losing our constitutional rights
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:31.480]  we are slowly being moved into what amounts to being a one world and that's george bush and
[3:46:31.480 --> 3:46:40.200]  gorbachev's words a one-world new world order and what that amounts to uh and basically is socialism
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:45.480]  one world socialism and if you don't like it you're going to be moved off someplace where they can
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:51.640]  control you and the the problem is uh in terms of the militia across the united states this is
[3:46:51.640 --> 3:46:58.120]  exactly what we're addressing as nothing to do with racism as i guess our our compadre from
[3:46:58.120 --> 3:47:04.440]  ohio would testify there's nothing to do with the handful of crazy people running through the woods
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:10.840]  and practicing to shoot unknown mysterious people we already are witnessing as we talked today
[3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:17.960]  port urico san Juan port urico is under martial law folks that everybody said would never happen
[3:47:17.960 --> 3:47:25.320]  that's as we speak to this has to do with uh the sweep of uh uh public housing for drugs
[3:47:25.320 --> 3:47:31.320]  and weapons that's the excuse that's the excuse that's being used now the only point they don't
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:37.160]  make is that the tremendous tonnage of cocaine and narcotics coming into the united states
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:43.320]  is being done on c 130 military aircraft it's been that way since uh all the way back in the 80s
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:47.560]  and it was part of the oliver north business with bringing in the drugs and the guns down
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:52.760]  to the countries that's what you're on you're afraid of uh the suspension of what you believe
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:57.720]  you're is your right to bear arms that's really at the fun at the root of this you're afraid
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:48:03.720]  the feds are coming along take your guns away my basic concern is what kind of a country am i
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:11.160]  going to leave my children i am very very concerned about that and that's the reason that i'm in the
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:16.040]  militia is what kind of a country am i going to leave for my children yeah that's the same way
[3:48:16.040 --> 3:48:22.040]  with me so you know you're the you're the chaplain right yeah right at 63 my youngest daughter
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:29.640]  just had a little girl well she's a year old now and i was amazed that it that at 63 i started to
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:35.480]  really appreciate this little person and so that's what i still don't know what the hell you're doing
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:40.920]  in these funny outfits here what are you concerned about gentlemen what's going to happen you're
[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:47.160]  finessing me here you think that the feds are coming they're going to suspend the constitution
[3:48:47.160 --> 3:48:52.520]  they're going to take your guns away and you're practicing and when they come you're going to
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:56.840]  pop them off it's already here's wait a minute wait a minute what do you mean it's already
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:49:00.840]  happened so you mean in the inner cities inner cities already happened we have you said public
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:05.320]  housing it's also been public and private areas also tree port louisiana is a great example sops
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:09.800]  will happen in chicago they killed a guy in boston doing that so you're so you're effectively you're
[3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:15.800]  in the militia in order to what preserve our constitutional right and how will this express
[3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:21.800]  itself this preservation this preservation what we do in ohio is we arm people with knowledge

[3:59:52.360 --> 3:59:59.560]  clip for everybody as well here it is it's not anarchy yeah and so training in the woods what we
[3:59:59.560 --> 4:00:06.040]  in other words you really think this is going to come down here you have to understand that
[4:00:06.040 --> 4:00:13.800]  in the area that i live it is woods my closest i don't understand how higher interest rates and a big
[4:00:13.800 --> 4:00:23.320]  get i gotta say something here look how domesticated donna he was i mean he's he's he's one
[4:00:24.200 --> 4:00:29.880]  you live in the woods a house in the woods oh my god you should be like 90 of people in an urban
[4:00:29.880 --> 4:00:34.680]  area so when we have a great depression instead of 80 being rural and being able to survive and
[4:00:34.680 --> 4:00:39.320]  only seven million starved in the great depression tens of millions more will starve it's so crazy
[4:00:39.320 --> 4:00:44.920]  to my god live in the woods and have guns you're not a domesticated slave like me it's so shocking
[4:00:44.920 --> 4:00:51.160]  to see someone that's somewhat free and informed uh in 15 years before their time oh my god it's so
[4:00:51.160 --> 4:00:58.120]  scary oh my god but but he sees a cop or a guy in a black ski mask in new york of the machine gun
[4:00:58.120 --> 4:01:05.080]  he feels safe oh oh fema calves no cops with machine guns in black mask no and cameras everywhere it
[4:01:05.080 --> 4:01:12.200]  makes me feel so safe to have a criminal government but but to see citizens with guys that they live
[4:01:12.200 --> 4:01:16.360]  they live in the woods they they have water wells they're not drinking their fluoride
[4:01:17.080 --> 4:01:23.720]  dear god they're crazy people let's go back to these dangerous people you live in the woods though
[4:01:23.720 --> 4:01:30.200]  the woods my god it's crazy oh my god this guy's out of his mind i bet he doesn't think gmo's good
[4:01:30.200 --> 4:01:38.840]  for him oh god help us oh no oh it's all over here it is folks thanks i have our key
[4:01:40.760 --> 4:01:45.400]  oh there's some reason the youtube clip's not playing good old youtube i'd say that tortures
[4:01:45.400 --> 4:01:51.400]  me here we'll just play it from here two questions all right i'll go ahead you the economic situation
[4:01:51.400 --> 4:01:57.080]  of this country yeah we're four and a half trillion dollars in debt we're going in debt at a billion
[4:01:57.080 --> 4:02:04.600]  dollars a day what will happen when all of the money collected on taxes goes to interest on the deck
[4:02:05.400 --> 4:02:10.440]  if you look at argentina brazil you have a hyperinflation yeah an economic situation
[4:02:11.720 --> 4:02:17.960]  collapse of the economy riding in the streets anarchy yeah and so training in the woods what
[4:02:17.960 --> 4:02:24.840]  we in other words you really think this is going to come down here you have to understand that in
[4:02:24.840 --> 4:02:32.120]  the area that i live it is woods my closest name but i don't understand how higher interest rates and
[4:02:32.120 --> 4:02:36.920]  a big service load on the debt is going to be cured by wearing fatigues and running around the woods
[4:02:36.920 --> 4:02:45.160]  is a grown man huffing and puffing in the you know what's what's the point if we were not dressed
[4:02:45.160 --> 4:02:48.600]  like this if we were not dressed like this in training we wouldn't be sitting here talking to
[4:02:48.600 --> 4:02:53.560]  you today and we want the american people to pull together contact their elected officials and tell
[4:02:53.560 --> 4:02:58.120]  them what the problems are and let's sit down and start working out the problem instead of just
[4:02:58.120 --> 4:03:03.000]  john here's what you told us here's what you told us can't no but i mean john i think said this to
[4:03:03.000 --> 4:03:08.200]  us okay uh it's uh it's about informing the public about what's going on in this country
[4:03:08.840 --> 4:03:14.760]  you say it's a sell-off the government is selling us out uh the constitution's in peril you believe
[4:03:14.760 --> 4:03:20.760]  that our government is involved in a population reduction come on our government wants to disarm
[4:03:20.760 --> 4:03:25.640]  the citizens create a one-world government then do a world reduction of the population
[4:03:25.640 --> 4:03:31.240]  and we're seeing what we're seeing now is foreign military equipment and chemical warfare equipment
[4:03:31.240 --> 4:03:37.400]  being brought into our country come on okay tens of thousands respond i'm going to step on john's
[4:03:37.400 --> 4:03:43.880]  toes here you gotta ask yourself and you folks that finding some of this humorous number one
[4:03:43.880 --> 4:03:50.200]  this was photographed in texas a couple of weeks ago yeah all right this is a frog short range
[4:03:50.200 --> 4:03:55.560]  russian chemical biological missile we have photographed several of these we also have
[4:03:55.560 --> 4:04:01.240]  this equipment on video tape with a star in a whole village looks like that folks but this is
[4:04:01.240 --> 4:04:07.320]  in texas if that doesn't bother you then maybe we should be how do you know that okay excuse me
[4:04:07.320 --> 4:04:12.200]  by the way i'm gonna hit pause again i mean i gotta get out here and go to a meeting i got
[4:04:12.200 --> 4:04:18.840]  10 more minutes to play at this but this is what's incredible now in 2008 we knew north com did this
[4:04:18.840 --> 4:04:24.440]  five years ago officially but they didn't advertise it said canadian and mexican and eastern block
[4:04:24.440 --> 4:04:30.280]  troops will be used to patrol america during an economic collapse for marshal law or terrorist
[4:04:30.280 --> 4:04:37.880]  attack then in early 2008 the north com publicly signed a deal with the canadian and mexican generals
[4:04:37.880 --> 4:04:43.400]  on canadian tv and then congress said we'd like to be able to see that we're supposed to fund that
[4:04:43.400 --> 4:04:48.120]  or agree to that we passed the laws and they said nope continue government sit down and shut up
[4:04:48.120 --> 4:04:52.760]  and now paulson comes out and says trillions and bailouts it's not 700 billion it's trillions
[4:04:52.760 --> 4:04:56.040]  and trillions and congress started talking a week and a half ago saying well we have to look at that
[4:04:56.040 --> 4:05:02.920]  and he said sit down and shut up presidential decision director 51 everything these guys said
[4:05:02.920 --> 4:05:13.080]  in 1994 what is it 14 years ago everything came true and now it's all declassified about the
[4:05:13.080 --> 4:05:18.360]  population reduction and the public just can't deal with it it's your fault out there folks
[4:05:18.360 --> 4:05:24.280]  we have given you all the information and and and there's clips of me in 95 96 97 saying this stuff

[4:10:16.840 --> 4:10:21.720]  on tripod this way and you're looking at you probably have night vision glasses and every
[4:10:21.720 --> 4:10:27.480]  time you hear a tree cracking the woods you're going to blow half the forest away your fear
[4:10:27.480 --> 4:10:32.360]  your fears that happen in america you must be talking a little bit about new york jerryville
[4:10:32.360 --> 4:10:41.800]  you can't know it phil you can't know it phil you believe weco and the incident and shoot out in
[4:10:41.800 --> 4:10:47.800]  idaho makes your case don't you absolutely that the federal government is coming down
[4:10:47.800 --> 4:10:52.920]  they've got all the weapons and the problem phil the problem is regardless of any one time
[4:10:52.920 --> 4:10:57.640]  this young man is speaking can't be heard if you talk no matter what anyone in this audience feels
[4:10:57.640 --> 4:11:01.240]  or anyone in the country feels about david caress and his followers whether they're interested
[4:11:01.240 --> 4:11:06.200]  or guilty they they deserve to process and they didn't they didn't receive that in regards to what
[4:11:06.200 --> 4:11:10.280]  you felt about the the adults the children certainly weren't guilty of anything and that's
[4:11:10.280 --> 4:11:13.880]  what we're concerned about this is this is evidence of what the federal government is capable of
[4:11:13.880 --> 4:11:19.880]  absolutely they did it yeah and you are concerned about the about the house to house sweeps for
[4:11:19.880 --> 4:11:25.400]  us you think you think the feds are capable of that aren't you you think the feds are capable
[4:11:25.400 --> 4:11:29.480]  wait a minute we don't think they're we don't think that they're a fence are capable of it

[4:16:49.880 --> 4:16:56.200]  reported on the front page of the New York Times it's called the militia no they say they're not
[4:16:56.200 --> 4:17:01.000]  racist it's not just about guns and possession of guns but the second man was involved here
[4:17:01.000 --> 4:17:06.120]  definitely they're proud of their second amendment it's about provisions it's about protecting your
[4:17:06.120 --> 4:17:10.760]  neighbor their neighbors they feel like they're together they're going to help and by god no
[4:17:10.760 --> 4:17:15.880]  constables going to come from some far away place and break their door down they'll shoot

[4:17:23.640 --> 4:17:39.560]  just a moment
[4:17:54.280 --> 4:17:59.960]  you've met the good brother Doug Hall member of the michigan militia
[4:18:01.480 --> 4:18:06.200]  okay so you don't sleep in the woods you maneuver in the woods and you're in and you say
[4:18:06.200 --> 4:18:11.320]  michigan is quite wooded especially the northern part here's the reverend speaking to the troops
[4:18:11.320 --> 4:18:17.400]  I guess this is a weekend gathering for go get them reverend praise the lord I thought felt that
[4:18:17.400 --> 4:18:25.560]  the lord was saying this is this group because you know the way it's growing across the nation
[4:18:25.560 --> 4:18:31.480]  phenomenal I go to staff meeting can't believe what I hear going on but I felt like the lord is
[4:18:31.480 --> 4:18:40.360]  saying this is the army of the lord in the united states for this moment that's the army of the lord
[4:18:40.360 --> 4:18:48.120]  is it that's the army of the lord yeah well that's the one I what's the army I want to be in I don't
[4:18:48.120 --> 4:18:54.360]  want to laugh at these people but I feel that they're all weird but I don't think it's that bad
[4:18:54.920 --> 4:18:59.720]  and as for him saying he's religious and isn't army of the lord is something else and I don't
[4:18:59.720 --> 4:19:03.880]  think it's that serious I don't think it's that bad and I would like to know if they're playing on
[4:19:03.880 --> 4:19:09.480]  maybe taking over the government maybe do like they didn't hate it you know the problem is the
[4:19:09.480 --> 4:19:15.480]  problem is you are the government and the problem is who did take over Haiti ma'am who took over
[4:19:15.480 --> 4:19:21.960]  Haiti a couple weeks ago no no no who took over Haiti you mentioned it you know who took over Haiti
[4:19:21.960 --> 4:19:27.160]  and out of control government they did not do anything other than go to some unknown entity
[4:19:27.160 --> 4:19:32.280]  called the united nations has nothing to do with your representative congressional representative
[4:19:32.280 --> 4:19:36.440]  and went in there and just took them over and stuck who they wanted in there who by the way
[4:19:36.440 --> 4:19:42.840]  is now a dope drop operation in between the south you've given us lectures about what that's who
[4:19:42.840 --> 4:19:49.000]  Haiti is we want to know about this you understand that we want to know what motivates you hey I want
[4:19:49.000 --> 4:19:54.280]  to say something to this army well hey now Reverend hey hey hey it's for horses Reverend
[4:19:54.280 --> 4:20:00.200]  well I'm going to straw whatever okay listen
[4:20:03.400 --> 4:20:08.120]  this none of these bites has taken out a context I set the condition number one
[4:20:08.680 --> 4:20:13.240]  I told these militiamen if you are going to be the army of the Lord you better be living right in
[4:20:13.240 --> 4:20:20.120]  your own homes all right ladies and gentlemen that is that but there's more of that online
[4:20:20.120 --> 4:20:26.600]  it's up on info wars dot com but look at their courage look how they're bold look how upright
[4:20:26.600 --> 4:20:31.080]  they were being attacked by that lesser man who was laughing and mocking them with that mindless
[4:20:31.080 --> 4:20:36.200]  group of people pillering them and booing them and laughing at them and a lot of these guys got
[4:20:36.200 --> 4:20:41.160]  set up went to prison had pipe bombs buried on the property hundreds of them feds infiltrated
[4:20:41.160 --> 4:20:48.280]  tried to begin to be violent never worked just just amazing people everything that they've
[4:20:48.280 --> 4:20:53.720]  done and and and all I can do is commend the American militia and it's in the second amendment
[4:20:53.720 --> 4:20:59.560]  all men 18 to 49 are supposed to be part of it 18 to 44 and instead we've got illegal aliens
[4:20:59.560 --> 4:21:04.520]  and foreign felons making up a lot of our military now you know we can't have the citizens involved
[4:21:04.520 --> 4:21:08.440]  and saying we'll defend our local governments and communities against corporate tyranny
[4:21:09.160 --> 4:21:13.640]  but you can have aggravated felons in your military and illegal aliens on them and if you
[4:21:13.640 --> 4:21:17.240]  didn't know folks they're recruiting them you're blind to that but just everything they're saying
[4:21:17.240 --> 4:21:24.760]  come true everything they warned and they deserve the respect of the people as I said we're going
[4:21:24.760 --> 4:21:29.480]  to go into retransmission now let me just go another two three minutes so we'll just come right out
[4:21:29.480 --> 4:21:34.360]  when the show comes back out of rebroadcast it's usually about 30 seconds ahead on the internet

[4:23:09.400 --> 4:23:15.080]  being measured has never been this cool or releasing this this low level of heat it's one
[4:23:15.080 --> 4:23:19.640]  of the most in the most early studied things by scientists and they've had accurate readings for
[4:23:19.640 --> 4:23:25.960]  300 years more or more nasa will hold a media conference Tuesdays at number 23rd it's tomorrow
[4:23:25.960 --> 4:23:30.840]  to discuss the data from the joint nasa european space agency lissy's missions reveal the solar
[4:23:30.840 --> 4:23:36.040]  wind the 50 year low then it goes deeper into the article say 300 years of measurements but
[4:23:36.040 --> 4:23:40.600]  since they've been measuring solar winds uh it's the 50 year low the sun's current state could
[4:23:40.600 --> 4:23:45.080]  result in changing conditions in the solar system yeah and it gets into all that so I'll be covering
[4:23:45.080 --> 4:23:50.280]  that tomorrow retransmission starts now on the info wars dot com streams want to thank everybody
