[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  Coming up, folks, on the show today, here in the third hour, world AIDS deaths, infections, at new heights, and the global government is behind that, my friends.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  We're also going to get into some new Second Amendment legislation and the latest developments of what's going on in Iraq, and of course your phone calls.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  For those that just joined us or are tuning in for the first time, you'd have to be hiding under a rock to not have heard about the Terry Schindler Shivo case.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  She's a lady who's not in a coma, not in a vegetative state, who could have been rehabilitated according to her own doctors.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  Her husband, who's since common law married and has children with another woman, has not allowed her to have the medical settlement, has not allowed her to have any rehabilitation.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  They then pulled her feeding tube for, what, seven plus days, which would kill most people, and the legislature moved and passed a law so the governor could have the tube reinserted.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  Now it's in the courts, and the whole pro-death euthanasia crowd has shown up en masse trying to push through legislation and court cases.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  They're fighting on multiple fronts to kill Terry, but this case just isn't about Terry and Terry's fight.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  Terry's fight.org has video clips and a lot of the news stories there.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  It's not just about her.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  I mean, we've had Wall Street Journal writer Wesley Smith on listing the names of people in Florida, among other states, where they beg for food and water,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  but the bioethics boards say, well, we're not going to allow you to have food and water, and they kill you.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  This is on the record.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  People who were talking, very dangerous precedent that's being set.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  I want to go ahead and bring Bob Schindler, father of Terry, on the show to give us the latest developments.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  Bob, thanks for coming on.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  Thank you for having me.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  For folks that don't know about this case, can you just recap in the next two minutes for them, and then we'll come back and give them the latest developments?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  Well, essentially what's happening, you pretty much described it.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  My daughter was displayed to the courts as being in a persistent vegetative state.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  Can you talk right into your telephone for me, please?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Yeah, I said my daughter was portrayed to the court as being in a persistent vegetative state,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]  and the court was also told that Terry orally made an end of life death wish,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  and from that she was essentially found, I guess, guilty by the court in order to be executed.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  Ordered to be executed by dehydration, one of the most painful deaths known by medical science on the record.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  You can't kill an axe murderer like this, but you can kill somebody's daughter like this, a human being.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  You know, it's really tragic what's happening in Florida,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  and the courts now have lined up against the governor and the legislatures because they had passed this law,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  and it's called Terry's law, to prevent her starvation,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  and of course feel that the government is now intervening in an area where they don't belong, essentially.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  So you've got yourself a real good dogfight going on here, and it's turned political as well,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  and that's the sorry part about it, where Terry's kind of got lost in the shuffle.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  And you've got rock bands showing up who are going to have live suicides on stage.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  They think it's all great.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  You've got the band Hell on Earth. You've got the Hemlock Society running around.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  I mean, it is a disgusting spectacle, but we have forced the news to stop saying she's in a coma.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  That at least is good.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  Well, yeah, finally, and that happened because of the videos that we got out there
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  that prove that Terry is not in any type of coma or persistent vegetative state.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  The other thing that we're trying to convey to people is her wishes.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  There were no such wishes.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  It was all hearsay coming from her husband and members of his family.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  Tell you what, Bob, stay there.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  We'll get into some of the new reports that have come out, and we'll take calls as well.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:09.176]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because
[00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:13.176]  there's a war on for your mind.
[00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:20.176]  Folks all over Western Europe, Northern Europe and England, they're now killing people who
[00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:22.176]  don't even want to be killed.
[00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:27.176]  Here in the United States, believe it or not, and in the Wall Street Journal and other major
[00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:33.176]  publications, if somebody has said that they do not want to be resuscitated, or do not
[00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:38.176]  want medical care, then the bioethics board will take over.
[00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:42.176]  Later, when they're paralyzed, neck down, begging audibly, ma'am, please have food,
[00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:47.176]  ma'am, please have water, there are hundreds of people whose names we know they have killed
[00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:50.176]  who are begging for food and water.
[00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:54.176]  They are setting the precedent to get rid of the old of the infirm.
[00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:58.176]  The news tried to basically lie about Terri Schiavo and said that she was in a coma.
[00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:04.176]  Then the video showed her following the balloon, smiling, trying to sit up.
[00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:08.176]  Her doctors going back over many years said that she could have been rehabilitated.
[00:06:08.176 --> 00:06:13.176]  A few years ago, she was able to even eat food, but then all rehabilitation was denied
[00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:14.176]  to her.
[00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:19.176]  Her estranged husband, who has children and has a common law marriage, told people that
[00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:20.176]  he wanted to take care of her.
[00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:22.176]  Oh, just sign rights over to me.
[00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:24.176]  The family believed him and did it.
[00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:28.176]  And we have Bob Schindler, the father of Terri Schiavo.
[00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:32.176]  And of course, this was a national case, still big headlines.
[00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:35.176]  We were covering it long before it was big news.
[00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:40.176]  The governor, after seven days of her being denied water and food in her feeding tube,
[00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:45.176]  the legislature moved and passed Terri's law allowing him to block it.
[00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.176]  He didn't even need that law to begin with, folks.
[00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:50.176]  Now the courts are moving to remove the feeding tube again.
[00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:54.176]  If you'd like to talk to Bob Schindler, have any questions or comments, you've called here
[00:06:54.176 --> 00:06:55.176]  asking me questions about it.
[00:06:55.176 --> 00:07:06.176]  If you'd like to talk to him, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-2599231.
[00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:11.176]  Here's Bob Schindler, an expert on the case, the father of this young lady who has been
[00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:15.176]  in a living hell, not being given treatment when she has infections.
[00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:21.176]  Michael Schiavo refuses to give her care, refuses to release the million-plus dollars
[00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:24.176]  they got in the settlement to her.
[00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:29.176]  The original medical reports show that she had trauma when she came into the hospital,
[00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:32.176]  broken bones, though they claimed it was a heart attack.
[00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:34.176]  Again, joining us is Bob Schindler.
[00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:37.176]  Bob, there's an article here out of the Palm Beach Post today,
[00:07:37.176 --> 00:07:39.176]  Bush too late on Schiavo.
[00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:44.176]  The case of Terri Schiavo, Governor Bush continues to put the state where it does not belong
[00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:49.176]  and continues to show that his intervention is more about politics than Ms. Schiavo's welfare.
[00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:56.176]  And it's a disgusting article saying, oh, it's doing her a favor to get rid of her.
[00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.176]  Your comments, sir?
[00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:05.176]  Well, you know, that all goes along with what I mentioned before, that this is term political.
[00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:13.176]  And the other part of it is you have the people who are advocating legal youth in Asia
[00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:15.176]  and the state of Florida.
[00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:18.176]  And Terri's case is really the trial balloon.
[00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:20.176]  Bob, I hate to keep having to stop you.
[00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:22.176]  Put the phone right up to your mouth for me, please.
[00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:23.176]  Yes. Can you hear better now?
[00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:25.176]  Yes, I can. Go ahead.
[00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.176]  Terri's case is like the trial balloon.
[00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:33.175]  And all these different organizations that are advocates of youth in Asia
[00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:44.175]  or have banded together to try and get the state to legalize that and assist with suicide.
[00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:51.175]  Now, the government of the state, which is Governor Bush, they recognize, I believe, what's happening.
[00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:56.175]  And they're doing their darnedest to offset these efforts.
[00:08:56.175 --> 00:09:02.175]  But it's just the tragic thing that what's happened to Terri over the years is tragic.
[00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:06.175]  It just continues, it seems, every day.
[00:09:06.175 --> 00:09:11.175]  Bob Schindler, a father of Terri Schiavo, where is the case right now?
[00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:13.175]  What's going on in the courts?
[00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:21.175]  Well, in the circuit court, there's a Judge Baird, his name is, the sister circuit court,
[00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:36.175]  who is going to hear Terri's law and already came out and said beforehand that he believes it's unconstitutional.
[00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:39.175]  And that will happen sometime in the near future.
[00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:41.175]  He'll make that declaration.
[00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:50.175]  And hopefully we'll have an opportunity, or the governor's people will have an opportunity to appeal that in the appellate court.
[00:09:50.175 --> 00:10:04.175]  But the attorney for Schiavo is asking that the court make this ruling without any hearings and just declare it unconstitutional and remove Terri's feeding tube.
[00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:06.175]  That's what they'd like to see happen.
[00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:09.175]  Now, there have been some rulings.
[00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.175]  Where is it in the process?
[00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:15.175]  How long until they rule and then possibly pull her feeding tube?
[00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:21.175]  Well, this judge could rule, we thought, almost any day, this Judge Baird.
[00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:31.175]  And hopefully we will, the governor's people will have an opportunity to appeal that in the appellate court.
[00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:37.175]  But what they're trying to do is to waive the appeal process, which is just ludicrous.
[00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:40.175]  Now, there's been a lot of bizarre activity here.
[00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:48.175]  Michael Schiavo, the husband, brought your daughter in to the hospital.
[00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:50.175]  And now the medical reports have come out.
[00:10:50.175 --> 00:10:51.175]  She had broken bones.
[00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:58.175]  They then said it was a heart attack from a mineral deficiency.
[00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:05.175]  And he came in and got you guys assigned over custody to him so he could, quote, streamline things.
[00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:12.175]  But then they had a malpractice suit and won over a million dollars.
[00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:17.175]  And he went to school to, quote, be a nurse because he wanted to take care of her for the rest of his life.
[00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:19.175]  Then he denied the most basic care.
[00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.175]  This is so important.
[00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:22.175]  This is on the record.
[00:11:22.175 --> 00:11:28.175]  He refused to allow her to have any type of therapy, though they were already feeding her.
[00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:29.175]  She was being rehabilitated.
[00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:32.175]  She was eating, folks, in her mouth, eating Jell-O, eating food.
[00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:34.175]  This is on the record.
[00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:36.175]  Now there's this new disgusting twist in the media.
[00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:42.175]  Here it is out of this editorial without a signature to it, as usual, by the Palm Beach Post.
[00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:44.175]  So this is the feeling of the paper.
[00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:58.175]  A report in the St. Petersburg Times suggested that Terry Schiavo's parents, Mary and Bob Schindler, split with their son-in-law because they wanted $10,000 from the $300,000 that went to him for the malpractice award in the daughter's case.
[00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.175]  Another $700,000 has gone to her care.
[00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:08.175]  Terry Schiavo's non-life and exploitation linger on.
[00:12:08.175 --> 00:12:14.175]  Now, I mean, you talk about bad behavior.
[00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:15.175]  That's Michael.
[00:12:15.175 --> 00:12:17.175]  I've covered this case.
[00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:18.175]  I've researched it.
[00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:20.175]  I've read hundreds of articles on it.
[00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:23.175]  And you guys have the doctors and others on your side.
[00:12:24.175 --> 00:12:30.175]  I mean, you might want to investigate legal action against the St. Petersburg Times.
[00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:38.175]  Well, what they're doing is they're putting a spin on this thing to take the attention away from, you know, the husband and Terry.
[00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:52.175]  There's evidence that is surfacing almost daily that indicates that he was responsible for Terry's collapse, and hopefully that at some point in time he'll be prosecuted for that.
[00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:59.175]  Now, sir, according to the Associated Press, you've spent your entire retirement, hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers.
[00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:00.175]  You love your daughter.
[00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.175]  You're there, you know, all the time.
[00:13:02.175 --> 00:13:05.175]  You've got Catholic priests that come and try to visit her all the time.
[00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:13.175]  A lot of times Michael won't let them come in and they refuse last rites when they had the feeding tube pulled a month ago.
[00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:20.175]  And imagine the nerve of them trying to say you wanted $10,000 and that's why you split with Michael.
[00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.175]  Why did you really split with Michael?
[00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:26.175]  Well, it was strictly for Terry's care.
[00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:34.175]  Prior to the malpractice, he had made commitments that he was going to do certain things for Terry to get her rehabilitated.
[00:13:34.175 --> 00:13:44.175]  And as soon as that money came in, he actually reneged on everything and attempted to end her life by not treating her for an infection.
[00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:51.175]  He had a urinary tract infection and he gave orders not to treat her for that.
[00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:55.175]  And also for 10 years hasn't allowed her teeth to be brushed.
[00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:57.175]  Well, he's done absolutely nothing for her.
[00:13:57.175 --> 00:14:07.175]  She's been warehoused in nursing homes and until the last three, four years they put her in a hospice because she doesn't even belong in there.
[00:14:07.175 --> 00:14:17.175]  And in there all she's getting is just, she's being bathed and kept clean by these caretakers.
[00:14:17.175 --> 00:14:19.175]  But she's limited to visitation.
[00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:21.175]  She's isolated from the public.
[00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:26.175]  She hasn't been outside for almost three years and she's in a 10 by 12 room.
[00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:31.175]  And there's police now that have been there for a month and a half in front of her room.
[00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:38.175]  There's police outside of the hospice facility that we have to get clearance to go in through the police.
[00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:42.175]  So any day now the judge could say pull the feeding tube.
[00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:46.175]  Have you heard from the Governor what he will do to counter that or if anything?
[00:14:46.175 --> 00:14:57.175]  I don't know other than the fact that from what I'm reading is that they have filed objections to what this judge is doing.
[00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:59.175]  They tried to have him removed from the case.
[00:14:59.175 --> 00:15:07.175]  And also the venue to have that transferred up into the county where the Governor resides.
[00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:14.175]  But it just, it appears from this end of it that these courts are doing as they please.
[00:15:14.175 --> 00:15:20.175]  And they're just, you know, they're on the bench and they're rewriting the laws.
[00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:26.175]  And they're just uncontrolled.
[00:15:27.175 --> 00:15:29.175]  What is Michael Schiavo doing?
[00:15:29.175 --> 00:15:31.175]  I know he was on Larry King Live.
[00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:33.175]  What's he been up to now?
[00:15:33.175 --> 00:15:34.175]  Well, we really don't know.
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.175]  We don't see him.
[00:15:35.175 --> 00:15:42.175]  We visit Terry almost on a daily basis and we haven't seen him in quite some time.
[00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:48.175]  He has his mistress and he has two children by the mistress.
[00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:51.175]  And he's really going along with his life.
[00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:56.175]  He keeps claiming that he...
[00:15:56.175 --> 00:15:58.175]  Well, I'll tell you what, Bob, we're going to break.
[00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:07.175]  And if folks want to respond to this or have any questions or comments for you, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.175]  The Schindler case, folks want to know where it was right now.
[00:16:10.175 --> 00:16:14.175]  And they could pull her tube any time, folks.
[00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:17.175]  And then we'll have to sit there and watch her start dying again.
[00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.175]  A lot of people die after five or six days.
[00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:24.175]  She survived, what, seven plus days with no water.
[00:16:24.175 --> 00:16:27.175]  That was amazing in and of itself, wasn't it, Bob?
[00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:30.175]  Yeah, that's the second time now that they stopped her feeding.
[00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:35.175]  Because it was stopped in 2001, in April.
[00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:38.175]  And it was four or five days then.
[00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:44.175]  Well, I want to talk about Terry's condition, too, when we get back, Bob, and take some calls, you know, when you're with her, how she's doing.
[00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:54.175]  And if you want to see video clips of her, this person is supposedly in a coma, but now admit that's not true in the media, go to terrysfight.org or it's onprisonblinded.com as well.
[00:16:54.175 --> 00:16:56.175]  We've got all the clips right there as well for you.
[00:16:56.175 --> 00:17:01.175]  We'll be right back, folks, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:02.175]  Stay with us.
[00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:33.030]  Welcome back folks, coming up I've got news on the Second Amendment, news on the economy,
[00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:39.270]  the war on, well, free countries that's going on under the guise of war on terror, what's
[00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:46.110]  happening with AIDS in Africa, very serious issue, we're talking to Bob Schindler, we'll
[00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:50.350]  watch this case through to the end, I hope that they'll allow her to have rehabilitation
[00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:58.550]  and to be taken care of, but we are an aging population and they're trying to set the precedent
[00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.350]  whoever they want, whenever they want. Bob Schindler, let's take some calls.
[00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.910]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas. Rodney, you're on the air. Go ahead, sir.
[00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:14.389]  Yes, thank you for taking my call today, Miss Alex and also Mr. Schindler. First of all,
[00:18:14.389 --> 00:18:20.790]  I want to start off by saying that I've been praying for God to extend a special portion
[00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:26.790]  of this Holy Spirit out to your daughter and the family so that they can remain strong,
[00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:34.790]  because it's been a very, very trying situation. I just want to say that before I
[00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:42.950]  ask you about a comment I heard you make earlier, I was interested in the statement
[00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:52.389]  you made earlier. You said that a number of groups had banned together in opposition to
[00:18:52.389 --> 00:19:03.750]  keeping Terry alive. I read that the ACLU was one of those groups. Alex, I wanted you to
[00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:12.310]  elaborate on this. Recently, wasn't the ACLU one of the groups who protested the human rights
[00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:18.710]  violations down there in Miami? Would you also like to comment on whether or not you
[00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.430]  think that agency has kind of two-faced it?
[00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:28.470]  What the ACLU does is they pick up some good things like the Patriot Act. They write the
[00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:35.030]  resolutions so they're weak. They go out and create bad case law. They defend rights that
[00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:42.550]  don't exist. They will say it's a human right to be killed by the government. The ACLU overall
[00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:48.150]  is full of good people, but at the top it's very, very bad. I had the local ACLU head
[00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.150]  Ruth Epstein walk up to me at the Patriot Act meeting, and she means well. She's a useful
[00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.310]  idiot. She said, well, I agree with you on the Bill of Rights except for the Second Amendment.
[00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.790]  It's not an individual right. I got into an argument with her. I just said, oh, forget it.
[00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.310]  A lot of them are just useful, idiot liberals. They think, oh, right to die. It's not right to
[00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.030]  die. It's the right for the government to call somebody a vegetable that isn't a vegetable.
[00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.110]  Bob Schindler, comments on the ACLU?
[00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:23.510]  We were surprised that they actually came in support of Terry Poston. We thought they would
[00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:30.870]  be coming in support of Terry. Nevertheless, they mentioned organizations. You have the Hemlock
[00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:36.790]  organization as well that more than likely is funding a lot of the expenses that they're
[00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:46.150]  incurring. I also, in my opinion, and I say it's my opinion that this is term political,
[00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:56.550]  you have your newspapers who are anti-Bush. They're coming out now forgetting the consequence
[00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.590]  of what can happen to Terry, but they're opposing Bush.
[00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.790]  That's the problem with the leftists. They're opposed to the Bushes for all the wrong reasons.
[00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.750]  Had a Bill Clinton was doing something that was wrong, they'd be all for it.
[00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.950]  They're a bunch of political whores. Thanks for the call, Rodney.
[00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:17.910]  You mentioned Bill Clinton. If you recall, Bill Clinton's philosophy was the accuser.
[00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:25.270]  Whenever he got himself in trouble, the person that bore witness to that was always vilified.
[00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.190]  That's the same thing that's happening to us now through some of the media.
[00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:39.190]  They're attacking our family. We're insane for what we're doing.
[00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:47.270]  Another call. It's despicable. John in New York. John, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:52.790]  Yeah. I have a couple comments. One is if you go and you sign a contract,
[00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.350]  you usually have within 72 hours to rescind your signature. That's the law.
[00:21:57.909 --> 00:22:05.110]  Also, if they've committed a fraud or somebody fraudulently coerced you into signing a contract,
[00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.430]  you have a right to break that contract.
[00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:14.150]  Clearly, Michael Schiavo has been derelict in his duty as her guardian.
[00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:20.389]  Clearly, he held out false reasons for all of this. Clearly, he should lose his guardianship.
[00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:22.070]  How does that happen, Bob Schindler?
[00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:29.350]  Well, it should happen, but the particular judge that we're in front of has, I think,
[00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:34.310]  denied ... We tried to remove him, I think, four times as guardian,
[00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.150]  and the judge continued to deny that. There's no way to appeal that?
[00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:42.710]  We haven't appealed that, I don't believe, in the appellate court,
[00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.389]  but I know through this one particular judge- Well, maybe you need to appeal it on up the
[00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:52.070]  ladder. I'm not sure of that. I'll tell you what, we'll come back and take a couple more
[00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.750]  calls from Bob Schindler, then I'll shift gears into other important news as well.
[00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.470]  This affects us all, folks. They're setting a precedent to kill us.
[00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:12.870]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:31.410]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight central
[00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.890]  standard time. We're about to finish up with John, Tim and Jacob and then that's going
[00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:41.410]  to be it for the discussion of Terry Shivobe. And again folks, if you've studied this case,
[00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:48.130]  so many nuances to it, so many lies, so much media corruption. Just the stuff that happened
[00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:53.570]  with Larry King Live, how he gave Michael Shivobe about three times the time on the
[00:23:53.570 --> 00:24:00.370]  air that he was going to give the Shindlers, the parents. Whatever happened with that, Bob?
[00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:07.010]  That was rescheduled to sometime in the future and we're not sure exactly when we'll make that
[00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:13.970]  appearance. But Michael Shivobe, he got plenty of uninterrupted time, didn't he?
[00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:19.730]  Yeah, well he sure did. He had the full hour, I believe, on that show. Most of that,
[00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:30.690]  they don't really talk about the facts in Terry's case. And it's a smokescreen and as I said,
[00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:35.810]  they're coming after our family and anything to take Terry out of focus.
[00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:41.970]  It's all right to die, right to die. Hey, she wants to die, let her die. And then they never
[00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.410]  show the video or they don't talk about the facts of the case. It's again,
[00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.770]  keeping the people in ignorance. Well, they don't want to talk about Terry.
[00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:59.730]  And unfortunately, she doesn't have any type of therapy. And that's just so cruel is what it is,
[00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.890]  what's happened or what has been permitted to happen to her.
[00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:10.610]  Now, John in New York raises a good point. I mean, can't you start the appeal process to get
[00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:18.050]  Michael Shivo to lose his guardianship? I mean, he's with this other woman with two children,
[00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:24.050]  pregnant again, has refused any type of rehabilitation at the protesting of doctors.
[00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.290]  I mean, isn't that enough to get him removed?
[00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:35.970]  There's a case in front of Judge Greer to have him remove his guardianship. And that was filed
[00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:45.010]  in January of 2002. And the judge is just starting, just recently, has started to discuss that case.
[00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.930]  But it's sad, you know, in front of him for the better part of two years.
[00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.570]  What about filing complaints using the system's own tools against it,
[00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.930]  finding complaints where she's not being properly cared for,
[00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.770]  and filing those with the Health and Human Services?
[00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:07.730]  Yeah, there was a complaint filed with an agency that is looking into these complaints.
[00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.450]  So basically, you've been doing everything right as a father would.
[00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.290]  John raises a good point. John in New York, anything else?
[00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:21.570]  To clarify, more specifically, the fact that he was coerced in assigning the contract
[00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:30.050]  under the pretense that the guy was going to provide care, which was a lie, was a fraud.
[00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.970]  I mean, and that alone should nullify the contract.
[00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:40.690]  Also, you can probably get a psychiatrist, obviously, to be honest, to say that your
[00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.810]  daughter had just gone into this horrible state, and that you were in no position just days after
[00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.490]  to be signing away your rights, and that was done under duress.
[00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:55.090]  Yeah, that's all in front of Judge Greer in this district.
[00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:03.410]  And as I mentioned, there is a petition in there in front of the judge,
[00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.530]  or a motion to remove Perry's husband.
[00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.530]  But if he doesn't act on that in a certain period, can't it automatically go to appeal?
[00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.650]  I don't know. I really don't know.
[00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.610]  Anything else, John?
[00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:21.970]  I'll just say that the scumbag guy, I had to face him, and that situation happened to me.
[00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.370]  I'd make sure the guy doesn't live to spend the money. That's all I got to say.
[00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.970]  All right. We hope that there's no harm upon anybody here, folks.
[00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:37.250]  This is a nonviolent show, and I've always said that for defense, yes, it's good.
[00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.010]  For any offensive activities, it's bad. That plays into their hands.
[00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:47.570]  We wish no harm upon Michael Cockroach Schiavo. Any comments to that, Bob?
[00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:56.850]  Well, again, our main story, we're not here to wage war with her husband.
[00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.490]  All we want is to take care of him and getting the proper attention that he deserves.
[00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.370]  I might mention that people in the grassroots movement out there now,
[00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.610]  where people are starting to wear the ribbons and they're putting lights in their windows
[00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:16.370]  And that's good news for not just Terry, but everybody. We've got to expose, again,
[00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:20.930]  for people that don't know. They're killing people who are begging for food and water.
[00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.410]  Please give me water. We've listed the names. This is going on.
[00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.730]  Let's talk to Tim in Canada. Tim, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.250]  Hi, Alex. Hi, Bob.
[00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.810]  Hi, Tim.
[00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.170]  Bob, I've been watching this since it first became news.
[00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.730]  Listening to this show, it's been news for a long time.
[00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.090]  I was going to ask you the question, at what point you might take the law into your own hands,
[00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.410]  but I'm not going to ask you that question. I just would suggest that there might come a point
[00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.690]  in time when you might have to get a group of people and get her out of that hospice,
[00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.250]  take the matter into your own hands. I'm not suggesting violence.
[00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:04.850]  That is defensive. I understand people's outrage. I'm not saying that it's not founded
[00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.210]  in decent humanity. I'm just looking at this as a chessboard,
[00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:15.170]  how to save this dear woman. That question, Bob, I don't expect you to answer it,
[00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.970]  but I know it's gone through your mind. That's why they've got armed police at considerable
[00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:25.410]  expense guarding her to make sure nobody can get to her.
[00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.970]  It would discourage that, really. There's been a number of people that have
[00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:34.930]  made that suggestion. As a matter of fact, there were people that were coming
[00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.530]  to that facility to do such a thing, and we pleaded with them not to.
[00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.570]  Now, probably provocateurs. Well, we were concerned that-
[00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.290]  You could have been in handcuffs within 10 seconds of saying yes.
[00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.370]  Well, it's not only that- Get down on the ground,
[00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.730]  Schindler! You're going down! Get down on the ground! You would have had
[00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.889]  guys pull guns on you the instant you agreed. Well, we were concerned that the people who
[00:29:55.889 --> 00:30:00.770]  were out there, and we've had a vigil there for the past six weeks where people have been
[00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.410]  in front of that facility, and we don't want anyone to be harmed.
[00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.570]  That plays into their hands, but next time they pull the tube and it looks like she's
[00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.770]  going to die, what was it like watching her over seven plus days being denied water, Bob?
[00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:19.330]  I don't even want to get into that. It was horrible.
[00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.770]  Torture, I would imagine. Well, I can't imagine.
[00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:29.650]  And Shaivos, his mistress mother was one of the matrons that was there inside the room,
[00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:36.610]  literally guarding her against- They had belief and two woman matrons that were there,
[00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:45.330]  and his future mother-in-law was one of them. So, imagine the wife paralyzed from the top
[00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:50.770]  of the shoulders down, looking around fully conscious while the mistress
[00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:56.530]  mother is there. This is unbelievable. It's like a Shakespearean tragedy.
[00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.850]  Well, it's sick. It's the mentality of these people. It's just
[00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:05.730]  it's sick that they can sit here and watch a murder take place.
[00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:11.889]  Okay, Tim, thanks for the call. Fine points. Jacob in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:21.810]  Yeah. Hello, Alex and Bob. Hello, Jacob. You know, I haven't heard any real
[00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:30.450]  program for her healing. You need to get her on North Pole Magnetic Cap
[00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.090]  and get her on natural food.
[00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:37.889]  Oh, I know the natural food will certainly help. They won't allow her. She was eating
[00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:43.730]  food eight, nine years ago, and then they refused it. The doctors became quite angry, Bob.
[00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:51.889]  Yeah. There are a number of doctors who have volunteered pro bono to treat Harry.
[00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:56.450]  Doctors who have been successful treating patients like Harry, they have recovered.
[00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:04.450]  We don't expect Harry to be 100% ever, but we do expect her to recover to the point where she can
[00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:09.250]  reenter and lead a useful life.
[00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.090]  Well, it's like a line from that movie,
[00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:15.330]  The Quiet American, where the guy's son's dying of polio, and he says,
[00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.130]  I don't care if he's crippled. I just don't want him to die.
[00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:25.330]  Well, I think she deserves a chance, and that's what's been motivating us all these years.
[00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:31.570]  She deserves an opportunity to get some type of care to help her, and she's never had that.
[00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:37.170]  When you're in the room with the mistress mommy, how do you control yourself?
[00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:49.409]  Well, I won't go there either. It's just the feeling of nauseous how she could promote this.
[00:32:49.409 --> 00:32:52.450]  The thing is that her daughter's going to be marrying this guy,
[00:32:53.570 --> 00:33:00.290]  and if you believe in karma, I don't think I'd be that asked to be participating in something like that.
[00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.130]  I know you reap what you sow.
[00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:08.530]  Well, exactly. As a word of quorum, I think that God has a way of...
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.090]  Well, I'll tell you, the people involved in this have been busy
[00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:19.250]  digging a hole straight to Hades so they just can do one more little scoop and fall right in when they die.
[00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.650]  Well, it's just something that they're directly violating,
[00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.929]  I think, the will of God. At some point in time, they're going to pay the piper.
[00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.409]  Jacob, anything else?
[00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.889]  Well, that North Pole magnetic cap would really do her some good.
[00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:35.490]  I'd like to get her up to the North Pole.
[00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:45.250]  Canada tried to pass a resolution to allow Terry to immigrate to Canada.
[00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.090]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.330]  Oh, yes, I was aware of that.
[00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:53.170]  Yeah, they had that, and unfortunately it did not go through,
[00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.690]  but they wanted to make her a Canadian citizen and have her take refuge in Canada.
[00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.370]  It's totally disgusting, and it's happening to people in hospital beds all over the country.
[00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.650]  Thanks for the call, Jacob.
[00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:10.050]  Bob Schindler, the website terrysfight.org, links to it at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.730]  and we'll have you back on as this develops, hopefully for the better, my friend.
[00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.570]  Well, I hope so, and I thank you again for having me one of all your listeners.
[00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:24.850]  I keep praying for Terry, and hopefully things will work out the way they should.
[00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:25.890]  All right, thank you.
[00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:27.010]  And I thank you very much.
[00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.890]  Take care, my friend.
[00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:28.770]  We'll be praying for you.
[00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.970]  As you said, you need that.
