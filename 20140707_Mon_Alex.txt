[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:36.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.840 --> 00:43.880]  we are dispatching for reporters or as we speak right now on a non-stop flight
[00:43.880 --> 00:51.240]  from Austin Texas to Marietta California where the federal government has
[00:51.240 --> 00:57.800]  openly announced they're dispatching riot police to go after the terrorist aka
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.360]  the American people that would dare stand there as homeland security as I've
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.960]  always said designed to implode our sovereignty buses the illegals in and
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.400]  then signs them up for welfare CNN is saying it is racist to say the word
[01:13.400 --> 01:20.080]  illegal really if I try to move to Brazil or Nigeria or Japan they call me
[01:20.080 --> 01:24.800]  an illegal what's the point of even having a country and paying taxes if
[01:24.800 --> 01:30.840]  anyone that wants to come here can and is instantly legalized but the
[01:30.840 --> 01:38.960]  establishment just in plain view acts like anyone who isn't brain dead is an
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.520]  extremist is is out of control the truth is there's a large subsection of the
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.000]  Hispanic immigrants that's the majority of Latin America over 80% coming to this
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.720]  country who were hardcore anti-white anti-black racist and that's just on
[01:54.720 --> 02:02.040]  record there's also a large subsection a large minority of whites and blacks that
[02:02.040 --> 02:08.600]  do not like Hispanics this is just tribalism in poor black neighborhoods
[02:08.600 --> 02:11.800]  all over the country blacks population is not going up it's it's staying the
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.320]  same because more than half the blacks get aborted they're being pushed out by
[02:17.320 --> 02:22.640]  Hispanic immigrants so that's where the real clash at a sociological level is
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.880]  going on when we're talking facts here my issue with the giant flood of
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.200]  immigrants is not what color their skin is if we had a giant third world
[02:33.200 --> 02:41.560]  country of black people or white people to our south who called themselves the
[02:41.560 --> 02:48.200]  race and who hated everyone else who was not in the Raza and who literally and
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.600]  again I have this clip I asked you guys a few weeks ago we can't find it here
[02:51.600 --> 02:57.440]  call Steve Mason bound knows him well works with him I've known him for 15
[02:57.440 --> 03:03.000]  years 16 years that's not true 19 years he has all the clips he need to get him
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.400]  down here right now because he has the Texas Frontline show with the former
[03:07.400 --> 03:12.120]  mayor on his last day in office because what's old is new folks this is bombshell
[03:12.120 --> 03:21.720]  stuff saying that Hispanics are not the master race are the God race descended
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.860]  from aliens Gus Garcia and he said if they didn't legalize all the illegals
[03:25.860 --> 03:34.600]  he was gonna move to Mexico and last time I heard I think he did now most
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.400]  people saying all Europeans need to leave and whites are the devil they're
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.880]  actually trying to move wherever European civilization is that so I mean
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.640]  I'm just telling the truth here about all this ladies and gentlemen the only
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.320]  kosher group to act like flaming out of control racist is Hispanics and most
[03:54.320 --> 03:57.640]  Hispanics are not like that and they're wonderful people but there's a large
[03:57.640 --> 04:01.400]  minority that's bullying everyone any Hispanic you talk to American will tell
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.360]  you this you better join the Raza kind of like the Klan would bully whites to
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.440]  join the Klan or at least give it taxed at approval and that's all it is and we
[04:11.440 --> 04:20.320]  have clips of this Viva Lo Raza go back to Europe whites and my otas crackers
[04:20.320 --> 04:26.480]  and my otas you know these are the clips that that that we have I've done a lot
[04:26.480 --> 04:30.960]  of reports but we got so many reports I can't keep track of it all so Steve
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.400]  Mason needs to be down here two weeks ago because he has every clip under the
[04:35.400 --> 04:40.400]  known sun and moon and he's waiting to bring it all I mean the most hardcore
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.640]  stuff he's got more than Glenn Spencer's got you know playing it over the phone
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.440]  line but we have new clubs it's all coming up and I'm gonna go call him
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.680]  during the break I'm not mad I just some stuff falls to the cracks we're gonna
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.840]  call it's gonna happen and you're gonna hear the former mayor Boston a few
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.600]  years ago

[10:25.920 --> 10:38.320]  thank you all for joining us on this live Monday edition if if the establishment
[10:38.320 --> 10:46.120]  is able to dissolve our border and get away with the detonation phase that
[10:46.120 --> 10:50.040]  they're carrying out right now just letting the world know if you can get
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.280]  here you're gonna be put on welfare and given a voter ID card and driver's
[10:55.280 --> 11:02.120]  license and will be a protected political class above the law if the current
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.720]  detonation phase is successful if they're able to ignite this warehouse of
[11:09.720 --> 11:18.640]  dynamite all the fireworks you're seeing right now is the fuse burning if it
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.360]  ignites the tens of thousands every few days that are pouring in across the
[11:24.360 --> 11:29.080]  country conservatively according to border patrol and being instantly
[11:29.080 --> 11:36.720]  legalized with whatever fake IDs they've got that's their new identity it will be
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.920]  a permanent political underclass that can be used and abused and used as a
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.880]  political scapegoat to bring in a total police state there are so many angles to
[11:48.880 --> 11:55.160]  this it makes the head spin if they're able to detonate like the primer in the
[11:55.160 --> 12:01.240]  back of a 30 odd six or 308 cartridge if the hammer that's dropping right now
[12:01.240 --> 12:07.600]  hits the pin and drives it into that primer and if it detonates properly and
[12:07.600 --> 12:15.920]  ignites the powder in that shell casing it will fire a high velocity rifle
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.800]  round right through the heart at point blank range of the sovereignty that's
[12:21.800 --> 12:28.600]  left of this rag tag collapsing country and quite frankly obama care was a
[12:28.600 --> 12:34.400]  308 shot right to the head shutting off the power plants 308 shot right to the
[12:34.400 --> 12:41.440]  head it's kind of like sonny and the godfather were they filling full of a
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.760]  hundred holes that's pretty much what this is I mean they're just they just
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.600]  got us up against a wall just firing right into the country and the country
[12:50.600 --> 12:53.920]  bleeding out in front of everybody right now
[12:56.160 --> 13:03.460]  making our military serve on average seven combators making men with their
[13:03.460 --> 13:08.400]  feet blown off put prosthesis on and order them back in the combat that's
[13:08.400 --> 13:12.640]  like driving a million miles on a pair of tires knowing they're gonna blow up
[13:12.640 --> 13:17.040]  they have defecated all over our military they have defecated all over the
[13:17.040 --> 13:24.320]  dollar the globalists are literally waging total war at the siege economic
[13:24.320 --> 13:29.360]  cultural level I mean my god folks they teach kids two plus two equals five they
[13:29.360 --> 13:36.160]  go on MSNBC and say your kids don't belong to you CNN has come out and I
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.360]  have the article right here the I word is un-American and equivalent to the
[13:40.360 --> 13:46.560]  n-word this is the total hospitality and the cult-like political correctness
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.240]  that the system thinks the public is under that we can be lectured by an
[13:51.240 --> 13:59.800]  army of racial Mad Alclones like Sally Cone to do what no country has ever done
[13:59.800 --> 14:04.200]  before not just open your borders
[14:04.200 --> 14:12.240]  they pay you when you get here this is national suicide with a bunch of
[14:12.240 --> 14:22.880]  arrogant gang member mafia manager level Hispanics who feed I mean repeatedly
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.880]  they've caught city council and other people's brothers in Austin where I live
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.840]  running literal basements full of slaves look it up it's been in the news
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.920]  Hispanics that they are just sucking money out of their families once they
[14:36.920 --> 14:41.000]  get them up here as illegals beating them with baseball bats and stuff if they
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.760]  don't pay him more money I mean the truth is there's a big gangster LFA
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.560]  culture that fits in with the globalist banksters that has been abusing
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.920]  Mexico for a hundred years and so the United States and the average dumb white
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.920]  person who can't find their butt with both hands and who's totally guilty and
[15:00.920 --> 15:08.000]  hates the fact that they're white has no idea what's going on is being blamed for
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.080]  all the stuff going on in Latin America and there's a lot of reasons it's so
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.120]  hellish down there when it could be a paradise but one of the biggest issues
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.480]  is the big mega banks have been down there and the gunboat diplomacy and the
[15:21.480 --> 15:27.000]  rest of it keeping a corrupt cut cocky in charge of all those countries so they
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.360]  weren't easily manageable Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Mexico not I'm not
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.040]  the American people but the globalist technocrats that are dominating the
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.560]  whole world have been doing to Mexico what they're now getting ready to do to
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.040]  us so so understand it's not just sitting here saying oh Mexico's a bunch of
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.760]  idiots oh Mexico's failed oh Mexico's bankrupt oh my god how embarrassing it is
[15:51.760 --> 15:58.080]  you know you're from Mexico we're going to go that same path folks Argentina was
[15:58.080 --> 16:01.120]  the richest country in the Western Hemisphere more than the United States
[16:01.120 --> 16:07.200]  until about 1920 look it up now they're one of the poorest because they went
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.000]  under a political system of fraud and there and and they went the same
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.080]  direction we're going and the globalist are on record wanting a giant poor
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.160]  underclass look the the poor Hispanic underclass pouring in was not going to
[16:21.160 --> 16:26.640]  get free welfare and goodies forever they're going to be a permanent poor
[16:26.640 --> 16:33.120]  class that is basically kicked around and used and controlled and that's what
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.280]  the Robert Rodriguez's and the Gus Garcia's I'm talking bill I know in Austin
[16:39.280 --> 16:46.760]  Texas that's who these people are big rich office system fat establishment
[16:46.760 --> 16:52.840]  folks that literally manage the Hispanic market and they give you a
[16:52.840 --> 16:58.000]  Mexican flag and they give you some machismo and they give you some flash
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.760]  with bravada but at the end of the day it's all a Ford Foundation declassified
[17:05.760 --> 17:11.680]  CIA program from 1958 I made a film battle for the Republic breaking it
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.000]  down it's an extra on endgame all on record and I can have sociologists
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.080]  anthropologists on like Hamamoto who is from the Rockefeller Ford Foundation
[17:22.080 --> 17:30.240]  system he will tell you that this is not my opinion it is a fact that they want
[17:30.240 --> 17:33.360]  to divide and conquer it is a fact as I told you they get rid of national
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.400]  borders but create super borders and then sub ethnic states within the old
[17:38.400 --> 17:46.480]  super region within the old national region this is about the end of the
[17:46.480 --> 17:53.760]  middle class the end of a ladder up the end of prosperity and again it is
[17:53.760 --> 18:00.960]  totally illegal on record to bring illegals in put them on welfare give them
[18:00.960 --> 18:10.280]  IDs let them vote and then if you catch a citizen handing out fake IDs it's
[18:10.280 --> 18:16.400]  serious federal prison time because the feds want the monopoly on handing all
[18:16.400 --> 18:21.800]  of this out and Daniel Estolin who's Spanish and lived all over the world
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.960]  eight years ago in endgame breaks it all down from his Bilderberg contacts
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.960]  saying the plan is to bring the illegals in and break the country up because he
[18:32.960 --> 18:37.960]  has the Bilderberg contact but we're way past that now
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.680]  general Petraeus Nancy Pelosi all of them admit this is a plan for a North
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.880]  American Union where there's a giant underclass fighting with each other
[18:47.880 --> 18:52.160]  over diminishing resources with the energy prices going up to implode
[18:52.160 --> 19:01.280]  everything and to use the giant black market Hispanic class as a black market
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.160]  for the elite the Democratic Party like they used Akron as a money laundering
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.080]  operation and a child sex trade operation you could walk into Akron and

[24:05.760 --> 24:10.160]  Alex Jones here back live so the new talking point being put out by
[24:10.160 --> 24:15.920]  state-run media and the White House is be loving Latin America's a hellish
[24:15.920 --> 24:20.840]  place and you need to be sweet to all these people that are there let them in
[24:20.840 --> 24:26.080]  give them drivers license let them vote there's such good people but we have a
[24:26.080 --> 24:33.400]  clip that Rob do found that we're gonna play on the show of Governor Brown back
[24:33.400 --> 24:38.000]  when he was governor the first time he didn't want Vietnamese immigrants there
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.280]  coming out of Vietnam for political persecution and why because 90 plus
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.120]  percent of them vote conservative because they've been under the communist
[24:48.120 --> 24:55.880]  boot don't want Vietnamese because they look at the demographics they want
[24:55.880 --> 25:01.280]  Latin Americans who've been taught for 60 something years communism and being
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.680]  anti-American is how you fix things every time they have a revolution down
[25:05.680 --> 25:09.800]  there to get out from some under some fascist right-wing pig who isn't even
[25:09.800 --> 25:15.240]  right-wing they just call themselves that some general or some dictator it's
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.320]  always communism is the answer so the globalist love that if you read Carol
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.440]  Quigley's book tragedy and hope that was an elite state department CIA primer
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.600]  that wasn't meant to be republished that we sell by the way 1100 pages I've
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.200]  read almost the whole thing I skipped some parts of it and he explains we
[25:33.200 --> 25:39.120]  want fascism we want communism we want racist race-based regimes religious
[25:39.120 --> 25:47.000]  based regimes we do not want stable truly liberal regimes so to control that
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.600]  we've got to pose as liberals and take over the liberal movement and what do
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.920]  they do all over the Middle East and Africa you got a stable secular
[25:53.920 --> 25:57.720]  government we're going to blow your government up and hire your neighbors to
[25:57.720 --> 26:02.280]  invade or hire Muslims to attack look at what they're doing the Middle East
[26:02.280 --> 26:07.960]  right now causing a sectarian Shiite Sunni war the al Qaeda run ISIS forces
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.760]  are blowing up mosque all over Iraq to get the Shiites in a civil war they're
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.960]  doing it under orders if they wanted to win they would be nice to the Shiites
[26:17.960 --> 26:22.600]  they're not even Sunnis ladies and gentlemen they are globalist run to
[26:22.600 --> 26:28.640]  cause the class of civilizations just like the open borders are I'm not anti
[26:28.640 --> 26:34.720]  Muslim I'm anti-globalist radicalizing them and using Saudi Arabian radicals
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.200]  did he stabilize the world and I'm not against the poor Latin Americans I look
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.520]  at Latin American children and I have as much care for them as black children or
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.880]  white children I try to stop them being aborted as Robert Rodriguez why he
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.640]  doesn't protest Hispanics being aborted if he's such a such a man of the Raza or
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.440]  while these Democratic Party groups want to push Gardasil on Hispanic children
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.360]  mark my words you take that shot you're not going to have kids and I said that
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.720]  ten years ago during the trials and now it's confirmed it attacks your ovaries
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.000]  that's because I hate Hispanics obviously I don't want them being aborted see
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.760]  how crazy that is but what I don't like is a giant army of racist Hispanics
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.640]  being brought up here literally you have don't have third-grade educations with
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.640]  tuberculosis and scabies and cholera I mean that's what's coming in folks I
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.280]  won't go to Latin America my mother begs my dad to not go down there on aid
[27:39.280 --> 27:46.480]  missions to some of the worst places in South America because of all the shots
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.560]  and stuff he's got to take to making sick I mean I won't go report from South
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.280]  America because it's that scary unless you go stay in a five-star hotel and
[27:56.280 --> 28:03.000]  don't leave or stay on the resort and I don't want to do that you know how
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.640]  scary Latin America is you know how scary Africa is there's a phenomenon of
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.960]  racist American blacks you know the type that buy into Al Sharpton the rest of
[28:12.960 --> 28:16.680]  it because I've talked to some black professors on and off record of when they
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.520]  go to Africa it changes their views real fast again ladies and gentlemen and the
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.960]  globalists want to collapse North America they only want civilization in
[28:25.960 --> 28:35.680]  Luxembourg Switzerland London and a few other areas there it is Mexico to give
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.560]  HPV vaccine to all girls in 2012 and they lie and say it's the law just like
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.600]  here it's not the law the president just ordered it like he's a dictator this
[28:47.600 --> 28:54.840]  is incredible makes me sick we should be trying to get Mexico free we should be
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.280]  trying to kick out the elites down there but no no instead the big banks work
[28:59.280 --> 29:02.680]  with them let's go to the clip of the I mean when you go to Southern California
[29:02.680 --> 29:06.360]  we've got the videos you name it of images of white people's heads cut off
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.440]  and we're gonna kill you go back to Europe all the rest of it and we're

[29:41.120 --> 29:46.440]  official you'll never hear that on CNN because they want to use race to create

[33:19.760 --> 33:25.200]  American swarms or Mexican swarms 35 million people in Mexico City about a
[33:25.200 --> 33:31.800]  third of them living in giant open sewers built out of cardboard boxes I
[33:31.800 --> 33:35.400]  don't blame them wanting to come up here the problem is putting them on
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.480]  welfare in places like California that's already bankrupt many times over
[33:40.480 --> 33:46.320]  is only going to sink this country down the tubes if we had a chance to put a
[33:46.320 --> 33:51.520]  libertarian free market government in Mexico I would donate time and money to
[33:51.520 --> 33:57.240]  try to help Mexico I want to build up Africa that's why I got so upset about
[33:57.240 --> 34:01.120]  the murder of Muammar Gaddafi because you can say whatever you wanted about him
[34:01.120 --> 34:04.520]  I've interviewed the journalist you name it that have been there all over Africa
[34:04.520 --> 34:10.120]  he was building up all of Africa he was taking the oil money of Libya and he was
[34:10.120 --> 34:14.640]  living almost in a shack himself behind a big wall I'm not lionizing him it's
[34:14.640 --> 34:19.000]  just it's true and he was building up Africa and putting in water wells and
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  roads and oil wells and exploding an African Union for Africans and they
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.240]  told him OB buddies with the West brought him in for eight years set him up
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.520]  and killed him and now it's admitted in the Christian Science Monitor and other
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.720]  publications major studies that Libya is 10 plus times worse than in fact they
[34:38.720 --> 34:44.240]  even quoted it astronomically bad it is now Road Warrior where it was big
[34:44.240 --> 34:51.000]  hotels and giant roads and airports the globalists do not have anybody's
[34:51.000 --> 34:59.760]  interest at heart I wish that there that I could visit Africa and not be hated in
[34:59.760 --> 35:06.160]  almost every African country as a white man they just banned in African
[35:06.160 --> 35:16.560]  countries under Mugabe they just banned white period owning property again a
[35:16.560 --> 35:20.840]  race-based system because when you get dumbed down ignorant masses whether it's
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.840]  in the poor South people living in shacks they become members of the Klan
[35:24.840 --> 35:28.200]  because it's all they've got or poor people in Southern California who are
[35:28.200 --> 35:33.280]  Hispanic they become members of Larazza and Metsha the difference is you don't
[35:33.280 --> 35:39.760]  go to college or you don't get accepted in those communities unless you join it
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.080]  and it wasn't as radical in the 60s it's designed by the Pentagon by the
[35:46.080 --> 35:52.240]  globalist look this up and they have hundreds of TV and radio stations called
[35:52.240 --> 35:59.680]  the Raza or called la reconquista look it up it means the invasion or the
[35:59.680 --> 36:07.360]  reconquering and what are you conquering what with slums with drug lords with
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.680]  fluids running down the streets I mean I wouldn't mind being conquered by
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.720]  Switzerland right now I wouldn't mind being conquered by Luxembourg I wouldn't
[36:16.720 --> 36:21.200]  mind being conquered by the Ritz Carlton I mean you know if they were pro
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.200]  gun pro family I've been conquered by the eugenicist New World Order and so if
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.640]  you but waking up to the fact we've been conquered is the beginning of the end
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.040]  of this and so they want to make sure that Hispanics don't learn English they
[36:37.040 --> 36:40.800]  want to make the main language Spanish now first it was 10 years ago 15 years
[36:40.800 --> 36:45.880]  ago in Texas and California and Colorado and Arizona and Nevada oh let's just
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.160]  make it bilingual and then it's you know what we're just not going to teach
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.120]  English and you know what if you don't speak perfect Spanish forget working at
[36:53.120 --> 36:57.920]  this car dealership or at this restaurant or at this hotel and then
[36:57.920 --> 37:02.920]  the Hispanics don't learn the global language the imperial language of the
[37:02.920 --> 37:07.520]  British Empire that's spoken in every country by the ruling elite is English
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.840]  you want to advance speak English you want to be successful speak English is
[37:11.840 --> 37:15.720]  it good to know how to speak German or Chinese or Spanish or Portuguese
[37:15.720 --> 37:21.440]  absolutely is it good to know how to speak Bedouin or Arabic I would imagine
[37:21.440 --> 37:28.320]  so but you got to have one language English one language they don't want
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.040]  you knowing the number one thing they want to work for multinational
[37:32.040 --> 37:36.000]  corporation or to work in communications or work across the board is
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.200]  English English English English hey Robert Rodriguez knows how to speak
[37:41.200 --> 37:48.200]  English he got raised by a fluent white family a well-known architect yes
[37:48.200 --> 37:53.400]  Robert I know all about you and not only that you're a world listener and your
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.000]  wife's a listener but that you've joined a radical race cult and that you hate my
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.600]  guts and I know all about everything else to Robert and I just hope you can
[38:02.600 --> 38:09.120]  hold on to your sanity bud because you've gone crazy now continuing here
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.280]  ladies and gentlemen with all the things that are going when he hosts Obama
[38:13.280 --> 38:17.800]  this week to hike their leg on Texas and freedom and promote the LaRica
[38:17.800 --> 38:27.520]  on quista this is the reality of what's unfolding in this society and there is a
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.960]  rebranding where Americans are told you don't have a culture it's not freedom
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.440]  it's not guns it's not John Wayne that was manifest destiny it certainly wasn't
[38:36.440 --> 38:45.880]  perfect no it is gangster drug cartel the skinny one grim reaper how do you say
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.360]  that in Spanish there's the female skinny one in the male skinny one and then
[38:49.360 --> 38:52.760]  the big drug cartels either joining the male grim reaper or the female grim
[38:52.760 --> 38:59.280]  reaper I forget how you pronounce it Delgado is skinny no no no I'm not
[38:59.280 --> 39:02.360]  talking about the day of the dead that's another thing honoring your ancestors
[39:02.360 --> 39:08.440]  I'm talking about the sociology research I was doing we had a professor on his
[39:08.440 --> 39:13.000]  written a book about it and it's the death cult of Mexico and and they
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.400]  worship a the grim reaper you see it on the cars everywhere the point here and
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.000]  they worship the drug cartel leaders I mean this is the worship of thugs the
[39:24.000 --> 39:33.120]  worship of a chief the worship of El Jefe this is the worship of warlords this
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.560]  is like a Somali style government you wonder why Mexico can't field an
[39:36.560 --> 39:43.280]  Olympic team you wonder why Mexico acts like the Horn of Africa acts like
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.560]  Somalia because that's what it is now it's gone from colonialism that was bad
[39:49.560 --> 39:55.760]  enough out of Aztec slavery into colonialism and then into El Jefe is
[39:55.760 --> 40:05.600]  him and then now we're under El Jefe is him with Obama the big chief it's Santa
[40:05.600 --> 40:12.360]  Muerte Santa Muerte that's right that's the female one so so this is what's
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.720]  going on ladies and gentlemen and when you get a total culture of death it's
[40:18.720 --> 40:25.760]  over for your society it's very scary let me read the headlines at drudge
[40:25.760 --> 40:31.320]  report.com and we also have some of these up on info wars.com border

[42:10.920 --> 42:16.560]  head up riot police are standing by scum border patrol officials under gag
[42:16.560 --> 42:23.680]  order you know we broke that weeks ago now it's mainstream news war zone 11
[42:23.680 --> 42:31.040]  killed 61 did in Chicago land over the holiday weekend alone but you never hear
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.040]  about that in the national news where they have a total gunman under the
[42:35.040 --> 42:43.600]  absolute mob boss the former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel whose
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.800]  brother helped write the Obamacare and admitted on Fox News six months ago the
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.800]  plan is to bankrupt health care with Obamacare the plan is to bankrupt
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.400]  health care the plan is to bankrupt the border the border states the plan is to
[42:59.400 --> 43:03.480]  bankrupt the power plants and then that means you I can't tell you how many
[43:03.480 --> 43:06.840]  yuppies have sent me emails are on the streets said I don't care of the shut
[43:06.840 --> 43:11.560]  down power plants I don't own one idiots that's where you get the cheap
[43:11.560 --> 43:18.920]  power idiots that have electric cars and look down everybody else that has a
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.800]  gas powered car I'm not against your electric car but it takes in the
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.640]  equations more energy and more greenhouse gas to charge your vehicle then
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.360]  it does have a gasoline or diesel vehicle coal is better than natural gas to
[43:35.360 --> 43:39.680]  burn and cleaner and I love natural gas people always accused me of working for
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.120]  oil companies I haven't seen one nickel from an oil company I'll tell you my
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.440]  family's got some gas wells and they'd be making a lot more money if people were
[43:48.440 --> 43:53.440]  forced on gas like a lot of these globalists are pushing because they own
[43:53.440 --> 44:01.280]  gas as well so I would make money off gasoline getting shut down but I don't
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.800]  ladies and gentlemen because I want to keep the whole economy going I don't
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.200]  want to be the only person with money and nobody else has got it and again it's
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.800]  not that much money anyways hell all over East Texas and areas it's like most
[44:12.800 --> 44:17.600]  people have a gas wall in their backyard if not much comes out of them but we've
[44:17.600 --> 44:20.840]  got a few good size ones but they've got them turned off because gas prices are so
[44:20.840 --> 44:28.400]  low and again people don't understand energy they're saying they just know
[44:28.400 --> 44:35.920]  it's hype it's fun to say I'm part of the Raza and then CNN has the nerve
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.600]  here's the report that we've got the newscast up there as well Sally Cohn is
[44:40.600 --> 44:45.880]  a progressive activist read revolutionary overthrow technician columnist and
[44:45.880 --> 44:52.000]  television commentator and it goes on she says that the I word is un-American
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.600]  and equivalent to the n-word here's the quote from the transcript today most
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.960]  people find the n-word and the effort incredibly offensive let's hope that
[45:01.960 --> 45:06.400]  most of not all people will feel the same way about words illegals and immigrant
[45:06.400 --> 45:12.400]  illegal immigrants in the not too distant future these are people lawlessly
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.120]  trying to break our country lawlessly trying to bankrupt the nation saying
[45:16.120 --> 45:24.760]  your children belong to the state and then the White House resident training
[45:24.760 --> 45:30.400]  according to Joan Rivers I thought she was a snapping turtle myself the first
[45:30.400 --> 45:36.000]  lady comes out and says don't use the word bossy it as a anti-feminine
[45:36.000 --> 45:43.920]  quality anti-feminist connotation as if it does or as if it did so what it's
[45:43.920 --> 45:51.480]  your free speech we need to be brash and use words they don't like on purpose so
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.360]  these authoritarian control freaks who think they sit up there and lecture you
[45:55.360 --> 46:02.920]  and tell you what words you can use remember what happened last year when
[46:02.920 --> 46:07.780]  the city of Seattle said do not bring paper brown bags to work because it's
[46:07.780 --> 46:13.600]  offensive to minorities because they're brown and you go that's crazy no one's
[46:13.600 --> 46:17.520]  ever used brown bag in a racial connotation but so what if they did it
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.400]  just means a cheap paper bag this is crazy but then you understand they know
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.760]  it's crazy it's meant to say we define everything don't use brown paper bags
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.600]  don't use the word bossy don't have a Nerf gun in your backyard with your
[46:32.600 --> 46:36.320]  friends will expel you from school even though there's no authority to do it
[46:36.320 --> 46:44.400]  it's the raw naked crazy exercise of power to say we're gonna flood the
[46:44.400 --> 46:47.280]  country with 30 million illegals legalize them and let them bring their
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.840]  family members in and if you don't like it and you don't like paying for it
[46:50.840 --> 46:57.200]  you're a racist excuse me if you don't turn your guns in you're in the Ku Klux
[46:57.200 --> 47:03.160]  Klan excuse me the NRA was founded by the north at the end by Christians to
[47:03.160 --> 47:10.200]  arm blacks against the Klan on record indisputable fact and you're saying
[47:10.200 --> 47:14.680]  it's the Klan and of course it's gonna stir up a bunch of racist whites as
[47:14.680 --> 47:19.360]  well generally low-income who've been competing against immigrant labor and
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.200]  who've had immigrants do racist things to them look you take the average red
[47:23.200 --> 47:29.360]  neck poor white person the closest people there to is a redneck Mexican the
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.760]  Mexicans I know are more redneck than any white person I know cowboy trucks
[47:33.760 --> 47:39.200]  cowboy hats the exact even listen to country music because that's where the
[47:39.200 --> 47:47.040]  cowboy culture came from was Spain it came from Mexico folks I don't have
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.040]  anything against those people but they are taking them and branding them and
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.040]  getting Latin American immigrants that are mainly communist and are not
[47:55.040 --> 48:00.280]  really a Spanish culture which is European it's not even it's not even
[48:00.280 --> 48:06.840]  Mesoamerican it's just socialist dictatorships for 70 80 years and it
[48:06.840 --> 48:12.440]  goes on and on and on and they just get up here and it's a total takeover let's
[48:12.440 --> 48:22.960]  play the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan met your La Raza down there bullhorning in
[48:22.960 --> 48:28.520]  Marietta, California saying Viva La Raza up with the race up with the race of
[48:28.520 --> 48:49.280]  his panics here it is I mean that is a race based group 100% and that's
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.200]  nothing I mean if people are freaked out by this I literally have hundreds of
[48:53.200 --> 48:56.600]  clips of all this stuff that we're just gonna be airing here on the air and
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.080]  doing special reports on in fact get a bunch of them queued up for tomorrow and
[49:01.080 --> 49:04.120]  if we can for the nightly news tonight I want to shoot a special report on this
[49:04.120 --> 49:08.000]  that will also air tomorrow with all the different La Raza clips and again in the
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.720]  mayor of Austin saying Hispanics are the superior race I mean I mean this is out
[49:12.720 --> 49:20.360]  of control and they take the most poor dumb down people who have no future and
[49:20.360 --> 49:26.240]  who literally think white people are out to get them and blacks are out to get
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.360]  them and I don't understand why on Spanish radio it's acceptable you know to
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.480]  call black people blackbirds which is the n-word in Mexico
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.120]  Mayota and things are so politically correct I use that term it's like I was
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.160]  bad using it no it's these documentary form I am detailing what's going on here
[49:44.160 --> 49:49.960]  the truth is I know what comes around goes around I want black people super
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.480]  rich and affluent and powerful and successful because that's who I want to
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.280]  be around I want Hispanics to be super powerful affluent successful and amazing
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.880]  if I like your music or I like your culture I like you I don't look at what
[50:02.880 --> 50:08.840]  color you are and quite frankly there is an attack on white culture because it's
[50:08.840 --> 50:13.960]  seen as Western civilization to override it by the Democratic Party by the
[50:13.960 --> 50:19.320]  Southern Parliament Law Center and other groups and I quite frankly am sick of it
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.480]  I'm sophisticated enough being putting up with racism my whole life from blacks
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.080]  and Hispanics the minority of those that have bought into this I'm sophisticated
[50:29.080 --> 50:31.960]  enough to not blame all blacks or Hispanics but most people aren't
[50:31.960 --> 50:37.440]  sophisticated as I am and a lot of whites who weren't racist are so sick of
[50:37.440 --> 50:40.680]  being treated badly when they were bleeding hearts that they're bouncing
[50:40.680 --> 50:44.920]  back the other direction which is what the globalist want is to create total

[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:56.720]  incredible incident that's only now been released via the trial of what happens
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:02.400]  when you openly engage in open carry and you look at the look on this woman's
[1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:09.840]  face this cop I mean she sees the enemy and that is of course a citizen and they
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:14.120]  will come to known open carry demonstrations even in San Antonio and
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:18.520]  will arrest people till we show up 1500 and as soon as our demonstration was
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.880]  over when there was a few people left they would arrest them even though the
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:27.720]  state has said the ordinance in San Antonio is illegal the police chief
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:31.080]  doesn't care because because he knows best because we can't have people walking
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:37.320]  around with guns because you want to be the only one with a gun you want to feel
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:40.560]  special with a gun on your hip where we can't have guns on our hip now I know

[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:49.320]  pro guy because they get it but the police chiefs work for the feds by
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:53.800]  large I don't care if it's awesome Texas or San Antonio and they need to be
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:57.120]  put their place this is our country you're not the only one that gets to

[1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:36.800]  the death of money is his latest book the coming collapse of the International
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.040]  Monetary System we're gonna spend the first half of the interview talking
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:44.040]  about where he sees the current system going but he's also a major whistleblower
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:49.720]  who witnessed the insider trading leading up to 9-11 and he's gonna
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:55.120]  basically break it all down today proving complete prior knowledge by
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.720]  trading firms directly connected to the central intelligence agency and that was
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:07.560]  in Der Spiegel and a few US papers the week after 9-11 but not the details not
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:12.360]  an eye witness to it so this is bombshell info coming up here in just a
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:17.840]  few minutes again his new book the death of money now before we go any further
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:24.960]  we're seeing the controlled collapse of our nation as he said a few weeks ago in
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:29.240]  England General Petraeus former head of the CIA said we're getting rid of the
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:33.080]  US we're bringing in the North American Union they have to do that
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:38.560]  Mexico has opened their southern border to South Americans central Americans to
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.640]  flood that is only the detonator for the larger explosion for the huge waves that
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.800]  will come after that will dwarf it now and that's already beginning that's why
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.440]  they announced that they let the kids go free and now their parents and now the
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:57.920]  felons 36,000 of them in one release last month I must say that again the the
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:02.600]  the sheriff of Travis County where I live in Austin Texas where the syndicated
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:08.360]  broadcast comes to you from is criticized in the Austin Chronicle this
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:15.640]  week saying how dare him deport 13 people a week by the way those are
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:20.120]  aggravated felons they say Austin's supposed to be a sanctuary city a quote
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:28.320]  secure community but he's deporting 13 a week in a city of over a million 200,000
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:34.000]  people that has over 5,000 legals coming here a week oh my gosh it's just BS and
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:40.040]  disingenuous says Amelia Ruiz Fisher of the Texas Civil Rights Project
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:46.160]  basically a La Raza front run by Jim Harrington on Sheriff Hamilton's list is
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:53.000]  purporting to reflect serious offenses associated with the escom detainees but
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.800]  were arrested for those crimes not immigration offenses and they just say

[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.040]  huge deal and being done by design because before global governance can

[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:19.600]  James Rickards project.com is the website we'll put that up on screen for TV
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.900]  viewers thank you for coming on sir I really appreciate it and you've got the
[1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:27.800]  floor to break down in layman's terms but then more technical what we face
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:32.400]  where we are and then I want to get into the big picture and basically how
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:36.840]  people can protect themselves thanks for coming on. Thank you Alex great to be
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:42.600]  with you and yeah the the new book the death of money you know it sounds like a
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:46.040]  provocative title but it's actually not meant to be that provocative the
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:50.600]  international monetary system has collapsed three times in the past 100
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:57.600]  years it collapsed in 1914 again in 1939 and again in 1971 so these collapses
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:00.600]  happened every 30 or 40 years and it's been a little over 40 years since the
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:03.720]  last one now that doesn't mean it collapses tomorrow like clockwork it
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:06.480]  just means that no one should be surprised if it does and there are plenty
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:12.680]  of warning signs official actions pointing very much in this direction and
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:16.720]  then so what I do in the book is I take the reader through the instability of
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:20.360]  the system I say it's not a question of committing errors in the future the
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:24.000]  errors have already been committed the blunders have already been made it's
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.840]  like snow that's piled up and we're waiting for the avalanche we're just
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:30.120]  waiting for that one snowflake to bring it all tumbling down so that's actually
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:34.320]  fairly foreseeable what I try to do is say okay when that happens because it
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:37.680]  has happened three times before what comes next what will the future
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.040]  international monetary system look like and then go the way back to square one
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:44.560]  what can investors do today that to sort of prepare for that says that the big
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:49.640]  picture you know my first book currency wars came out in 2011 and if you open
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:52.920]  up the chapter 8 of currency wars guess what's there it talks about Ukraine
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:57.960]  gas prom Russia natural gas is a weapon etc in other words all the things are
[1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:02.560]  happening today we're in my 2011 book if you want to know what's gonna happen two
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:06.160]  or three years from now read the new book because that that really is the
[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:09.480]  purpose is to look over the horizon and see what's coming obviously everyone
[1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.320]  should get the book specifically everyone should get the book and it's
[1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:17.400]  available you can link through it James records project com or Amazon you name
[1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:22.680]  it go ahead let's get that specific with regard to the dollar galaxy you know
[1:20:22.680 --> 1:20:26.040]  when you when you write a book and it comes out hopefully you get a lot of
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:28.440]  things right but one thing to ask yourself is well did I get anything
[1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:31.520]  wrong is there anything I might have missed and and looking at the book which
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:34.240]  has only been out for a few months I would say the one thing is things that I
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:37.480]  thought might take a year or two to play out are actually playing out now knows
[1:20:37.480 --> 1:20:41.800]  this collapse is happening faster than I thought even when I wrote the book last
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:46.100]  year just to be specific imagine a stool with three legs and resting on the
[1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:50.640]  stool is the dollar and the three legs are Russia China and Saudi Arabia the
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:54.880]  three props if you will under the dollar let's take them one at a time Saudi
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.360]  Arabia that's basically the story of the petro dollar you know in 1974 in the
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:05.120]  late 70s the dollar almost collapsed at that time there was we had 50% inflation
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:09.760]  between 1977 1981 we had three recessions back to back to back you know the
[1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:13.720]  price of gold went up 2,000% it was a complete run on the dollar
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:18.160]  and just struck a deal with the with the Saudi Arabians with the the royal
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:22.640]  family Saudi Arabia to price oil in dollars now there is no reason then or
[1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:26.760]  now why oil has to be priced in dollars at the time it could have been priced
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:31.040]  in Deutsch marks or Japanese chance was Frank's or gold today it could be priced
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:34.680]  in euros maybe dollars and the other things but there's no reason oil has
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:38.960]  to be priced exclusively in dollars but it was not put an enormous prop under
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:43.560]  the dollar because everyone needs oil so if oils priced in dollars and you need
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:48.400]  oil that means you need dollars people who don't have any other reason to want
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:52.240]  dollars have to have them to buy the oil so that was a support for the dollar
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.480]  now what was the other side of the deal the other side of the deal is that we
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.640]  the United States would guarantee the national security of Saudi Arabia we
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:04.280]  would prop up the house of Saud now that deal lasted until last December last
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:08.760]  December President Obama stabbed Saudi Arabians in the back by anointing Iran
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:12.760]  as the regional hegemonic power in the Middle East now what that means is you
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:15.720]  know US is withdrawing power from around the world that's very obvious the
[1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:19.040]  president said so in his speech at West Point but what he wants to do is sort of
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:22.560]  leave a cop on the beat so in every hotspot around the world there's some
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:25.720]  power that's going to kind of take care of things in the neighborhood if you
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:29.600]  want to think of it that way well the US green lighted Iran as the cop on the
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.440]  beat in the Middle East we green lighted their nuclear ambitions I know
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:35.520]  there are these talks underway but the fact is the centrifuges are still
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:41.240]  spinning the Iraq reactor is still operating and that is only good for one
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.040]  thing which is a producer plutonium which is only good for one thing which is
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:49.480]  making atomic weapons and so that's kind of full speed ahead so the Saudi
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:53.520]  Arabians took that as a stab in the back and they should by the way in a
[1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:58.440]  recent briefing given by very high level US officials to the king of Saudi
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:02.680]  Arabia they went through this long you know 45 minute presentation about all
[1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:07.160]  the nuance in our policy with Iran and all that the king who I think is 91 or
[1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:11.960]  92 years old at the end of it he just grunted and said they get one we get one
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:15.400]  those are his exact words and what he meant was Iran gets a new Saudi Arabia
[1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:18.960]  they get nukes the next day they'll just fly him in from Pakistan so so now that
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:22.120]  we've reneged on our side of the deal no longer guaranteeing the security of
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:26.040]  Saudi Arabia they feel free to renege on their side of the deal of supporting the
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:29.280]  dollar so watch for the dollar sorry watch for oil to suddenly be priced in
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:34.280]  euros and other currencies now over to China what's China doing well China kind
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:38.440]  of painted themselves into a corner they bought almost three trillion dollars
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:42.600]  worth of u.s. dollar denominated securities for their research research
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:47.160]  your savings account so you know if you make 50,000 and you spend 40 you've got
[1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:50.520]  10,000 savings you can put it in the back of the stock market or whatever
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:53.800]  but so different with countries when countries run a trade store plus they
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:57.080]  have savings and they have to put it somewhere and in China in China's case
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.960]  the savings going to the trillions of dollars when they put all their savings
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:05.080]  into unfortunately for them US Treasury notes now there's no saying in banking
[1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:09.280]  if I owe you a million dollars I have a problem but if I owe you a billion
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:12.880]  dollars you have a problem because you have to collect the money from me so
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:16.640]  since we owe China three trillion dollars they have a problem they can't
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:20.520]  dump the securities they might want to but the market's not that big so what
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:24.800]  are they doing instead they're buying gold by the thousands of tons and just to
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:30.320]  put that in perspective there are only about 33,000 tons of official gold in
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.160]  the world official gold means the gold held by central banks and sovereign
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.040]  wealth funds and the finance ministries and so forth so it's only about 33,000
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:42.800]  tons in the world China has bought about 3,000 tons or 10% of all the official
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:46.160]  gold in the world just in the last four years now they have not disclosed this
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:51.280]  by the way you have to gather this from mining output Hong Kong imports covert
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:54.880]  sources they're using military and intelligence assets to do this but the
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:59.160]  evidence is there and this is all in my book as well so why are they doing that
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:02.800]  well they're creating a hedge position in other words they can't dump the
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:07.560]  treasuries but if we inflate the dollar which we're trying to do Janet Yellen
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:10.680]  has said we need more inflation inflation is just theft from savers mean
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:13.960]  inflation sounds like a technical word just think of it as someone reaching in
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:16.520]  your pocket and stealing your money that's what inflation is so Janet Yell
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:21.040]  says we need more inflation in others we we need more theft from savers well
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:23.840]  China is the biggest saver in the world they got three trillion as I mentioned
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:26.880]  so if we inflate the dollar they're going to lose on their paper but if they
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:30.760]  have enough gold gold's going to go up a lot so they're going to lose on the
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:33.400]  paper but they're going to make it up on the goals that's the way to hedge their
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:36.880]  position without dumping the Treasury securities that's what the Chinese are
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.920]  doing over to Russia we're in a financial war with Russia of course
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:45.000]  Russia invaded Crimea it's causing trouble in Eastern Ukraine no one left
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.040]  right or center thinks there should be a military response to that and there's
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:52.040]  not going to be but the US doesn't want to be seen to be doing nothing kind of
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:55.440]  rolling over playing dead so the president has announced economic
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:59.400]  sanctions which are a form of financial warfare by the way we've been in a
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:05.720]  financial war with Iran or had been from 2012 up until the end of 2013 but the
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:09.320]  president sort of called a truce in that war and eased up on the sanctions on
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:13.040]  Iran that was part of that stab in the back I mentioned earlier but now we're
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.160]  in a financial war with Russia by the way these sanctions are fairly tame you
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:19.520]  know sort of amounts to the fact that if you're all garks may not get to go to
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:22.640]  the Super Bowl next year but the bottom line and all those rushes different from
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.400]  Iran they can fight back they can seize US assets in Russia they can dump US
[1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:29.760]  Treasury securities raise our interest rates sink our stock market they can
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:33.320]  unleash their hackers to shut down the New York Stock Exchange so the US has to
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:36.440]  be careful about going too far in that realm because Russia can fight back so
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.880]  sure James these legs let me just throw this in and people just joined us
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:44.680]  James Rickards is our guest he's the best-selling author of currency wars if
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:50.360]  he's just tuned in and he's breaking down what his new book gets into that just
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:53.640]  came out a few months ago the death of money the coming collapse of the
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:58.960]  international monetary system and I want you to quantify for folks when you
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:02.840]  say US I guess you mean the collection of special interest kind of allied with
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:06.080]  the Anglo-American establishment or correct me if your views different than
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:13.320]  mine and what their worldview is I see them pushing such a complex strategy
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:16.640]  that there isn't even really a strategy at all they just think there's a
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:20.720]  strategy and they're destabilizing the whole world in a belief that they can
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.880]  manage crises for more personal gain for the political and elite corporate
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:32.080]  class but in the overall losing true American soft power in the end and
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:36.760]  bringing in a global crisis that basically could end superpower status
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:43.040]  for the United States we become some weird hermit third world you know
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:49.760]  dictatorship of the totalitarians well there is a difference between the
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.960]  United States government and America the beautiful I do think that's important
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:56.800]  bear in mind I'm really speaking about the government and official what do you
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:00.080]  think of what they've done in Alex yeah what do you think of what they've done
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:06.440]  well well look I just I don't have to get into any hidden conspiracies I just
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.920]  take the their actual words I met with members of the federal open market
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:13.080]  committee I've met with central bankers and privately not publicly but
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.280]  privately they will tell you they don't know what they're doing they are making
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:19.740]  it up as they go along exactly try this if it doesn't work if it doesn't work we
[1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:24.080]  pull it back if it works we try a little more I mean the Federal Reserve has
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:29.960]  had 15 separate policies since 2009 you know the forward guidance first it was
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:37.440]  2012 then it was 2013 now it's 2015 QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 which had part a part b
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:42.640]  operation twist currency wars you know you name it I mean on and on you have
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:46.720]  15 policies in five years you don't know what you're doing exactly so bottom line
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:50.640]  basically bottom line judgment day is coming and the question is what will
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:55.840]  judgment they look like well judgment day will look like a collapse of
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:59.920]  confidence in the US dollar and you know people say the dollar isn't backed by
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:03.560]  anything actually it is backed by one thing this is what Paul Rucker says I
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.920]  think he's right it's backed by confidence yes people believe the dollars
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.200]  historic value they will continue to use dollars but the minute they stop
[1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.440]  believing that the dollar can collapse like a house of cards now the problem
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:16.680]  with the Federal Reserve in particular I would say the US Treasury they take
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:20.000]  confidence for granted they assume it's always going to be there therefore they
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.200]  can do any policy they want and so good but confidence is fragile it could be
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.520]  lost quickly once you lose it it's very hard to get back all right James
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.200]  Rickards is our guest he is a heavy hitter comes highly recommended by Max
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:34.960]  Kaiser but I'm familiar with his work separately and he's really given us the
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:38.720]  non-political straight dope on what he thinks is going on and it's not really
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:42.440]  what he thinks like he said most of the stuff is on record we're gonna find out
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:46.220]  the time frame he thinks for the collapse how bad it's gonna be what you
[1:29:46.220 --> 1:29:50.320]  can do to protect yourself straight ahead we're on the March the Empire
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:56.920]  stay with us and full work start Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:47.640]  Fox News and other channels as well some very informative videos up there so so
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:52.200]  boiling it all down this is going to happen the question is when will it
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:56.800]  happen and my issue for you is I'm not an economist or you know top investor like
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:02.000]  you who's made so many accurate predictions I know it's coming but I
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.320]  already see prices increasing everywhere as the controlled media tells me prices
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:11.480]  aren't going up very much I already see when I travel out of the country the
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:16.880]  dollar is frowned upon in places just a few years ago it was it was smiled upon
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:25.040]  I already see all over the place signs of real depression in many areas and then
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:28.680]  I see the government gearing up for civil unrest the Department of Defense
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:32.440]  admitting it I mean they've got to know Obamacare is going to shut down the
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:35.920]  economy shutting down power plants is going to shut down the economy they've
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:39.840]  got to know open borders all of this I mean you're saying it's a bunch of
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:43.160]  ineptitude I know they have been trying everything under the sun I'm sure that's
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:48.200]  part of it but isn't there the vulture capitalist crony capitalist angle of
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:51.560]  this that a lot of insiders are going to make a lot of money out of a depression
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:56.160]  or do you disagree with that sir no I think that's exactly right in exhibit a
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:00.080]  I would say is Warren Buffett now look Warren Buffett has this image as the
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:05.000]  avuncular sage of Omaha the stock and best friend blah blah blah but when it
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.760]  comes to billionaires don't listen to what they say watch what they do
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:10.880]  Warren Buffett's last two big acquisitions to go back a few years he
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:14.880]  bought the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad now he bought the whole thing
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:17.480]  by the way it took a private didn't just buy a few shares he bought the whole
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.920]  thing now what is the railroad a railroad is nothing but hard assets it's
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:25.000]  right-of-way mining rice adjacent to the right-of-way rail rolling stock
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.640]  yards switches signals etc how does the railroad make money it moves hard assets
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.440]  as freight coal corn wheat steel etc so a railroad is the ultimate hard asset
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:39.680]  it's it's composed of hard assets and it makes money moving hard assets what was
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:44.400]  Warren Buffett's next big purchase he bought oil and natural gas resources and
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.320]  by the way he doesn't need the keystone pipeline because he can move his own oil
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:51.240]  on his own railroad you line up a hundred tanker cars you got a pipeline on
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.040]  wheels so Warren Buffett is a guy who's dumping dollars as fast as he can
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.520]  getting into hard assets it doesn't matter what happens to the dollar the
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:02.200]  dollar could be confetti which has happened before to other currencies he
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:06.280]  still owns a railroad he still owns oil he still owns natural gas he owns things
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:10.240]  that people need this is very similar by the way to what happened in the famous
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:15.320]  Weimar hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic in Germany in 1922 and 1923 we
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:18.920]  all know who the losers were the losers were the middle-class savers if you had
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:23.240]  money in the bank a pension and annuity and insurance policy
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:27.480]  retirement income a steady job you were the loser because all of your fixed
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:30.600]  income assets were wiped out but there were a lot of winners to the winners
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:33.760]  were the industrialist people with factories if you have a factory it's a
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:36.160]  factory it doesn't matter what the currency does people who had gold and
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:39.920]  Switzerland people who had assets overseas they were the winners because
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:42.600]  they were not wiped out then they went around and bought up all the losers
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:46.440]  consolidated industrial holdings into relatively few hands then they decided
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:49.600]  that Hitler would be a good puppet for them that didn't work out too well in
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.120]  the long run but we've seen this movie before so watch what Buffett does he's
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:57.480]  dumping paper money again into hard assets but there are many many other
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:01.360]  examples and you know Alex when we talk about this collapse I think the the
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:04.560]  government and the Federal Reserve would like to avoid it but there's another
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:08.040]  part of them that knows it's coming so they've got their own plan and behavior
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:12.480]  ready and like we said earlier you don't have to you know break into a safe in
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.800]  the middle of the night they actually put this stuff on their website go to the
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:19.160]  IMF website the International Monetary Fund website they published a paper in
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:24.840]  January 2011 it's on the website as a 10-year plan to make the SDR that's the
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:28.480]  special drawing right SDR stands for special drawing right the global reserve
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.080]  currency now what's an SDR well stands for special drawing right that's a
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:35.920]  really geeky name what it is is world money now so why did they call it an
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:39.400]  SDR well they knew if they called it world money it might scare people so they
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:43.040]  gave it this really you know technical names so people was sort of young and
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:46.720]  and looks somewhere else it's kind of like the Federal Reserve I mean the
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:49.880]  Federal Reserve is the Central Bank of the United States why did they not call
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:52.760]  it the Central Bank of the United States in 1913 because they knew that
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:55.920]  Americans hate central banks so they call it the Federal Reserve well the
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:00.680]  same thing with this world money it's the special drawing right now by the way
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:04.480]  there's nothing new about SDR's they were invented 1969 they've been issued
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:07.360]  from time to time they were actually issued in 2009 I might have been the
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:11.600]  only guy outside the IMF to notice but this is just printed money and by the
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:14.600]  way the easiest way to understand it it's not that technical the Federal Reserve
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:18.400]  has a printing press they can print dollars the European Central Bank has a
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:22.600]  printing press they can print euros the IMF has a printing press they can print
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:26.720]  SDR's and they do and they have and they're not backed by anything it'll be
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:30.640]  highly inflationary except when we so the next time there's a liquidity crisis
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:35.120]  remember the last time there's liquidity crisis and a financial panic in 2008 the
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:39.040]  Fed bailed out the whole world we know they printed four trillion dollars but
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.560]  that was just the tip of the iceberg they did tens of trillions of dollars of
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.960]  swaps guarantees guarantee every bank deposit in America
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:51.860]  guaranteed every money market fund in America propped up the system for the
[1:42:51.860 --> 1:42:55.680]  benefit of you know the elites the power leads who who actually benefit the
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:59.000]  most from that but there's but there's a problem they're tapped out and there was
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.080]  they haven't unwound any of that a lot of that's still in place so when the
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:05.720]  next crisis comes it's going to be bigger than the Fed they're not going to be
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:09.920]  able to go to 8 trillion or 12 trillion on their balance sheet because they'll
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:13.000]  destroy confidence so where is the liquidity going to come from it's going
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.280]  to come from the IMF in the form of SDR's it will be highly inflationary but
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.640]  no one will understand what's coming from I call the IMF transparently
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:23.720]  non-transparent and what I mean by that is they transparent in the sense that
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:26.760]  they put these plans on their website but they're not transparent in the sense
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:30.400]  that no one understands them because it's all tech they try to play both sides
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:34.960]  and they they consolidate power on the way up in the bubble they consolidate
[1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:38.640]  power during the collapse always posing as the savior they never get in
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.400]  trouble so you broken down the technicals beautifully and I know your book
[1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:45.920]  it's in a more detail how bad is it going to get because they're funding
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:50.320]  destabilizations in Eastern Europe there they're funding you know this new
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:55.360]  caliphate running around starting a civil war blowing up Shiite Mosque there
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.920]  the I mean look I understand they don't know what they're doing at many levels
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:02.480]  trying to put it off so they can say they try to do it but on the other hand
[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:06.640]  they're trying to destabilize things at the same time I mean the evidence is
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:10.360]  there what do they think they're going to get out of this what we where is
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:14.680]  America going how bad is it going to get and what's the time frame because am I
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:19.800]  wrong in saying that we're seeing major signs that the creep towards the exits
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:23.840]  at the movie theater is starting to go a little bit faster here because it looks
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:28.080]  like the dollar's in trouble here well at the dollar's in trouble but so are
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:31.360]  global capital markets and your designs are everywhere so let me give you a very
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:34.960]  concrete example so we're watching the stock indices you know I guess the stock
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:37.800]  markets off a tiny bit today but they've been going up and up and up there at
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:41.840]  all-time highs at record highs and the mainstream media says hey happy days are
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:44.400]  here again stock markets at an all-time high get out there and buy some stocks
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.400]  meanwhile this is going up on very high leverage meaning borrowed money so New
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:51.720]  York Stock Exchange leverage is at an all-time high and it's going up on very
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:55.120]  thin volume which means that not many people are participating but meanwhile
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:59.840]  what the experts the pros are buying put options now a put option is a way to bet
[1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:02.800]  that the markets going down so let's say I have a lot of stock and it's been
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:06.160]  going up and I've been making a lot of money well I might want to get out but
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:10.120]  if I start selling if I start selling the stock I might be the snowflake that
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:12.840]  causes the avalanche and I don't want that to happen so what they do is they
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:16.480]  go over here to a different market they buy put options which is a bet the
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:19.920]  market's going to go down now remember the Chinese they got the paper but they
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  also have the gold yeah pros harry stocks but they also have their hedging so
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:27.720]  when the market crashes a little guy is going to get wiped out on this 401k but
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:30.360]  the big guys you have all those money on the stocks but they're going to make
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:33.520]  money on their puts and lock in their profits this is the kind of thing that's
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:36.400]  going on behind the scenes you have to be bit of an expert and bit of a
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:40.560]  technician to see it but it is visible that all this is publicly available and
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:43.960]  it's accelerating correct they're not just hedging now from what I've seen
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:49.680]  they're piling on to getting out of all the pop assets on the Nasdaq and the
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:56.880]  Dow Jones and they're moving into the most hardcore of a stable assets right
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:59.240]  well they want to do well some of them are doing that Warren Buffett's a good
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.680]  example but for people who want to hedge themselves without good memory if you
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:05.920]  start selling the stock you might be the guy who causes the avalanche what they're
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:09.880]  doing is keeping the stock to some extent but buying these put options so now
[1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:12.720]  they're hedged the market could go down they don't care because whatever they
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:16.520]  lose in stocks they'll make in the puts but the little guy is not a how long can
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.760]  this go on how long can this go on well one of the hard things is some of these
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:23.360]  things can go on longer than you expect won't go on forever I don't think it'll
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:25.760]  go on much longer I don't think we'll get two or three years down the road we
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:28.200]  might not get one year down the road I don't want to say it's gonna happen
[1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:32.200]  tomorrow because the thing about bubbles they go on longer than we expect but I
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:36.240]  wouldn't be waiting for today see a lot of people you know that I talk about the
[1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:38.960]  soul of the world Alex and people invariably come to me and they say
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:42.200]  something to the effect of you know hey Jim call me at three o'clock the day
[1:46:42.200 --> 1:46:46.120]  before it crashes I'll sell my stocks and buy gold and I say it doesn't work
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:49.680]  that way I'm not going to know the day before I can see it coming for sure but
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:52.640]  I'm not going to know the day before the time to prepare is now the time to get
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:57.200]  out of stocks get some gold don't go overboard I recommend 10% gold other
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.840]  kinds of hard assets fine art etc the time to do that is now by the way for
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:06.160]  the small investor when you want gold when when gold starts gapping up when I
[1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:10.760]  say gapping up $100 an ounce boom next day up $200 an ounce boom next day up
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:14.720]  $300 an ounce a week goes by it's up $1,000 an ounce is funny way that's
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:17.840]  what most people are going to say oh gee I better get some gold guess what you're
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:21.040]  not going to be able to find it the mint will stop shipping your local dealer
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:25.800]  will be out you want to get it beforehand having wealth funds correct that's
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:29.600]  exactly look at the Chinese government the University of Texas they've all
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:33.200]  been quietly hoarding it while they use all these naked shorts and things to
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:38.000]  drive down the overall price of gold but as real inflation kicks in you know all
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  commodities I don't think they can suppress the price of gold much longer I
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.840]  would imagine it's going to go up in the fall what do you say well usually does
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:50.040]  go up in the fourth quarter fourth quarter is usually strong for well I
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:53.320]  think the detectives have is good I I was in Switzerland recently and on this
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:57.440]  last trip instead of visiting the banks which I usually do I want to see the
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:00.960]  guys who actually store gold the top secure logistics firms in the world and
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:04.720]  the guys who actually refine gold so people handling the physical stuff they
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:07.480]  told me stories that'll make your hair stand up stand on down talk to the
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.960]  largest refiner in Switzerland he said he's working triple shifts so 24 hours
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:17.840]  a day he's producing 20 tons of gold a week the Chinese are taking half so
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:21.320]  there's 10 tons of gold a week going to China times 50 weeks you know that's
[1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:24.320]  500 tons a year remember I mentioned earlier there's not that much of visual
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:28.320]  gold in the world so he said the Chinese want more but he said I won't sell to
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:31.920]  them because I have to take care of my regular customers and he said for the
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:35.880]  first time I'm having trouble sourcing gold meaning you know when you're a
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.880]  refiner you take gold from you know scrap and jewelry and miners and other
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:43.880]  400 ounce bars and you re-refine it into what the Chinese want which are one
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:48.480]  kilo bars of 49 purity he said I'm having trouble sourcing us so long as
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:53.320]  the last time that happens this never happened so the the technical setup is
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:57.720]  very strong gold is just you know the reason gold had a week here in 2013 was
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:04.040]  because the exchange trade of fun GLD that's the ticker symbol to scourge 500
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:08.280]  tons that was a raid on the GLD warehouse by the big banks who control
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:11.960]  that warehouse because they were sending that gold to China well you can't do
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:15.440]  that twice I mean you can do it once because they had I guess about I think
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:19.800]  about 1100 tons at the beginning of the year so take away 500 tons now you're
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:22.680]  down so now is the time and you're viewed to buy gold that people never do
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.920]  they only buy once it's racing up it's it's of course I buy when it's low about
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.400]  most of my gold but did about 300 to 500 dollars and haven't sold any of it we're
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:37.720]  gonna come back and and I go to break sir and I want to segue into really the
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:41.440]  bombshell information that you let out a little bit on Max Kaiser show on RT a
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.720]  few months ago and I know it was in Der Spiegel and and some of the German
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:51.560]  newspapers at the time but you were a witness according to Max to this to some
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:58.040]  of the insider trading prior to 911 so I want to go to break and come back in the
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:02.320]  next two little short segments and really you know have you break that down
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:05.320]  and what that signifies because you know you're saying you don't know the day
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:09.400]  before something's gonna happen but other people did and I remember also in
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.000]  the papers it wasn't just that there were you know FBI agents and Secret
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.680]  Service people and there were little kids that said those towers won't be there
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:21.800]  next week and then that all got shut down so there's a lot of people that knew
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:27.400]  a lot of people that across the board who didn't go to work that day and those
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.440]  are not conspiracy theories the media has tried to turn it into those with red
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:36.080]  herring fake stories and things but undoubtedly that's a big deal so our

[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:13.280]  Alex Jones third hour is coming up our guest will be with us a little bit into
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:16.960]  the third hour and I plan to get into other news and open the phones up here's
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:23.080]  a headline on a voice of Russia Beijing Seoul at South Korea's capital agree to
[1:54:23.080 --> 1:54:28.640]  direct trade in national currencies that's a big deal is to have massive
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:33.400]  amount of trade that then ends up here I mean the dollar is being cut off every
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:39.080]  day and it is just very very frightening because I talked to the average
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:42.120]  person out there and they say I don't care of the shutdown coal power plants I
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:45.920]  don't care they shut down somebody's business I don't own it I don't care of
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.240]  the dollar dies let it die Alex this system needs to come down America's
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:56.920]  corrupt I'm sick of it let it all come down well yeah it is corrupt but it's
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:02.680]  not America it's a multinational system and it's gonna hurt us folks it's gonna
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:06.320]  hurt the average person I don't care if the stock market goes down I don't own
[1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:11.240]  any stock it affects everybody you work for where you go the bonuses you get it
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:15.200]  is this ridiculous how self-centered the average American is and I'm not saying
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:20.480]  everybody but we were very morally upright people on average when we had the
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.200]  Great Depression and it was rough and I think what we're about to see could be
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:27.840]  even worse what do you briefly say to that James records best-selling author
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:32.160]  and a top analyst about what a depression would look like with this
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.240]  type of population well if you want to know what a depression looks like look
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:44.000]  around Oxford and the depression this depression started in 2007 and it will
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.160]  continue indefinitely until we get some structural changes which I don't see on
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:50.600]  the horizon now a lot of people don't know what the meaning of a depression is
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:54.640]  they assume it means continuous declining GDP but that is not the
[1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:57.920]  definition you can have growth in a depression what it means is the growth
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:02.960]  is depressed relative to trend so a trend long-term trend of growth in the
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:05.840]  United States is say three three and a half percent and by the way in the
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.480]  short run you can grow four five or even six percent as we did during some of the
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:14.360]  years when Ronald Reagan was president because you're bringing unemployed
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:18.160]  people back into the labor force at a faster rate so trend is three and a half
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:21.840]  percent short-term growth is four or five percent but if you're actually growing
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:25.800]  at one two percent which we are that's a depression it's the gap between the
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.600]  potential and the actual and that represents lost wealth and never make
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:34.200]  it up so I mean you have to be 90 years old today to have a living memory of the
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:38.040]  Great Depression so essentially all but basically no one knows what it feels like
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:41.360]  well except what we do it feels like this and I've had people say well Jim if
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:44.120]  we're in a depression where the soup lines the soup lines would hold foods
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:47.760]  because you get your food stamps on a little debit card and you can walk in
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.200]  to hold foods and get some gourmet soup to go so it's not that we don't have
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:56.200]  soup lines but they're just in the supermarket is there on the streets but
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.880]  you look at labor force participation you look at real wages you look at
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.880]  unemployed underemployed people working part-time which they have full-time jobs
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:07.880]  actual growth we're in a depression now now could it get worse yes it could get
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:11.360]  a lot worse because you can put a financial panic or financial collapse on
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:15.640]  top of a depressed economy and that's what I see come sure I mean if the
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.040]  welfare checks don't show up or they don't have the buying power it's the
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.440]  same of them not showing up cities will burn I mean that's just a fact that's
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:26.000]  and the Pentagon knows that do they think a bunch of armored vehicles are
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:31.360]  going to keep everybody safe well they're hoping it doesn't come to that but
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:34.760]  they're certainly prepared for it I mean we see you know not news really the
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:38.680]  militarization of local police as I said these are not your local police force
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:42.400]  are not people who get kittens out of trees they've got flashbang grenades
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:47.440]  high-tech battery ramps night vision goggles tear gas automatic weapons you
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:51.480]  know body armor armor personnel carriers and they'll break down your door for you
[1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:55.480]  know a simple you know credit card for it or something so and it was a case the
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:59.480]  other day where sadly they threw a grenade and blew the face off a two-year-old
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:04.160]  child sleeping in a crib so that's your local police force if you're illegal and
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:08.360]  have an aggravated felony you can come right on in I mean this is becoming
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:11.720]  bizarro world stay there we've got a little five minute segments sir after
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:14.760]  one minute break where I want you to finish up on the collapse in your book
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:18.160]  and and what you mean by the death of money I haven't read the book yet I
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:22.840]  read your last book years ago and then I want to in that next segment you've
[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:26.400]  agreed to stay with us about 15 after so I want to get into the insider trading
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:30.400]  because folks you're one of the only eyewitnesses of this it was confirmed
[1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:34.440]  but not the details so the third hour is coming up folks tell your friends and

[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:34.000]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:38.260]  us with us until the end of the next segment is James Rickards that's
[2:00:38.260 --> 2:00:43.200]  something author of currency wars and I'll give you his website as well it's
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.400]  James Rickards project comm it's an excellent website a lot of videos and
[2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:50.680]  information there only about five minutes of this segment got a 12 minute
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:53.360]  segment coming up then we'll let you go because I know you're a busy man
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:59.000]  appreciate the time finishing up with what does your gut tell you because you
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:03.760]  know rich elites can always run to the next safe country but to me the United
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:08.240]  States does not look like a very good place to be during a full-on collapse
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:13.600]  20% chance of full-on collapse 50% I mean the depression just keeps getting
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.640]  worse and worse I agree about all metrics within a depression since 2008 or
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:23.080]  earlier most real economists agree with that I mean how bad will it get well the
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:26.400]  next financial crisis will be the worst in history Alex that's not just an
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.760]  opinion or wild guess it's actually based on the science of complexity which I
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:35.280]  talked about in both my books said the death money and currency wars complexity
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:40.800]  theory basically looks at the scale of a system that's a fancy word for size but
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:45.560]  but here's the point when you triple the scale of a system you don't triple the
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:49.720]  risk you increase the risk by an exponential factor 10 or a hundred
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:54.240]  times so 2008 what did we hear about ad nauseam too big to fail too big to fail
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:57.560]  too big to fail well guess what the five biggest banks in the United States in
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:02.320]  2008 today are bigger they have a larger percentage of all the banking assets
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:06.520]  their derivatives books are bigger so everything that was too big in 2008 is
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:11.000]  bigger today which means the next collapse will be exponentially bigger and
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:14.680]  it was all the Fed could do to put out the fire last time the next one's going
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:18.200]  to be bigger than the Fed it's going to be over to the IMF and there's no by the
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:20.880]  way I talked earlier about these special drawing rights that's the world money the
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:24.880]  IMF issues well there's no way they're issuing that without Russian Chinese and
[2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:28.840]  other people's approval because they're all members of the IMF the G20 is sort
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:33.120]  of the fact of board of directors of the IMF and they're not going to say hey yes
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:36.360]  this issue a bunch of SDR so we can prop up the dollar they're going to say let's
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:40.440]  issue SDR so we can bury the dollar once and for all now the impact of this is
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:46.120]  just inflationary at best and possibly hyperinflationary it doesn't mean the
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:48.880]  dollar is going to go away you'll still have dollars but they'll be like
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:53.280]  Mexican pesos notice the dollar will be a local currency that you use to go down
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:57.440]  to you know restaurant or hairdresser or whatever but it won't be used for the
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:01.640]  big things when I say the big things the price of oil settlement of balance of
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:05.680]  payments between countries probably the financial statements of the hundred or
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:10.680]  so largest global corporation so you know some few years from now when you
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:14.200]  get your financial statement from IBM or General Electric it'll all be stated in
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:17.720]  SDRs because they're really global corporations so this SDR is the coming
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:20.480]  thing now it might not work it will definitely be tried as I say the
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:24.040]  blueprints already there it's on the IMF website secretary Geithner talked about
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:27.200]  it he said he was open to it madam Lagarde Christine Lagarde head of the
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.600]  IMF talks about all the time so the plan is already there it will definitely be
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:34.400]  tried whether it works or not is a different question if people lose
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:37.920]  confidence in the dollar why would they have any more confidence in another
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:41.240]  form of paper money called the SDR well if it works it will only be because no
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:44.200]  one understands it which is why education is so important that's why I've
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:47.840]  read my books and do interviews like this one just try to explain it to people
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:51.800]  in very straightforward terms if it fails however which it might then you're
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.680]  probably going to have to bring gold back into the picture not because you
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:59.040]  want to but because you have to just to restore some confidence but there's
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:02.920]  another side to this which is as what I call the money riots break out as
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:08.560]  confidence is lost as society begins to disintegrate you'll see a neo-fascist
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:14.560]  response executive orders military as local police national guard we already
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:18.520]  have the wiretapping we already have the surveillance the cameras are there by

[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:24.880]  they're actually surveillance and addiction points on the new thing of
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:28.040]  course is the drive you know the driverless car well actually going
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:30.600]  around a driverless car and the government wants to turn it off and come

[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:21.600]  you should get it just the graphs and quotes and documentation this guy no
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:25.720]  wonder Max Kaiser says this guy's about as good as it gets to real analysis I
[2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:30.120]  hope they'll come back on the show every few months I just to go over things and
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.320]  give us his perspective before we go back to him when he leaves us we're gonna go
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:39.320]  to your phone calls and then we're gonna cover the CBS news story LAPD to no
[2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:45.320]  longer comply with feds on immigration hold request of felons of criminals not
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:49.760]  not just the people that are there illegally and you wonder how the
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:53.160]  illegals come here from all over the world to rape and kill and serial kill
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:57.800]  from Eastern Europe and Europe and Africa and Latin America we always pick on
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:02.080]  Latin America because that's 80 plus percent I mean is people fleeing
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:06.920]  justice you just get on a plane or a bus you're here you're legal I mean this is
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:12.560]  crazy town by the elite and LA is a total globalist takeover base the third
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:18.280]  world realization and it's a look at this image if you're watching us on TV
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:22.880]  LAPD no longer comply with feds on immigration hold request and it just
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:27.520]  shows them all up there and there's a video announcement that this the if
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:32.760]  you're illegal you're above the law they will not hold illegals to be picked up
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:36.200]  by ICE when they've committed crimes they will just release them and then
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.040]  they'll just I just can't believe it that's political correctness I guess if I
[2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:43.760]  robbed a bank the cops pull up with guns down I go hey don't be racist they
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:47.960]  probably say mr. Jones let us escort you with the money right to your vehicle I
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:54.800]  mean literally wow all right shifting gears into the big subject and giving
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:02.720]  him the floor to break it down insider trading 9-11 please tell us sir again
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:05.400]  for the folks that just tuned in what you were doing at the time your
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:09.200]  background James Rickards again best-selling author of the death of
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:12.280]  money and of currency wars joins us he's been on with us for over an hour
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:18.240]  getting into the current financial situation but now the big enchilada we
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:21.480]  know was under Spiegel and a few other publications if you just joined us that
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.640]  there was insider trading connected to the executive director of the CIA
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:32.280]  Buzzy Cron guard that investigation got shut down he was inside one of these
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:36.240]  major financial institutions while this was going on and and is one of the
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:40.160]  only witnesses to what happened I want to give you the floor James they have a
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:45.120]  lot of courage to talk about this tell us exactly what you saw well a couple
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:48.040]  things Alex the first thing I think the most important one you have to
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:53.880]  distinguish between inside trading and what some commentators call inside job
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:59.520]  and they just get blurred together insider trading just means somebody knew
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:03.240]  about the attack in advance and they went into markets and either sold stocks
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:06.960]  or bought put options which is the same thing as the selling stocks or they
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:10.680]  bought bonds which are different to make money when the attack happened that is
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:14.160]  non-debatable I cover this in chapter one of my book it happened there was
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:18.000]  insider trading there's tons of evidence of it when I say evidence I mean
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:23.080]  statistical forensic anecdotal it absolutely happened now inside job is
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.120]  different that somehow suggested the government US government had something to
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:31.400]  do with it I've seen no evidence of that and by the way I went down there now
[2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:36.560]  after 9-11 I mean I'm talking in the immediate days not six months or a year
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:39.720]  later when it was a memorial when a tourist attraction I'm talking when
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:44.680]  flames were still coming out of the rubble the military set up a secure
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:47.840]  perimeter around lower Manhattan there were various checkpoints at Canal Street
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:54.160]  and Church Street if you know the area you you needed security clearance or some
[2:12:54.160 --> 2:12:57.840]  official business or you had to be in the maintenance of one of those buildings
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:02.240]  etc. to get get inside the perimeter I was inside that perimeter I went to the
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:05.800]  roof of the American Express building which after the two towers and World
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.560]  Trade Center 7 came down the American Express building was the tallest
[2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:12.600]  building this is in the World Financial Center across the street from the World
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:15.280]  Trade Center I went out of the roof it was not an observation deck it was a
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:20.680]  roof I went out there and I looked straight down into the flaming ruins of
[2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:25.720]  the World Trade Center and I was reminded of Rodin's sculpture the Gates of Hell
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:29.320]  I thought the Gates of Hell had been open and I was looking into them that's
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:32.800]  what I saw so you know these armchair engineers who talk about control
[2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:36.200]  demolition all this stuff I mean that there's zero proof of that that's a
[2:13:36.200 --> 2:13:40.720]  nonsense some guy said to me oh there are 2,000 engineers I understand your
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:45.360]  provides though that you're not a 9-11 truth or but specifically insider
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:50.880]  trading prior knowledge that something was coming on American and United correct
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:54.280]  well first of all there is a ton of statistical evidence by the way the 9
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:59.320]  11 Commission never said that there wasn't insider trading what they said
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:02.360]  was that they found no evidence of insider trading but if you don't look
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:05.400]  you're not going to find the evidence so that was sort of a lawyer's you know
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:09.480]  wiggle room to to get out of actually dealing with the issue said the 9 11
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:13.200]  Commission report itself does not say that there wasn't insider trading now
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:18.000]  about a year after 9-11 I was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency to join
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.760]  a project that looked into the possibility of a future attack and what we
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:26.480]  said was okay if there was insider trading ahead of 9-11 could you have
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:30.320]  seen it and if another spectacular attack was coming would there be insider
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:34.480]  trading again could you detective for market signals could you get a FISA
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:38.520]  warrant break down the door and stop the attack and we spent years studying that
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:42.480]  and I was a co-director that project and I met with people I met with the people
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:46.960]  of the SEC who did the investigation for 9-11 Commission I worked with the CIA on
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.080]  this I worked with hundreds of volunteers Nobel Prize winners etc so it's very
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.800]  very involved in this and we wrote the definitive the definitive study of this
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:14:59.840]  now here's the thing if you find if you're a detective and you find a body
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:02.400]  with a bullet hole in the head but there was no witnesses it doesn't mean you
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:05.960]  can't prove the crime it just means you need some other kind of evidence if you
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:10.800]  don't have a witness evidence to use DNA well the DNA equivalent and stock
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:13.920]  markets is statistical evidence and there were numerous academic studies and
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:17.400]  they're all cited in my book my book has 300 footnotes so I don't make things up
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:21.720]  there's tons of documentation any reader can go find the source material that
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.600]  there was no question that the put by by the way put by is a bet that the stocks
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:30.840]  can go down before 9-11 was enormous there'd be as if you know a guy ordered
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:34.120]  one ham and cheese sandwich for lunch every day for ten years and then one
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:37.880]  day he ordered 300 ham and cheese sandwiches that's the kind of put by we
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:42.400]  saw in the last five trading days prior to 9-11 I met a CIA headquarters with
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:47.200]  John Mulhern John Mulhern was the head of one of the four largest specialists on
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:50.440]  the New York Stock Exchange he was the market maker in American Airlines
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:54.000]  stock and I looked at him I said John was there insider trading in American
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:57.440]  Airlines ahead of 9-11 he said it was the most blatant case of insider
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:03.080]  trading I've ever seen there was by the way since my book came out Alex it's
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:06.440]  kind of interesting there are people with additional information who have
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:09.680]  contacted me they've come forward almost like they want to get something off
[2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:13.160]  their chest so there are stories that are not in my book because these people
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:16.720]  contacted me after the book came out but one of the most chilling stories
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:21.560]  fellow came to me he was a dealer one of the so-called primary dealers they're
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:24.880]  the biggest banks in the government securities market he handles sovereign
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:27.800]  wealth funds which are the biggest traders in the government securities
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:31.680]  market so here's a guy the biggest trader for the biggest dealers in US
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:36.200]  government securities on September 10th the day before 9-11 he was actually out
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:39.720]  of the office at an outing his phone rang his trading assistant said hey there's
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:43.680]  someone on the phone they want to buy two billion dollars of two-year
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:47.880]  treasury notes now two billion dollars is an enormous order the biggest firms
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:51.200]  they might trade a hundred million at a time or sometimes larger two billion
[2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:54.360]  dollars or two-year notes is an off-the-charts order this customer had
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:57.800]  never called before wasn't as if it was a long-standing customer and it was a
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:00.760]  sovereign wealth fund he didn't tell me the name of the country but I think you
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:04.840]  can infer that it might be Saudi Arabia but and then he did the trade of course
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:08.680]  the next day 9-11 comes those those securities soared in value so that
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:12.480]  trader made a fortune and they never heard from the customer again so you know
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:15.320]  when the customer when it when someone who's never spoken to you before calls
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:18.560]  the day before the attack buys two billion of two-year notes the next day
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:22.200]  the attack comes the securities go up guy makes a fortune walks away never
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:25.360]  heard from again this is the kind of stuff that was going on it was going on
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:28.720]  on a very large scale not not even all the stories have come out so no
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:32.440]  question about insider trading now where I fought the government was for not
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:35.120]  looking just to bring that story forward to the present day what we were
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:38.440]  talking about earlier Alex with the death of the dollar we all know what
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:42.520]  happened in Ukraine in March and April of 2014 this year just prior to the
[2:17:42.520 --> 2:17:47.680]  invasion Russia which owns a lot of US Treasury securities in its central bank
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:52.760]  started dumping US Treasuries last October was anybody looking at that and
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:55.600]  it was if you're Russia and you know you're going to make Crimea and you
[2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:58.880]  think the US is going to push back with economic sanctions you want to mitigate
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:02.600]  the impact of the sanctions by lightning your load of US Treasury securities
[2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:06.280]  well they started doing that in October so my criticism of the US government is
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:09.160]  not that they were in on it I think that's nonsense but that they weren't
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:13.640]  looking then they're not looking now and these techniques that you need to look
[2:18:13.640 --> 2:18:16.880]  at are not that difficult because hedge funds do it every day sure James James
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:21.080]  though look you obviously you're a smart guy I know you got brought him out of the
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.600]  CIA to do this report because there are good people in all these you know
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:30.200]  agencies is also bad actors and bad subgroups and history shown that clearly
[2:18:30.200 --> 2:18:35.120]  when you had some of the supposed hijackers trained at US bases in all
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:41.600]  sorts of spy training and then that got covered up clearly you had Iraq being
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:46.920]  attacked not Saudi Arabia clearly you have the police state being shut up on
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:52.960]  the backs of the attack of 9-11 the lying about the dust when I say inside
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:58.200]  a job I mean the system stood to gain from this on so many fronts and it's
[2:18:58.200 --> 2:19:03.600]  Saudi Arabia right now driving the bus with these attacks and and this new
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:10.720]  invasion of Syria and Iraq that certain power structures Carl all group and
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:14.960]  others stood to gain from this and there's enough to investigate it I mean
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:19.920]  even six of the 10 commissioners have said the official story did not reflect
[2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:25.920]  reality so what do you say to that well you can gain from it and not know why
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:28.400]  you're gaining and that happens all the time let me give you a very simple
[2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:32.960]  example so let's say a very small trade goes through so there's someone with
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:36.640]  inside information they know the attack is coming they do a trade now who would
[2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:40.640]  that person be what could be a cook a driver a safe house operator associate a
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:44.400]  brother father sister mother everyone has a social network and there was
[2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:47.720]  definitely a wider group than the hijackers themselves of course we knew
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:52.560]  about this attack coming and people in that position cannot resist some insider
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:55.200]  trading and when people are skeptical that they say why would you compromise
[2:19:55.200 --> 2:19:59.520]  operational security I have a two-word answer which is Martha Stewart Martha
[2:19:59.520 --> 2:20:02.680]  Stewart was the legitimate billionaire she made a billion dollars through
[2:20:02.680 --> 2:20:06.200]  honesty and hard work but she ended up behind bars because she couldn't resist
[2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:10.000]  the little securities fraud involving a tip on insider trading so that's the
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:13.200]  human nature side of it now here's what happens so that trade goes through now
[2:20:13.200 --> 2:20:16.760]  there was no news that day if somebody's buying put options and there's bad news
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:19.880]  about the airlines that's one thing but when the market is going up the sector
[2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:23.480]  is going up all the other airlines are going up and someone's buying puts on
[2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:27.440]  United Airlines and American Airlines and there's no news then you know
[2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:31.880]  somebody knows something you don't you might buy more put options yourself that
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:34.880]  doesn't make you a criminal when insider trader just makes you actually a very
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:38.160]  smart trader this is what's called the piggyback or technically the name for
[2:20:38.160 --> 2:20:42.400]  the signal amplification so by the end of the day it's not surprising that there
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:46.800]  was a massive volume of puts on your hand word of mouth I mean if you told one person
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:50.800]  I found a bunch of gold laying around at the foot of this hill and you know ten
[2:20:50.800 --> 2:20:53.600]  hours there'd be a hundred people out there looking for gold there'd be people
[2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:57.080]  looking for gold a hundred years after the gold was already picked up that
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:01.240]  rumor would never die I get signal amplification what I don't get is Mayor
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:06.240]  Willie Brown San Francisco Chronicle on screen September 12th told not to fly
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:10.840]  to New York by Conalisa Rice it turned out National Security Advisor on
[2:21:10.840 --> 2:21:15.880]  September 10th Joint Chiefs of Staff cancelled a meeting in New York two
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:22.600]  days before 9-11 source ABC News I mean my issue here is is you look at problem
[2:21:22.600 --> 2:21:26.560]  reaction solution and the radical transformation of America into a police
[2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:30.440]  state that you were just talking about earlier and the NSA and the rest of it
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:36.040]  and you see the wrong country attacked you know not not Saudi Arabia but Iraq I
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:40.960]  mean you can see why people don't buy into the official story because if you
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:45.240]  questioned insider trading they said oh you're a liar it doesn't exist if you
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:50.480]  questioned our sickening relationship with Saudi Arabia oh they're perfect
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:54.760]  shut up you know you're racist I mean I think that's why people don't buy the
[2:21:54.760 --> 2:22:01.280]  official story of 9-11 well look I I'm a simple guy ox I stick to facts and the
[2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:04.360]  guy get attacked by the mainstream for talking about insider trading head of
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:08.440]  9-11 I get attacked by the truthers for not buying into control demolition of
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:12.040]  World Trade Center 7 so I probably have it right if I'm up from on that middle
[2:22:12.040 --> 2:22:15.400]  ground by the way this stuff about you know as I said I was there that the
[2:22:15.400 --> 2:22:18.520]  armchair engineers can think what they want I was there there was nothing
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:22.760]  controlled about that there was not a demolition I mean I was inside the
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:26.320]  American Express building on the 17th floor which was Lehman Brothers headquarters
[2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:29.960]  at the time the face of the building was ripped off so I'm inside the building
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:35.960]  looking out at a blue sky with girders stuck into that space with the face of
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:40.160]  the building ripped off by what was really a wave of metallic debris that
[2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:43.200]  came over because there was so much that was not a controlled demolition by the
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:47.320]  way the biggest tenant in World Trade Center 7 United States government so
[2:22:47.320 --> 2:22:50.040]  why would the US government have a plot to blow up its own office and kill its
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:52.520]  own people this is where these things fall down well they can put a lot of the
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:56.760]  records there FBI CIA all base there and the criminal group within government
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:00.600]  could then run the operation out of there and then burn it down but listen
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:04.560]  let's shift gears out of that I respect people who disagree with me
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:07.880]  legitimately and who bring up real issues and and just to expand on what
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:11.880]  Kaiser had told me that specifically you have interviewed people who were there
[2:23:11.880 --> 2:23:15.840]  at the terminals and could see the insider trading coming in or basically
[2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:19.200]  blocked not you specifically but you wrote that report so I appreciate your
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:22.200]  courage I mean I've already scanned through some of your book I'm familiar
[2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:25.960]  with your work I think you're being very truthful about warning the people and
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:30.880]  we appreciate you something there should be some orthodoxy of heresy where we
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:35.600]  politically burn you at the stake if you don't you know with your own
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:39.600]  perspective agree with everything we're saying I mean the 9-11 truthers all
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:42.560]  fight with each other and have hundreds of different views I get what you're
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:46.440]  saying I don't think it's evil to look at it as an inside job I don't think it's
[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:51.400]  evil to not look at it as that I think what we both agree is this regardless
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:55.160]  it's been used to take our liberties and our borders are basically wide open
[2:23:55.160 --> 2:23:59.360]  right now and they haven't let a good crisis go to waste they've used this to
[2:23:59.360 --> 2:24:03.160]  bring the military-industrial complex home and we need to reverse this right
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:07.800]  now it's not keeping us safe well that will get worse Alex and just on a
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:12.080]  going forward basis when this financial crisis comes people gonna find you know
[2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:15.400]  there's a lot of concerns you not everybody can get out at once people
[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:18.040]  gonna find that they can't get out that they're not gonna be able to withdraw
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:21.560]  savings from the banks the banks that's the so-called bail and so their
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:25.160]  accounts are gonna be blocked ATMs are gonna be shut off major institutions are
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:27.880]  gonna be told that they cannot sell it's not a question of you can I sell at a
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:32.000]  good price you won't be able to sell so the the architecture of the bail in
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.640]  writ large is already there and I'll be talking about that in future interviews
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:40.960]  but the crisis is gonna be a lot worse but the response is going to be much
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:45.120]  more draconian well there you go the bail in spend a few more minutes if you
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:48.760]  can come back as soon as you want to get into that in great detail we now see
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:54.520]  them announcing in Europe places like Spain oh we want a tax on your money in
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:57.840]  the bank account but it's only gonna start you know at a low percentage point
[2:24:57.840 --> 2:25:02.560]  oh the Cyprus model and then we see the laws and regulations being changed the
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:07.840]  real-time surveillance of every financial system to do just that that's the
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:13.600]  word I'm getting from I mean I've as you have contacts I have contacts at I'm
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:17.800]  I could even say at president level of major banks you know big big five banks
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:23.200]  and they're scared and asking me what what they think well they should do and
[2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:26.800]  then I'm asking them I mean it's kind of like we're passing a hand grenade
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:30.720]  around to each other with musical chairs I mean what's gonna happen when
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.240]  they do a bail in and you don't just can't get your money out now they're
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:40.280]  stealing it well that's exactly right and I do think as I said the next crisis
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:43.800]  gonna be bigger it's gonna be bigger than the Fed that they they hope it goes
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:47.440]  away but it's not going away the the economy we're in a depression we're
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:51.320]  gonna stay in that and definitely it's just a matter of time by the way if you
[2:25:51.320 --> 2:25:55.400]  look at the very low volatility of the last five years the period that it
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:26:01.680]  resembles most was 2002 to 2007 in other words the period from 2009 to 2014 if
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:06.080]  you graph it by various metrics it looks exactly like the period from 2002 to
[2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:11.960]  2007 we all know what happened next so get ready and the derivatives overhang
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:16.480]  hasn't been dialed back it's only been increased well that's right and by the
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:19.560]  way that's another interesting phenomena the this is a little bit technical but
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.640]  the Fed is now experimenting with a massive exercise in what's called reverse
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:27.560]  repo and I'll explain that very simply reverse repos the Fed has all these
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:30.820]  government securities how did they get them well they printed money and they
[2:26:30.820 --> 2:26:33.760]  bought the government securities from the dealers from the banks and that's how
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:37.400]  they print money and get it out to the banking system the problem is the
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:41.280]  dealers in the banks need the government securities is collateral for the
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:45.480]  derivatives because they want to leverage 10 to 1 or 100 to 1 etc do the
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:49.440]  derivatives to prop up the asset markets but when I do a derivative with you I do
[2:26:49.440 --> 2:26:53.520]  a swap with you you're like hey Jim how do I know you're good for the money well
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:57.200]  one of the ways you know is I'll send you Treasury securities as collateral so
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:00.200]  that's your guarantee that I'm going to perform my end of the deal well what
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:04.280]  happens when the Fed buys up all the securities and the banks no longer have
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:08.080]  the securities to post this collateral to prop up the derivatives which are
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:11.480]  propping up the stock market well the Fed solution to that is they are now
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:15.920]  lending the securities back to the dealers on a short-term overnight basis
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:19.160]  and taking cash in return so on the one hand they're printing money to buy the
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:22.360]  securities on the other hand they're lending them back to the dealers overnight
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:25.560]  so they can post this collateral that's how bad things are well they're
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:31.280]  reselling they're reselling the all these fraudulent financial instruments
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:35.400]  again well technically relending but they're making them available through
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:39.120]  these so-called reverse repos but that's right but they buy them permanently by
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.800]  printing money and then they lend them back temporarily say why would you do
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:46.000]  that well so that they can have collateral to support the derivatives
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:51.640]  books to prop up the stock market this is a match maybe I've been doing this too
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:54.840]  long but I actually understand all these technicalities it's it's what I do
[2:27:54.840 --> 2:27:58.240]  professionally and it's just appalling and it makes your hair stand on well I
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:01.280]  appreciate you giving us extra time next time you come on we'll just do an hour
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.840]  we got about a minute or two left before break I can't wait to read the book but
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:11.480]  expanding on that talking to the people in the CIA talking to the folks in the
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.800]  military intelligence I talked to some of those people as well most of them are
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:18.640]  compartmentalized have never done anything wrong have actually tried to
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:22.360]  help the country and I mean now they're having this big discussion about is this
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.040]  on purpose or was it by design I mean I think in a complex system again have
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:30.080]  people playing every point of the board so I think the answer is it's everything
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:34.440]  but but we better decide to get back to freedom and back to justice or we're
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:39.720]  gonna go off the edge as you said into a hyper fascism I mean what are people
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:43.520]  saying to you about the future of this country because in a fascist system
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:48.800]  nobody's safe we should all not want to go this direction well I had a meeting in
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:51.640]  the office of the Secretary of Defense and I told a very senior official there
[2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:56.480]  I said look the day will come when your destroyer your cruiser will pull up to a
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:00.720]  fuel depot in Singapore and you'll say that the operator filler up with fuel and
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:04.560]  the operator will say fine pay me in special joint rights pay me in SDRs and
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:07.800]  for the first time you're gonna have a forward deployed military that you have
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:12.720]  to finance in a currency that you don't print and that was shocking to the very
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:16.440]  senior official and then this individual said to me you know I hear you it does
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:19.920]  sound like a national security threat but the Treasury really doesn't like it
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:23.320]  when we talk about the dollar in other words that's the compartmentalization

[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.400]  tend to just not believe government could be involved because it's such a big
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:44.200]  deal criminal elements working in multiple governments US intelligence

[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:06.600]  door they let the attack happen bare minimum and there was so much aiding
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:11.440]  abetting to open the door and to block FBI investigations I mean it's just it's
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:15.840]  literally thousands of points it it it makes my head spin I've made like four
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:22.440]  films on the subject I'm not bragging who was the western star that said no
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:26.400]  brag just fact it wasn't John Wayne look up no brag just fact for me guys
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:31.840]  thanks I remember one time I was on air a few years after 9-11 and I was saying
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.240]  you know I'm the father of the 9-11 truth movement and another smaller
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:40.520]  talk show host called me and said you know you sound like an arrogant person
[2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:46.440]  saying that on air and I said hey I'm not saying it because I'm arrogant I'm
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:52.960]  saying it because it's the truth and I take a big risk doing that and the
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:58.520]  establishment was calling me the progenitor of the 9-11 truth movement
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:01.960]  you know I said they're gonna blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on
[2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:05.520]  their CIA asset been lauding to invade all over the world and take our
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:09.200]  freedoms here's the Rand Corporation report with these other reports in a
[2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:13.000]  two-and-a-half hour emergency TV show and a three-hour radio show those are all
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:21.840]  online from July 25th 26 2001 and I went on air that day and the day after and I
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:24.480]  said they're gonna launch a bio attack on top of it and they launched the
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:33.120]  anthrax attack I just studied this and I know how they operate and look at our
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:39.360]  government runs al-Qaeda today and ISIS and the rest of it the guns of will
[2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:44.720]  sonnet no brag just facts at Walter Brennan of will sonnets prowess with a
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:52.480]  weapon no brag just fact where I come from it's not good to tell people what
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:36:02.960]  you got in the hole the ace in the hole and I don't like quite frankly in my
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:07.320]  cousin got something right to the day he said you know Alex is really an introvert
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:11.720]  and nobody really knows that and that's the truth I'm an introvert ladies and
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:16.240]  gentlemen I don't like being famous I don't like being hated by some people I
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:27.120]  have to do this okay and but I've gone so far down the line with all this that I
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:31.280]  I see other perspectives and I'm just here to try to convince the
[2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:37.000]  establishment not to commit suicide and take us with them and so that's why I've
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:42.320]  gotten to the point where I may have said 15 years ago yeah let them send in you
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:47.320]  and troops we'll just shoot them not anymore because I don't want that civil
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:52.960]  war to happen that's what they want I'm 40 years old now I've been doing this
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:37:01.080]  since I was 21 years old toll free number to join us is 800 25 at 9 92 31
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:08.760]  800 25 at 9 92 31 and the reason I tell people you know where the 9 11 truth
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:15.240]  came from it came from the event itself but I was there day one just like time
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:20.080]  magazine calls me the mad prophet of the Tea Party because I am the mad prophet of
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:23.920]  the Tea Party from my perspective Ron Paul's the founder of it and I'm the
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:29.880]  prophet of it if you want to call it that someone raising the alarm we need to
[2:37:29.880 --> 2:37:33.400]  be alarmed we need to be upset we need to be bombastic we need to run around
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:38.120]  screaming because that'll get people out of their coma but I'm not putting an
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:43.480]  act on when I run around screaming I'm concerned when I see our government
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:48.680]  running and funding Al Qaeda and giving them more than 10,000 12,000 15,000 I've
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:53.320]  had kernels on saying it's 15,000 missiles I don't know it's over 10,000
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:57.880]  missiles the government acts like I've done something so they can power grab
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:01.680]  and run my life and make me a slave while the border is wide open and they
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:09.720]  create ISIS toll-free number to join us 800 25 9 90 31 I want to show folks if
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:14.560]  you're watching on TV some articles here LAPD to no longer comply with feds on
[2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:20.200]  immigration hold request headlines should be illegal aliens above the law
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:25.240]  because they don't just release them for being illegal
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:29.560]  they say don't even call me legal just legalize them legalize anybody can get
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:35.960]  here well we'll be a billion people in a couple years of that happen and they
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:40.480]  just say we can't pay for it anymore we won't even hold them to give them to
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:47.920]  ice plus ice just let them go and so now they go on to say you know people that
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:53.640]  don't have two serious low-level crimes is the quote and of course I know this
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:38:58.320]  like the back of my hand folks they released out of Texas alone in a
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:01.400]  four-year period I remember reading this in the Houston Chronicle a quarter
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:06.480]  million illegals and upwards of I forget the exact numbers a large portion
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:10.440]  were aggravated felons and it was 36,000 a month ago released in one month
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:15.240]  remember that headline 36,000 aggravated felons we're talking arson
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:21.120]  child rape I mean I've got stacks of news every day I don't even get to with
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:25.800]  headlines like this two-time illegal immigrant charged with rape in Philly
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:31.320]  Sanctuary City city cops won't work with feds unless Honduran immigrant
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:38.960]  convicted yeah they're just gonna deport them it's like that railway killer who
[2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:44.040]  prayed on Hispanics so there's another underbelly to this Hispanics who aren't
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:48.320]  citizens that don't know this aren't Americanized are prayed on by the
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:52.640]  criminals and the gangs and they're the ones that lobby and manage the
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:57.200]  immigrant smuggling the running the lawyers all of it and that brings me to
[2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:06.320]  this next report you don't just have the people in 800 plus Sanctuary City's
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:14.000]  catch and release for DWI hit-and-runs rape robbery
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:21.560]  criminals worldwide coming here knowing it's the happy hunting ground you have
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:25.040]  let me show folks right here this is in the weekly Chronicle comes out every
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:29.800]  Thursday they've written literal whole cloth articles about me probably 15
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:36.640]  times telling outrageous lies where it's literally inverted truth okay fiction
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:44.120]  and I was not sophisticated when this started 16 17 years ago now I understand
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:48.280]  they they own and run South by Southwest they're invested in the high-rise
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:51.560]  apartments they've got this army of fake liberals that literally work for the
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:57.120]  Chronicle for free not knowing they're working for a $15 million a year profit
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:02.360]  organization but it's all like beatnik old minutes of going yo daddy yo yo
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:07.800]  black ops squads okay and the editors obsessed with me and attacks me every
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:11.840]  month and listens to the show and admits it and I never realized why because they
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:17.360]  know I'm telling the truth they know everything I knew before I knew it they're
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:23.160]  literally hate my guts they've got any legal alien on the front of it with a
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:30.400]  cut-up American flag smiling and then you open it up this is a microcosm and it
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:39.040]  attacks the sheriff the black sheriff Greg Hamilton the Texas civil rights
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:43.600]  project that's like the 80 yellow Southern Bobby Law Center that he deports
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:50.560]  13 people a week folks Travis County has a jail that looks like the death star I
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:54.280]  mean they catch you doing anything they're ordered to throw the book at you
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:59.200]  and this is an article like he's a horrible racist bad guy because he
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:06.040]  deports aggravated felons and then I mean how do I get these rights where I
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:10.440]  can drunk drive I can I don't even want to rape people but you can rape people
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:19.920]  murder and then if the sheriff tries to deport you if the I mean I've talked to
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:23.600]  the cops you've all heard about it than is I've talked to Travis County
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:28.320]  prosecutors they said no the judge will give an illegal alien a $5 fine you'll
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:32.160]  be put into classes everything else you'll spend five years paying off your
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:36.840]  DWI an illegal will be released on the spot and you go to their website the
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:40.000]  Texas Civil Rights Commission with Jim Harrington and all the rest of these
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.760]  people and there they've got maps and everything how to get in how to take over
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:50.560]  how to get the Dream Act right here and it's all Ford Foundation funded with the
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:54.280]  workers party and Caesar Chavez and all the stuff that sounds reasonable
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:57.840]  because Caesar Chavez was mad about pesticides and how people are being
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:01.400]  treated of course Hispanics were being exploited any migrant or worker group
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:06.360]  is poor sharecroppers I'm just thinking only hearing that minorities are really
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:09.640]  the majority in most areas of the country are the only ones that ever got
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:13.760]  abused and didn't serve at share but the thing is they take that whole movement
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:23.440]  named streets after it and make the whole civil rights movement about being
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:27.080]  anti-white and being part of the Raza and it's all a bunch of rich white
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:33.160]  lawyers and they've got these in every city and they get the city to build
[2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:40.000]  homeless housing and turns out it's free legals and they get money off this
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:49.320]  community it's disgusting it's acorn folks it's acorn and and this is the
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:54.760]  white liberals that run all this they're not liberals at all and it needs to be
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:44:00.000]  investigated and looked at and it goes on all over the country programs in
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:04.560]  services and then they have city art things with billboards that show a
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:09.880]  revolution of Raza taking over America and show the plan of Oslo and you go
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:17.480]  to these immigration rallies and it's Mexican flags everywhere with guys
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:23.480]  wearing plan of San Diego shirts a plan to kill all white male 16 and older I
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:27.880]  mean it's like imagine the Klan had a plan to kill all blacks 16 and older I
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:32.840]  mean it's like and the other will be reeducated I mean it's just like what
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:36.240]  you're like man you're talking about killing all the whites shut up racist
[2:44:36.240 --> 2:44:40.440]  comeback shut up racist shut up racist I am sick of it and they're trying to
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:50.120]  radicalize Hispanic people who are great people I mean and again this will
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:54.560]  only increase white racism which is the Balkanization they want we've got to
[2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:58.200]  create a culture a bill of rights Constitution we've got to create a
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.560]  culture where we identify on freedom on second amendment on property rights on
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:08.800]  low taxes on prosperity not this runaway train where you've got the
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:14.000]  illegals so upset and so anti-america that if you were an American flag in
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:19.400]  Texas or California the gangs the illegal gangs get so mad you have to take
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:27.080]  your shirt off it's turning around inside out see they tell America to have no
[2:45:27.080 --> 2:45:32.400]  culture and then it's overwritten by a Ford Foundation synthetic weaponized
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:37.960]  Chicano nation system that does nothing it's like here you're the ruling
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:45.080]  Chicanos now go go sweep instead of building a system to build everything
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:49.700]  up it's oh look you vote for the Democrats you can be gay now while they
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:52.920]  take everybody's rights of the NSA spies on us and the Republican leadership
[2:45:52.920 --> 2:45:55.520]  you notice isn't saying anything about any of this
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:01.840]  Geo mama you really screwed up on the border let's get amnesty passed the same
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:07.640]  one George Bush had written the Republican leadership wants this because
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:13.640]  the big corporations want you begging with a thousand people from India and
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:20.880]  Mexico and in Romania and China they want you lined up whether you're a
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:25.200]  professional or whether you're a auto mechanic or whether you're a custodian
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:30.440]  or whatever you are if you're a school teacher they want you up against the
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:34.720]  corporate fake schools that are meant to destroy the education system which I
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:38.680]  didn't understand until a few years ago is they wrecked the education system and
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:41.160]  then forced you into the new corporate system I mean they know what they're
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:49.120]  doing folks and so I don't blame people who identify with race and all this
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:53.520]  stuff at a primitive level because that's how humans are but the point is
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:59.400]  is it's all engineered we're gonna go to Tom Leslie Rob truth Raider Joe and
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:04.560]  others but this is a plan they're gonna destabilize the country bring us into a
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:08.400]  third world and the wealthy people will be a tiny group that live behind armored
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:13.520]  gates and the rest of us are gonna be out here running around poor and America's
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:17.520]  conquered that's it with a bunch of paramilitary cops strutting around where
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:21.640]  the illegals given drivers license to vote politically to totally dismantle
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:27.120]  the country if we don't turn this around folks will be like Zimbabwe and
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:33.200]  Robert Mugabe you can look at the culture at the TV shows everything it's
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:39.040]  all anti-white and that's only because that scene is the dominant culture that
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:44.400]  if it can be overthrown it can be overwritten with anything and they're
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:48.240]  not overriding it with any real culture they're just overriding it with a bunch
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:53.600]  of drug dealers and criminals and scum that own the Spanish run media itself
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.080]  financed by the big banks that launder the money I mean it is a criminal take
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:00.280]  over we're gonna go to break them back go right to your calls a little bit of
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:06.440]  overdrive to get to all of them you can see the lawlessness as it unfolds and as
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:11.720]  they go outrageous you want a gun you're in the Klan that matter what reality
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:16.240]  shows you don't want Obamacare you claim there's death panels you're a racist
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:19.680]  well the death panels on this subsection now the death panels are
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:23.640]  public of course we're gonna kill grandma we're liberals you don't kill
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:29.640]  grandma your races yeah they want diminishing resources so they're the
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:34.600]  only ones in control of them so they can buy you cheap
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:41.800]  God I go to the third world I can't even go to anymore because there's so many
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:48.640]  beautiful third world places and the people are just in hell there's always
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:55.240]  up on a hill a big armored compound with helicopters and the rich guy and his
[2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:59.320]  family can come down and get anybody's daughter they want everybody's controlled
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:03.760]  by them no matter if it's a fascist or a communist system they have their system
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:07.960]  in place there's always cops everywhere with machine guns the sign of a broken
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:13.160]  failed country and all the signs are there for America that's why it's more
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:16.040]  important than ever this show has the truth we know what's historically
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:19.720]  happening we've proven it I don't like the responsibility of being the tip of

[2:54:53.440 --> 2:55:00.640]  you're on the air go ahead thank you alex um I wanted to mention you were
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:05.680]  talking about 9-11 earlier and I tuned in a little bit late but I only called
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:09.920]  I want to bring up a point about the a lot of the other mainstream conservative
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:16.520]  shows you might call neocon um I know a lot of folks who listen to these shows
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:22.040]  including myself occasionally that do not and never believed the official
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:31.320]  story or 9-11 and any time the topic comes up the way so many of these
[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:38.120]  posts trash those who believe oh yeah they don't have they don't have an
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:41.680]  intellectual discussion with you they just say you're crazy and believe in
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:46.360]  puff the magic dragon and that's because bare minimum they stood down on 9-11
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:51.160]  and unfortunately they basically ran it with Saudi Arabia and the Democrats are
[2:55:51.160 --> 2:55:59.080]  involved as well I always found it interesting that I mean I heard recently
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:07.360]  a comment from Michael Savage he did not go into great detail but he's one of
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:13.120]  the only voices I've ever heard he did say he was looking at conspiracy theories
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:17.600]  didn't say which one he didn't say he was believing anything Michael Savage is
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:21.880]  super smart and he knows about false flags he says Obama may stage one and
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:26.000]  so he I mean he gets the big picture he's the only other show that will
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.040]  actually cover everything and so yeah and even disagree with him on a few
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:33.640]  percentage points or he disagrees with us it doesn't matter he cares about the
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:38.080]  future of the country he doesn't just out of hand attack every talk show host
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:42.760]  out there he attacks other talk show host he disagrees with what they say not
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:47.480]  not because he's just going after him he doesn't take a lot of talk show host
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:51.040]  actually but I think it's pretty funny because the ones he attacks kind of
[2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:55.800]  deserve it but the straights are so dire right now that even when Glenn Beck
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:56:59.880]  attacks me all the time it lies about me just God bless him that's all I can say
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:05.040]  thank you Tom let's talk to Rob in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:12.320]  hello Alex welcome thank you very much I'm new to Texas and I gotta say I'm a
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:18.360]  little unimpressed at the lack of patriotism in the state I say in
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:21.780]  Grand Prairie a grand prairie you know don't come out and protest the
[2:57:21.780 --> 2:57:25.800]  illegals we got riot police the illegals are God and they're calling the riot
[2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:29.600]  police into California you don't do any these people in Texas now know how to do
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:33.560]  one thing and that's suck government boots and they did everything they have
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:38.440]  taken from them because they want to be hurt so no I mean I'm ashamed of Texas
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:42.240]  in many ways but compared to other states we're doing you know better but it
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:49.520]  we're a smaller pile of dog crap I'm from Chicago okay I lived there my whole
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:56.160]  life in the Midwest and I have a fire identification card that they gave me no
[2:57:56.160 --> 2:57:59.840]  questions asked through the mail from the state police everybody I talked to in
[2:57:59.840 --> 2:58:04.520]  the south says why do you need a car to buy a gun so being out here for the last
[2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:10.320]  two years they have totally and when I say they the infection on the planet the
[2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:15.000]  devil's disease they have completely got themselves into every single little
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:20.040]  corner from property managers all the way up to you know the chief of police or
[2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:22.720]  whatever I don't know where the highest chain of command is but it's just
[2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:25.760]  disgusting no I hear you listen let me explain what's happened to Texas I love
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:29.200]  Texas and I dearly love it when it's a great state great people I was being
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:35.280]  sarcastic I want Texas to be ashamed we get we've been colonized by bureaucrats
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:40.280]  and it isn't really Texas anymore I mean my gosh the police aren't allowed to

[3:00:43.480 --> 3:00:47.680]  are people in the final equation here in this country but folks need to learn to
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:52.640]  mind their own business and not work with the system as much as you can because
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:57.120]  the system wants compliant people who will go along with it unless you're an
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:01.080]  illegal who's above the law big only for a time to break down the country I mean
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:04.200]  it's just there's a discriminatory fact that the illegals are above the law and
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:08.320]  its citizens are treated like crud because we put up with it stop
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:13.240]  complying like an illegal alien you will become God let's go ahead and talk to
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:18.840]  Leslie in Illinois Leslie you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I would just like
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:24.840]  to say that my parents lived in Europe during World War two my father was a
[3:01:24.840 --> 3:01:30.240]  prisoner of Auschwitz and Buchenwald and when they came to these states they were
[3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:35.880]  very appreciative of the United States and they were told they had different
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:42.720]  political opinions keep it to yourself and you know we have it very good here
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:48.880]  and that's where people just don't understand well we had it good and now
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:52.160]  a bunch of globalists have run up a credit card in our names and they think
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:56.440]  a bunch of checkpoints with cops bugging their eyes out at us is gonna make us
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:02:01.320]  shut up that's not gonna stop the total implosion we have to come together and
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:05.920]  say no the police state is just a signpost on where they're taking us
[3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:09.880]  people are like I don't care there's a police state what have I done you've
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:15.240]  done nothing the elite want to steal everything and so when they do when they
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:19.800]  set up a police state look out that's what I'm getting at what is it they're
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:26.040]  planning to do that they're gearing up with all this well we know it's impoverished
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:32.280]  us and take everything anything else Leslie well my mother's just been
[3:02:32.280 --> 3:02:37.280]  warning me for about 10 years she says pay attention you think that these things
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:41.480]  that they're doing are no big deal but they are once it's here it's hard to get
[3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:47.440]  rid of and I knew what she meant was communism so she saw the signs already
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:51.720]  years ago and have you studied communism and how it worked the Soviet Union it's
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:55.600]  a spitting image to what the Democrats are doing and what the Republicans you
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:59.440]  know play politics with it's just it's unbelievable and a lot of it's because
