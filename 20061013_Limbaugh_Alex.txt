[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.091]  Ladies and gentlemen, during the break, a friend of mine sent me an email.
[00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:08.672]  I don't visit the Democrat kook websites much anymore, but a friend does.
[00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:15.394]  It's just funny.
[00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:17.195]  What is this site?
[00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.216]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:22.937]  It's an article here by Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:25.118]  Now, I'm told, I don't know this for certain,
[00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.660]  I am told that Alex Jones is one of the leaders of the 9-11 was a government conspiracy campaign.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.946]  One of the leaders of the movement trying to prove that 9-11 was not what it was.
[00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:42.191]  The Bush administration was behind it for whatever nefarious purpose.
[00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.173]  Let me just read this to you.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.525]  Headline, Fox News spins plane accident, says it could affect election.
[00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:56.033]  The FBI and Homeland Security are now labeling a small aircraft hitting an apartment building in Manhattan as a probable accident.
[00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.575]  Is this a government psyop?
[00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.211]  Intended to invoke memories of 9-11 as the midterm elections approach?
[00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:05.432]  On Fox News, your world with Neil Cavuto.
[00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:15.416]  Cavuto suggested during a conversation with Congressman Peter King that the event would possibly affect the upcoming midterm election by reminding Americans of the horror of 9-11.
[00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:20.698]  It has now been reported the pilot, one of the occupants of the plane, was Corey Lytle.
[00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:23.259]  The fact that the accident in... Now listen to this.
[00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:35.833]  The fact that the accident involves a celebrity means the networks can justifiably talk about it for another three weeks, and in that sense, invoking memories of 9-11, it could impact the election.
[00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:50.621]  Reports that Lytle's passport was found on the street, also seen as suspicious by some 9-11 truthers, because it would seemingly prop up the inconceivable notion that Mohammed Atta and other hijackers' passports survived and were discovered.
[00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:50.981]  However,
[00:01:51.741 --> 00:02:01.028]  In the case of Lytle, this could easily be explained by eyewitness reports that most of the plane debris did not enter the building and ended up on the street below.
[00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:12.295]  They believe that this is a psychological ops operation designed to make you think of 9-11 to impact negatively the Democrats in the upcoming election.
[00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:13.296]  I have noticed also
