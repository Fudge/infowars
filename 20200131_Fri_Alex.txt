[00:30.000 --> 00:38.240]  Well, the United Nations is working with the globalist client state of China to standardize
[00:38.240 --> 00:41.300]  worldwide martial law policies.
[00:41.300 --> 00:49.880]  Personally, I think myself and the Director General have never seen the scale, commitment
[00:49.880 --> 00:56.080]  of an epidemic response at this level in terms of all of government involvement across all
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.080]  of the different arms of government with the tremendous support being poured into Wuhan
[01:01.080 --> 01:07.520]  and Hubei from the central government with a highly organized emergency management structure.
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.640]  The challenge is great, but the response has been massive and the Chinese government deserve
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.160]  huge credit for that response and for the transparency in which they have dealt with
[01:18.160 --> 01:19.160]  this.
[01:19.160 --> 01:24.520]  A case in point in terms of one of the clusters of infections that we're currently working
[01:24.520 --> 01:29.360]  with Germany to investigate, it was the lab in China who contacted Germany to tell them
[01:29.360 --> 01:31.840]  that they had a return case that was positive.
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.600]  So China is not only helping to manage the cases in its own country, but it is actively
[01:36.600 --> 01:37.600]  reaching.
[01:37.600 --> 01:39.280]  And it just goes on.
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.880]  We also have video of the Director General, the UN, saying similar things and praising
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.880]  China as the model that's all coming up.
[01:45.880 --> 01:53.680]  If you're a TV viewer, you may be asking yourself right now why I have such a triggering image
[01:53.680 --> 01:54.680]  in here.
[01:54.680 --> 01:58.480]  Like I was thinking this morning, I woke up at like 3.30 in the morning, how much I hate
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.960]  Adam Schiff and how just looking at him made me start screaming on air yesterday because
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.800]  he just forces himself into our lives for years and he says, I'm a tool and work for
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.800]  the Russians.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  So does Rand Paul.
[02:10.800 --> 02:13.520]  Now they're saying arrest Rand Paul.
[02:13.520 --> 02:17.520]  And then I come in here and they've put him up here on the big screens.
[02:17.520 --> 02:19.920]  So pretty amazing.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.040]  We go to a wide shot of that.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.040]  That'd be great, guys.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.040]  Or maybe not.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  Okay.
[02:24.040 --> 02:26.120]  Well, anyways, whatever's going on today.
[02:26.120 --> 02:32.920]  But we've got a lot of really important information to cover here and we've got huge news on the
[02:32.920 --> 02:39.080]  virus that we're going to be going over and how serious is it really and the exponential
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.080]  growth of it.
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.720]  There, that's what I was telling folks about coming in here and seeing this incredibly
[02:43.720 --> 02:44.720]  triggering image.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.600]  But I'm going to restart the show next segment.
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.120]  We're going to just disregard this segment as if this segment never even existed.
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.600]  And a lot of that problem is I get in here last minute, right before I'll get ready for
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.120]  the show and I'll go around to your business and I got here about 30 seconds late.
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.120]  So I apologize.
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.840]  The crew on that, but I'm going to reset here and not just blow up and turn this fricking
[03:04.840 --> 03:08.640]  table over, man, because I'm pissed about what's going on in this world.
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.840]  And like I said, that son of a bitch shift pisses me off.
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.280]  And I probably shouldn't even have that up there.
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.760]  But what the hell is wrong with that piece of crap and how the hell is such a piece of
[03:20.760 --> 03:24.840]  garbage ruling over us sick of it?
[03:24.840 --> 03:29.760]  And by the way, that's a normal response to a bug-eyed pervert child molester like him
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.280]  run in our country.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.840]  He's a crap.
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.280]  Seriously, I was thinking how much I hate him at 3.30 in the morning.
[03:39.280 --> 03:41.600]  He's just a detestable person.
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.840]  And look, he works for the Democrats at the top, so he doesn't just look like a pedophile.
[03:47.840 --> 03:55.560]  I bet all the tea in China, all the tea in China, that that guy is a pedophile.
[03:55.560 --> 03:59.840]  Now Brian Stelter, if I was casting someone as a pedophile in a movie, there's only one
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.200]  person that on the bill as a top star as a pedophile, you know, if you had a movie about
[04:05.200 --> 04:09.480]  a pedophile that kidnaps kids and keeps them in basements and tortures them and eats them.
[04:09.480 --> 04:11.440]  Stelter or shift?
[04:11.440 --> 04:13.440]  Because when you really get down to it, I don't know.
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.880]  Stelter both the most creepy, ugly, sick, demonic, filthy, make-your-skin-crawl pieces
[04:18.880 --> 04:24.320]  of garbage that rape America, rape the truth, want our children, want our guns, and are
[04:24.320 --> 04:28.840]  cornerbacking the psychic gang rape of the planet.
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.280]  And I told you I'm going to reset him and come back.
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.280]  This is not part of the show.
[04:33.280 --> 04:34.280]  You just saw.
[04:34.280 --> 04:37.240]  There's a little screw-ups in here and shift.
[04:37.240 --> 04:38.240]  Can't handle it.
[04:38.240 --> 04:39.240]  Can't handle it.
[04:39.240 --> 04:40.240]  Can't handle it.
[04:40.240 --> 04:43.800]  No, I would cast him as the pedophile kidnapper master.
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.800]  Not saying he is.
[04:44.800 --> 04:45.800]  Just saying he looks like it.
[04:45.800 --> 04:48.080]  I mean, my God, he makes my skin crawl.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.080]  God almighty.
[04:50.080 --> 04:51.080]  Matt Bracken's coming up.
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.080]  He's got huge, super-breaking news.
[04:53.080 --> 04:54.580]  Oh, double trigger.

[04:56.580 --> 04:58.880]  Seriously, get it down.
[04:58.880 --> 05:01.880]  It's no secret that our daily lines are becoming more stressful.

[06:12.720 --> 06:17.560]  front lines of the Infowar.
[06:17.560 --> 06:25.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this January 31st, 2020, broadcast.
[06:25.480 --> 06:28.920]  I am your host, Alex Jones, we're going to be here live for the next four hours, then
[06:28.920 --> 06:30.800]  the War Room with Owen Schreuer is coming up.
[06:30.800 --> 06:36.840]  This broadcast of very existence is again a defiance of the globalist tyranny.
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.360]  This is the day that many believe the president will be acquitted.
[06:41.360 --> 06:44.560]  I thought they'd probably get the votes for witnesses, but it looks like they don't have
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.360]  the votes as of right now.
[06:46.360 --> 06:52.280]  They're finishing up their closing arguments, and Trump could be acquitted today.
[06:52.280 --> 06:55.680]  And Trump, of course, has said this is a good time for our country because the country's
[06:55.680 --> 06:58.760]  waking up, and I tend to agree with him.
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.080]  But if the globalists don't get in trouble for all the crimes that Pencil Neck, Adam
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.080]  Schiff, and others have committed, they're just going to keep committing them.
[07:05.080 --> 07:12.400]  Look at this headline, Democrats demand Rand Paul's arrest after Senator asked about Obama's
[07:12.400 --> 07:18.120]  holdover, Eric Ciarumala, who is one of the people making false testimonies, the transcripts,
[07:18.120 --> 07:20.200]  and all the other witnesses, it doesn't match.
[07:20.200 --> 07:23.120]  But the president's indicted.
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.200]  That's what impeachment is, and he can't face his accuser.
[07:28.200 --> 07:30.880]  So that's all coming up.
[07:30.880 --> 07:35.040]  We've got all those clips, and we'll be following the vote.
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.040]  All of it.
[07:36.040 --> 07:38.400]  If it goes through tomorrow, we'll be here covering it.
[07:38.400 --> 07:42.360]  Obviously, we have a live Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., and I'll be hosting, so we'll be
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.640]  hitting it from every angle.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.800]  There's so much other incredible news as well.
[07:47.800 --> 07:56.720]  We've got what's happening with the virus, coronavirus UK to quarantine citizens returning
[07:56.720 --> 08:02.960]  from Wuhan in secure facility, pilots, flight attendants demand flights to China.
[08:02.960 --> 08:10.160]  We stop as virus fears mounts worldwide, coronavirus drone army deployed to spray disinfectant
[08:10.160 --> 08:12.440]  across China.
[08:12.440 --> 08:15.040]  Until people 20 years ago, they were going to use drones for law enforcement and crowd
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.040]  control.
[08:16.040 --> 08:17.040]  Oh, your conspiracy theorist.
[08:17.040 --> 08:19.040]  They're like Washington Post headlines.
[08:19.040 --> 08:22.360]  Now it's, oh, the drone armies are saving us.
[08:22.360 --> 08:25.880]  Coronavirus, China accused of burning bodies in secret.
[08:25.880 --> 08:32.320]  So now we have the last man on earth, Vincent Price, come home for real.
[08:32.320 --> 08:38.160]  Haunting pictures show dead man left lying in the street of deserted coronavirus, ground
[08:38.160 --> 08:41.760]  zero.
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.320]  The virus cases may be under counted with even 3,000% surge.
[08:47.320 --> 08:49.320]  Well, that's Bloomberg.
[08:49.320 --> 08:53.360]  That's exactly what we were reporting that we could have a go here on air.
[08:53.360 --> 09:00.080]  But oh, we're the conspiracy theorist that the Washington Post and vice have to all report
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.440]  on how bad we are.
[09:06.440 --> 09:12.320]  So we'll be looking at all the different angles of this.
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.960]  Wary of irking China, Trump offers rosy take on virus threat.
[09:15.960 --> 09:18.720]  Oh, I hope the president's right.
[09:18.720 --> 09:24.960]  Who declares international emergency over coronavirus outbreak, crazes communist China.
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.400]  And really what it is is a planetary drill for world government and forced inoculation.
[09:29.400 --> 09:32.720]  That is all coming up as well.
[09:32.720 --> 09:39.560]  Who demands gratitude and respect for Chinese dictators, coronavirus response.
[09:39.560 --> 09:44.800]  Who orders countries not to engage in stigma or discrimination in response to coronavirus
[09:44.800 --> 09:45.800]  outbreak.
[09:45.800 --> 09:48.240]  And CNN says that white people are the problem.
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.680]  I'm not getting to them for worse.com article with their tweets and reports.
[09:54.680 --> 09:57.960]  CNN is angry that white people are trying to stop the coronavirus spreading.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.080]  Yes, it's white people's fault.
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.960]  And all these haunting videos of the complete ghost towns, we're going to be going over
[10:04.960 --> 10:07.480]  all of that today.
[10:07.480 --> 10:10.840]  The true number of coronavirus victims is far larger than you're being told.
[10:10.840 --> 10:11.840]  Look at those numbers.
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.240]  As I mentioned in the Washington Post and others, experts debunk fringe theory, linking
[10:17.240 --> 10:21.320]  China's coronavirus to weapons research.
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.760]  And so we're going to play Senator Cotton, who's gotten classified briefings on it saying
[10:26.760 --> 10:32.360]  we need to look at Wuhan, which develops bioweapons, and is that being a possible release point
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.360]  that there's an ongoing cover-up?
[10:33.360 --> 10:42.080]  But you know, he is a far right fringe lunatic, according to Jeff Bezos's Washington Post.
[10:42.080 --> 10:47.520]  So we're going to talk about the response to this and the hysteria and what would happen
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.240]  in America or in Europe or other areas if you had lockdowns and people being welded into
[10:53.240 --> 10:58.560]  their apartment buildings and blockaded and what happened during the Spanish flu that
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.880]  killed between 30 and 50 million people and how the Chinese are pretty docile and herdable.
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.840]  And they say that themselves, probably the most servile culture in the world under the
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.920]  chai comms, very sad for them.
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.440]  But what will happen if there's something like that here and they try to tell a city
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.800]  shelter in place, no one's there to help you and you can't have any food, looting and burning
[11:21.800 --> 11:23.320]  would begin within hours.
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.400]  We all know that.
[11:24.400 --> 11:28.760]  It would look like Devil's Night in Detroit wrapped into the purge for real.
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.120]  And Matt Bracken is a great author, researcher, former Navy SEAL, terrorism expert, and he's
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.760]  been predicting this for a long time that it's going to break out somewhere in the world
[11:36.760 --> 11:38.880]  like this and we're going to see this type of hysteria.
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.680]  So we're going to talk to him when we come back on the other side of the break.
[11:42.680 --> 11:48.800]  And again, it's almost over, Democrats know they've been beaten again.
[11:48.800 --> 11:50.960]  Trump insists he isn't worried about impeachment.
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.560]  This is a happy period, Sanders surges, Biden plateaus, that's why they're getting ready
[11:56.560 --> 11:57.560]  to go out for Sanders.
[11:57.560 --> 11:59.760]  They already stole the nomination from him a few years ago.
[11:59.760 --> 12:03.600]  Now they're back to do it again, the same leftist authoritarian.
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.840]  So that's all coming up.
[12:05.840 --> 12:13.560]  I'm going to say this, we are going to sell out within a week at current sales rates
[12:13.560 --> 12:16.040]  of super silver immune gargle.
[12:16.040 --> 12:23.800]  This is 16 ounces of the highest quality nano silver that is so good for your body and so
[12:23.800 --> 12:24.920]  good for your gums.
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.560]  And the main disease point and how you get these low oxygen bacteria that can grow in
[12:30.560 --> 12:38.160]  your heart, one of the biggest causes of heart disease is the fact that people have these
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.480]  different types of bacteria and viruses living in their mouths.
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.320]  This is the patented nano silver that the US military uses.
[12:46.320 --> 12:50.160]  Nobody else has this, but the big company, the big nano tech company, I got the documents
[12:50.160 --> 12:51.160]  here.
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.440]  I'd asked Tim Fruget actually this morning, as I saw it, my stack and it got moved to
[12:56.440 --> 12:58.240]  bring me those documents back over.
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.680]  I don't see those, the restricted documents that we can now give you because Congress
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.160]  released them on the company that produces this for us.
[13:06.160 --> 13:10.000]  And what they said about SARS, which is again the coronavirus same family that it's been
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.760]  proven to knock it out.
[13:11.760 --> 13:14.800]  This isn't a supplement where, oh, you can't say things about it.
[13:14.800 --> 13:22.040]  This is patented nano silver and it's 16 ounces of it, ladies and gentlemen, at a price you're
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.040]  not going to find anywhere else.
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.720]  We are the only folks.
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.080]  This from that company was developed by my dad, with the owner who's a huge listener,
[13:30.080 --> 13:31.240]  the head scientist.
[13:31.240 --> 13:34.840]  And so no one even actually has this, this is just the patented nano silver in here.
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.800]  And you can also ingest it because it's at 15 parts per million.
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.720]  You don't want to go above 30 generally and obviously you can go heavier than that topically.
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.320]  And they got the strongest silver, super silver wound gel patented that you can sell over
[13:50.320 --> 13:53.880]  the counter made by the same company that we private label.
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.920]  All of that is still discounted because I'm not going to raise it back to retail or jack
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.920]  the prices up.
[14:00.920 --> 14:05.060]  You know, we had thousands of masks, antiviral mask and others.
[14:05.060 --> 14:08.480]  We always sell them at something people need in their emergency kits.
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.040]  He left it at sales price sold out in one day last week.
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.040]  We could have made them cost you 10 times more.
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.120]  Amazon selling single mask for like a hundred dollars.
[14:19.120 --> 14:21.760]  We didn't do that because I'm an opportunist.
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.160]  I'm selling things you need up front that I know will help you and your family that
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.600]  also fund their operation that then defends the second amendment, the first amendment,
[14:29.600 --> 14:32.000]  the unborn and all the good things this broadcast does.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.320]  So we have it in the 16 ounce.
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.840]  We have it in the two other smaller container sizes.
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.800]  In fact, one of these again has a little spray top.
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.760]  Great to take with you to the airport, great to take to work, you know, the chemical sanitizers
[14:46.760 --> 14:47.760]  don't work as well.
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.160]  And they can also lower your fertility and cause a lot of problems.
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.200]  Silver is toxic to bacteria and viruses.
[14:53.200 --> 14:56.360]  That means overall a little bit of it's good for you, but consult your physician.
[14:56.360 --> 14:59.520]  A lot of it, not so much just like antibiotics.
[14:59.520 --> 15:02.880]  It's just another weapon in the arsenal to protect yourself up front.
[15:02.880 --> 15:06.640]  So you put the super silver wound gel on your hands and things first.
[15:06.640 --> 15:08.440]  It creates an invisible barrier.
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.360]  It's not used after it's used before, but yes, I use it when I have cuts and things
[15:12.360 --> 15:14.880]  and they just heal so much faster.
[15:14.880 --> 15:21.600]  Also almost forgot this super silver immune gargle has iodine in it as well that's so
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.520]  good for the body and so good for the teeth.
[15:23.520 --> 15:25.920]  And when you don't have enough of the iodine, it lowers your immune and everything else
[15:25.920 --> 15:26.920]  as well.
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.920]  So this is really a proprietary product.
[15:27.920 --> 15:28.920]  We're very, very proud of it.
[15:28.920 --> 15:34.440]  We have the nano silver whitening toothpaste that has the same patented nano silver in
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.640]  it as well that also remeliorizes the teeth.
[15:37.640 --> 15:44.000]  So all of the silver products are 40 to 50% off even though you watch about in the next
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.840]  week, they're going to all be sold out.
[15:46.840 --> 15:47.840]  Everybody needs this.
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.840]  Not just for this virus, but for all the crap going on and all the things happening and
[15:51.840 --> 15:58.000]  it funds the info war and the storeable food selling out as well infowarrestore.com.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.680]  I'm here with Scott, you see him founder of OMG tax.
[16:01.680 --> 16:06.440]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.

[16:11.800 --> 16:15.640]  in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required
[16:15.640 --> 16:18.360]  to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.720]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.200]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.440]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.960]  That's what the client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non collectible
[16:31.960 --> 16:33.120]  status with the government.
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.240]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot

[17:11.160 --> 17:12.280]  my life.
[17:12.280 --> 17:17.520]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[19:05.520 --> 19:11.760]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I discovered that I absolutely know work that

[19:24.800 --> 19:30.240]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[19:30.240 --> 19:31.560]  the bad halogen.
[19:31.560 --> 19:36.440]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[19:36.440 --> 19:43.720]  I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[19:43.720 --> 19:49.480]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at InfoWarsLife.com and I'm telling you
[19:49.480 --> 19:56.080]  folks get it, it's amazing, discover the benefits and it funds the InfoWars360 win.
[19:56.080 --> 20:02.120]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[20:02.120 --> 20:30.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.400 --> 20:36.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, something big is afoot.
[20:36.800 --> 20:49.560]  I told you last week and over the weekend that storeable food companies have had FEMA
[20:49.560 --> 20:53.800]  and other federal agencies call up and buy all their storeable food up.
[20:53.800 --> 21:00.240]  That really happened and that they are preparing for a major pandemic here in the United States.
[21:00.240 --> 21:07.560]  And then obviously the virus is much worse, it's been spread much further and much more
[21:07.560 --> 21:13.080]  widely and that's why Trump can't really do a bunch of quarantining or block everything
[21:13.080 --> 21:18.480]  at this point because it's already here and we're already seeing a lot of deaths from
[21:18.480 --> 21:21.760]  pneumonia and we know that.
[21:21.760 --> 21:24.920]  And so the question is then what is the UN and what is China up to?
[21:24.920 --> 21:31.560]  I want to talk with Matt Bracken next segment, he's going to join us down on another subject
[21:31.560 --> 21:35.240]  about the breakdown of society because he talks about this and I've said this a lot
[21:35.240 --> 21:40.560]  and I know he's absolutely right and everything the globalists have done is about making the
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.920]  climate politically and economically and culturally perfect for a societal breakdown.
[21:46.920 --> 21:55.880]  We are soft, we are hand to mouth, we are absolutely domesticated compared to just a
[21:55.880 --> 22:01.840]  few generations ago and I'm not putting everybody down, I'm an idiot too when it comes to the
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.360]  stuff that my grandfather, especially my dad's that could fix or do anything and they were
[22:06.360 --> 22:11.240]  all into being able to do that and they had fun doing it and they knew how to do all sorts
[22:11.240 --> 22:15.240]  of stuff and they were business people too.
[22:15.240 --> 22:20.880]  The Hank Williams Jr. song is, my dad taught me to live off the land and his dad taught
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.400]  him to be a businessman but no, people, rural folks, farmers and people are business people
[22:25.400 --> 22:31.720]  too and just that common sense, street smarts, he's gone compared to what it was and it's
[22:31.720 --> 22:35.200]  scary how domesticated people are because we'll talk about that with Matt Bracken next
[22:35.200 --> 22:39.400]  segment but I wanted to get to this because we've got the horrible Adam Schiff up behind
[22:39.400 --> 22:43.040]  us, very triggering to me, I got very, I'm not just kidding, I got very upset when I
[22:43.040 --> 22:47.680]  came in here and saw him, what is wrong with him, the crimes he's committed, the things
[22:47.680 --> 22:52.400]  he's done and him and Jerry Nadler fighting over who can make the closing statements last
[22:52.400 --> 22:56.840]  night, we've got some video of that and Trump I believe will get acquitted, I figured they'd
[22:56.840 --> 23:00.840]  have the votes for witnesses but now it looks like they don't, we're going to follow that
[23:00.840 --> 23:07.440]  as it unfolds, John Roberts saying, oh we can't read the name of the so-called whistleblower
[23:07.440 --> 23:14.920]  Eric Shiramala, so now you can't face your accusers, I mean this is getting out of control.
[23:14.920 --> 23:19.600]  Matt, so where do you see it going, what do you think is going to happen?
[23:19.600 --> 23:26.560]  I think it's a really great sign that it ended with disunity by Nadler and Schiff and you
[23:26.560 --> 23:30.800]  can tell that Nadler was trying to rein it in because he had blown it so badly in his
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.720]  last closing argument when he was accusing the senators of treason that they didn't call
[23:35.720 --> 23:44.880]  for witnesses but I think that a real wildcard in this is Romney because Romney is not his
[23:44.880 --> 23:52.240]  own man, Romney is a CIA stooge, they put him in, he's run by a guy named Kofor Black
[23:52.240 --> 23:58.400]  who is a close confidant of Brennan who is actually still running the CIA from the outside,
[23:58.400 --> 24:08.520]  the top three at the CIA are all Brennan mentees, acolytes, people are still hoping if they can
[24:08.520 --> 24:13.400]  get rid of Trump or vote him out, the old order comes back in, you have to understand
[24:13.400 --> 24:20.440]  about the CIA, you're never ex-CIA at that level, so Kofor Black is sort of the Rasputin
[24:20.440 --> 24:27.000]  of Mitt Romney, so whatever Kofor Black and John Brennan tell Mitt Romney to do, that's
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.720]  what he's going to do, so he could actually flip the vote either way, he's not an ideological
[24:31.720 --> 24:38.240]  person like Collins, she's confused and she's a dingbat but Mitt Romney is going to strictly
[24:38.240 --> 24:42.560]  follow orders and we don't know how he's going to fall down, then the next thing is if it
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.480]  is a 50-50 tie and in this era, I mean it always looks like we're all in the cusp of
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.680]  amazing things if it's a 50-50 tie then Roberts, he's the one that overturned, he flipped on
[24:55.680 --> 25:02.200]  Obamacare, he's another wild card, I think he's under blackmail control and if it looks
[25:02.200 --> 25:06.680]  like it'll benefit the deep state to call witnesses, they will and if they don't, if
[25:06.680 --> 25:10.880]  they're going to cut their losses because they're afraid that if they do call witnesses,
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.480]  this can drag out for months and turn into Eric Charamella being interviewed, Sean Misko,
[25:17.480 --> 25:22.720]  Abby Grace, both Vindaman brothers, this is a plot that's clearly hatched up in the National
[25:22.720 --> 25:30.080]  Security Council by the Obama holdovers, so if all of these people are called in to testify
[25:30.080 --> 25:34.920]  and they have to take the fifth, then the Republican lawyers are going to just lay
[25:34.920 --> 25:39.000]  out the conspiracy around them, if they take the fifth, that'll look terrible.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.320]  How long is he going to, I've been trying to get a straight answer on this, how long
[25:43.320 --> 25:46.240]  until we find out if they're going to have that vote and whether he's going to get acquitted
[25:46.240 --> 25:49.280]  today or whether they're going to drag this into next week?
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.520]  I think it's going to go till tonight, also just for a moment, if you can indulge me,
[25:55.520 --> 26:02.760]  I want to give a shout out to the Appalachian Battalion of the Mossy Oak Militia and this
[26:02.760 --> 26:09.880]  is our secret, one of our secret ritual recognition signs right here, okay, you can get a picture
[26:09.880 --> 26:10.880]  of that.
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.880]  Okay.
[26:11.880 --> 26:18.360]  This is the Mossy Oak Militia, okay, anyway, I have to be wearing this today, so anyway,
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.920]  it's kind of an inside joke among people that like to shoot in the woods.
[26:22.920 --> 26:28.480]  But yeah, anyway, haven't been doing enough a lot lately, but pretty much, you know,
[26:28.480 --> 26:34.000]  I forgot the brass all over the table and, you know, reloading.
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.720]  But anyway, the vote comes tonight and it's a poker game and, you know, Justice Roberts
[26:40.720 --> 26:46.240]  is one of the potential king makers, if it's a 50-50, and whichever way the deep state
[26:46.240 --> 26:48.960]  tells him to go, that's the way he's going to go.
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.120]  Well, it's certainly a big day today and we're going to be watching it all.
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.000]  In fact, I'll probably just end up staying up here late tonight and doing a special broadcast
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.160]  if I get the crew in here because this is history happening right now.
[27:00.160 --> 27:05.920]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back and talk about this virus and
[27:05.920 --> 27:09.200]  why we've seen this unprecedented response.
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.520]  I know you want to get into the technicals of how dangerous it could be during a lockdown
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.440]  or similar things here and how riots would probably break out in many cities.
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.000]  That's all been pre-programmed by the media and the culture, but from your own research,
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  do you think it's man-made?
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.840]  Do you think it escaped from a lab?
[27:26.840 --> 27:28.600]  Do you think it's a natural mutation?
[27:28.600 --> 27:29.600]  Why is it being hyped up?
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.160]  I mean, gut level, what do you think this virus is?
[27:33.160 --> 27:39.280]  I think at a huge pandemic like this today, you know, it almost is a moot point whether
[27:39.280 --> 27:44.280]  it's natural or man-made because we'll never really know the truth.
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.360]  There's never going to be a record that comes out that everybody believes.
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.120]  There's always going to be theories that are competing.
[27:53.120 --> 28:00.920]  I would say, sure, it could be snake to bat to man, or it could be the Canadian Bio Research
[28:00.920 --> 28:06.040]  Lab to Wuhan Bio Chem Lab or Research Lab, and then it gets out.
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.200]  You know, it infects somebody in the lab and they go home and it gets out that way.
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.680]  But I don't think we'll ever know definitively unless there is a chance, if they take this
[28:15.680 --> 28:23.920]  virus apart and they can see that there are spliced-in sections that are absolutely impossible
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.280]  to have occurred in nature, you know, kind of like a Frankenstein virus, then we might
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.280]  know.
[28:29.280 --> 28:31.520]  But that's way down the road.
[28:31.520 --> 28:36.080]  What the problem is, the very same groups that are doing the testing are groups that
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.760]  have called for population control and have been caught in secret experimentation before.
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.600]  We're going to look at every angle of it.
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.120]  The UN has said it's a global emergency, but doesn't want travel restricted, but most
[28:46.120 --> 28:48.040]  countries are restricted travel.
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.720]  So why hasn't Trump done that yet?
[28:49.720 --> 28:52.640]  We'll answer that question as best we can on the other side.
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.640]  It's Friday.
[28:53.640 --> 28:54.640]  We're live.
[28:54.640 --> 28:55.640]  Stay with us.
[28:55.640 --> 29:03.560]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.480]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[29:07.480 --> 29:08.960]  my family to freedom.
[29:08.960 --> 29:13.360]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool
[29:13.360 --> 29:16.920]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.040]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our BlackRifle Real Estate
[29:21.040 --> 29:22.040]  team is here to help.

[29:52.040 --> 30:00.560]  We're live.
[30:00.560 --> 30:04.960]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks,
[30:04.960 --> 30:05.960]  it'll be too late to get them.
[30:05.960 --> 30:11.520]  You got to get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[30:11.520 --> 30:14.880]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[30:14.880 --> 30:21.520]  Please go to infowarstore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part of survival
[30:21.520 --> 30:22.520]  covered.
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.800]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down, or whatever
[30:27.800 --> 30:31.720]  the case may be, the RZ air filtration mask, M2 mesh.
[30:31.720 --> 30:32.720]  I have one of those personally.
[30:32.720 --> 30:36.520]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.560]  I am prepared.
[30:37.560 --> 30:38.560]  Are you?
[30:38.560 --> 30:39.960]  If you're not, infowarstore.com.
[30:39.960 --> 30:40.960]  On sale now.
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.680]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[30:43.680 --> 30:45.840]  It's not necessarily the disease.
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.080]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[30:48.080 --> 30:51.800]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[30:51.800 --> 30:53.560]  Food will be off the shelves.
[30:53.560 --> 30:54.560]  Water won't be available.
[30:54.560 --> 30:56.200]  You might not even be able to leave your house.
[30:56.200 --> 30:59.320]  You got to be prepared before it comes down.
[30:59.320 --> 31:06.920]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high quality, organic vitamin D3,
[31:06.920 --> 31:12.200]  vitamin K combo, because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring that
[31:12.200 --> 31:17.960]  people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs.
[31:17.960 --> 31:23.080]  And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly
[31:23.080 --> 31:25.600]  viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[31:25.600 --> 31:30.320]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these
[31:30.320 --> 31:31.320]  viruses.
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.120]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for
[31:36.120 --> 31:37.800]  sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[31:37.800 --> 31:45.360]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the fact that
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.800]  I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you
[31:49.800 --> 31:51.840]  protecting yourself and your family.
[31:51.840 --> 31:59.200]  So Winter Sun taken out of the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at infowarstore.com.
[31:59.200 --> 32:01.520]  Well it's here, the year 2020.
[32:01.520 --> 32:02.880]  World government's out in the open.
[32:02.880 --> 32:06.600]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[32:06.600 --> 32:07.600]  the answer.
[32:07.600 --> 32:13.120]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks
[32:13.120 --> 32:19.480]  against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the
[32:19.480 --> 32:21.200]  protection of the unborn.
[32:21.200 --> 32:22.200]  Wow.
[32:22.200 --> 32:26.280]  Yes, now we know we're right, the new world order's real, Satanism's real, the pedophile
[32:26.280 --> 32:30.720]  leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[32:30.720 --> 32:34.880]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in
[32:34.880 --> 32:35.880]  Kansas.
[32:35.880 --> 32:39.680]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[32:39.680 --> 32:44.760]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[32:44.760 --> 32:46.280]  gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[32:46.280 --> 32:49.600]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and
[32:49.600 --> 32:50.600]  being involved.
[32:50.600 --> 32:56.520]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of infowarstore.com
[32:56.520 --> 32:57.520]  is critical.
[32:57.520 --> 33:26.320]  So please take action.
[33:26.320 --> 33:31.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:31.320 --> 33:38.240]  Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.240 --> 33:42.880]  Matt Bracken is our guest and I was listening to him yesterday talk about during the fourth
[33:42.880 --> 33:49.600]  hour how dangerous it would be to have a great depression today or a Spanish flu type pandemic
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.280]  that killed between 30 and 50 million people, the numbers vary and how criminals and other
[33:55.280 --> 34:01.360]  groups would definitely use that to have what you saw during the Los Angeles riots on a
[34:01.360 --> 34:02.520]  mass scale.
[34:02.520 --> 34:07.160]  And then if you try to have people shelter in place for weeks and weeks what they're
[34:07.160 --> 34:13.520]  saying and who not in other areas and welding people in to apartment buildings, that would
[34:13.520 --> 34:16.240]  just be a recipe for total collapse.
[34:16.240 --> 34:19.440]  The Japanese had crime go down after Fukushima.
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.520]  They have almost no crime other than gang stuff, people fighting and some theft.
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.440]  But very low crime rate, it went down during the tsunami and the crisis they came together.
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.040]  And there's a lot of great Americans and we come together as well, but there's also
[34:34.040 --> 34:35.760]  a lot of wild folks that would take advantage of it.
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.200]  We'll talk about that with Matt Bracken, but a drudge siren, ladies and gentlemen, just
[34:40.200 --> 34:41.200]  went up.
[34:41.200 --> 34:46.200]  We're linking it at infowars.com, but drudgereport.com leased The New York Times, the same New York
[34:46.200 --> 34:53.040]  Times that worked with Bolton to make up lies about WMDs in Iraq.
[34:53.040 --> 34:56.920]  Well they're back again, a known certified liar that backed Trump's policy before with
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.600]  Ukraine and said Trump was doing great on Voice of America interviews he did and said
[35:01.600 --> 35:04.320]  that they were fighting corruption in Ukraine.
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.440]  Well now he's got a book and millions of dollars and the known certified criminal liar, by the
[35:08.440 --> 35:14.320]  hell did Trump hire him, he warned him, is trying to sink Trump right now as they try
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.280]  to get witnesses, which will be Bolton and all the rest of them.
[35:18.280 --> 35:23.880]  Trump told Bolton to help his Ukraine pressure campaign book says, oh, oh, he said, help
[35:23.880 --> 35:31.760]  Giuliani with his contacts and that Giuliani was looking into corruption.
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.680]  We've got Ezra Levant coming on who shot the most incredible undercover video.
[35:35.680 --> 35:43.760]  I mean, it's like beyond a movie with senior Royal Mounted Police in suits and ties saying
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.120]  you're guilty, you're going to go to prison because you wrote a book about Justin Trudeau.
[35:49.120 --> 35:56.920]  I mean, it's incredible, he's on next hour and we've got such huge news right now, but
[35:56.920 --> 35:57.920]  this is big.
[35:57.920 --> 36:01.120]  They're saying arrest Rand Paul, arrest me.
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.160]  Don't say Eric Sieramala, you can't face your accuser and they tell him, they go, oh, who
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.800]  made the complaint about your book is secret, but you criticized Trudeau during an election,
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.240]  he goes, that's totally legal.
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.440]  He reads them the law, they go, no, it's not.
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.800]  And it's, it's just unbelievable.
[36:18.800 --> 36:23.760]  So there's such tyranny, such authoritarianism taking place and I'm reading this New York
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.840]  Times article, Mr. Trump told Bolton to call the president who had recently won election
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.080]  as president of Ukraine to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani was planning
[36:33.080 --> 36:34.280]  a trip to Ukraine.
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.800]  So the president wanted his lawyer to meet with someone, my I've never heard of such
[36:39.800 --> 36:47.240]  the crime is this, the Obama, Biden, Soros, Schiff, Bolton, Pelosi, Kerry, Romney, Clinton,
[36:47.240 --> 36:52.800]  they all use the billions a year going into Ukraine since the Cold War and after to launder
[36:52.800 --> 36:54.080]  the money back to themselves.
[36:54.080 --> 36:55.080]  It's the watering hole.
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.080]  People always talk about how the US sends aid to Israel that comes back.
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.080]  Absolutely.
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.080]  I don't like it.
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.200]  I'm not anti-Israel, but that's corrupt and wrong.
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.600]  But the amount of money sent into Ukraine is even more than Israel.
[37:08.600 --> 37:11.480]  And that's the watering hole of these people.
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.560]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[37:12.560 --> 37:20.200]  And so our president is indicted in a trial be removed right now because Bolton said this
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.760]  again Matt Bracken, terrorism expert, best selling author.
[37:23.760 --> 37:25.520]  You've really been following this closely.
[37:25.520 --> 37:28.000]  This was their little sneak attack, I guess on this day.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.480]  I was saying earlier, it looks like we might seem acquitted tonight.
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.480]  You said not so fast.
[37:31.480 --> 37:33.680]  They've got a few tricks up their sleeves.
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.200]  Minutes later, this comes out, you've been proven right.
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.160]  This is a deathmatch because Charamella is just a symptom.
[37:42.160 --> 37:49.000]  Charamella went on the airplane at least once with Joe Biden to visit Ukraine while Hunter
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.920]  was on the board of Burisma making a million a year.
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.160]  So Charamella has a stake in this.
[37:56.160 --> 37:59.120]  If Biden goes down, Charamella goes down with him.
[37:59.120 --> 38:03.360]  So they've been trying to come up with a way after the collapse of the Russian collusion
[38:03.360 --> 38:04.360]  hoax.
[38:04.360 --> 38:11.360]  And the Ukraine thing is just another attempt to throw the dogs off the trail by doing a
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.320]  preemptive strike against Trump, put Trump on the defensive instead of them having to
[38:16.320 --> 38:20.760]  answer for, you know, what did Charamella know about all the dirty corrupt dealings
[38:20.760 --> 38:23.200]  that the Bidens were doing in Ukraine?
[38:23.200 --> 38:25.000]  I mean, it's preemptive.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  It's like a backfire.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.320]  I just want to ask a question for people watching them on the TV screen right now.
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.880]  Would anyone let any of those people babysit your children?
[38:33.880 --> 38:42.440]  Would you let Brennan get anywhere near you, Biden, Schiff, Strock, Sirmala, Misko, Vitamin?
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.480]  Vitamin looks like just a raving lunatic.
[38:45.480 --> 38:46.480]  What the hell?
[38:46.480 --> 38:48.480]  Klein Smith, look at Chalupa.
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.440]  Well, we were exposing Chalupa three years ago and these people are sick.
[38:53.440 --> 38:58.280]  Yeah, and some of them are still on the National Security Council.
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.840]  So Trump, you asked a few minutes ago, why did Trump hire Bolton?
[39:02.840 --> 39:08.760]  One of the most effective weapons that the deep state used against Trump from his election
[39:08.760 --> 39:15.320]  on was to warn elite, you know, national experts, subject matter experts, do not work for Trump.
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.840]  If you work for Trump, you'll be blackballed, you know, from elite society.
[39:19.840 --> 39:26.120]  So he had to take, you know, what was leftover and Bolton was definitely a retread leftover.
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.840]  But there was almost, that's why he wound up with people like Papadopoulos, who's way
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.000]  smarter than they thought he was, but a guy like Papadopoulos was a lightweight, obviously,
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.920]  to be considered as one of Trump's foreign policy experts.
[39:39.920 --> 39:45.400]  It just makes the point that Trump was being starved of any, you know, legit leaders.
[39:45.400 --> 39:50.320]  He wound up bringing poison pills aboard like McMaster, you know,
[39:50.320 --> 39:51.320]  Exactly.
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.800]  All the mid-level, even high-level that might have been good were threatened off of them.
[39:55.800 --> 39:57.200]  Everybody gets targeted, harassed.
[39:57.200 --> 39:59.440]  Anybody that gives the president good advice comes under attack.
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.800]  They didn't want our guest or info getting the president, that's all the news.
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.000]  And so, but then like, oh, but these people will help and then they were establishment,
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  they were authorized, they came and pledged allegiance to Trump, but really were stabbing
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.200]  him in the back the whole time.
[40:13.200 --> 40:19.120]  Stabbing him in the back and Bolton, McMaster, others like that, you know, they're overtly
[40:19.120 --> 40:23.960]  back stabbing him now, but even during their tenure, they were, you know, helping people
[40:23.960 --> 40:28.400]  like Vindman and Charamella with their leaks against Trump.
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.760]  So Trump has been, you know, for all that he's done, imagine what he could have done
[40:32.760 --> 40:39.200]  if he wasn't, you know, hip, deep in cobras and vipers, which is what he's had to deal
[40:39.200 --> 40:40.200]  with.
[40:40.200 --> 40:43.080]  So he's, you know, got the Democrat enemy out in front of him and he's got all these
[40:43.080 --> 40:46.400]  back stabbing, lying rhinos behind him.
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.680]  But don't think yet the optics, everyone hears the presidents in trouble for going after corruption.
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.280]  And then Hillary was using Russians and millions of dollars to create a fake trail on Trump
[40:58.280 --> 40:59.280]  with everything.
[40:59.280 --> 41:00.280]  They say Trump did.
[41:00.280 --> 41:01.280]  They did.
[41:01.280 --> 41:03.440]  I mean, this is really backfired on them in a massive way.
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.440]  I hope, I hope so.
[41:04.440 --> 41:07.480]  I hope it comes out in the, in the election.
[41:07.480 --> 41:13.280]  I make a comparison between Brexit and then, you know, the resistance of the British elites
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.600]  dragging it out, refusing to go along backfire and then, and then Bojo gets elected in a
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.000]  landslide and it's not that the Tories are great, but the labor got punished.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.880]  And I see the initial election of Trump being like Brexit.
[41:27.880 --> 41:29.600]  Hey, we voted for our guy.
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.000]  And then he's just resisted and fought every step backstabbed.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.320]  And in November, I think a lot of Democrats are going to come out and vote against the
[41:38.320 --> 41:41.800]  Democrat party, just like they slammed labor.
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.040]  And that's what Trump needs.
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.360]  Trump needs to have the Senate, the House, you know, and the executive with, with loyal
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.680]  people by next year, hopefully no more of the total and I said this when they passed
[41:52.680 --> 41:55.680]  Brexit four plus years ago, I said, they're going to fight it for years.
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.120]  They're going to drag it out, but then it's going to blow up in their face and cause even
[41:59.120 --> 42:02.880]  bigger rebellion and see exactly.
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.600]  I see the exact same pattern here, but when we come back though, let's talk about flying
[42:06.600 --> 42:07.600]  the ointment.
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.400]  This virus, why the UN is supporting China and the draconian measures.
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.000]  What would happen here if they tried to quarantine cities, you know, the size of Wuhan that
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.520]  don't even exist in this country?
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.880]  I mean, that one city is bigger than any city.
[42:20.880 --> 42:23.280]  We've got bigger than New York, bigger than LA.

[42:30.880 --> 42:32.640]  I wouldn't even have a guest on like Ezra Lorraine.
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.360]  He's a great guy, but, but during news like this, but what happened to him is so crazy
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.240]  because he's got a hidden camera and they're like, you're guilty.
[42:40.240 --> 42:45.040]  You wrote a book criticizing Prado just want to come clean with that and he just tears
[42:45.040 --> 42:46.360]  the hell out of them.
[42:46.360 --> 42:48.360]  That's videos on info wars.com as well.

[45:03.120 --> 45:05.240]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[45:05.240 --> 45:11.320]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.960]  that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it
[45:15.960 --> 45:16.960]  is.

[45:23.360 --> 45:24.520]  And it's symbiotic.
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.960]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[45:29.960 --> 45:31.280]  the bad halogen.
[45:31.280 --> 45:36.160]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[45:36.160 --> 45:43.440]  I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago is sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[45:43.440 --> 45:49.200]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at infohorsetore.com and I'm telling you
[45:49.200 --> 45:51.080]  folks, get it.

[46:05.000 --> 46:06.560]  a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.880]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game changing toothpaste
[46:11.880 --> 46:16.480]  and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.040]  and fluoride free, the adult or the children's.
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.760]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[46:23.760 --> 46:24.760]  People love it.
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.120]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.800]  but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  ginsivitis.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  This is all proven.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.840]  There are claims of this, but I had to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for
[46:44.840 --> 46:50.400]  knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't
[46:50.400 --> 46:52.400]  strip away the enamel.
[46:52.400 --> 46:53.720]  So we're really proud of it.
[46:53.720 --> 47:11.080]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.080 --> 47:18.480]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live, Matt Braggins, our guest, I keep trying to
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.040]  get to the main reason I had him on the coronavirus, but things keep breaking and this just broke
[47:23.040 --> 47:24.040]  up.
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.360]  Marlago, gate crashed, shots fired.
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.040]  That's being reported by WSVN7 News.
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.040]  Had someone try to ram through and shots fired.
[47:38.040 --> 47:41.760]  There have been an incident in Marlago, Donald Trump's property in Palm Beach or his winter
[47:41.760 --> 47:42.760]  at White House.
[47:42.760 --> 47:47.080]  Florida, according to local news reported involving gate crashing and shots being fired.
[47:47.080 --> 47:52.400]  WSVN News 7 reported the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office sources said there was an incident
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.960]  at Marlago in Palm Beach that just happened 30 minutes ago.
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.800]  Someone ran the northern checkpoint near the property and the deputies fired at this person.
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.880]  The journalist said on the air, Secret Service officials have fired at the person as well.
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.360]  The person who sources the believe is a woman was still able to get away.
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.520]  Officials are saying the person ran from the scene and is still out there.
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.840]  Is this somebody off their medication?
[48:22.840 --> 48:28.800]  That's happened before or is it a psycho trying to kill the president or trying to attack
[48:28.800 --> 48:29.800]  him?
[48:29.800 --> 48:32.400]  I mean, I physically have had people, you've seen it attack me.
[48:32.400 --> 48:39.640]  So a Fox News host, everybody, Tucker Carlson's basically moved to Maine.
[48:39.640 --> 48:40.640]  It's serious.
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.320]  And as Trump doesn't get convicted in the Senate, as he wins reelection, we hope, and
[48:46.320 --> 48:49.600]  it looks like that's where we're going with 276 days out.
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.920]  That's what they thought with Hillary as well.
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.160]  So it's classic to be overconfident.
[48:54.160 --> 48:58.800]  They're going to get more aggressive, more radical, more out of control.
[48:58.800 --> 49:01.800]  What do you make of this, Matt Bracken?
[49:01.800 --> 49:07.360]  I think it's an indicator of what I call the social boiling point.
[49:07.360 --> 49:15.840]  The social temperature is rising and people who are emotionally labile, they become more
[49:15.840 --> 49:17.880]  and more easily triggered.
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.920]  And I can tie this to the coronavirus thing in this sense.
[49:22.920 --> 49:28.520]  When I talk about cities imploding, I'm not saying it's because of a pandemic.
[49:28.520 --> 49:34.320]  It's just almost anything that would disrupt the modern infrastructure can lead to a total
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.240]  implosion of our cities.
[49:37.240 --> 49:40.840]  You mentioned before, China, they're very docile in Japan.
[49:40.840 --> 49:46.200]  They also follow orders kind of more like America in 1918, during the Spanish flu.
[49:46.200 --> 49:52.160]  When you look at the pictures from the Spanish flu era of just hundreds of cots lined up
[49:52.160 --> 49:58.840]  with people that are dying in cots that are just like a couple feet apart, all up and
[49:58.840 --> 50:05.080]  down in barracks and hangers, they didn't panic and freak out.
[50:05.080 --> 50:08.600]  The overall American social temperature was low.
[50:08.600 --> 50:12.480]  Cities were very, very stoic in the old Roman sense.
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.720]  Very stoic and there was unity, there was a war, so there was censorship, there were
[50:17.720 --> 50:21.000]  no alternate theories about things.
[50:21.000 --> 50:29.200]  But if you can put it in water terms or human terms, we're 98.6 and water boils at 212.
[50:29.200 --> 50:35.280]  Let's say that in 1918 or maybe in Japan today, the social temperature is fairly low.
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.320]  You know, when you throw in something like a 50 degree raise, they can compensate and
[50:40.320 --> 50:41.320]  deal with it.
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.200]  Like the Fukushima reactor meltdown, people didn't even loot stores.
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.480]  But in the United States, we're so close to the boiling point that you throw a 50 degree
[50:51.480 --> 50:55.840]  raise in and the pot boils all over the kitchen.
[50:55.840 --> 51:01.240]  And once that happens, all bets are off because what we saw in the Spanish flu in some cities
[51:01.240 --> 51:07.260]  like in Philadelphia, it came right to the edge of total societal collapse.
[51:07.260 --> 51:17.040]  And that's in the religious, unified social harmony compared to today of that era.
[51:17.040 --> 51:20.120]  And it almost came close to a collapse.
[51:20.120 --> 51:26.400]  So I would say that as far as the coronavirus goes, as long as the mortality rate is 2 or
[51:26.400 --> 51:28.680]  3%, I think we can weather it.
[51:28.680 --> 51:32.520]  It's out, you know, it's going to spread, but it's going to be, I hope, like a really
[51:32.520 --> 51:34.200]  terrible flu.
[51:34.200 --> 51:38.240]  But if it mutates and it gets up to a higher realm, then forget it.
[51:38.240 --> 51:43.760]  You know, the Spanish flu had a 10 to 20% fatality rate.
[51:43.760 --> 51:48.240]  People got it and died the same day, their lungs filling up with fluid.
[51:48.240 --> 51:54.680]  And what happens then is, and it's much worse in urban areas and compact areas like military
[51:54.680 --> 51:57.600]  bases on troopships, things like that.
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.040]  It just spreads like a nuclear bomb, you know, like a chain reaction.
[52:02.040 --> 52:07.160]  When you have a 10 or a 20% mortality rate, there are not enough grave diggers.
[52:07.160 --> 52:10.320]  There are not enough, you know, the doctors are all sick.
[52:10.320 --> 52:15.360]  And everything just, you know, the disease runs wild, but there's nowhere to bury them.
[52:15.360 --> 52:17.100]  There's nobody to bury them.
[52:17.100 --> 52:18.800]  The food supply stops.
[52:18.800 --> 52:22.880]  We got to the border of that with the Spanish flu in 1918.
[52:22.880 --> 52:30.280]  But if it happened today, it might not take as much of a mortality rate because our society
[52:30.280 --> 52:32.480]  is so close to already boiling over.
[52:32.480 --> 52:38.480]  You know, in Jacksonville, near where I live, there are stores now, you can imagine, that
[52:38.480 --> 52:39.480]  have a policy.
[52:39.480 --> 52:44.360]  They do not allow more than five people in the dollar store because crowds of kids come
[52:44.360 --> 52:46.280]  in and just loot the place every day.
[52:46.280 --> 52:50.000]  You know, this is nothing like America of 1918.
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.200]  You know, we're already at that flash mob, you know, ready to go crazy.
[52:55.200 --> 53:00.200]  People aren't self-sufficient, people, a lot of people feel entitled.
[53:00.200 --> 53:02.280]  Everywhere the news is white people are inherently bad.
[53:02.280 --> 53:06.320]  By the way, most minorities are really nice, cool people, but it's weird white people trying
[53:06.320 --> 53:11.080]  to program them to attack whites, to further destabilize things during a crisis.
[53:11.080 --> 53:16.320]  I mean, this has been done by design in a giant clout and piven on steroids strategy.
[53:16.320 --> 53:17.320]  Yes.
[53:17.320 --> 53:19.680]  And Alex, you mentioned race.
[53:19.680 --> 53:25.880]  Nobody in 1918 would have thought that this was a bioengineered weapon designed to wipe
[53:25.880 --> 53:28.200]  out this or that race.
[53:28.200 --> 53:34.800]  But you can bet that there will be every kind of rumor or theory that this is a racially
[53:34.800 --> 53:36.240]  engineered bio weapon.
[53:36.240 --> 53:41.600]  And even if that doesn't happen, poorer people, minorities will feel like, oh, all this, they'll
[53:41.600 --> 53:47.000]  be told, they'll hear rumors that all the supplies are going to the rich white neighborhoods
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.240]  and we're getting nothing.
[53:48.240 --> 53:53.920]  Oh, you know, you know, the Democratic Party in the left, Obama got caught in Kenya with
[53:53.920 --> 53:58.840]  his cousin, also in Egypt, but also here with the whole Trayvon Martin thing they kicked
[53:58.840 --> 53:59.840]  off.
[53:59.840 --> 54:01.120]  It's not about who's right or wrong.
[54:01.120 --> 54:02.800]  It came out, as you know, in documents.
[54:02.800 --> 54:06.480]  They were trying to foment a race war and literally trying to get us all to kill each
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.480]  other.
[54:07.480 --> 54:08.480]  It didn't work then.
[54:08.480 --> 54:12.280]  But you know, if there is a regular virus or a contrived virus, whatever it is, the
[54:12.280 --> 54:15.320]  deep state is going to try to use it against Trump and against America.
[54:15.320 --> 54:20.640]  And I think that's why Trump's been so restrained in not having countermeasures because he doesn't
[54:20.640 --> 54:21.800]  want to add to the hysteria.
[54:21.800 --> 54:24.720]  I'm not saying that's a good or a bad thing, but what do you think, Matt?
[54:24.720 --> 54:33.000]  Well, if it stays within that like two to 3% mortality rate, then no matter how it spreads
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  great.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.600]  I mean, it's not as bad as measles.
[54:36.600 --> 54:41.000]  Measles can float in the air like in an airport for hundreds of feet and land on a surface
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.800]  and infect you long after, but this is not as deadly as the SARS virus, but it spreads
[54:48.800 --> 54:49.800]  a lot more.
[54:49.800 --> 54:56.040]  But if it stays at a 2%, we can ride it out as long as the social cohesion holds.
[54:56.040 --> 55:02.160]  If it gets up 5%, 8%, 10%, I think all bets are off because it'll start affecting the
[55:02.160 --> 55:04.200]  transportation infrastructure.
[55:04.200 --> 55:06.360]  If supermarkets don't get resupplied with it.
[55:06.360 --> 55:07.360]  Stay there.
[55:07.360 --> 55:08.360]  I've got to go to break.
[55:08.360 --> 55:12.200]  We've got a lot coming up and a lot more and we're following the Senate trial and all
[55:12.200 --> 55:15.280]  this new bulletin stuff and shots fired at Mar-Lago, but we're getting more on that.
[55:15.280 --> 55:16.280]  We come back.
[55:16.280 --> 55:18.120]  We've got more coming in right now.
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.960]  Stay right there, Matt Brack, and do a little bit more time with us, nwisfaranddomestic.com.
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.320]  By the way, listeners, I'm here saying get vitamin D3 with vitamin K to help fight off
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.640]  viruses and bacteria before this hit.
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.300]  We have the best product that's about to sell out, and that's winter sun.
[55:33.300 --> 55:39.840]  We also have something nobody else has, patented nano silver that is what the U.S. military
[55:39.840 --> 55:40.840]  uses.
[55:40.840 --> 55:41.840]  I don't even have time to get into all this.
[55:41.840 --> 55:42.840]  I showed it to you yesterday.
[55:42.840 --> 55:46.360]  This is congressional restricted documents.
[55:46.360 --> 55:49.240]  Where do you think I get the stuff we sell?
[55:49.240 --> 55:50.240]  We don't play games.
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.200]  I go out to get the best, and a lot of times the best are listeners.
[55:54.200 --> 55:57.840]  We are the only people that can private label this, but this is a product my dad developed
[55:57.840 --> 55:58.840]  with them.
[55:58.840 --> 56:00.840]  The next hour, I'm going to spend five minutes on this because it's important.
[56:00.840 --> 56:03.440]  I'm going to show you the company and who they are because they don't care.
[56:03.440 --> 56:07.520]  I've always left our private labelers alone, because I don't want to get harassed.
[56:07.520 --> 56:08.520]  These people are patriots.
[56:08.520 --> 56:09.520]  They don't care.
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.520]  They're like, no, tell them.
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.520]  In fact, here's some documents.
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.360]  We just got authorized by Congress to show these from a congressman, so this is all going
[56:17.360 --> 56:18.720]  down right here, folks.
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.160]  So we've got it, and it's going to sell out at current sales rates by the middle of next
[56:22.160 --> 56:24.280]  week.
[56:24.280 --> 56:26.720]  Everybody else would go to full retail on this or jack at the price.
[56:26.720 --> 56:27.720]  Not us.
[56:27.720 --> 56:28.720]  Not us.
[56:28.720 --> 56:29.720]  Not us.
[56:29.720 --> 56:34.120]  We're going to get that percent off right now in fullwarstore.com, because I want you
[56:34.120 --> 56:35.120]  to get it.
[56:35.120 --> 56:36.120]  I want you to have it.
[56:36.120 --> 56:38.760]  And please don't forget, we have the very best storeable food.
[56:38.760 --> 56:41.600]  And at the price, you can pay again a lot more and get something that tastes better.
[56:41.600 --> 56:42.600]  But people really like this.
[56:42.600 --> 56:43.840]  It's high quality.
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.640]  I go out and get the best sponsors, so you like it and want to reorder it.
[56:47.640 --> 56:52.600]  And so if there's ever a giant spike in demand, they can actually supply it.
[56:52.600 --> 56:54.640]  Because this isn't my first rodeo.
[56:54.640 --> 56:59.680]  So I've had these folks for almost 12 years, and they're probably the largest food company
[56:59.680 --> 57:00.680]  in the U.S. now.
[57:00.680 --> 57:04.560]  They're the top three that are uncontested.
[57:04.560 --> 57:07.320]  And it just, it's drop shipped from them.
[57:07.320 --> 57:08.480]  They're in our computer system.
[57:08.480 --> 57:10.040]  We have a partnership with them.
[57:10.040 --> 57:12.920]  And it just goes right out to you seven to 10 days.
[57:12.920 --> 57:15.720]  They have the food, but they're 24 hours a day packing it.
[57:15.720 --> 57:16.720]  So it's super fresh.
[57:16.720 --> 57:17.760]  It's 25 years.
[57:17.760 --> 57:18.760]  It's in great containers.
[57:18.760 --> 57:21.320]  It's my Patriot supply in fullwarstore.com.
[57:21.320 --> 57:27.400]  The full catalog, the very best specials you can get on their line of food in fullwarstore.com.
[57:27.400 --> 57:30.200]  And the fact that governments buy it all up, they're one of the only companies that wouldn't
[57:30.200 --> 57:32.400]  sell it to FEMA and this other government agency.
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.000]  And I'm going to interview the CEO of the company in the fourth hour.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.480]  In fullwarstore.com and your purchase funds the In Full War.
[57:38.480 --> 57:39.480]  And it's insurance you can eat.
[57:39.480 --> 57:44.280]  The only way you fail is not taking action and protecting yourself and your family.
[57:44.280 --> 57:47.920]  In fullwarstore.com.
[57:47.920 --> 57:52.960]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China, and the food
[57:52.960 --> 57:55.640]  supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[57:55.640 --> 57:59.160]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries.
[57:59.160 --> 58:04.040]  And many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States
[58:04.040 --> 58:05.040]  West Coast.
[58:05.040 --> 58:09.600]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.360]  run out of supplies of affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.240]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up
[58:18.240 --> 58:20.040]  food stores at alarming rates.
[58:20.040 --> 58:24.680]  In full wars, private labels from my Patriot supply and ships right out of the very same
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.680]  factory.
[58:25.680 --> 58:29.400]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run
[58:29.400 --> 58:31.280]  out probably in a few weeks.
[58:31.280 --> 58:36.160]  And that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[58:36.160 --> 58:43.520]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer, but if you get your order in now at in fullwarstore.com,
[58:43.520 --> 58:47.920]  you will be secured to get the food within seven to ten days.
[58:47.920 --> 58:56.160]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and
[58:56.160 --> 58:59.280]  Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[58:59.280 --> 59:05.320]  Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[59:05.320 --> 59:10.400]  But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[59:10.400 --> 59:17.440]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[59:17.440 --> 59:21.800]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[59:21.800 --> 59:27.800]  Anyone once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump, will also be targeted
[59:27.800 --> 59:32.000]  by Cobra in the future.
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then
[59:39.000 --> 59:46.160]  blame you like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[59:46.160 --> 59:56.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.160 --> 1:00:07.000]  All right, let's just dispense with even the intro, Alex Jones here back live.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Matt Bracken, during the short break, is shaking his head.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.200]  We have him on the show a lot, he's a great contributor.
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:15.160]  I never seen him do that.
[1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:16.160]  It's breaking.
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:17.160]  What are you seeing now?
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:20.480]  We have breaking shots fired outside Marlago, somebody reportedly tried to crash through
[1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:21.480]  the gate.
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:22.720]  The Secret Service police shot him.
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:23.720]  They got away.
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.320]  I mean, what the hell is going on?
[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:26.320]  Here's the headline.
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:31.960]  Marlago, gate, crash, shots fired, Bolton's dropped a bunch of little new propaganda poodle
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:32.960]  bombs.
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:35.640]  And they're acting like it's the end of the world there.
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:37.440]  Will the president be acquitted today?
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:39.800]  We're going to be covering more of this when we come back.
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:44.000]  We've got the video of what happened at Marlago, so we'll have some of that next segment.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.120]  But in closing, break down a society, why do you think the drill is so big?
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.240]  Why are they acting like the virus is so deadly?
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:55.160]  Why do you think Trump's responded this way?
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:57.280]  Other key points.
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:01.640]  So far, the disease does not appear to be that deadly, and not that we can trust any
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:03.600]  figures coming out of China.
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:06.080]  So there could be a cover-up going on.
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:09.600]  Once it gets into other countries, you know, like Italy, this cruise ship, if this has
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.200]  a high mortality rate, then they'll be dragging bodies off that cruise ship like you can't
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  believe.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:16.200]  That's right.
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:17.200]  They won't be able to cover it up long.
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:18.200]  No way.
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:19.720]  I was smiling during the break.
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.400]  I was listening to Cobra, and it occurred to me that if, you know, if they managed to
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:27.400]  complete the shot down in the world.
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:29.400]  You're listening to Cobra.
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:30.400]  Good, Matt.
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:36.280]  I could have a good job for you and a partnership at Cobra Industries with my good friend Destro
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:37.760]  and Baroness.
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:45.200]  Alex, you and Owen, you and Owen can make a complete side-living, maybe better, Hollywood.
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:47.840]  You and Owen doing voiceovers.
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:48.840]  That's it.
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:49.840]  That's it.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:51.840]  You can shut down the store and fund it off of voiceovers.
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:56.040]  Hey, you know, I'm not bragging, but I was actually on the road to being like a top voiceover
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:01:57.040]  guy.
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:02.200]  I was voicing major trailers, stuff for films, TV ads, insurance company commercials.
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.600]  But as soon as they went, wait a minute, you're the Alex Jones criticizing Obama.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:11.680]  That when Obama got in, I mean, I made one year $890,000 because I was in the half tarp,
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:15.040]  you know, the whole Screen Actors Guild, whole deal for voiceovers.
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:19.400]  And so it would go through that, and a lot of this place got built on voiceover money.
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.400]  But that's what happened.
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:24.880]  As soon as I criticized Obama, like a spicket, the jobs went off.
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  So yeah.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:29.960]  I had no idea, but it absolutely does not surprise me.
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:31.200]  Does not surprise me.
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:33.320]  But you and Owen together, I mean, good.
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:34.320]  He's good too.
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.520]  Yeah, and he can sing too.
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:43.880]  But as far as this virus, it's kind of a good test for maybe, unless it mutates, I think
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:47.560]  we can ride this one out, unless it mutates to a higher mortality rate.
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:51.600]  At 2% or 3%, a society can ride it out.
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.260]  It's not like Ebola, just nuking entire villages.
[1:02:55.260 --> 1:03:00.160]  But this one will spread, you know, there's sort of a thing, there's like a paradigm.
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:03.560]  You have lethality versus mobility.
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:08.720]  This one has great mobility and transmissibility, but not high lethality.
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:12.840]  If it mutates to a higher lethality, then all bets are off.
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:17.160]  But for now, we can almost, I think we can just afford to study it.
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:20.160]  And I'm glad that Trump hasn't hit the panic button on it.
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:25.920]  It's something I wanted to say before, that the whole anti-vaccine thing, if there was
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:33.160]  a big pandemic, you can bet that they would outlaw talking about vaccines, except to say,
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:35.520]  you know, salute and take your vaccine.
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.960]  They would call it national security and national emergency.
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:40.240]  That's why I think this may be staged.
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:44.760]  For six months, there's been a total war on people even questioning vaccine efficacy.
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:46.880]  And there's been a total shutdown.
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:51.240]  And if there's a real pandemic and people are really frightened, it'll be like 9-11
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:52.880]  bringing in the Patriot Act.
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:56.840]  If you want to get rid of the First Amendment, you need to get people to think there's something
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:01.520]  so bad that we just can't allow people to say, don't take a vaccine.
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:05.440]  And let's just hypothetically say, they created the greatest vaccine in the world.
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:08.160]  It was 100% effective and no risk.
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.600]  There are going to be people that doubt it.
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:13.400]  Well, they'll just say, you may not doubt it because of the national.
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.000]  There's also like Orthodox Jews and people that's against their religion.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Right.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.560]  And in World War I, they arrested, you know, thousands of people for just slightly hinting
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:26.880]  that the war was wrong in the teams.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:31.320]  So we have a history in this country, like Alien and Sedition Act.
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:34.240]  We have a history of doing this.
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:36.120]  Matt Bracken, thank you so much for the time.
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.560]  I really appreciate you joining us, enemiesfarmdomestic.com.
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:39.560]  Thank you.
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:40.560]  All right.
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:43.880]  When we come back, I'm going to cover the latest breaking news in Marlago, the latest
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  on the virus.
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:50.800]  And there's a short little special report by Greg Rees on this Chinese city where this
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:57.080]  all started is the first test bed for 5G and 6G.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:02.640]  We've got three big sales going right now and one of them has to end within a week.
[1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:08.280]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:09.280]  It's amazing.
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:10.720]  Go check it out for yourself.
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:16.200]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:19.080]  halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:21.240]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:25.280]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got
[1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.280]  enough iodine.
[1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:31.320]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off M4store.com and it funds the M4.

[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.200]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:42.800]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:44.000]  That's why people get so sick.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  That's the main reason.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.880]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption.
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:48.880]  It's amazing.
[1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:53.120]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at M4store.com.
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:06:01.920]  Protect yourself and fund the M4, 360 win.
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:15.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:22.360]  There are strange facts surrounding the coronavirus outbreak of 2020.
[1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:28.800]  In 2018, the Peer Bright Institute was granted a patent for the coronavirus.
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:34.560]  The Peer Bright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:41.360]  On October 18th of 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with John Hopkins
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:48.920]  and the World Economic Forum, hosted Event 201, a high level pandemic simulation in New
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:50.600]  York City.
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:57.320]  The simulation, which was held just three months ago, was based on the coronavirus.
[1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:03.480]  They concluded that it could kill 65 million people and decided the solution was to have
[1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:07.240]  a vaccine within months of an epidemic.
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:12.760]  The same week that the coronavirus makes headlines, Netflix releases the docu-series
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:21.600]  pandemic, how to prevent an outbreak, wherein the solution is vaccines and the trusted hero
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:23.280]  is Bill Gates.
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:30.160]  Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fund Innovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:33.840]  a coronavirus vaccine.
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:36.520]  It's weird, right?
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:40.080]  Or am I just a conspiracy theorist?
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:41.640]  What about this?
[1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:48.360]  5G, an emerging technology upgrade that has many countries concerned about its impact
[1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:50.520]  on human health.
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:55.080]  Experts from all over the world warn of the dangers of 5G.
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:08:02.840]  In 2018, it was reported locally that Wuhan would be the test bed city for full 5G network
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:05.640]  operation in China.
[1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:11.280]  The article went on to say that it would be fully operational by 2020.
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:17.880]  And on Halloween of 2019, they turned it on.
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:23.400]  Scientists warn that 5G causes flu-like symptoms.
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:25.600]  Interesting?
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:32.080]  What is also interesting is that when trying to share the link of 5G being launched in Wuhan,
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:39.120]  Facebook blocks you from doing so, because it violates their community guidelines.
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:56.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:01.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:05.600]  There was an article.
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:07.440]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:13.440]  This week saying, meet the real umbrella corporation.
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.240]  And I'm not a huge Resident Evil fan.
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  I am a fan of that, Asian or Pinchick, whatever her name is, but I've seen a couple of them.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:27.400]  And it's about an evil corporation that's called Umbrella, but really it's the Red Cross
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:32.720]  of the secret societies.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:38.640]  And so whoever wrote it was really smart, because the Red Cross is actually the oldest
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:44.080]  operating intelligence agency, continual operating secret society that's ever been.
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:45.080]  There are some that are older.
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.560]  They're just not continually operating.
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:50.320]  And everybody's like, yeah, this is like the Umbrella Corporation.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:54.240]  And then my buddy Shane Stonner sent me this image.
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:10:01.800]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it, and it says Umbrella Corporation.
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:02.800]  Good shot if we could.
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:03.800]  That'd be awesome.
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:04.800]  Thanks.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:11.560]  And the actual research laboratory where this happened has the exact same symbol, but
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:14.920]  instead of red and gray, it's green and gray.
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:18.320]  I mean, it's the exact same symbol.
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:19.880]  And I'm like, okay, that's got to be a joke.
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:26.600]  And then Corona translates to Raccoon City, and that ties back to the movie.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:29.880]  And I went and looked this up, and again, I miss a lot of stuff.
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.400]  People are always asking, why aren't you covering this?
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:32.400]  Why aren't you covering that?
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:36.120]  I just see a zero-hedge article read a little bit of it, and like, hey, this is really an
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:38.560]  evil corporation, and they've done bad stuff before.
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:44.680]  And it's just like the Resident Evil Corporation.
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:49.000]  But I didn't even pay attention to the photo they had on there and the underwriting under
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  it.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.520]  I thought it was a joke.
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:58.400]  No, they really have the same symbol as the Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation.
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.880]  That in the world is going on.
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:06.520]  I mean, it's not just close.
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:07.520]  It's dead on.
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:12.160]  In fact, it's the same symbol.
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:18.440]  If you look at it in night vision view, it's just in night vision view.
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:20.520]  It's the exact symbol.
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:29.640]  And by the way, that's the symbol of a lot of secret societies, some good, some bad,
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:38.760]  but that particular one is Nazi lore, the Iron Cross, all of it.
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:44.360]  Why would the Chai comms in a known lab connected to the government and bio weapons development?
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.520]  That's in fact, queue up.
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:49.800]  Senator Cotton, please.
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:52.920]  Why in the hell would they have that symbol?
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:54.320]  Now, I've got to look it up.
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:12:00.600]  I spent like 10 minutes this morning and couldn't find when they got that logo.
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:04.440]  But it appears the company and the logo comes after Resident Evil.
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:09.240]  So why would you pick the Resident Evil symbol of the Evil Global Corporation?
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:10.240]  Why?
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:11.240]  Why?
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:12.920]  This is big, folks.
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:18.720]  This is big because the globalists are obsessed with putting their fingerprints on it.
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:22.400]  It's like anybody, a good guy, bad guy, US special forces, you'd say we're the good
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:24.640]  guys, we're the bad guys in Vietnam, depending on how you look at it.
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:28.800]  But they'd leave an ace of spades when they killed somebody in their mouth or at the scene
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:31.960]  so you know who did it.
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:39.240]  Well, where this came from, a lot of experts believe in shadowy groups tied to the US military
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:52.560]  and tied to thefts in Canada of a coronavirus genome, RNA is now being tracked back to this
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:53.560]  company.
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:13:02.400]  And you've had four releases of coronaviruses before, SARS is a coronavirus by Chinese labs.
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.440]  But the Washington Post says, oh, you better not ask questions.
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:07.440]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:11.640]  And here's Senator Cotton talking about it yesterday.
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:17.240]  They also claimed for almost two months until earlier this week that it had originated in
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:23.560]  a seafood market in Wuhan, that locals had contracted it from animals and say bat soup
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:26.280]  or snake tartare.
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:28.360]  That is not the case.
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:34.800]  The Lancet published study last weekend demonstrating that of the original 40 cases, 14 of them
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:38.960]  had no contact with the seafood market, including patient zero.
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.760]  As one epidemiologist said, that virus went into the seafood market before it came out
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:44.920]  of the seafood market.
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:48.360]  We still don't know where it originated, could have been another seafood market, could have
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:51.880]  been a farm, could have been a food processing company.
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:59.000]  I would note that Wuhan also has China's only biosafety level four super laboratory
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:06.120]  that works with the world's most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:08.040]  Oh.
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.920]  And he calls for shutting down all flights to the U.S.
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:19.880]  If it's as deadly as Lancet saying up to 15% death rate, which I don't believe, then you
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:24.080]  better damn well shut down flights from China.
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:32.120]  Now, I would not preempt the coverage of the trial of the president.
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:39.840]  And the gatecrasher and shots fired at Mar-a-Lago and the coronavirus and your phone calls,
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.200]  that's what I'm really wanting to take, because you just bring up angles I wouldn't have thought
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:45.200]  of.
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.840]  Or a lot of times I already thought that then later, I'm like, oh, wow, I forgot to say
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:49.840]  that.
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.120]  We're thinking the same thing here.
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:53.640]  We're getting something done here in a big brainstorm session.
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:54.640]  That's what this is.
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:56.600]  There's not talking points coming down from one high.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:57.920]  We're trying to suss this out.
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:14:59.480]  And some listeners get confused.
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:00.920]  They go, wait a minute, you got one guest saying this?
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:03.760]  And they go, yeah, we're not a cult, man.
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:06.920]  It's like when they deposed me on Sandy Hook, they go, well, one of your hosts says they
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:08.560]  thought it happened, but others were questioning.
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:12.040]  And I go, yeah, man, we're not a cult here.
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:14.280]  We question everything.
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.640]  Cults tell you don't question.
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:18.040]  And you should question info wars.
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:19.480]  You should question yourself.
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:21.320]  You should question the government.
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:22.320]  You should be engaged.
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:23.720]  And I'm not here preaching at you.
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:30.920]  I'm telling you what I need to do, but I've got to get Ezra LeVon on because I already
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:33.920]  admired him because I know about the work he's what he's been through and he's super
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:34.920]  smart.
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:38.840]  But man, I watched this video this morning and I watched it twice and it's up to three
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:40.340]  thirds this morning.
[1:15:40.340 --> 1:15:44.520]  And I mean, this is like the real Perry Mason.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.400]  He's the Perry Mason when he runs into these federal police that are trying to put him
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:56.400]  in jail for writing a book, wait until you see this.
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:02.560]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:03.560]  Forget bunkers.
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:05.520]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:10.360]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival bug
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.120]  outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  Bold statement.
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  You bet.
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.600]  I'm now at survivalist camps dot com.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.640]  That's survivalist camps dot com.
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:25.760]  Trust your family survival to survivalist camps dot com.
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:31.120]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.120]  the world.
[1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:35.160]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:41.120]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:44.920]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:47.440]  As a river of vote, who do we fight for?
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:54.000]  The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.200]  at Amazon Books.
[1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.600]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:05.000]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.840]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:13.400]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:17.920]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:18.920]  across America.
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:20.920]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:22.920]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:26.520]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:27.520]  healthier I feel.
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.120]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:35.320]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.800]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:46.000]  Remember your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 that's 866-295-5305 or order
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:57.080]  online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:17:59.840]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for swarable foods.
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:02.800]  I would have swarable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.480]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:05.480]  I hope it doesn't.
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:08.600]  It's incredibly dangerous and it will cause, well you don't need me to tell you what will
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.080]  happen if this giant bubble pops.
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:13.800]  So I've been promoting swarable foods to everybody because they're high quality, it's insurance
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:14.800]  you can eat.
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:15.800]  It lasts 25 years.
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.120]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.600]  lowest price and that's my Patriot supply.
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:25.200]  And then so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:30.680]  label it as infowars select and they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:34.760]  They're still able within 7 to 10 days to ship it to you, give you get your orders in on
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:39.720]  their small orders, their big orders, 7 to 10 days it will be shipped out to you, give
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:41.320]  you get your order in now.
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:45.000]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.440]  So get your orders in for high quality swarable foods right now for all the reasons out there
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:53.440]  and it's insurance you can eat and it funds the Infowar, a total 360 win.
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:54.440]  InfowarStore.com.
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:19:02.200]  Well it's here, the year 2020, world governments out in the open, we've got the predicted mass
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:06.400]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:12.080]  huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:18.960]  promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  Wow.
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.160]  Yes, now we know we're right, the new world order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:28.200]  a leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:32.640]  no, but I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:38.400]  in Kansas, we have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter, everything we do,
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:43.040]  every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:44.040]  and everything we're going to go through.
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:47.440]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:52.720]  being involved, but just remember your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:20:00.160]  support of m4shore.com is critical, so please take action.
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:28.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show right behind me is Mar-a-Lago and I'm not sure if
[1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:32.720]  you can hear, but there are multiple helicopters over location now we have just heard from
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:37.240]  the Florida police, they say a vehicle and suspects are currently in custody.
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:41.520]  So the way that they describe the situation is essentially the Florida highway patrol
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:48.000]  was following a black SUV as it barreled towards two security points outside of Mar-a-Lago.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:53.320]  It broke through both of those security points before eventually officials launching fire
[1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:54.320]  into that vehicle.
[1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:59.960]  Now, again, the vehicle then sped off, they were eventually tracked down and again this
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:04.200]  custody, excuse me, this vehicle and these suspects are currently in custody.
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:07.280]  We have reached out to Secret Service, we know of course President Trump is supposed
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.000]  to be here later today, he's spending his weekend here in Mar-a-Lago, this is a developing
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.080]  situation, but you should see the kind of security presence that's around us right now.
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:20.600]  Streets blocks away from Mar-a-Lago are completely shut down and we talked to one eyewitness
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:25.240]  who was at Mar-a-Lago when the security said he heard about eight gunshots at this time
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:28.680]  and then was shuttled off by Secret Service and of course we know the rest of that story
[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:33.160]  because we watched it happening, all of these roads being shut down the Florida police as
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:37.080]  well as these agents all on the scene here trying to determine what happened.
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:42.080]  The big question here of course is whether or not that vehicle was headed towards Mar-a-Lago
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:46.760]  intentionally, were they on a chase for any reason, why exactly were they following this
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:50.440]  car in the first place and why was it heading towards Mar-a-Lago and of course what this
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:53.720]  is just a developing situation, we're going to keep our ear to the ground, keep talking
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:59.040]  to our sources to figure out what exactly happened.
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:04.320]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones and there is a lot
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:09.440]  of breaking news obviously unfolding, this could have just been somebody that was going
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:13.280]  the wrong way and not paying attention, they could have been drinking and could have been
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:17.440]  driven in and driven out and then you do that in a security like that, you're going to get
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:24.640]  shot at, that's sad but there's going to be collateral damage in a climate where they're
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:33.440]  saying Trump is literally Hitler and having a nation is Hitler and then the only person
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:39.520]  with any connection to Hitler we see is George Soros who literally was a Nazi collaborator
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:44.160]  and said it was the best time of his life and then he finances a whole network saying
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:53.560]  Trump is Hitler, you can't make this up ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make this stuff
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:23:06.200]  up so there's that, sometimes you see something and it blows your mind and that happened to
[1:23:06.200 --> 1:23:10.960]  me, I woke up at 3.30 in the morning last night with all the stuff going on, drank some
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  coffee, took a shower, went and walked around the local golf course that's next door, came
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:22.840]  back about 5 a.m. and sat down with an iPad, had another cup of coffee and I went to InfoWars.com
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:27.320]  and saw a Kellerman Green article he put out like, last night I'd missed and I watched
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:31.600]  it twice and believing I don't have 45 minutes to watch it 20 something minutes twice, I
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:35.840]  watched it and I was like I got to get this guy on tomorrow but there's all this huge
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:42.600]  breaking news but I said this is important because what it illustrates for everybody,
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:47.000]  it's like a skeleton key or a Rosetta stone but I'm going to get Ezra Levante's take on
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:51.960]  the impeachment of Trump, the trial, the virus first in this segment then we'll get to what
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:24:00.280]  we're talking about when we come back but I mean, I don't have enough words to describe
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:07.400]  how these senior former federal police now attach another federal group, 30-year veteran
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:15.520]  Royal Mounties in their suits, sit there and act like something out of a movie about
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:22.120]  the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, I mean, it's like that scene when Mr. Anderson in
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:29.440]  the first matrix meets the agent Smith, I mean, I watched this and it's horrifying and
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:35.280]  then I went and read like hundreds of comments on YouTube, I sat there and then my kids start
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:38.360]  waking up, come in like 6.30, I'm making them breakfast and they're like what are you doing
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:42.680]  and I'm reading the comments, everyone sees what it is like the new Soviet Union, it's
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:47.920]  insane and here's the thing, you watch, they're going to charge you, you can smell it, they
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:52.000]  say you're guilty, you want to walk that back, you just admitted you're guilty of writing
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:57.920]  a book during an election and Ezra Levante's like well I've got the law here, that's totally
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:04.280]  legal, right, they go you're going to jail, this is America with cops in a room trying
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:12.520]  to hot box somebody, but it's over a book and it's like a sick parody, but it's not,
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:17.920]  this is Kevin Blackface Trudeau, like what's up with dudes in Blackface trying to take
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:21.640]  our freedoms, in Virginia and I'm going to stop there, this is a limited time in this
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:25.480]  segment as we're going to get to this and the whole climate and what they're calling
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:30.200]  for Rand Paul's arrest for exposing the fake whistleblower and the president's bill to
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.880]  face his accuser, what I got from this is what I already knew, whether it's Europe or
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:39.080]  Canada or the US or Australia or anywhere, the left are communists, authoritarians and
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:43.720]  they've decided to do this and they're taking over and they want to put us all in prison
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:48.960]  and I have empathy for you, not because I'm a candy ass, but because I'm in the same boat
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:54.200]  and like we need to push back and I love what you said to them, hey I'm not looking for
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:58.600]  trouble, but I'm, you damn right I did that, you bet I published a book, because I'm a
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.680]  free person and that's in our constitution, look at you, you are shameful, it's like
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:07.160]  Oscar level, but it's beyond that because it's real, they really are trying to put you
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:11.720]  in jail, they've really banned your TV network when it was one of the top rated deals, I
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.160]  mean you've already been effed over by this authoritarianism and now they want you to
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.560]  fear them, I mean these people are a joke, now I'm ranting, we'll get to the next segment
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:22.640]  but I said I'll get to the next segment I'm doing it now, what do you make yourself the
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:28.800]  general climate though and Trump and the left in their droodling desire to put us in prison?
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:34.920]  Well look it's part of the same thing, to ban a book or to impeach a president, what
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:42.000]  are those, those are using the power of the authoritarian state to undo the natural will
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:47.320]  of the people, in my case I wrote a popular book about Trudeau, well the government was
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:53.200]  gonna squash that by prosecuting me, in the case of Trump's impeachment he won the election
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:59.440]  fair and square, he looks like he might win again, so use the power of the state to stop
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:04.360]  it undemocratically, it's also what happened to Brexit, for three and a half years they
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:10.680]  managed to foil the will of the people, today finally Brexit is happening, so all of these
[1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:16.680]  are cautionary tales, don't give up your power to a authoritarian, but all of them give us
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:23.880]  a little glimmer of hope too that if you fight hard you might win in the end, well I mean
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:28.840]  I've got to say it, I watched the video twice, it's up on infowars.com, it's also on your
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:34.520]  site, I know you've got a lot of sites, what is the best site to go find the video, well
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:40.800]  we have a special page for it called save rebel news.com and I'll take your cue about
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:46.880]  timing but there's one, I sent your producer a few clips, one of them is so incredible,
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:50.200]  so I'm summoned there, I mean you tell me if we want it, I don't know what you want
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:57.360]  to talk about now on your timing, yeah, you know I go down there, they take me to a high
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:02.880]  security location, they tell me no videotaping, well I'm not gonna listen to them because
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.800]  I know if they're telling me I can't tape it, it's because they're saying things they
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:13.240]  don't want shown to the world, so I have on me a concealed camera, James O'Keefe style
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.080]  and I'm so glad I did because I don't think people would have believed it if they didn't
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:21.840]  see it, when we come back from the break I'll show you the most terrifying thing I said
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:27.640]  to them, show me the complaint against me, I'm ready to meet the charges, they said we're
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.160]  not gonna show you the complaint, I said is it a secret, well I'll let you show how that
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.960]  goes, we're gonna come back, we're gonna get to it all with Ezra Levant because there's
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:40.360]  such huge news breaking but this is the authoritarianism, these people are dangerous and I've read
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:45.160]  about stuff like this in like Nazi Germany and Russia but now you're seeing it in Canada
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:49.800]  folks, it's unbelievable, you're guilty of publishing that book and they're guys in
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:29:14.800]  sharp suits and they're on a power trip, they're enjoying this.

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:02.040]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food
[1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:06.160]  supplies and medical supplies are running out. We know the virus has already spread
[1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:11.360]  to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:16.520]  arriving on the United States West Coast. We've now confirmed from major food suppliers
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:21.960]  across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of food because of institutional
[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:26.000]  and governmental buyers. That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:32.680]  are now buying up food stores at alarming rates. InfoWars private labels from my Patriots
[1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:35.880]  supply and ships right out of the very same factory. They called and let us know that
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:40.360]  they have bought food forward, that that's going to run out probably in a few weeks and
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:45.440]  that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within 7 to 10 days. But
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:52.560]  if people wait, it may end up being longer, but if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com,
[1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:56.840]  you will be secured to get the food within 7 to 10 days.
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:31:01.160]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:05.480]  You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship
[1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:09.360]  and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back. And
[1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:13.600]  you know what? I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team. And it's
[1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:20.400]  why InfoWars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:26.440]  people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity
[1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:31.080]  and I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are
[1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:35.360]  the Info War and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:40.000]  you can. For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at InfoWars,
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.240]  I want to thank you all because you are the Info War and you know that's not just words,
[1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:52.120]  that's reality. You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only
[1:31:52.120 --> 1:32:18.120]  has power because of you and I suggest you use it.
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:27.760]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:32.640]  viruses. So right now we have winter sun still available even though we always order only
[1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:37.240]  so much for sale during the fall, winter and spring. I'm going to let it sell out at the
[1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:44.720]  sales price of 40% off $23. Despite the fact that I could sell it at full price because
[1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:49.280]  I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you, protecting yourself and your family.
[1:32:49.280 --> 1:33:00.080]  So winter sun taken out of the tongue, super high quality, 40% off available now at InfoWars.com.
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:23.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:29.280]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com and it's just insane. Everybody knows they're doing
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:32.880]  this in Europe. Everybody knows they've hired the former Stasi to help suppress nationalists
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:39.800]  and patriots and people just promoting freedom. But now in Canada, they've been persecuting
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:45.560]  the press and shut down his network on national TV that was popular, taking away its license.
[1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:50.960]  This is what goes on and now they're trying to do that here in America. And so you're
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.040]  like, oh, it's a private company, you know, let big tech censor. You will now, it's royal
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:59.720]  mounted police coming in suits and ties, calling you in the letter, you go in and meet with
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:05.440]  them. And it's right out of a cop movie. They're not asking if he sold cocaine or if he money
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:11.160]  laundered or if he kidnapped somebody. No, it's about the book he wrote. It's it's incredible.
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:16.600]  Here's a few minutes from the intro. Today we're here about Rebel News Network Liberty.
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  Oh, I know that. And I'm just asking you to confirm that not that not a single other loving
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:28.040]  book of Trudeau is being investigated. Once we're done, if you believe that there should
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:33.440]  be complaints that are no because I'm not a censor like you. I'm not a bully and a censor.
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:38.120]  I'm not a bureaucrat looking to justify my budget like you. I go out and earn my living
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:47.440]  every day, fella. You call in authors to grill them about a book criticizing your boss. Think
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.960]  about who you are. We call the director of Rebel News Network Limited. Yeah, who happens
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:57.600]  to be the author of the book? I think there's going to be a chapter about you two fellas
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:08.880]  in the next edition. Giving our questions there? Certainly do.
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.160]  All right, let's just stop there. As are the best way to do this is just let you take control
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:17.960]  for this segment and part of the next. You've got a bunch of clips here. You've got a lot
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:23.320]  to say and we're honored to have you with us. But again, they're trying to use campaign
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:27.360]  finance law, just like Democrats have said, ban drudge, ban Alex Jones, use campaign
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:32.720]  finance law. We're under speech. We're not under campaign. Sure, I support Second Amendment
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:37.320]  pro-life things like that. And I'm a Republican when it's for President Trump. I hate a lot
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:41.320]  of the Republicans, but if I want to publish a book around an election, I can. Well, Canada's
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:45.760]  put laws in place. And maybe you can briefly explain that, but you're reading them the
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:52.080]  law and they're saying, sorry, you're a criminal. He says twice. Well, just you take over.
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:55.880]  Go ahead. Sure. I mean, in Canada election law, there's
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:03.200]  a special exemption for book and the promotion of books. So I mean, I've written, I don't
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.720]  know, almost 10 books or so. I'd have to count some of them are best sellers. So the book
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:13.480]  is clearly protected under our laws. And yet they still brought me in. Here's the crazy
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:19.680]  thing. There were 24 book published about Justin Trudeau, our left wing prime minister,
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:25.640]  the same time as mine. But I was the only author that was brought in. So that's not
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:32.840]  a coincidence. And I thought, well, should I even go there? But I knew that I could get
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:39.520]  them to admit things if they didn't realize I was videotaping them. So I asked them a basic
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:44.920]  question. Let me start with this one. Let me show you how Kafka asked it. I went to
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:49.760]  Ottawa, this high security location. They took me into a windowless room. There was
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:55.160]  these two 30 year veterans of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I'm not sure their status
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:00.000]  now they wouldn't give me their business card. So I don't even know their, you know, technically
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:06.080]  who they're working for. I know we were at the elections Canada head office, high security.
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:11.800]  And I said, all right, can I see the complaint against me? Let me ask your producers to roll
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:19.640]  that clip. It's called see the complaint. This is how we started. And it just got crazier.
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:26.080]  Take a look. Here he is asking for the complaint. The complaint against me. The letter that
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:31.720]  you received. No, I presume that you're investigating based on the complaint. Yeah, this is still
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:37.960]  part of the investigation. So we'll have to, once the investigation has been completed,
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:43.040]  the commission will have to make a decision. At that point, you'll have to decide if that
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:48.360]  is releasable. It's not something that's usually is released. So it's a secret complaint? It's
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:53.920]  not a secret complaint. It's just a complaint. That's part of the investigation. And to keep
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:58.480]  the integrity of the investigation right now, you'll understand that we can't share everything
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:02.920]  that we have as well. I don't want everything that you had. I just, if I'm here to meet
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:09.680]  a complaint, but you won't show me the complaint, how can I possibly meet the complaint? How
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:16.320]  can I possibly respond to something that you won't show me? Well, I think the letter was
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:22.280]  quite clear on what we're, what the infraction is, is alleged. And this is where we want
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:28.200]  to clarify with you. Well, did you generate the complaint or was it from an outside party?
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:32.040]  No, we didn't generate the complaint. Okay, so someone, generate the complaint. So someone
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.520]  external to your office generated the complaint? That is usually the case. Is that the case
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:41.920]  in this case? Yeah. Yeah, we did not generate the complaint. Okay, was it the liberal party
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:48.920]  that generated the complaint? So you won't tell me who the complaint is. They have to
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:53.440]  the complainant. Is that the secret? No, not at this point. So at what point do you tell
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:59.920]  me who this commissioner is, is the ultimate responsible person for, for the investigation
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:06.760]  and how this is decided? So how do I know what I've, what conduct has been complained
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:12.120]  about if you won't tell me? This is Kafka s. Can you make that point for those folks
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:18.160]  haven't read Kafka? That's a famous novel of a nightmare future scenario where someone's
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.240]  on trial, but they're not being told the crime they committed, or you can't face your accuser
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:26.400]  just like President Trump can't face your accuser. And when a senator says the name
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:32.240]  of Eric Saramala, the Chief Justice shuts them down. I mean, again, it's just everywhere.
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:37.560]  The attacks on free speech and other calling Democrats are for the arrest or censure. Senator
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:42.520]  Blumenthal and others of Rand Paul. The point is, these are authoritarians.
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:50.400]  Yeah. Well, listen, the lesson I hope your viewers take from my experience here in Canada
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:56.120]  is never give up your first amendment and to ensure that never give up your second amendment.
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:01.160]  I should tell you that in Canada and Europe, we don't have the first amendment and the
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:10.640]  second amendment and it's show. And the fact that many Americans have lawful firearm that
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:17.820]  on the mind of legislators, they would never try certain moves on Americans is at the end
[1:40:17.820 --> 1:40:24.560]  of the day, you have a tool to push back against tyranny. In Canada, all we have is our persuasion
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:31.720]  and our attempt to convince people. But the other side doesn't care about freedom, and
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:35.560]  they would frankly do whatever they could to get us. Well, that's right. I mean, watching
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:40.320]  the video in parts of it looks very cinematic. Other parts are aimed at the wall. They wouldn't
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:45.360]  give you their IDs on record or cards. You're still able to get that. And the arrogance
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:51.560]  of these men who, you know, are dressed nice and look like FBI agents, look like Royal
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:56.680]  Mounted Police, and they're enjoying messing with you and enjoying running over people's
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:01.040]  speech and a book you wrote that was number two on Amazon. And they know why they're there
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:04.980]  to try to scare you. These are dangerous people, in my view. I mean, I mean, this is the closest
[1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:09.320]  things to Nazis I've ever seen in Canada. I'll tell you that I'm not saying they're Nazis,
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:13.480]  but men in suits, oppressing speech, trying to digitally burn books, and you're facing
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:18.360]  years in prison if they charge you with this for campaign finance fraud. I mean, these
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:23.040]  guys are a menace, and obviously, Trudeau gave them the order. They're a menace. You've
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:27.800]  already had courts rule when Trudeau's tried to bar your reporters that he broke the law.
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.200]  He's the criminal.
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:35.480]  Well, it's a big battle. Let me know if you have time for another clip, because there's
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:36.920]  one more that might be of interest.
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:40.480]  Oh, you've got a bunch. When we come back, we've got another segment. I'm going to play
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:46.800]  these. The video made my blood pressure go up, because I mean, I watched it twice, and
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:51.560]  the arrogance of these men. Let me just ask this for the minute to break. Is the average
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:57.480]  federal police officer that arrogant in Canada, or these special commasars, special guys they've
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:58.480]  picked?
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:01.360]  Well, I was trying to find out who they were, and like I said, they wouldn't give me their
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:07.960]  business card, so I sort of took a picture of their ID cards, and then I Googled them.
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:13.440]  And these guys, 30-year veterans of the RCMP, they worked on counterterrorism matters. One
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:21.080]  of them worked for Interpol, organized crime. I think those are legitimate policing duties.
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:23.080]  So for them to be assigned to an officer-
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:27.520]  Well, that's what I'm saying. They sent real, you can tell, these people are trying to put
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:30.880]  you in prison. I mean, I watched it. I'm just like, and it's like, I don't even hate these
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.800]  people, but it's like at a deep level, like this is dangerous. These are dangerous people.
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:39.040]  This is what evil looks like. These are bad people, man. Oh my God. Oh, just stay right
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.200]  there. I mean, folks, you've got to watch the full video. It's on informers.com. It is
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:48.200]  sickening. I've got all this huge news, but I'm doing this because it is archetypal. Everything
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:56.000]  we're facing, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:00.080]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods. I would have storable foods because
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.280]  2020 is a very dangerous year. The bubble is so huge and could pop. I hope it doesn't.
[1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:07.520]  It's incredibly dangerous and a little cause. Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:11.080]  happen if this giant bubble pops. So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:14.960]  because they're high quality. It's insurance you can eat. It lasts 25 years. We go out
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:19.000]  and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.880]  And that's my Patriot supply. And then so that I have my own private label of their full
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:27.960]  spectrum of food, we private label it as info wars select. And they are saying that they've
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.240]  never sold this much food. They're still able within seven to 10 days to ship it to you
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.800]  if you get your orders in on their small orders, their big orders, seven to 10 days, it will
[1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:41.760]  be shipped out to you if you get your order in now. But just as sure as the sun came up,
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:46.280]  it's all selling out right now. So get your orders in for high quality, storable foods
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.080]  right now for all the reasons out there and it's insurance you can eat and it funds the

[1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:03.880]  out in the open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:09.320]  government as the answer. And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place. It's coordinated
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:16.320]  by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:21.480]  the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow. Yes. Now we know we're right. The new
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:26.080]  world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader real. But we're real as well
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:30.000]  and we love God and we're standing up and saying no. But I just want to make the point
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas. We have never been in some
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:40.520]  smallville place that didn't matter. Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:44.240]  of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through. So
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:48.520]  it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:54.400]  Just remember your action now, the prayer, word of mouth and financial support of MP4.com
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:47:22.400]  is critical. So please take action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:30.560]  I don't even understand what I've been accused of doing. I don't understand who accused me.
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:39.560]  I don't understand when. So this is a, frankly, this is a star chamber that is illegal. I'm
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:43.240]  here because really I wanted to ask a few questions about what you're gonna do if I
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:47.560]  don't give you documents. You wouldn't answer. I wanted to ask who complained you wouldn't
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:52.720]  answer. I wanted to see the complaint you wouldn't answer. I wanted to check you guys
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:56.000]  out and learn a little bit how many folks are on the file. You didn't really answer,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:04.560]  but I can count. I guess my message to the commissioner is, I don't even know who it
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:19.440]  is, but that'll change. I guess my message is every ounce of energy I have, every dollar
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:27.400]  I have and can raise, every trick of the trade I can deploy, I will deploy to smashing this
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:34.160]  law. And I think you know that's true. I think we'll have books and billboards and
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:43.960]  TV videos and lawnsides and we'll do all sorts of crazy things in defense of free speech
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:50.000]  and freedom of press. And we'll do it all. And it's not what I really want to do. I
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  wanted to live my life and do my journalism, but if you guys are gonna put me through a
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:01.280]  trial because I wrote and published and promoted the election, book during the election, I'm
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:08.640]  gonna do everything I can to show you and the country that's not Canadian. You're being
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:13.560]  un-Canadian by summoning an author to your offices. You're being un-Canadian and you
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  need a reminder.
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:20.760]  Now, we're playing what Ezra Levant said, and he was in there for about 45 minutes.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:24.680]  He's put out 20-something minutes, but he's putting out the rest, I'm told, soon. But
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:28.520]  they're jerks, okay? He's just playing what he responded to, and I think that's good because
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:34.760]  he was very eloquent. And it was beyond tears to my eyes this morning when I heard him after
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:37.960]  like, you know, you're guilty. So you want to probably walk this back and do what we
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:41.840]  tell you right now. And he says, no, you know what? You're guilty. You're the ones. It's
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:47.560]  pathetic how you follow orders. What level of orders won't you follow? It's like a Perry
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:52.720]  Mason or Kill a Mockingbird moment, but this is real. The stuff Hollywood made about tyranny,
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:57.800]  I'm watching it. And I look up the law. You're facing years in prison for this, and they're
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.760]  clearly, you're like, well, you can leave now if you want, but you need to answer our
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:05.440]  questions. And yeah, we're going to come get you. Are you going to come to my offices
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:09.280]  and raid me? And they're like, yeah, we want to know about your employees. We want to hear
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:12.760]  like, this isn't about your book. And later it's like, it's the book. It's about the book.
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:18.280]  I mean, they're lying. They're changing what they're saying, and they are enjoying it.
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:21.120]  It's one thing if they follow orders, and we're like, we're here to ask you this, sir,
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:28.160]  to please answer. That'd be bad enough. But they are loving it. I mean, they are so pompous.
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:29.800]  And just it's disgusting.
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:37.760]  You know, they asked me a lot of strange things. I mean, I predict out that there will be probably
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:43.360]  1000 books this year about Donald Trump and the election. Not all of them will be published
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:48.000]  by big name publishing houses. But these days, there's a lot of that. There were dozens of
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:52.680]  books pro Trudeau, and it's totally legal to publish a book. They're claiming you're
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:57.120]  doing campaign finance. They say it all. You're like, here's the law. I'm not I'm a media
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:01.560]  person. Yes, I don't like Mr. Blackface. And they're like, well, you're going, you know,
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  you're going to jail.
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:06.680]  Well, and that's the thing is, of course, the books are published during the election
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:10.400]  because I want to they're like, why did you do that during the election? You're like for
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:15.320]  the election. He goes, we got you, sir. That's a crime. You're like, dude, what are you talking
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.600]  about? That's what it's insane. You know, I don't know if we have time, but there's
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.800]  one clip your producers have called, did you think about the timing of the book? And if
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:29.360]  we got time, maybe it's interesting to watch it because they're implying that's clip three.
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:33.120]  Did you think about the timing of the book? Here it is. Knowledge that you would have
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:43.120]  or not have of the election candidate elections. When you are playing the book and you the
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:48.480]  new third party rules, because I believe there's some comments on yourself as well about that.
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:53.760]  Did you give any consideration of saying, maybe I should register as a third party for
[1:51:53.760 --> 1:52:00.520]  this circumstance? Or maybe I shouldn't? Because of my interpretation of what I'm going to do?
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.000]  Or did you not make that determination?
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.840]  I appreciate the question. Yeah, I absolutely did think about that a great length.
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:14.480]  Do you want to share any of those thoughts?
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:23.520]  Well, sure, some of them. I mean, I thought the day I register with the government to
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:32.800]  write a book is the day we no longer are the true North strong and free. And if elections
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:39.400]  candidates commissioners are stupid enough to prosecute me for writing, publishing and
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:44.200]  promoting a book about an election during the election, then that's an important fight
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:49.720]  to have because we need to roll back these pencil neck bureaucrats and their blackface
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:55.480]  boss. And we need to remind them that we're still a free country. So I thought about it
[1:52:55.480 --> 1:52:57.600]  long and hard.
[1:52:57.600 --> 1:53:00.800]  And folks playing clips can't even do it justice when you see the stuff they're saying to him
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:04.520]  when he responds, but I can't listen to their voices. So we're not going to play it. If
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:09.400]  you want to go watch it, it's info wars.com and the article you need to spread it. But
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:13.480]  this is real tyranny, ladies and gentlemen, because I've read the Canadian law and it's
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:17.520]  like, oh, of course, if you're just a citizen or a group, and it's your speech, you could
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:22.480]  publish a book any way you want. But if you're a political group and it's a political publication
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:26.440]  by the party or by a third party as an action group, you got to tell us they're trying to
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:31.760]  get him to say, yes, I'm a political action group and opt in to go into jail. And they're
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:37.840]  telling him, you're guilty, buddy. You admit you did this in the election. No crap, Sherlock.
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:42.600]  Of course, I don't like this piece of garbage. And I'm doing this. It's my speech, the Magna
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:49.560]  Carta 1215 that's still in charge in Canada, common law. And it's just outrageous. It's
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:55.040]  not tiptoeing towards North Korea or communist China or Nazi Germany or mallet. You know,
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:54:02.480]  it's here. And again, the enjoyment. These guys look like they are on cloud nine when
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:07.040]  they're looking at you. They are enjoying this because they're superior to you. But
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:12.520]  it's obvious you're superior to them in intellect and justice and will because I know your story,
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:14.720]  all the great work you've done, how you've been persecuted. You don't make a big deal
[1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:19.760]  about it. We've been persecuted too. And it's not like we're victims. I see this and I just
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:25.720]  am saying to humanity, we're not putting up with this. This is BS. Well, you know, it's
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:29.920]  funny you mentioned earlier that my book hit number two in the Canadian best side of the
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:36.360]  list. I was pretty proud of that. But yesterday, after these, we published these hidden videos,
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:41.800]  my book went to number one in Canada yesterday. And there's a little bit of hope there because
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:48.160]  that shows that even Canadians were were sometimes a docile people were a submissive people compared
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:55.200]  to brash bold Americans and their First Amendment. Even Canadians were so grossed out by what
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:54:58.400]  they saw in this video. It was trending in Canada. Oh, that's the good news. It was
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:03.080]  enough to say. Number one. Well, number one, congratulations. I haven't read your book.
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:08.080]  We need to sell it. It's amazing. I know you've got to go. We got to go to break. Come back
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:11.040]  and do five more minutes on where you see all this going. And we have former Congressman
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:16.120]  Bob Barr joining us who ran the impeachment started the impeachment against Eric Clinton
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.960]  to give us his expert take. You couldn't do better on a day like this with the president
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:22.720]  and we'll have the latest. Are they going to go with witnesses? We don't know yet. We're
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:29.640]  checking shots fired at my logo. Speaking of funding, that's a lifeblood. A intellectual
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:34.040]  pit bull like Ezra Levant can stay in the fight. He'll win the fight, but he's got to
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:39.040]  have oxygen. He's got to have oxygen. If he doesn't have oxygen, he's got the spirit
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:44.680]  to fight. But he's the spirits willing. Okay, but the body's weak. He will not be able to
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:49.040]  fight. And I know they've decimated him from where he was going to the very top. And they
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:52.640]  said, Nope, you're done. You know, he invested everything he had. Same with us. They're trying
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:56.520]  to wrecking ball us because they're trying to wrecking ball you. And that's why everybody
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:56:00.440]  needs horrible food. Yeah, this virus may be terrible. May not be. Everybody needs trouble
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:03.640]  food. We've got the best. It's selling out all over the country. We still have it in
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:08.480]  four store.com. We have the very best nano. I haven't even told I haven't gotten to this.
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:15.080]  I have congressional reports confirm university A&M that we have the patented nano silver
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:18.840]  that is the very best. And of course, they're patriots and we have developed this immune
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:22.280]  gargle. And I'm not going back to full price even though we're going to sell out of it
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:29.280]  very soon. It's still 40% off in four store.com 16 ounces of nano silver beyond colloidal immune
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:34.040]  gargle. It also has iodine in four store.com. And we have it in the smaller containers as
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:39.120]  well in the little spray bottles. That's something you need. That's great. That's a good value
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:43.680]  and excellent value that funds us. And believe me, man, it's for me. I don't give a rat's
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:46.960]  ass about status and stuff. Everybody knows that. I could have already had all that. They
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:50.720]  tried to get me on their team. They're like, don't you want to star in major movies? This
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:53.680]  is like 15 years ago. The last time I said no, they're like, how about 10 million? I'm
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:57:00.480]  like, no. All I care about is authenticity, just like you do. I don't want to have sex
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.240]  with a sex robot. It's plastic. I want my wife. I mean, it's not like that's even a
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:08.920]  big deal. So yeah, obviously, I'm the real McCoy, you're the real McCoy, but you need
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:15.200]  these products in four store.com. And I can tell you within 12 days or so, my Patriots
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:18.960]  going to be sold out. They're trying to get more food supplies or trying to get them in.
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:21.840]  That may happen. All the other competitors are sold out. They're telling you they're
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:26.000]  not they're lying to you. That's why I have my Patriot. They don't do that. It's drop
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.720]  ship instantly. They're in our computer system linked up. It just comes in boom front of
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.560]  the line. It goes out. Best deals are going to find on their amazing food info or short
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:37.520]  com. And then it's that good piece of mind and it funds the info or all points of the
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:42.600]  compass are then covered info or store.com. Take action. Our number three straight ahead.
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:50.160]  Stay with us. I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars.
[1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:55.840]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:01.240]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. worldwide and President
[1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:07.520]  Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:13.040]  You're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:17.880]  But trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China. Trump's
[1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:23.320]  been doing an amazing job. But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:28.480]  being targeted because we are effective. And the globalists are beginning to lose their
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:33.080]  war against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some major fireworks out
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:38.760]  of them. But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:43.960]  at us. That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused
[1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:46.960]  and stay happy.
[1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:51.000]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:55.520]  all the other shows we do here. But I'll be honest with you. We run during the breaks
[1:58:55.520 --> 1:59:00.800]  a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want
[1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:05.000]  to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:08.680]  paying the bills here. And I want to expand the face of the globalists not contract.
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:14.280]  I don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We saw enough product.
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:18.280]  We'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run
[1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:22.640]  for their money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus,
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:26.640]  X2. These will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products. Check out the water
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:30.600]  filtration, air filtration. Check it all out. Whatever you do, take action and know. Be
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:34.160]  part of the Second American Revolution. Be part of Crush the Globalist. And get great
[1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:39.160]  products at the same time. Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site. Infowarslife.com is
[1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:51.160]  the supplements. Take action now and funding Infowar for your own future. You're listening
[1:59:51.160 --> 2:00:14.240]  to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:25.800]  We're going to stop voter suppression. They call that suppression to argue with someone
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:30.240]  is censoring them. So then they censor you. The left one is like, oh, don't censor me
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:34.240]  when I'm arguing. I'm like, me arguing with you is not censorship. But see, disagreeing
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:38.920]  with the left is then they suppress you. As we're live on again, we can't do justice
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:46.360]  here in the time we have to the footage. And again, the fact that these are a federal police,
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:52.600]  a federal body, they call you there with this, this, this, this letter you go there. You're
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:58.600]  very professional, better than any lawyer I've heard. And they're all secretive and
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:04.600]  just that very, very bizarre. It's amazing. Other comments about where this is going and
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:09.640]  how many years in jail because he tells you you're guilty. And I was looking at the statutes.
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:14.600]  I mean, you could spend years in jail, according to them, saying that you're a political action
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:19.120]  group, violating campaign law when you're a publisher that wrote a book.
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:26.440]  Yeah, I've never seen any other author be summoned in by the police, except in tyrannical
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:30.840]  regimes. You know, he asked me why I didn't register my book with the government. I think
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:37.440]  we played that clip there. When I was a kid, I learned that in the Soviet block, typewriters
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:43.040]  in the country of Romania that was under the Soviet register, that's right. And you know
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:48.320]  what, you had to not only tell the police you had it, but you had to do a typing sample.
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:51.920]  Because you know, each typewriter is slightly different. It's like a fingerprint away those
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:58.840]  metal. Yes, right. So they would keep a sample of how your typewriter type in case they were
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:02:04.640]  to find some illegal samizdat, some illegal propaganda, they would know whose typewriter
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:10.480]  it came from. I don't believe in registering books with the government or typewriters or
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:16.360]  whatever the media of the day is, but these guys apparently do.
[2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:22.720]  Well again, I watch body language and those guys are arrogant and dangerous. I mean, I
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:26.840]  think they're the clear and present danger and and Trojan danger and the left everywhere.
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:31.560]  This isn't like in a vacuum everywhere they're doing this Europe, the U.S. universities,
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:35.720]  and they just do it like they have the right because they know best. And damn it, you published
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:40.340]  a book about the prime minister that's a bestseller and exposing him. So we're getting you ready
[2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:46.120]  for criminal charges. And I think they're arrogant enough, Ezra, to do it. But just like
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:50.360]  them trying to block Brexit only blew up bigger than trying to crush Trump only blow up bigger
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:56.240]  that the tyrants are following the same dead end right down a black hole. Thanks to you,
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:02:59.960]  the few good men that have courage. And I do admire you. You've got the spirit, brother.
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:00.960]  I thank you.
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:06.920]  Well, you're very kind to say it. You know, let me make one observation. In Canada, we
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:12.460]  have groups like the ACLU up here. It's called the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.
[2:03:12.460 --> 2:03:17.400]  We have something called Penn Canada. We got Canadian journalists for free expression.
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:21.200]  We got the Canadian. Yes, they're all missing an action.
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:26.560]  I haven't heard from one of them. I can assure you if the shoe were on the other foot, if
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.680]  it was under our former reserve, chickens with the heads cut off, chickens with the
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:32.680]  heads cut off.
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:39.640]  Well, you know, they keep saying Trump is at war with the media. He's rolling back press
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:43.400]  freedoms. No, no, he's speaking back against them. Sorry, go ahead. You're right. Yeah,
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:46.800]  that's all he's doing is talking back and they don't like it. Here in Canada, we have
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:52.600]  true government restrictions on journalism and authors and complete silence from the
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:58.120]  left. In fact, I got to tell you, I've had more interest from American talk radio hosts
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.800]  than from Canada, because even our media has learned to be submissive. And I have the
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:09.280]  left or only clients, the left or only clients for Islamist and globalist who they're bringing
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:13.520]  in to be their client groups to dominate us. We're being enslaved and Western values are
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:18.120]  being completely overthrown. And we have to just admit it.
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:22.560]  Well, listen, we'll keep fighting up here as long as we can. We have so much culturally
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:27.440]  in common with America, because we both come from the same tradition of the Magna Carta,
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:33.120]  as you said, in the UK. I regret that we didn't stand firm. We didn't get the First Amendment
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:40.400]  style protections put in our Constitution when we were born. So keep yours, Alec.
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:43.720]  Thank you, sir. Please come on soon. Just about the news and what's happening. I want
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:48.200]  to get you as a mainstay. Thank you so much. Ezra Ravon, incredibly powerful video up on

[2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:36.760]  Okay, we're back live. And again, we're just with us for the last hour. No, we're not
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:43.560]  no one in the middle of the Senate trial coming to a head of the president and shots fired
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:48.360]  at Mar-a-Lago and giant viral outbreak and UN global emergencies. And people were trying
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:56.640]  to secretly burning bodies and mass firegraves and would spend three segments, four segments
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:03.960]  with a journalist. But I know the stuff they've done to Ezlo Revant. And he just keeps beavering
[2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:12.840]  on. But it's like it's, I got violently angry yesterday when I saw senators saying we should
[2:07:12.840 --> 2:07:18.320]  maybe arrest Rand Paul. These are dangerous people, okay? Not Rand Paul. He's the one
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:29.880]  trying to stop wars. And I just want them off our back, man. I just want these globalists
[2:07:29.880 --> 2:07:34.640]  off our back. And I know you do as well. I just respect you as listeners. I mean, you're
[2:07:34.640 --> 2:07:41.600]  so fricking precious, man. You're the people that actually care. And you're so humble.
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.120]  You're always like, Oh, Alex, thank you. Thank you. Do you understand for my children how
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:51.520]  important you are? The future we're building together. I mean, we're together. Black, white,
[2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:56.280]  old, young, you name it. But they want to tell us come together under the unification
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:08:00.520]  of the globalist while they're doing nothing but stirring us up against each other. We need
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:07.320]  the natural real unity of common sense and God that brings us together. But I mean, I'll
[2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:14.120]  just, I'll just, I'll just spell it out here. I am blown away by how evil the deep state
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:20.600]  is and how sick they are and how filthy they are and how lying and stupid. And then it
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:32.120]  hits me. These people have been winning for a long time. They have been absolutely dominating
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:38.600]  us. And so that makes me feel like a wimp. I don't have something to prove, but I also
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:42.240]  not going to lay down. And again, I'm, there's a lot of guys can kick my ass. Okay. But I
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:47.840]  remember being a little kid and getting off the bus and like sixth grade, fifth grade
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:54.000]  and kids were three, four years old, getting on me and beating me up and stuff until that
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:09:00.200]  moment when I just got angry and picked up, you know, a rock was on the ground and, and
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:03.720]  yeah, I mean, basically put the kids high out and their parents got mad. Like, well,
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:08.200]  your 15 year old, 16 year old shouldn't be trying to beat up 11 year olds, but they don't
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:12.960]  have the killer instinct. Folks, we do. That's why they're bullies and scum. Those of us
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.200]  that have it don't need to abuse the power. We've got it. Much voltage as we need. God
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:21.760]  will give it to us. And every time the enemy stands up and tries to take us on, they find
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:25.480]  out that, Oh, we weren't back in powerful. We weren't trying to run people's lives because
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:34.760]  we didn't need to do that. We already had the power. And what I'm getting at is we have
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:39.760]  allowed these people to do this to us. And so it's our fault. We'll know who's to blame.
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:45.160]  Look in the mirror and I'm saying that myself. I've made a lot of mistakes. So when I preach
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:48.560]  this stuff, it's what I think we ought to do. And I think you agree with me. It's not
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:53.080]  me up here on some damn high horse like some Glitterbug preacher. Act him like he where
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:59.920]  he's perfect and he's got all the answers. Be ash. God's got all the answers and right
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:03.640]  action will prove those answers and will make you stronger. And that's a path we've all
[2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:08.280]  got to walk. Anybody telling you they got it all figured out. They got a one size fits
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:12.160]  all and they got it all right. He better watch that person. That's a cult leader right there.
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:17.560]  There's no cult here except the cult of Jesus Christ. And people say, man, you just more
[2:10:17.560 --> 2:10:24.520]  and more you preach. It's not all I got. It's everything. It's expansive. It's real and
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:30.320]  the enemy runs from it. That name is real. And you could just be a scientist and wonder
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:36.200]  why the hell these people run from it. Why they're so scared of it. I get obsessed with
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.160]  silly stuff like this. I got this lav mic on so I can walk around. I haven't been walking
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.520]  around today. There's a lot of news to cover. I didn't really get to a lot of calls today.
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.040]  We got Bob Barr who actually initiated the impeachment against Bill Clinton coming up.
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:55.960]  I couldn't think of a better guest in this whole constellation of news. I want to get
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:00.520]  Robert Barnes back on as well. I was saying get Barnes on get Barnes on but I must have
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:06.080]  mumbled over the phone. So there's they got Bob Barr but see how sometimes God's greatest
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:08.920]  gifts are unanswered prayers because I want to get Barnes back on too. He's always so
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:13.040]  busy but Bob Barr. Oh that's really great. Oh I'm glad. Are you mad? We actually got
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:17.280]  Bob Barr. I'm like no I'm glad you got Bob Barr. In fact you should have thought of
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:23.000]  that. We should get him on. He started the impeachment and got that initiated. The House
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:28.720]  representatives and got punished by the political establishment for it. So that's coming up.
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:42.040]  But something big is about to happen and I'm not sure it's this virus but we need to have
[2:11:42.040 --> 2:11:47.360]  our bases covered with the virus and you know I said I would talk about this but it's such
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:50.560]  big news and we'll go to break and come back with a guest so I'm going to do it right now
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:54.200]  because this is an important decision for all of you out there to think about and decide
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:57.600]  what you're going to do. But can I get an overhead shot guys? I want to show you something
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:05.920]  that I've been authorized to show you. This is in Congress. This is 13 years ago and this
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:13.880]  is the company. And when I got this information four or five days ago I said listen are you
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:17.920]  sure you want me to do this because you've got Department of Defense contracts. You've
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:22.080]  got a lot of others and they might mess with you. They're like no no we're the owners.
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:25.360]  We like what you're doing. We've got a partnership with you. We want people to know how important
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:31.680]  this is of the Department of Defense and congressional reports say that this product, the nano silver
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:38.400]  has been found to knock out SARS. Well no crap Sir Locke. Of course it does. Viruses bacteria
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:43.120]  you name it. Nobody's selling 16 ounces of nano silver that's patented. This is the top
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:46.320]  company in the U.S. that we're not even private label. This is something they developed with
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:51.080]  my dad, the immune gargle. Ridiculous name but that's a technical medical name and you
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:57.200]  can drink it and it's all, it's what my dad is an oral surgeon and Dennis named it. So
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:00.680]  that's what we're going to call it. But super silver immune gargle in three different sizes
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.720]  is selling out but I'm still keeping it at 40% off despite that 50% off and you get all
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:08.360]  three together because we're not going to raise prices during a crisis. We're not going
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:14.520]  to gouge people. But here's the deal. Department of the Army Headquarters United States Special
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:21.160]  Operations Command Tampa Point Boulevard and it goes into Andrew C. Vaughn Eddenbach Commissioner
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:25.480]  of Food and Registration and they go on to say that with antibiotic resistance and all
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:31.640]  the rest of it we have found that this particular type of nano silver is effective against SARS
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:39.320]  and a whole bunch of other stuff. Then it goes on here. The Texas A&M System Health Science
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:48.760]  Center and it says confidential because they don't want this type of stuff out for a lot
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:54.080]  of reasons and it goes over the fact and says dear Secretary Ridge and they go on to say
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:14:01.760]  the Office of Homeland Security John B Connelly Building so that A&M is running a whole secret
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.600]  project for the government and they say this particular nano silver we found in our trials
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:18.440]  secret trials with American biotech labs was very effective. This report is that the coronavirus
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:23.600]  like the SARS same family virus homeland defense put out the data that our product could kill
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:29.040]  that one. She the above letter from the Director of Homeland Security the Secretary Dr. Carlton
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:33.120]  ex-surgeon general Air Force is a brilliant man who came up with the model hospital system
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:38.640]  mobile hospital system. We only received a copy of it because our testimony before Congress
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:43.680]  on malaria and it was included in the addendum of the testimony we never received a good
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:51.080]  copy but we did get a copy and it's worth reading and it goes on. So I mean look it's
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:55.560]  the grace of God that stuff like this happens. My dad was killing himself still doing dentistry
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:14:59.360]  and managing a bunch of companies and like seven eight years ago and I said dad I need
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:02.600]  you to come in and manage supplements we need to put on our own put out the best and you've
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:06.280]  brought stuff he's done research scientists as well and some things I said we need you
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:10.800]  to bring us through the best of help certify everything and he did it and and and and then
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.960]  he brought us the folks that are in the super silver toothpaste the super blue toothpaste
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:19.440]  it has the nano silver this is the top company folks this is and they're like no just say
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:25.160]  who we are Dr. Keith molar CEO American biotech labs LLC that's the big one they're the only
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:32.440]  ones that have approved over the counter super silver womb gel do not take this internally
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:37.240]  this is super well let's just say we're doing this poisonous to bacteria and viruses which
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:41.320]  means it ain't too good for you but it's better than dying right so this this goes on the

[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:27.320]  location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.960]  at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory

[2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:14.920]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:20.280]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:25.600]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:31.040]  have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal

[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:41.800]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:47.480]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside

[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:57.480]  pollen block chewable tablets I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:02.440]  I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:05.680]  this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting
[2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:10.920]  in here telling me you got to get up there and tell me so here I am telling people super
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:16.320]  silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:21.000]  years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free I think
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:25.120]  the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:29.680]  my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse
[2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:35.760]  out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:41.440]  good things are happening in my mouth in fact I find myself brushing my teeth three to four
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:58.680]  times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels you're listening
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:00.680]  to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:42.200]  well we're really blessed to have former congressman Bob Bart joining us he helped initiate the
[2:20:42.200 --> 2:20:47.760]  impeachment of Clinton there was so many crimes the Clintons were committing but they could
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:54.440]  nail them down on that one and we couldn't have somebody better to lay out his view on
[2:20:54.440 --> 2:21:00.120]  this whole fiasco and what he thinks is about to currently happening what ambassador Bolton
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:13.600]  is up to who extolled on US radio that Trump was doing a great job in Ukraine and was fighting
[2:21:13.600 --> 2:21:18.040]  corruption he said that on voice for America but now he's got millions of dollars he's
[2:21:18.040 --> 2:21:22.960]  telling a different story but our guest is so smart instead of me asking questions I
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:30.600]  should just ask Bob Bar of Liberty Guard dot org who's got a long pedigree of work in industry
[2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:35.840]  and the CIA before that and in Congress and as a lawyer what is front and center I mean
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:44.160]  what would you call this because when I look at Schiff and Nadler and Pelosi I see something
[2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:51.000]  more frightening than even pure evil it's delusional narcissism making fools out of
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:55.600]  themselves but never stopping and then Trump's Justice Department which you also work for
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:22:02.040]  I know the high level never reacting to their crimes is enabling it to get even more crazy
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:07.120]  like toddlers acting out but these aren't toddlers so I'm getting more angry at Trump
[2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:12.560]  quite frankly than I'm getting at Schiff and people because because he's not going after
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:16.920]  these people I don't want some big in just clash inside the government but we already
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:23.720]  have it don't we Bob Bar or am I wrong no you're not wrong Alex and there is there are
[2:22:23.720 --> 2:22:30.480]  so many different aspects to this there are so many things going wrong it's like you know
[2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:36.480]  taking your card to a mechanic and the mechanic says look your air system isn't working your
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:41.280]  fuel injections aren't working your exhaust system isn't working your your spark plugs
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:46.600]  aren't working there's everything wrong but what we have to do I think is not lose sight
[2:22:46.600 --> 2:22:52.200]  of the short term goal here and that is to get rid of and put a stop to this nonsense
[2:22:52.200 --> 2:22:57.200]  in the Senate and then tackle these broader and deeper issues that you've identified
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:04.840]  the deep state itself the short term problem here is for Mitch McConnell to keep the Republicans
[2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:10.360]  in line and many of these Republicans are always looking for ways to go over to the
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:17.440]  other side. Mitch has a job here to at least keep a majority in line to stop this nonsense
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:22.720]  so that we can then move on and tackle these other more important systemic problems with
[2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:30.120]  the government. Well as a former federal prosecutor and again I'm not going over the whole pedigree
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:36.160]  somebody that was ignited the legitimate impeachment of Bill Clinton what are you seeing here as
[2:23:36.160 --> 2:23:42.600]  an expert that we don't see? I'm really not seeing anything that you and the vast majority
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:49.120]  I think Alex of the American people see and that is a Democrat majority in both the House
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:55.480]  and the Senate that are so blinded by their hatred their sheer hatred for Donald Trump
[2:23:55.480 --> 2:24:00.880]  that they have lost sight of their responsibility they have lost sight of history they have lost
[2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:06.240]  sight of the American people they have lost sight of everything and they have this tunnel vision
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:15.120]  focused on Donald Trump in the crosshairs of their efforts. Hopefully Mitch McConnell
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:22.480]  can keep any other Republican squishes from going over to the Democrats so that we don't
[2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:30.040]  reopen this up in ways that it should not constitutionally be open and that is for witnesses
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:36.880]  and new evidence so that we can stop this now and then hopefully move on to defeat the
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:43.160]  Democrats with their House majority in the fall reelect the president and really attack
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:48.440]  these systemic problems that are the deep state in Washington. You know define that
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:52.760]  because people say oh Bob Barr he's former CIA what are you doing well there's a lot
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.120]  of good the CIA's is bigger than Coca-Cola that just means clandestine operations in
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:01.200]  the government we need people that have been in the CIA they can tell us what's going on
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:07.240]  and help decipher that obviously and Trump has been at war with corporate elements governmental
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:14.480]  elements using the cloak of different US intelligence agencies to operate and we have the FISA court
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:19.840]  you're a former prosecutor the FISA court said they illegally did this so I'm not even
[2:25:19.840 --> 2:25:25.360]  saying oh the CIA giving them a pass I'm giving the facts that this is illegitimate operatives
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:32.360]  and networks inside government using the apparatus for their own political attempt to come against
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.920]  the president is that accurate it's accurate you've really put your finger Alex on two
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:42.360]  very very important aspects of what we need to be concerned about here one is the unholy
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:49.560]  relationship between corporate America and the government itself the government there
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:56.040]  are restrictions often not followed but there are restrictions on information the government
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:02.960]  can obtain and use if they use the FISA court properly that serves as a limitation but one
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:10.360]  way that the government gets around those limitations is to use corporations to do it work for it
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:16.000]  and gathering data basing and then sharing information so that's one serious problem that
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:23.640]  we have here the second is now we have an opportunity with the abuses of FISA that have come that
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:29.680]  we've known about now that have come to light publicly what we now need to do is try and
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:35.760]  fashion a majority of members in the House in the Senate to make some real reforms to
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:41.160]  the foreign intelligence surveillance act there's legislation pending but my worry is
[2:26:41.160 --> 2:26:47.280]  that as soon as we move past impeachment and then have the opportunity to focus on reforming
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:53.280]  really reforming the foreign intelligence surveillance act and the courts that the government
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.120]  will try to all of the all of the national security people and say oh we can't make any
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:04.440]  reforms it's national security that's what we have to really be working on FISA has to
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:09.800]  be reformed because it's a backdoor now that the government can drive a Mack truck through
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:17.640]  yeah if they if if Obama and Hillary and a few others and people like Brennan are willing
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:26.160]  to use that against the candidate the nominee and then the elected president and then the
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.840]  sworn in president they'll go after anybody that that takes some big way bows to start
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:41.080]  shooting at POTUS with a spy grid it doesn't mean if they if the US government can go after
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:47.240]  a presidential nominee a president elect and a sitting president of the United States
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:52.800]  then nobody in this country is safe from government abuse of its power they're absolutely cracked
[2:27:52.800 --> 2:27:59.680]  and that shows they've gotten way too big for their bridges right yes sir so how do
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:06.200]  we when we come back how do we reform because I know you've seen every angle of it and and
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:11.640]  Bob Barr is our guest Liberty Guard dot org how do we deal with that and what do you predict
[2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:16.800]  comes next because if Trump the Justice Department don't move on these people somehow then then
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:21.160]  what will their new attack be because I've already enjoyed I love the fact that Tulsi
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:26.600]  Gabbard is suing Hillary for all this money for calling her a Russian agent hey they did
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:30.920]  that to me and they took bank accounts away they almost shut us down I mean that they use
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:35.720]  national security apparatus to come after us by that designation and so I'm glad as
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:40.360]  people pushing back because if I'm anything folks it's not a Russian agent but anybody
[2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:44.160]  that opposes tyranny is called one they bit off more than they can shoot Bob Barr is our
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:48.680]  guest we'll come right back we'll talk about the whistleblower Eric Saramala as well and

[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:37.120]  senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the evening mr. chief justice
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:55.600]  members of the senate washington democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:02.480]  the last election i'm not why am i not worried i should be worried you know remember nixon
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:08.400]  it was like a dark period right a very dark period was like oh you think about it right
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:13.960]  and with clinton it was not good they say that with johnson it was a long time ago none
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:23.200]  of us remember but they say it was a very dark period this is a happy period for us yeah
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:26.840]  they're calling an america's nightmare and then they go oh it's terrible we didn't want
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:32.120]  to do this and then polosi's handing out pins at signing ceremonies i'm actually going to
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:37.280]  be honest with people because i don't usually get scared and i don't like to even use that
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:44.480]  term i'm really concerned bob bar former congressman who helped initiate the impeachment of bill
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:49.520]  clinton that we're being too confident here and then we're not looking for the real problem
[2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:52.560]  and that while we're looking one direction it's the other and they're telling trump he's
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:55.640]  assured of victory she's like we heard hillard was assured of victory three and a half years
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:35:00.720]  ago with the election fraud and the censorship and everything the establishment's done going
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:05.440]  after the president the real place they can try to get him is election fraud and manipulation
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:11.000]  we know goes on and so i see him saying yes it is a great period no one's buying and i
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:16.480]  know what mainstream media says anymore there is a major political realignment towards nationalism
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:24.080]  and freedom and free market systems worldwide i think nobody denies that but still the behavior
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:30.400]  of the creatures of the deep state these toddlers these babies these people that were
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:36.240]  given power and expect their invincible their frankenstein you know it's not that smart
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:40.000]  but he's dangerous you can pull your head off and they're kind of just stumbling around
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:43.920]  and no one ever stops me all that's frankenstein he's full of crap well he'll still twist your
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:48.880]  head off so what i'm getting at here is i guess i could have said it very simply is
[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:54.000]  it's not about vindictiveness but the danger of what the democrats have done in the hoaxes
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:01.280]  and the illegal spying and the crimes when is the attorney general that shares your name
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:07.040]  going to do something in your view that's a good question and i wish there were a clear
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:12.800]  answer to it one way or the other but i i don't know one thing that i do know in addition
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:19.200]  to the accuracy of what you've just noted alex is the fact that the real one of the real
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:29.760]  real problems that we're facing is google and other social media uh you know shift uh adam
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:34.480]  shift was talking the other day that well if we don't remove prompt now we can't be assured
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:40.720]  that the election will be fair uh the danger that's not the danger the real danger lurking
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:50.000]  in the area of swaying voter and influencing voter and voter suppression is social media
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:56.320]  and there have been several studies of this there was a hearing for example that senator
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:02.240]  ked truce chaired in his judiciary subcommittee last summer this past summer robert eppstein
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:08.720]  he had a fellow named robert eppstein uh as witness and robert eppstein said look i am a
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:14.960]  liberal democrat i supported hillary clinton but i'm here to tell you that if you don't do
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:21.920]  something to get a handle on the power of social media and these search engines like google to
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:27.840]  influence voter and influence public opinion then you are going to lose control of this
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:33.920]  government permanently i mean it was a truly frightening presentation and yet i have not
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:39.440]  seen any evidence in the last six or seven months since he testified that people in the congress
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:44.880]  are serious about doing something about that that problem that he identified i totally agree with you
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:50.080]  and and i went and looked at what twitter announced months ago made it official today the headline is
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:55.520]  twitter users can now report voter suppression misinformation well their definition is and
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:01.440]  here's the form anything someone doesn't agree with or if someone says it hurt my feelings
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:06.880]  now it's like a university you're now suppressing them so your band and it will only be done against
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:12.160]  trump supporters they so this is but again they call it stopping voter suppression when they're
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:19.040]  the ones doing it this this isn't just a company doing what it wants this is ai real time beyond
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:26.080]  anything the soviets could dream of oh the the technology uh that we have and it is constantly
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:32.960]  being upgraded it is something that george orwell could only have dreamed about uh when you look at
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:41.040]  for example the way google and other lesser search engines the way they manipulate and direct people
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:47.280]  when they're making an inquiry just answering asking perhaps an interesting question it immediately
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:53.440]  puts terms in their looks for terms and then changes what the individual is looking for and
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  ranks it in ways that have demonstratively by objective studies swayed people's thinking and
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:06.880]  how they react and they're paid their billions they're paid to do it they're paid to do it
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:13.920]  they make billions of dollars off of it and congress i'm not in favor of censorship and it's not a
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:20.960]  matter of censoring these companies it is no it's saying you don't rig the plan for you and and saying
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:27.040]  okay you're going to deal with all of this data in your manipulation of people who use search engines
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:33.440]  we're going to open that up in the same way that the federal government opened up technology and
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:37.120]  telecommunications and that's my next question and i'm talking over and i apologize but you've
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.720]  got such knowledge on this exactly this isn't this isn't okay big take and do what they want or
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:47.840]  they're a private company they're in there it's on records saying the republican party's official
[2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:52.960]  affiliation is nazis google did that for months so they got caught okay and then sundar gets up and
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:59.040]  says we've never manipulated one search result i can call google okay and i can pay them to make
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:03.920]  me the top search for whatever i want and i can do it where it doesn't even say it's an ad so the
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:08.960]  fundamentals is they're lying in front of congress telling us a baboon's acid and purple
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:16.400]  if i'm not quite sure about i haven't looked at a baboon's anatomy lately but i think you're
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:23.680]  probably right uh this is what they do uh there are a study after study uh and i would encourage
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:30.160]  people to uh to go back and look at robert eppstein's testimony before senator cruz's subcommittee
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:36.560]  this past summer this is serious business and that's the real threat they can sway that is the
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:44.400]  search engines can sway tens of millions of votes by the way they rank and by the way they
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:51.680]  manipulate search engine inquiries i know i'm ranting here sir and i really appreciate you being
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:57.200]  with us i i got sent by mike sternovich two years ago the secret google documents where they were
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:01.760]  paying 15 million dollars to one company to downrank us so they weren't even doing it their
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:06.640]  own search thing they were just having another company attack us to correct and like who paid
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:11.680]  for that that's obviously government will stay behind networks obama put in place and then google
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:16.560]  said now those are real documents we made a mistake sorry that's a whole congressional
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:21.760]  investigation but again they demonized me and not about me it's what they did they demonized me
[2:41:21.760 --> 2:41:26.800]  to go oh jones is fair game and then they set the precedent that you can have the most dangerous
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:31.360]  game hunt alex jones nobody stands up for me you did not a few others that we appreciate it
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:36.800]  and then the president said for everybody that's what's so dangerous it is and the american people
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:41.280]  need to wake up to it and demand that their representatives in the senate and the house
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:47.600]  do something about it now or come election time we're going to be on the losing end of this
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:54.240]  manipulation of voters have we heard yet are they going to allow senators or to have guests
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:42:00.640]  or have witnesses do we know yet what's going to happen no we don't we don't know yet because
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:06.000]  there are as you know you know two or three of these squishy republicans that are always more
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:11.680]  interested in appearing to be so nice and nonpartisan and fair to the democrats that that
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:16.720]  becomes the overriding factor and whether or not they decide to prolong this uh this uh this
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:23.360]  this prod this impeachment debacle so we still don't know uh we saw last night that senator
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:29.200]  Lamar alexander thankfully said i see no need for witnesses and new evidence susan collins
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.600]  not unexpectedly says she wants them we're waiting to see i guess if lisa murkowski
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:42.000]  in alaska this i've never understood this why an alaskans alaska senator matt in alaska is a great
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  state it's a conservative state uh and yet they have a senator that uh is so squishy on these
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:53.360]  things so apparently we're still waiting on on her right one more segment stay with us ladies and
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:43:00.480]  gentlemen this time of year i'm always promoting winter sun our high quality organic vitamin

[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:14.080]  getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin d it needs and then that's the main reason
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:20.160]  people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:25.760]  it's on record that you've got to have this to live not just to defend against these viruses so
[2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:31.360]  right now we have winter sun still available even though we always order only so much for sale during

[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:20.000]  all right congressman former congressman bob bars here he helped launch the impeachment of bill
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:24.720]  clinton people always ask why didn't they go after clinton for the missile secrets all the rest of
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:30.080]  it because that was all shrouded national security and you couldn't get the republicans on board but
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:35.600]  you could on him lying you could on the other issues that were going on we are seeing the fall
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:41.440]  of the house of clinton with the abstein stuff we are seeing really hillary's power debate she is
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:46.960]  going to control the convention coming up and something they could have a broker convention
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.840]  she's just illusional enough to try it she has intended to run again but i don't i don't know
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:56.240]  if she'd actually pull that off just in general what is your feeling about the state of the republic
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:00.720]  your state of the union bob barger respect you and the listeners respect you i mean
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:08.240]  is the state of the republic strong or is it in flux the most difficult task i have alex at the
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:14.800]  beginning of every day when i get up is to remain optimistic about the united states in our future
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:21.680]  i refuse to give up the optimism that is is at the foundation of our this great land of ours
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:28.160]  is becoming more and more difficult when you look at for example right now in the senate you have
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:35.360]  senate republicans who cannot decide whether or not to simply end this this hoax of a trial
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:39.600]  and move on they're fretting about it they're wringing their hands they're worrying about
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:47.120]  how they will appear media how they will appear to their democrat holly and then for some reason i
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:52.800]  read an article just before i came on the show with you that the white house lawyers who i think
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:59.440]  have done an excellent job so far now want more time to prepare their closing argument and what
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:04.560]  in the heck do you need more time for you to shut this down the whole thing was fraudulent so it's
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:13.440]  more grandstanding so that that may prolong this you know get this thing voted on move on let the
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:19.440]  president present himself to the american people in a state of union and remind us what a great
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:26.400]  country we are how important it is to move forward and lay out some legislation that the president
[2:49:26.400 --> 2:49:32.080]  should be supporting that will get a handle on what he knows better than anybody else are the
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:38.880]  abuses by the deep state i totally agree and i began the interview this way and i'm gonna end
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:44.640]  it this way bob bar i love trump he's a great guy he's the real deal he's americana not left
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:48.480]  or right he just he's not to get the country he wants to be president and the deep state's mad
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:52.880]  that it's not ruled by committee we've actually got an executive that's doing all the people i
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:50:01.200]  think i'd give him an a plus on effort and and and and being a true blue guy but man it's not that
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:05.200]  i've been put to the ringer by these people and i've really gotten to experience you know the
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:10.880]  deep state's teeth it's that it's gonna happen again and again i'm all in for getting in a fight
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:15.360]  but not we win each time and then we let them line up again and attack us when they're committing
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:20.240]  crimes i just i just really think that we need i go back to that everybody waits for that
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:26.560]  action because it becomes a dereliction of duty if trump doesn't start getting aggressive with
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:30.880]  the deep state and i understand he's surrounded by a bunch of people that are cowards but it's
[2:50:30.880 --> 2:50:38.720]  he's getting crazy there there are things that can be done trump has to do it the senate has to
[2:50:38.720 --> 2:50:45.440]  do it ron paul has to do it and if we don't this year uh because i think we have an excellent chance
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:51.520]  of retaking majority in the house but it will be for naught unless we use the power of the
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:58.480]  majorities and the white house to attack the deep state i mean we we heard the former acting
[2:50:58.480 --> 2:51:05.200]  c i director don mcloff in a few months ago saying thank god for the deep state the left knows how
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:12.400]  important is to retain those positions and to fight any type of reform and silicon valley is with them
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:19.360]  we need to get this thing back on track as soon as this impeachment is finished both legislatively
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:25.040]  and through the administration's executive powers but think about how profound that is even though
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:30.080]  they're dug in it's now admitted they're there as you said they go on c span with brendan and
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  mclochland and say thank god the intelligence agencies through congress are removing the president
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:42.080]  as if they're the electorate the arrogance of criminals in my view the arrogance of them announcing
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:46.320]  that i heard that clip probably 50 times people are like stop playing the clip it was so incredible
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:51.440]  the admission that we're a rogue group of the government like a banana republic like venezuela
[2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:56.320]  and we're going to overthrow an elected president for made-up crap uh that was absolutely amazing
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:52:02.880]  and you're totally right so as negative as some things are i believe the optimism uh mr bar as you
[2:52:02.880 --> 2:52:09.520]  said congressman bar in that at least it's out in the open now that there are bureaucrats that are
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:15.760]  too big for their breaches and i believe that will be their undoing it needs to be and it needs to
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:22.480]  begin in earnest this year can't be put off any longer we need to do it this year alex no you're
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:26.080]  right you're right okay i know you've got a lot of sites and a lot of stuff you're doing what is the
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:32.160]  best site for folks to find all things bob bar liberty guard dot org two two things alex thank
[2:52:32.160 --> 2:52:37.680]  you yes liberty guard dot org they can go to bob bar dot org for the law enforcement education
[2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:42.640]  foundation which i had to support our men and women in blue and as you know that's critical
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:46.880]  because the left's trying to take them over and turn them into political police commas are so you're
[2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:50.880]  doing such good work thank you bob bar for everything appreciate you always a place they're
[2:52:50.880 --> 2:52:54.640]  always a place for alex thank you thank you all right i'm going to host the fourth hour and we've
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:53:02.960]  got a special guest coming on um i'm not a victim i'm a leader and i'm a target because of it but
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:10.160]  believe me the the the enemy is launching on every front right now against humanity they are they are
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:15.440]  behind the scenes just doing unbelievable stuff and that makes me know we're over the target so i'm
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:20.720]  like oh my god this really sucks i'm under attack no i i i want to fight with these people i just
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:26.960]  want you to know that the reason the president doesn't have more support is they threaten everyone
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:33.280]  around him i mean we're talking sex operatives infiltration grab their bank accounts uh uh
[2:53:33.280 --> 2:53:38.160]  people threaten to kidnap the kids i mean it's it's it's it's beyond any movie you've ever seen
[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:42.640]  okay you just saw a canadian royal man of police saying we're gonna put you in prison
[2:53:42.640 --> 2:53:49.520]  for a book you wrote against trudeau i mean it's it's these people are unchanged they have no
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:58.000]  chivalrous uh connection by the way chivalry is what powerful people do because they want some rules
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:03.680]  on themselves they want to get rid of the chivalry they want to start going down that line they're
[2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:09.280]  gonna reap the whirlwind but i gotta tell you something from the bottom of my heart we're
[2:54:09.280 --> 2:54:16.480]  living in incredible historic times and i just when listeners call up and they say alex thank you
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:22.240]  so much for what you're doing they could put a gun to my head i wouldn't stop doing this you
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:27.760]  understand that because this is like getting oxygen i'm not a huge skin diver but i've gone down to
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:31.680]  about 80 feet and come back to the top some people can really go down like a thousand feet and do it
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:35.680]  because it compresses your blood so they have more oxygenation but it's coming back up you've
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:40.960]  got to watch out for but i've gone down about 80 feet skin diving and down there man like a minute
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:45.200]  woes it's like everything's so bright everything's so clear and when you come back up you're like
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:51.280]  god i i i need air and i start using the whole skin diving analogy but
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:55:02.960]  i don't know why i was using skin diving analogy i'm not going off talking points here but that
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:09.680]  this is like oh it's coming back up at the top getting air i mean i'm like somebody that went
[2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:14.800]  down 80 feet and i'm coming back up with my flippers and i just want to get that air you know
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:22.320]  because the the my blood's not under pressure i'm at 30 40 feet down and and now my brain's
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:28.080]  going whoa you don't have air dude so me fighting tyranny is not some heroic effort
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:34.560]  it's air in your lungs
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:45.520]  it's air in your lungs it's not like some heroic thing to suck air in your lungs or
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.280]  love your children or if somebody walks up and punches you in the face to kick their ass that's
[2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:56.800]  not heroic that's the thing about fighting you know you don't want to get to fight with some
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:00.480]  big guy starting to fight with you but you know as soon as they take a swing or as soon as they
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:05.760]  connect you're like you know what i'm gonna beat your ass and then it starts there's something so
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:11.520]  satisfying when that bully gets hit really hard and then rallies again you knock them down again
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:15.600]  and they and all the sudden they go yeah and your foot goes right in their face and rakes their
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:21.440]  nose and teeth out and i don't want to be like that but i'm telling you that don't thank me for this
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:28.240]  this is everything this is the animating contest of liberty this is what it's all about i wouldn't
[2:56:28.240 --> 2:56:33.040]  be anywhere else because i love you and i want to be with you in eternity i don't want to go with
[2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:39.280]  satan i want to go with god and i'm not going to put on some fake candy ass bible thumper bs up
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:45.920]  here i love jesus and that's it jesus made me and that's it and i love god and whatever god does
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:51.200]  through me it happens but i just go out the spirit and god even want me to stand up there and tell
[2:56:51.200 --> 2:56:55.680]  people how pious i am all day or sit there and tell people how i read this many books the bible
[2:56:55.680 --> 2:57:00.400]  and i memorized this and i've got all god wants me to get up and take on the new world order
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:06.800]  because if you don't one thing about god god hates cowards
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:16.160]  no one knows who originally said that but it's true god hates cowards and god loves people
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:22.320]  who are default position to not have fear and who are committed to god's will
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:29.440]  but our flesh is imperfect so to be able to line up with god is a process of flame
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:36.400]  and you've got to be put through the fire of hell to separate the metal from the chest
[2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:41.120]  what it's all about all right big fourth hour straight ahead

[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:06.480]  all right you know i took a lot of calls this week and i really
[3:00:06.480 --> 3:00:13.440]  want to come in here sunday and i will be here sunday 4 to 6 p.m central but there is a lot going
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:18.240]  on and we're going to be here tracking at the war rooms coming up obviously this virus is already
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:25.520]  here in the united states and it's a big deal whether it's a exaggerated situation or whether
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:29.200]  it's really as deadly as they're saying i think it's clear that it's killing some people and it's
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:39.200]  a big u.n. world government drill but i'm really excited that a lot of people get what's happening
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:44.000]  and and and and realize that this is important in fact we got some time left before this next
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.560]  guest joins us let me just get up and talk about this right now so
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:57.840]  so i didn't just start selling storeable food to the audience last month or six months ago
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:04.880]  or a year ago i've been selling storeable food to people that believe they need to get it i've been
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:10.720]  doing that for 20 plus years this has made sense to me to have insurance you can eat during any
[3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:17.200]  crisis and we hope trump and america wins we hope the globalists get defeated but you know war like
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:24.560]  this there isn't any arming that wins a war politically or militarily that doesn't have food
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:31.280]  backing it up and so that's what we're talking about here napoleon went into russia he ran out of
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:37.360]  food he failed hitler went into russia he ran out of food he failed so you know adam schiff wants
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:41.040]  to defeat the russians we need lots of food to do that now we need to beat the adam schiff's the
[3:01:41.040 --> 3:01:49.200]  world because if you don't have food they control you ladies and gentlemen so uh i believe in storeable
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:54.160]  food 20 something years ago got it myself that's insurance you can always eat but then i noticed that
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:02:00.160]  even there are big reputable companies during a big spike they make people wait months
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:06.880]  to get their food they play games well going back more than 11 years ago they've been around 12 years
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:12.000]  my patriot supply came along and promised to be different and i slowly worked with them for a couple
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:17.440]  years to test them out and now 10 11 years later they're the best and again it's it's like everything
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:22.240]  that's the best you could have a nexus point like a graph like what's the lowest price versus what's
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:27.360]  the best quality there's some stuff that i pointed out cost way more three four five six times more
[3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:32.080]  it's like war may it's ridiculous how good it is but it costs way more but on the next point this
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:36.800]  is right in the middle super low cost the lowest you're going to find for any decent food and it's
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:40.880]  really good high quality stuff some stuff's like gourmet it's like damn i think this every day
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:45.600]  other stuff's like that's pretty good the point is it's really good and it's not a scam and there
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:51.360]  are people that are smart and want a long term relationship you buy it in four store.com they're
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:56.160]  in the back end of our computers it's my patriot supply we just get some of the money to fund our
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:01.040]  operation when you buy it there in four store and they ship it out to you they've got food for another
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:06.720]  twelve days or so they're honest about that what they don't have is the people to pack it so they're
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:12.880]  going 24 hours a day at their three factories in the united states one in utah the other two big ones
[3:03:12.880 --> 3:03:19.600]  and that's what's happening so they're there and they're taking your orders the other big companies
[3:03:20.720 --> 3:03:27.200]  just instantly when institutions called sold out big corporations governments called they sold out
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:31.360]  the chai comms bought up all the mass they brought up all the food they can't great the chinese need
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:35.840]  food i get it they're shipping over there that's great we are selling food to the american people
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:40.960]  and that's the message and the mission of tim redhawk the founder and their CEO that's coming on with
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:48.320]  us next segment but this is something that is the the the trifecta it's great food you and your
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:04:00.080]  family need it funds the information war and at the same time it gives you the confidence to know
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:06.160]  that you've taken care of yourself and your family so it's that simple it's called ready hour now we
[3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:09.920]  used to call it info or select because i could get around the rules they had at their company
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:14.640]  to even lower in the prices to dominate the market i am their biggest distributor that's how we fund
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:19.760]  this operation but they came to me and they said that's boosting the price to have to private label
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:24.800]  it just not the private labeling just call it we call it ready hour so we do you just order
[3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:29.840]  it info or store dot com that funds our whole operation and it really is excellent it's super
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:33.840]  high quality they have special meals for special diets and so much more they have four weeks they
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:37.520]  have three months they have four months they have six months they have years this is something
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:42.720]  everyone should do to invest in their future and to begin the road towards preparedness
[3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:47.920]  is the chinese say the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step well getting
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:55.120]  swarable food and firearms is more than the single step well it's here the year 2020 world
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:04:59.520]  governments out in the open we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:05.200]  government as the answer and we've gotten massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated by
[3:05:05.200 --> 3:05:12.560]  big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns and freedom and jesus and the family
[3:05:12.560 --> 3:05:18.160]  and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new world order is real
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:22.720]  satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real as well and we love god and we're
[3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.920]  standing up and saying no but i just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have
[3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:33.440]  never been in Kansas we have never been in some small village place that didn't matter everything
[3:05:33.440 --> 3:05:38.720]  we do every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:41.920]  and everything we're going to go through so it's an incredible town to be alive i'm going to thank
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:47.280]  you all for being aware and being involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of
[3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:52.000]  mouth and financial support of mp4 store.com is critical so please take action
[3:05:57.680 --> 3:06:05.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin tess's
[3:06:05.440 --> 3:06:15.280]  listeners for joining us on this Wednesday broadcast january 29th 2020 and we have a very
[3:06:15.280 --> 3:06:21.680]  special guest with us obviously i just straight shoot the listeners it's all i can do it's my
[3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:29.040]  superpower is that i just tell the truth and what's going on a lot of people two plus weeks ago said
[3:06:29.040 --> 3:06:35.200]  why aren't you promoting storeable foods and water filtration by this coronavirus is obviously out of
[3:06:35.200 --> 3:06:40.880]  control and i said i'm always promoting water filtration and storeable foods and the best
[3:06:40.880 --> 3:06:45.360]  storeable foods and the best water filtration i'm not going to sit here and like freak out at this
[3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:54.160]  point but then we saw the sales over the last weekend just skyrocket and then i got some calls
[3:06:54.160 --> 3:07:01.920]  not just from our main supplier my patriot supply but i got calls from all over the country
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:10.800]  different companies trying to get me to endorse their product or become sponsors suddenly well
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.240]  over a long period of time the last 12 years i've worked with my patriot supply who's become the
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:22.320]  leader because i want somebody who's got quality products that get delivered right on time so
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:26.640]  here i am saying this isn't a pitch but if i'm going to pitch food i'm going to pitch it but
[3:07:26.640 --> 3:07:31.040]  that's only part of the equation because i'm straight shooting you yes i'm pitching you food
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:36.800]  right now i can't help it i'll be honest right in front but that's a side issue to the fact that
[3:07:37.840 --> 3:07:42.640]  i've been working with these folks 12 years since they began with a philosophy of high quality food
[3:07:43.280 --> 3:07:49.840]  at low prices but the reason i've got them on is i started getting calls from other food
[3:07:49.840 --> 3:07:55.760]  suppliers saying we've sold out big institutional buyers are coming and buying it all up but will
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:07:59.440]  you eat your listeners to try to buy our product and i said well do you have it on hand well
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:05.920]  we're not sure how fast it'll get there so the new story is there's a panic for storeable food well
[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:11.760]  with 2020 and the establishment trying to trigger riots and what's with what's happening in the
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:16.800]  economy it's always smart to have storeable food that's why i promote what i already personally
[3:08:16.800 --> 3:08:23.360]  believe in them and live by being self-sufficient if you aren't self-sufficient if you don't have
[3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:28.880]  food and water and basic communications and control your family you're not free you're a slave
[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:33.200]  so yes i'm selling storeable food but that said let me bring on
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:41.360]  Keith Bessemer who is the president of my patriot supply now i've known Matt Redhawk who
[3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:46.320]  is a very shy person since he started the company they've been a sponsor for 11 years their 12 year
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:51.120]  history but the real reason they're here today is not even to sell you food they're selling it out
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:57.200]  faster than they can get it it's to break down the fact that i gave them a call a few days ago and
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:02.080]  i said i'm getting calls that the food's selling out and they're gearing up for some big emergency
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:06.240]  do you know about this can you tell me if there's been big governmental buyers coming to you and
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:12.400]  they said listen it's no secret we've had the general services administration which should have
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:18.160]  set up front coming to us trying to buy up everything we've got because all the other
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:24.320]  major food distributors are either sold out or close to selling out so he joins us now other
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:28.720]  than me pontificating all day because obviously i want you to get storeable food i want you to
[3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:33.120]  be prepared i want you to be self-sufficient for whatever's coming on the pike but the story
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:38.400]  of how the u.s government is trying to buy up the food supply and what's happening with this
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:45.440]  coronavirus that's the big issue that's front and center so this is 70 percent news story 30
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:50.880]  percent selling food because it's so crazy so key thanks for coming on with us again i just
[3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:56.960]  straight shot the audience that yeah i'm selling food but as a father as a patriot as an american
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.920]  as somebody who's heard about china the the information you have that i called and solicited
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:07.760]  from you is what's really crazy for me glad to be on alex and good to speak with you once
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:16.000]  again here matt is in a travel right now is in the air travel commitments today or else he would
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:21.920]  have been on he's been visiting with our suppliers to make sure that we've got all the the materials
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:27.920]  to you know make the meals and package the foods and get the things out to both your your viewers
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:33.680]  and your your those in your store and your your shoppers and the folks at my patriot supply so
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:42.960]  so but you're right we this started in november i started getting emails phone calls from different
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:52.080]  people of from the government basically trying to get us into a system where you can get gsa
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:58.720]  contracts to work with the government on making large large purchases of storable food and you
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:03.120]  know we've always said no we will never do that we will not sell through the government of my
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:09.120]  patriot supply but they keep calling alex they keep emailing and is recent as yesterday i'm
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:13.520]  getting i'm getting phone calls going would you go into the system you get into the system
[3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:18.080]  so that we can see they want to know all the information how much food can you make
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.960]  where your warehouses how big are the warehouses how fast can you get more raw materials to
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:28.080]  make food kits they want this information and we just said no and they keep calling alex
[3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:34.320]  why do you think that is because i'm always selling storeable food i believe in it you guys
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:40.080]  are great but but now it's it's it's different i mean they're like really pushing hard what
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:46.880]  does that signify to you well it tells me they know something that we don't and that's typical
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:53.600]  i'm guessing you know seam is gonna you know buy a stock up for something uh and you know be it uh
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:12:00.160]  uh you know to control i guess um you know we we don't want to do that we we have my patriots
[3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:06.480]  apply we we service americans uh we want to work direct with americans to help them prepare
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:12.000]  we don't need some go between in between uh that's uh preparing for something in the future that they
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:19.040]  know and they control well that's really yet so again i began to get calls weeks ago why aren't
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:23.840]  you promoting storeable food by other parties i said well we've got the best group my patriot and
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:28.960]  people go to m4store.com at drop ships within an hour and it funds our operation you know we've
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:33.440]  already been with them over a decade that's what we're with but okay but you know something big's
[3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:38.720]  coming and i've just kind of been punched drunk with the coverage of the trial of the president
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:45.360]  trump and all the other news but now it's suddenly hit like a ton of bricks the last few days it
[3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:51.120]  certainly has and i mean the sale of food storage has been off the charts you're you're talking about
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:57.360]  it we're seeing it you know we're running four lines constantly 16 hours a day to ship at our
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:04.000]  multiple warehouses across the country uh or you know doing everything we can possible to get food
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:10.480]  storage to americans to the patriots out there but we're seeing the outer limits of this i mean we've
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:16.880]  you know math's been visiting with the suppliers and we have convoys of semis on the way to our
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:21.440]  production facilities with all these raw ingredients need to make foods that's like the rice and the
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:28.800]  potatoes and the veggies and the sauces and the apostas and such and we you know it takes about 90
[3:13:28.800 --> 3:13:34.400]  days from the the day we say hey give us the truck full of rice to when it's ready in a package to
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:40.160]  ship to the customer so we've pulled forth all these contracts that we have all these purchase
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:46.640]  orders from 90 days forward to take get it to our facilities now so we can supply folks but you know
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:52.480]  the outer limit is in the next two maybe three weeks you know we're not going to be able to
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:58.640]  ship food much longer here and we're going to be like the others i i guess that uh well the others
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:04.000]  are selling to someone else we're selling we're selling direct to americans and and that's really
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:08.160]  the truth here people are asking me hey you know there's foods been sold out hey you know government's
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:12.480]  buying it up why aren't you covering this then i call you guys they go yeah it's insane lines of
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:19.440]  semis most people are sold out we're still offering at this price people should order now to make sure
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:24.080]  they get it within i guess they ordered a day within seven to ten days you're being honest that
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.720]  you're close to being like all the others but you're not like all the others when you guys
[3:14:28.720 --> 3:14:33.840]  run out of food or have a wait you tell people the others are famous that's why i use you guys
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:39.280]  because you have great food high quality of fair price and i don't like listeners that pay for
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:45.040]  something and then don't give it delivered i've been through that a few times i won't go through it
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:49.920]  again that's why you guys are my sole sponsor and so yes it's true like everything we promote here
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:55.360]  it's the real mccoy and if they order with you they will get the food you have it in supply you have
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:15:01.200]  it in pipeline how many days can you hold out until you've got to push that date from seven to ten
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:06.640]  days out well i'd say we're all good for about the next two weeks here alex you know you put the
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:10.800]  order in the staff is working they're going to get it out as quickly as possible there and then it's
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:16.640]  some shipping time to get to wherever in the united states here but but three weeks now we're in a
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:22.400]  guessing game and you know we don't know how much more the sales are going to increase the demand
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:27.760]  for emergency food storage in the last couple of days here you know friday was one number and then
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:33.680]  that number doubled on sunday that number doubled again well it's doubling today okay now keith keith
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:37.920]  messomer the president of my patron supply in my view the best

[3:17:54.080 --> 3:18:00.880]  globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because we're awake we're alive we're
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:07.440]  passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:12.720]  of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and
[3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:19.280]  they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:24.480]  have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:30.080]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:37.520]  it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:44.240]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we
[3:18:44.240 --> 3:18:51.520]  are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in
[3:18:51.520 --> 3:19:00.160]  charge this should really be easier than it is i'm not here giving you a sales pitch i'm pointing

[3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:26.960]  about iodine because it's the good halogen fluorides the bad halogen and people told me about it for
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:32.880]  years and i didn't listen and i'm so thankful that finally i listened to dr group like eight years
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:41.440]  ago it started taking true iodine atomic iodine we've got it back in stock x2 40 off right now
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:48.080]  at info or store.com and i'm telling you folks get it it's amazing discover the benefits and it
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:58.160]  funds the info or a 360 win you can't lose unless you don't take action you're listening to the alex
[3:19:58.160 --> 3:20:05.840]  jones show
[3:20:09.600 --> 3:20:16.480]  so i have this neurotic thing i do where i just tell you exactly what i'm thinking and where i'm at
[3:20:17.280 --> 3:20:21.440]  because hey great i sell you a bunch of storeable food it funds in fours we fight the globalist
[3:20:21.440 --> 3:20:25.600]  fight for the unborn five the second amendment i'm buying storeable foods great company i believe
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:31.600]  in it so i sleep good at night promoting this but if i get into obsessing over telling you how
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:36.480]  i'm selling you storeable food it misses the whole story we're always selling storeable food
[3:20:37.760 --> 3:20:45.120]  why now is there this giant shortage that we're reporting to you why is there this institutional
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:53.200]  run on food with the general services administration calling our big sponsor my patriot supply
[3:20:53.200 --> 3:21:02.320]  and keith bansomer and saying we want everything you've got that's really the big story here is that
[3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:09.360]  wow there's a run on food the chinese shelves are empty china exports a lot of food as well
[3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:15.520]  not just imports what happens when other countries can't ship what happens if this thing does become
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:22.880]  a over-the-top pandemic so i believe in storeable food for patriots so that we're not dependent
[3:21:22.880 --> 3:21:27.440]  on the system that's just a default we're always promoting food we're not promoting
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:32.640]  high-quality storeable food just today bottom and d3 just today we're doing all the time
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:41.440]  but what does it signify when the u.s. government's quietly not just contacting my patriot supply
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:49.360]  but contacting everybody trying to buy up the food well it shows that this thing is already out of
[3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:55.120]  control in china you got control here and it's not just food that people need they need to get
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:22:01.600]  right with god keith talking to your suppliers talking to everybody why are they so panicked
[3:22:01.600 --> 3:22:07.120]  what do you really think is going on right now it's definitely the chatter about the crown of
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:12.960]  iris there alex i mean that's that's what we're hearing that's why people are making a purchase
[3:22:12.960 --> 3:22:19.120]  here i mean the word quarantine that that's a big word look what's happening those millions of people
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:24.960]  in china there and move that word quarantine to a city in the u.s. means you don't leave your home
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:29.840]  it means stores are shut it means you can't get out and how much food is sitting on the sidelines
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:35.200]  that's what americans are thinking right now and you know coronavirus is all what it's all about
[3:22:35.200 --> 3:22:40.720]  and one would have to put one and one together and say exactly that's why you know since november
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:47.120]  we're getting the phone calls from the gsa we're we're getting the emails you know i'm getting voice
[3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:52.160]  mails you know saying would you go into the system will you get all that information entered into
[3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:58.000]  the system tell us about what you can do for us so why do you think why do you think the deep state
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  fema the gsa is contacting you i mean obviously because they're worried about a big crisis but
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  why are they pushing so hard to know what you can supply well you know you know control the information
[3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:15.760]  control the food supply you control the people i mean that's it really comes down to a very
[3:23:15.760 --> 3:23:22.160]  simple equation and you watch it in a microcosm around the world and you pray to god it just doesn't
[3:23:22.160 --> 3:23:29.600]  come to us last week i guess it was last tuesday or wednesday i was like i better get some mask
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:34.000]  for viruses and i better get some more durable food for my neighbors i already have quite a bit
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:39.600]  from you guys and then when i call they're like okay well normally it ships the next day but right
[3:23:39.600 --> 3:23:44.320]  now it's seven to ten days and that's what i was like wow why aren't i promoting this to my own
[3:23:44.320 --> 3:23:48.480]  listeners because there's almost a guilt even though selling foods and insurance policy you
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:53.680]  can eat there's almost a guilt during a crisis that well i better not sell something that even fema
[3:23:53.680 --> 3:23:58.080]  is buying up because i'm being opportunistic no we're not being opportunistic we're the people
[3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:03.760]  that warned up front about this and this is an insurance policy people should eat everyone should
[3:24:03.760 --> 3:24:09.680]  go to infoorstore.com because we just auto shipped you guys we you know we send you the order right
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:15.120]  away within hours dropship i guess is the word and then they get the highest quality swarble foods
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:20.160]  and it also funds the info or a win-win and i hope that people don't need this food but i was just
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:25.280]  sitting back last week going wait i'm ordering more food i'm ordering gas mask i should be
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:30.400]  promoting this to my audience and we shouldn't be ashamed of that we should be proud that we are
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:36.320]  warning americans and others are getting them ready absolutely i mean we prepare for a hurricane
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:41.120]  right you see what you what americans do and you know hurricanes approaching one of the
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:47.040]  Gulf Coast states and so you know people run and prepare in stores days in advance same thing is
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:52.720]  playing out here you know it may come to pass it may not come to pass you know we certainly hope it
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:58.240]  doesn't but it doesn't hurt to be prepared that's what my kids you know ask me you know dad should
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:04.640]  we be uh stocking something i say you like to eat you know of course they do so you know well
[3:25:04.640 --> 3:25:09.200]  there's nothing wrong with having a little food storage at the ready uh so that you don't have
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:17.200]  to deal with the chaos when it's quote unquote too late there's nothing i'd like more than this
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:23.120]  coronavirus to end in china end here not big you're not be a big problem i just see all the
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:30.480]  preparation going on and i hope we're wrong and i hope this isn't needed but i'm absolutely excited
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:36.560]  to get people thinking about being prepared for economic collapse war all of it i'm not excited
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:42.320]  about those prospects but i'm very excited about getting people to think about being independent
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:48.640]  because once you start that mindset of being self-sufficient and being independent you're not
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:55.280]  under the system's control it's like magic we've got to get the point of being independent
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:26:00.640]  even if we just mentally think about what does that mean that's that big step like the chinese
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:06.480]  say that leads to a thousand miles it certainly does and you know alex if you stop and think
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:13.280]  about it we are all preparers in some way shape or form we prepare for retirement with 401ks and
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:18.160]  ira's we prepare with medical insurance in case there's a you know hospital disaster and you
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:23.680]  got the big bills coming for that we prepare for fire by having smoke detectors we've got
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:29.520]  you know car jacks and spirit hires in our car jumper cables here preparing for that day when
[3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:34.080]  maybe the car is not going to be working the right way or the wheel blows out here i mean i'm
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:38.080]  carrying a gun in my love compartment i'm not looking for a fight but it's there in case i need it
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:44.400]  exactly exactly so food preparation is the same thing it just makes common sense and so
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:49.920]  i have a little extra on the store shelves for whatever the the emergency is it's coronavirus
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:55.200]  or you know the day the power goes out power goes out in your home any day any moment any time
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:27:00.400]  you're asking yourself the question well how long right away okay an hour or two you're fine day
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:05.040]  okay what if it's a week what if it's a month that's what you're prepared for you you're ready
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:10.880]  so you don't have to worry about those well that's right Keith the whole system is based on people
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:16.400]  being dependent on the system and not self-sufficient so everything we can be to be self-sufficient
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:21.120]  is a big plus and if people can be self-sufficient and get the best high quality storeable foods

[3:33:22.320 --> 3:33:29.760]  wednesday global transmission and a lot of times we're ahead of the curve most of the time we are
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:37.280]  but when it comes to promoting something or a product that has to do with the crisis we
[3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:43.520]  did to be behind the curve so like i said last week early last week i'm like hey i need some
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:48.480]  more virus mask i need some more food i gotta take care of my neighbors if stuff goes down it's just
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:54.560]  something i do like i have insurance i've got a gun safe i've got security i mean i'm a father i've
[3:33:54.560 --> 3:33:58.800]  got to be in charge i'm trying to prepare for the future you know i've got a little armor
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:05.680]  redoubt outside town you know four or five acres with a gun safe and food because i'm not living in
[3:34:05.680 --> 3:34:13.760]  fear i'm living empowered like i've got a big bumper on my forward truck i've i've got a gun
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:19.040]  safe right over here and i know how to use the guns i'm not living in fear i'm living empowered but
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:24.960]  i did miss the boat on this one and i've got to say my patriot supply i'm proud to say miss the
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:28.560]  boat on it because they're not even out there promoting things they're one of the biggest
[3:34:28.560 --> 3:34:33.600]  most successful trouble food companies in the country we private label it because i got a better
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:38.960]  deal we're not in a crisis to sell their food it's all dropped shipped every day from them so it just
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:45.120]  says info or select on it but it's it's their whole catalog info or store.com same price funds
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:52.000]  or operation i hope you'll buy it there but we're here in the middle of all this it's bigger than
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:59.840]  just buying food or having a firearm or trying to buy some property out town it's the idea of
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:08.240]  during the great depression in 1929 to about 1938 or 1939 major universities estimate 17 million
[3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:15.840]  people starved to death and you had about 87 percent of people that were really but about half of them
[3:35:15.840 --> 3:35:22.480]  that were self-sufficient so we're talking 40 plus percent that were totally self-sufficient
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:31.600]  well today we're not 90 percent rural or 87 percent rural we're almost 100 percent
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:39.760]  urban and other people that are rural very few are self-sufficient so again we all know that
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:46.640]  Ann saves food in the old parable the grasshopper doesn't so it's that simple equation everything
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.520]  the globalists do is about making you dependent on them hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck but
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:58.720]  moving to a rural area or closer rural area or being self-sufficient or even having a redoubt
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:04.560]  or even having some formal foods that is a major plus in some type of Bernie Sanders communist
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:11.760]  overthrow so Keith Mansomer is the president of my patron supply i've been a big fan supporter
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:17.360]  of the owner of my patron supply for more than 10 years matt redhawk who's too too humble to come
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:23.520]  on the show i try to get him to today but just at the time we have left talk about what's happening
[3:36:23.520 --> 3:36:28.080]  with other storeable food companies the fact that they sit there and have a limited supply
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:32.400]  wait till there's a crisis sell out of it and then get people to buy the food they don't have in
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:37.920]  stock you're selling food you've got in stock that you're freshly packaging now so that's why
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:43.360]  during this crisis i'm proud to be promoting that absolutely you know all the orders that come in
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:48.800]  today and if we were store and such we've got product it might take us a little longer because
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:54.240]  of the sheer you know volume of what's happening you know eight nine times normal you know capacities
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:36:59.120]  and such to get it out the door but it's it's going to be delivered to you that's not the story
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:05.040]  that you know we're hearing from customers that are calling us and chatting and emailing and social
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:09.280]  media and all they're saying you look you know these other guys i just went and checked them out
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:13.920]  and they're saying they might be able to ship it next week and then you know it's going to take a
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:19.200]  couple of weeks after that i might not see something for two to three weeks that's not that's not the
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:24.880]  company we built at my patriot supply but you're being nice the inside baseball is they're sold
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:30.080]  out they can't even get the food you and matt set up the that's why i chose you guys the infrastructure
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:34.800]  in a real crisis you guys have that reach at least for a few weeks you're being honest about that
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:40.240]  though yeah yeah yeah that's exactly why we have multiple warehouses and we've built you know that
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:45.440]  the company for this moment that's you know it's it's that it's that moment of awareness you know
[3:37:45.440 --> 3:37:50.640]  people are going to say hey now i need it i need it now when let me ask you this why was i contacted
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:56.080]  over a dozen companies wanting me to do and you guys are my main sponsor i'm busy you're busy
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:01.040]  that that says something you didn't even contact me you're just too busy supplying the food you
[3:38:01.040 --> 3:38:06.160]  didn't contact one of your biggest distributors that shows your your focus not even on sales that's
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:11.040]  why i begged you to come on you're like literally focus on fulfillment talk about what you're doing
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:15.920]  right now to make sure it all gets fulfilled yeah absolutely so you're making sure that we've got
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:20.880]  you know plenty of the raw materials to make make all the foods and continue to kid them and you
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:26.000]  know get the meals and put them in the the heavy duty four-layer packaging but we're running four
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:31.360]  times the four lines i should say to ship out across these multiple warehouses the staff
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:35.920]  alex is working 16 hours a day right now for having sex you know but that's the thing they know it's
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:40.480]  all hands on deck this is the time to serve america that's what we're doing we're serving you know
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:45.200]  direct to americans you know let those other guys sell to the you know the government contracts and
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:49.680]  all that's what i'm turning out is you guys are so busy you'd even call your one of your biggest
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:54.400]  distributors i mean you're busting your ass but talk about that somewhere against the government
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:39:00.080]  but why are you guys whenever the government tries to buy it up saying no no because that's not that's
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:04.080]  our mission our mission is to help americans direct they they know where to come they can come direct
[3:39:04.080 --> 3:39:09.280]  to us they don't need to have somebody distribute you know emergency food exactly you're not about
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:14.640]  the control of government you're about the power of the individual absolutely you nailed it on the
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:21.040]  head there alex it does creep me out that i didn't think about this until i called you guys and then
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:24.880]  i was the operator was like yeah you're glad you're calling my goodness we usually ship the next day
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:29.840]  but it's like five days right now the time i got mad on the phone which took three days you guys are
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:35.840]  like uh we live only to promote this because maybe a month more i mean let's just say you've been a
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:40.320]  little bit concerned about what's going on it's kind of scared you a little bit well when we saw
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:44.320]  last week and we went in the full motion saying hey this is uh you know going to get a little bit
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:48.640]  bigger so you know let's make sure we've got the pipeline filled so we can serve and we can deliver
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:55.040]  like we do each and every day other points in the few minutes we've got left that you want to impart
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:39:59.360]  to the listeners because i'm all about empowering people i'm all about putting high-quality food
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:04.560]  in their pantry so they have a backup of their self-sufficient but this is definitely talking to
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:11.360]  matt today and you today this is a record level isn't it it is it is at this point here and we're
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:15.520]  talking about a lot about food today here alex but you know the first thing you gotta think about
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:20.160]  is water you can live you know barely more than three days without some fresh purified water
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:25.360]  that's why we've got the alexa pure pro uh water filtration system it's gravity powered so you know
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:30.080]  electricity could be off and it's gonna work just fine now start there make sure you've got that make
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:35.760]  sure you've got the good clean you know drinking water and then you can use that in junk in conjunction
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:41.040]  with preparing hot meals with the foods that we hear at my patriot supply half so it's it's really
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:45.440]  a one-two punch that's what we do as a company and uh that's why you know we appreciate your
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:49.840]  partnership because you understand it too there alex oh i do i mean we're we're promoting alexa
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:55.280]  pure which third party groups go my god this is like in the top two or three out of hundreds
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:01.200]  of gravity-fed filters it's one of the highest rated yeah again i this is where i buy my water
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:05.760]  filtration it's where i buy my storeable foods and yeah i'm not ashamed of it it funds this great
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:10.320]  crew that bust their butt around the country and on air exposed in the globalist we're selling
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:15.440]  high quality food we're selling high quality water filtration i just kind of feel like an idiot that
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:20.240]  i missed the boat that for like two weeks is for the biggest run on food ever and i'm not even
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:25.040]  promoting it on air so that my audience gets it and so i could find my operation i feel like a
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:30.960]  i feel like an idiot kind of you know well alex sounds you know it's not too late there's there's
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:35.520]  plenty of time for you know folks we've got the inventory they can get into the queue you know
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:39.600]  we've got a couple of weeks here maybe we can get the three weeks here with the all that we've
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:45.360]  got the the convoy semis that's coming with more food goods and such and then we're gonna get people
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:50.960]  prepared and and get them what they need and that's what i want listeners to know i'm always
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:56.000]  seeking out straight shooters i'm like neurotic about i'm totally ocd and what you and matt redhawks
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.920]  say is what is happening i dealt with this with companies that were reputable a few times and then
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.080]  suddenly it'd be six months people get their food or problems the same thing with water filters that's
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:12.080]  why for over 10 years i just love the fact that during regular times people get great food and
[3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:16.480]  water filtration you name it and during bad times they get it and that scares me though that you're
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:21.040]  saying two three weeks and you're out of food because of government buying everything up that is
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:27.280]  scary all right keith bassomer thank you so much we'll go to infowarstore.com to fund us it's all
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:32.160]  dropship the same day but my patreon supply will come back and cover all the news on the other side
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:37.280]  but this is a time to be prepared government's gearing up as well keith thank you so much my friend
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:43.520]  thank you all god bless hey it's insurance you can eat i hope you don't need to use it

[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:56.960]  well it's here the year 2020 world government's out in the open we've got the predicted mass
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:02.480]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:09.200]  taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:15.360]  and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:20.320]  we're right the new world order is real satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real

[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:30.160]  one month into 2020 that we have never been in cancels we have never been in some small
[3:43:30.160 --> 3:43:35.440]  village place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:38.960]  species and everything we've gone through and everything we're gonna go through so it's an

[3:44:45.840 --> 3:44:50.880]  only has power because of you and i suggest you use it.
[3:44:52.320 --> 3:44:58.320]  i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from info wars your support and your help
[3:44:58.320 --> 3:45:04.400]  in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really
[3:45:04.400 --> 3:45:09.840]  caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes
[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:16.400]  to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech
[3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:21.440]  censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:26.560]  our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:33.120]  than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the
[3:45:33.120 --> 3:45:38.720]  globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:44.960]  major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison
[3:45:44.960 --> 3:45:50.720]  they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:58.320]  stay happy infowarstore.com we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[3:45:58.320 --> 3:46:02.000]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them want to thank the listeners for
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:08.720]  getting it but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:13.840]  that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free the adult or the children's
[3:46:13.840 --> 3:46:18.800]  these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers people love it this is a
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:24.800]  whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also
[3:46:24.800 --> 3:46:31.760]  remineralizes the teeth then it has the patented silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria that
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:36.880]  causes ginsivitis this is all proven you can make claims with this but i had to tell you no one has
[3:46:36.880 --> 3:46:43.680]  a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:50.160]  that doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the operation infowarstore.com
[3:46:50.160 --> 3:46:58.400]  that's why we're still on air thanks to you you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:16.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:16.880 --> 3:47:29.600]  a number of the countries and foundations are coming together to look at making vaccines
[3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:37.520]  in advance of an epidemic so that we can have platforms that are very quick to make new vaccines
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:42.000]  and so we're far more ready than we were when they have bull epidemic hit and so that's a
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:48.880]  a big contribution it's a response to the fact that the vaccine didn't get done for a ball until
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:56.480]  after the epidemic was gone what's being announced is uh 460 million that'll be given out in grants
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:03.840]  for specific pathogens that there's concern about but the focus will be on using an approach
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:12.240]  that even if it's a new disease we could make a vaccine more rapidly so the good news is that
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:20.080]  science has these RNA DNA type vaccines that you might literally in a period of months be able to
[3:48:20.080 --> 3:48:25.120]  create something new instead of the many years that it takes now when our foundation first started
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:30.240]  up it was focused on reproductive health that was the main thing we did because i thought you know
[3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:35.920]  population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face you've got to help mothers who
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:40.880]  want to limit family size have the tools and education to do that now that's the only thing
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:47.040]  that really counts this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you've got a
[3:48:47.040 --> 3:48:52.240]  thing on the left co2 that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of
[3:48:52.240 --> 3:48:59.760]  people the services each person's using on average the energy on average for each service
[3:48:59.760 --> 3:49:07.280]  and the co2 being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see how we
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:12.240]  can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to
[3:49:12.240 --> 3:49:19.040]  zero now that's back from a high school algebra but let's let's take a look first we've got
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:26.000]  population the world today has 6.8 billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now if we do
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:32.800]  a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could lower that
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:39.520]  by perhaps 10 or 15 percent this vaccine work is the biggest program for the gates foundation
[3:49:40.160 --> 3:49:47.440]  and that's because it is so impactful it's incredible value it utterly changes the country
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:57.040]  to have the newest vaccines we also have had great support from the vaccine manufacturers in terms of
[3:49:57.760 --> 3:50:05.280]  continuing to get the prices down and so that makes all of this possible we also have ambitious
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:11.280]  goals for getting vaccine coverage up it's wonderful that it's up at 80 percent but gavi working with
[3:50:11.280 --> 3:50:19.040]  key partners in particular WHO and UNICEF can get that even higher and so today gives us
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:26.960]  resources that will go into that going back to 2000 that's when gavi was first established
[3:50:27.680 --> 3:50:36.560]  within five years they had gotten hepatitis b hemophilus influenza hib and yellow fever
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:42.320]  out to lots and lots of people the world is willing to step up and make sure that all the
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:48.800]  kids who need these vaccines will get them vaccines are now getting out to children far
[3:50:48.800 --> 3:50:54.880]  far better than ever before because a group called the global alliance for vaccines gavi has raised
[3:50:54.880 --> 3:51:02.480]  money to buy these vaccines on behalf of the poor kids we are much closer today to achieving the goal
[3:51:02.480 --> 3:51:09.520]  of universal coverage i think today we'll go down in the the history of global health it's a very
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:17.600]  important day right up there with the time that UNICEF first committed to universal vaccination
[3:51:18.320 --> 3:51:25.280]  right up there with the original creation of the global alliance for vaccines well it's amazing
[3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:31.600]  how asia including most large countries there have gotten extreme poverty down quite substantially
[3:51:31.600 --> 3:51:39.360]  uh so as you say africa is going to have a very high share of the people in extreme poverty
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:45.280]  and in fact the births in the world are shifting uh towards africa it's a quarter of the births today
[3:51:45.280 --> 3:51:51.040]  but over the course of this century it becomes half of all the births in the world so we need to
[3:51:51.040 --> 3:51:57.040]  really double down take the positive examples from asia what was done there in terms of health and
[3:51:57.040 --> 3:52:05.440]  education and go to even the toughest parts of africa and execute those investments and so
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:13.920]  it's a call that to maintain the great progress we're going to be working in tougher places but
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:21.840]  that's what we need to do the majority of the people are young people and that is an opportunity
[3:52:21.840 --> 3:52:30.560]  because if you do invest in those people their open-mindedness their productivity you know being
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:36.640]  in as they come into working age it can be a fantastic thing but the challenge to get these
[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:42.400]  health systems to scale up to get the food systems for nutrition to scale up and then the
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:48.800]  educational systems then i'll only have the access but the quality as well that's not going to be
[3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:56.960]  easy we're gonna have to have donor resources stay very generous and the local governments figure
[3:52:56.960 --> 3:53:02.400]  out how to raise domestic resources and then run these systems so melinda and i wondered whether
[3:53:02.400 --> 3:53:09.200]  providing new medicines and keeping children alive would that create more of a population problem
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:16.320]  what we found out is that as health improves families choose to have less children the
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:21.040]  population growth goes down as we improve health what's at stake is really very large
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:29.120]  and that is whether we can raise the money so that all the children of the world get the vaccines
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:36.080]  that the children in the wealthier countries like germany and the united states get this
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:43.360]  includes a vaccine to stop the main cause of diarrhea a vaccine that stops the main cause
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:50.720]  respiratory disease well anyone who's been out to see populations getting AIDS drugs or
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:53:59.840]  communities getting malaria bed nets they'll be very sympathetic to these things but the politicians
[3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:05.840]  and particularly the voters very few of them have actually seen it in action and their image of
[3:54:05.840 --> 3:54:11.280]  AIDS goes back to several decades ago where it was more about buying friendship than it was about
[3:54:11.280 --> 3:54:17.600]  putting the money where it could have the most impact it's not one political term you know that
[3:54:17.600 --> 3:54:22.800]  we can get these things done and but but if you think in terms of 10 or 15 years we will be able
[3:54:22.800 --> 3:54:30.480]  to see immense progress why aren't we getting vaccines out in africa for diarrhea for respiratory
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:37.760]  disease why don't we yet have a vaccine for malaria those are the things that i um you know i push
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:44.800]  forward i wouldn't say get angry but i'm uh really impatient that uh we're not moving as fast as i'd
[3:54:44.800 --> 3:54:52.960]  like okay so we are experiencing a measles outbreak yeah um in 22 states because parents are choosing
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:54:59.200]  not to vaccinate their children for whatever reason they may have and much of your foundation
[3:54:59.920 --> 3:55:04.480]  work has been getting vaccines to developing countries how do we fix it right here in this
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:10.400]  country yeah i believe that vaccines are fundamental uh to life we know that the reason
[3:55:10.400 --> 3:55:16.240]  so many children now survive to their fifth birthday is because of vaccines right so the women i meet
[3:55:16.240 --> 3:55:20.880]  in all over the world in developing world countries they'll walk 10 kilometers in the heat to get a
[3:55:20.880 --> 3:55:26.560]  vaccine they'll tell you how important it is to save their child's life so here i think when people
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:30.960]  start to remember that we used to have measles and it's a needless thing for a child to have
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:37.680]  measles or to die from measles that is that's untenable and if somebody's immune system's down
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:42.800]  because i didn't get my kid vaccinated for measles you get sick yeah that doesn't make any sense
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:48.560]  somebody like uh like this young lady here who's having twins my dog had to get shots to get groomed
[3:55:48.560 --> 3:55:54.720]  he had to get all the vaccinate the shots done and i'm thinking that's an imbalance in life if
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:56:01.280]  animals have a rule to get them in a spa why should kids go to school without being vaccinated the
[3:56:01.280 --> 3:56:06.560]  thing that makes me crazy about this is a lot of these adults who have decided not to vaccinate
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:13.520]  their kids have been vaccinated you know they have those you know the certain age you have this mark
[3:56:13.520 --> 3:56:17.760]  that looks like a baby vampire doctor and we've forgotten we have a short memory and what i would
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:23.840]  say to parents is talk to your pediatrician he or she has the real information and trust
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:28.560]  their point of view they are medically trained and they will tell you to have your child vaccinated
[3:56:28.560 --> 3:56:35.680]  parents don't want to vaccinate their kids in a way
[3:56:41.360 --> 3:56:45.600]  people one question that i think a lot of viewers would actually have for you is
[3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:52.720]  have you ever had the thought to just give it all up yeah they were trying to shut me down about
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:58.720]  15 years ago and messing with me and saying jones is all about money and attacking my family and
[3:56:58.720 --> 3:57:04.320]  stuff and i said you know what i'm going to get big now because i guess i've got to do this job to
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:07.200]  defeat the globalists that already becomes so prominent i thought i thought i'd just be a talk
