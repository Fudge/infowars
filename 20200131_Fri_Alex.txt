[00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:42.139]  Well, the United Nations is working with the globalist client state of China to standardize worldwide martial law policies.
[00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:48.064]  Personally, I think myself and the Director General have never seen the scale
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:07.490]  Commitment of an epidemic response at this level in terms of all of government involvement across all of the different arms of government with tremendous support being poured in to Wuhan and Hubei from the central government with a highly organized emergency management structure.
[00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.352]  The challenge is great, but the response has been massive.
[00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:18.536]  And the Chinese government deserves huge credit for that response and for the transparency in which they have dealt with this.
[00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:31.803]  A case in point, in terms of one of the clusters of infections that we're currently working with Germany to investigate, it was the lab in China who contacted Germany to tell them that they had a return case that was positive.
[00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:36.526]  So China is not only helping to manage the cases in its own country, but it is actively
[00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.158]  And it just goes on.
[00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:44.464]  We also have video of the Director General of the UN saying similar things and praising China as the model.
[00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.626]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:47.427]  If you're a TV viewer...
[00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.555]  You may be asking yourself right now why I have such a triggering image in here.
[00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:59.599]  Like I was thinking this morning, I woke up at like 3.30 in the morning, how much I hate Adam Schiff.
[00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:07.105]  And how just looking at him made me start screaming on air yesterday because he just forces himself into our lives for years.
[00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:10.728]  And he says I'm a tool and work for the Russians, so does Rand Paul.
[00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:13.470]  Now they're saying arrest Rand Paul.
[00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.573]  And then I come in here and they've put him up here on the big screens.
[00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:19.417]  So, pretty amazing.
[00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:22.219]  If we can go to a wide shot of that, that'd be great, guys.
[00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:22.739]  Or maybe not.
[00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.022]  Okay, well, anyways, whatever's going on today.
[00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:39.694]  But we've got a lot of really important information to cover here, and we've got huge news on the virus that we're going to be going over, and how serious is it really, and the exponential growth of it.
[00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:43.157]  There, that's what I was telling folks about, coming in here and seeing this incredibly
[00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:47.541]  Triggering image, but I'm gonna restart the show next segment.
[00:02:47.541 --> 00:03:01.494]  We're gonna just disregard this segment as if the segment never even existed And a lot of that problem is I get in here last minute right before I'll get ready for the show and I'll go around to care of business and I got here about 30 seconds late So I apologize the crew on that but
[00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.903]  I'm going to reset here and not just blow up and turn this freaking table over, man.
[00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:08.985]  Because I'm pissed about what's going on in this world.
[00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.768]  And like I said, that son of a bitch, Schiff, pisses me off.
[00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:16.169]  And I probably shouldn't even have that up there.
[00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.111]  But what the hell is wrong with that piece of crap?
[00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:23.454]  And how the hell is such a piece of garbage ruling over us?
[00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:24.775]  Sick of it!
[00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:31.178]  And by the way, that's a normal response to a bug-eyed, pervert, child molester like him running our country.
[00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:31.839]  Piece of crap.
[00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.885]  Seriously, I was thinking how much I hate him at 3.30 in the morning.
[00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.526]  He's just a detestable person.
[00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:47.951]  And look, he works for the Democrats at the top, so he doesn't just look like a pedophile.
[00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:54.637]  I bet all the tea in China, all the tea in China, that that guy is a pedophile.
[00:03:55.506 --> 00:04:10.505]  Now Brian Stelter, if I was casting someone as a pedophile in a movie, there's only one person that, on the bill, as a top star, as a pedophile, you know, if you had a movie about a pedophile that kidnaps kids and keeps them in basements and tortures them and eats them, Stelter or Schiff?
[00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.348]  Because when you really get down to it, I don't know.
[00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:30.742]  They're both the most creepy, ugly, sick, demonic, filthy, make-your-skin-crawl pieces of garbage that rape America, rape the truth, want our children, want our guns, and are quarterbacking the psychic gang rape of the planet!
[00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:31.682]  I told you I'm gonna reset.
[00:04:31.682 --> 00:04:32.203]  I'm gonna come back.
[00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:34.605]  This is not part of the show you just saw.
[00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.107]  Just a little screw-ups in here and shift.
[00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:38.048]  Can't handle it.
[00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:38.888]  Can't handle it.
[00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:39.409]  Can't handle it.
[00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:43.721]  No, I would cast him as the pedophile kidnapper master.
[00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.063]  Not saying he is, just saying he looks like it.
[00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:48.025]  I mean, my God, he makes my skin crawl.
[00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:49.967]  God Almighty!
[00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:51.088]  Matt Brackett's coming up.
[00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:53.290]  He's got huge, super breaking news.
[00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.451]  Oh, double trigger!
[00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:55.272]  Get it off!
[00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:55.632]  Help!
[00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:56.453]  Change the background!
[00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:57.294]  Seriously, get it down!
[00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:01.828]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:06.431]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.

[00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:17.465]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:25.589]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this January 31st, 2020 broadcast.
[00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:26.670]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.811]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:31.012]  Then the War Room with Owen Troyer is coming up.
[00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:35.315]  This broadcast, very existence, is again in defiance of the globalist tyranny.
[00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:41.079]  This is the day that many believe the President will be acquitted.
[00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:46.261]  I thought they'd probably get the votes for witnesses, but it looks like they don't have the votes as of right now.
[00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:52.142]  They're finishing up their closing arguments, and Trump could be acquitted today.
[00:06:52.142 --> 00:06:58.644]  And Trump, of course, has said this is a good time for our country because the country's waking up, and I tend to agree with him.
[00:06:58.644 --> 00:07:04.686]  But if the globalists don't get in trouble for all the crimes that Pencil Neck, Adam Schiff, and others have committed, they're just going to keep committing them.
[00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:15.108]  Look at this headline, Democrats Demand Rand Paul's Arrest After Senator Asked About Obama's Holdover, Eric Sirimala.
[00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:17.769]  Who is one of the people making false testimonies.
[00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.629]  The transcripts and all the other witnesses, it doesn't match.
[00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.970]  But the President's indicted!
[00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.132]  That's what impeachment is, and he can't face his accuser.
[00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:30.773]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:31.813]  We've got all those clips.
[00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.760]  And we'll be following the vote, all of it.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.401]  If it goes through tomorrow, we'll be here covering it.
[00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:42.022]  Obviously, we have a live Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., that I'll be hosting.
[00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:43.502]  So we'll be hitting it from every angle.
[00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:47.664]  There's so much other incredible news as well.
[00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:51.705]  You've got what's happening with the virus.
[00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.466]  Coronavirus UK to quarantine citizens.
[00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:59.674]  Returning from Wuhan in secure facility.
[00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:06.120]  Pilots, flight attendants demand flights to China be stopped as virus fears mounts worldwide.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.266]  Coronavirus drone army deployed to spray disinfectant across China.
[00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.809]  I'd tell people 20 years ago they were gonna use drones for law enforcement and crowd control.
[00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.170]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.032]  They like Washington Post headlines.
[00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:20.834]  Now it's, oh, the drone armies are saving us.
[00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:25.856]  Coronavirus, China accused of burning bodies in secret.
[00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:32.098]  So now we have the last man on earth, Vincent Price, come home for real.
[00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:41.340]  Haunting pictures show dead man left lying in the street of deserted coronavirus ground zero.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:47.742]  China virus cases may be undercounted with even 3,000% surge.
[00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:49.162]  Wow, that's Bloomberg!
[00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.963]  That's exactly what we were reporting
[00:08:52.076 --> 00:09:06.390]  A week and a half ago here on air, but oh, we're the conspiracy theorists that the Washington Post and Vice have to all report on how bad we are.
[00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:12.256]  So, we'll be looking at all the different angles of this.
[00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:15.719]  Wary of irking China, Trump offers rosy take on virus threat.
[00:09:16.562 --> 00:09:18.684]  Well, I hope the President's right.
[00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:24.868]  Who declares international emergency over coronavirus outbreak praises Communist China.
[00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:29.191]  And really what it is is a planetary drill for world government and forced inoculation.
[00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:32.673]  That is all coming up as well.
[00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:37.717]  Who demands gratitude and respect for Chinese dictator's coronavirus response.
[00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:45.683]  Who orders countries not to engage in stigma or discrimination in response to coronavirus outbreak?
[00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:48.265]  And CNN says that white people are the problem.
[00:09:48.265 --> 00:09:49.026]  I'm not kidding.
[00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:54.551]  It's an Infowars.com article with their tweets and reports.
[00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:57.994]  CNN is angry that white people are trying to stop the coronavirus spreading.
[00:09:57.994 --> 00:09:59.376]  Yes, it's white people's fault.
[00:10:01.172 --> 00:10:04.095]  And all these haunting videos of the complete ghost towns.
[00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:07.479]  We're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:10.802]  The true number of coronavirus victims is far larger than you're being told.
[00:10:10.802 --> 00:10:11.803]  Look at those numbers.
[00:10:11.803 --> 00:10:13.405]  Does that mention the Washington Post and others?
[00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:20.051]  Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research.
[00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:33.393]  And so, we're going to play Senator Cotton, who's gotten classified briefings on it, saying we need to look at Wuhan, which develops bioweapons, and as that being a possible release point, that there's an ongoing cover-up.
[00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:41.978]  But you know, he is a far-right fringe lunatic, according to Jeff Bezos' Washington Post.
[00:10:41.978 --> 00:10:42.799]  So we're going to talk about
[00:10:43.757 --> 00:11:00.737]  The response to this and the hysteria and what would happen in America or in Europe or other areas if you had lockdowns and people being welded into their apartment buildings and blockaded and what happened during the Spanish flu that killed between 30 and 50 million people.
[00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:05.140]  How the Chinese are pretty docile and heritable.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.621]  And they say that themselves.
[00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:10.383]  Probably the most servile culture in the world under the Chai Koms.
[00:11:10.383 --> 00:11:11.783]  Very sad for them.
[00:11:11.783 --> 00:11:14.925]  But what will happen if there's something like that here?
[00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:18.106]  And they try to tell a city, shelter in place.
[00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:20.768]  No one's there to help you and you can't have any food.
[00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:23.029]  Looting and burning would begin within hours.
[00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.369]  We all know that.
[00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:28.650]  It would look like Devil's Night in Detroit wrapped into The Purge for real.
[00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.031]  And Matt Bracken is a great author, researcher, former Navy SEAL, terrorism expert.
[00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:37.092]  He's been predicting this for a long time, that it's going to break out somewhere in the world like this.
[00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:38.832]  We're going to see this type of hysteria.
[00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:42.593]  So we're going to talk to him when we come back on the other side of the break.
[00:11:42.593 --> 00:11:43.673]  And again, it's almost over.
[00:11:43.673 --> 00:11:47.154]  Democrats know they've been beaten again.
[00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:50.876]  Trump insists he isn't worried about impeachment.
[00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.917]  This is a happy period.
[00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:54.537]  Sanders surges.
[00:11:54.537 --> 00:11:55.678]  Biden plateaus.
[00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:57.278]  That's why they're getting ready to go after Sanders.
[00:11:57.278 --> 00:11:59.719]  They already stole the nomination from him a few years ago.
[00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.660]  Now they're back to do it again.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.520]  The same leftist authoritarian.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.881]  So that's all coming up.
[00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:08.402]  I'm going to say this.
[00:12:08.402 --> 00:12:10.303]  We are going to sell out.
[00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:15.933]  Within a week at current sales rates of Super Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:24.775]  This is 16 ounces of the highest quality nano silver that is so good for your body and so good for your gums.
[00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:36.278]  And the main disease point and how you get these low oxygen bacteria that can grow in your heart, one of the biggest causes of heart disease, is the fact that people have these
[00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.294]  Different types of bacteria and viruses living in their mouths.
[00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:44.457]  This is the patented nano silver that the U.S.
[00:12:44.457 --> 00:12:46.079]  military uses.
[00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:49.283]  Nobody else has this but the big company, the big nanotech company.
[00:12:49.283 --> 00:12:50.344]  I've got the documents here.
[00:12:52.526 --> 00:12:58.289]  Tim Frigier actually this morning, as I saw it in my stack and it got moved, to bring me those documents back over.
[00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:10.876]  I don't see those, the restricted documents that we can now give you because Congress released them on the company that produces this for us and what they said about SARS, which is again the coronavirus, same family that it's been proven to knock it out.
[00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:14.599]  This isn't a supplement where, oh, you can't say things about it.
[00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:24.006]  This is patented nano silver, and it's 16 ounces of it, ladies and gentlemen, at a price you're not going to find anywhere else.
[00:13:24.006 --> 00:13:25.107]  We are the only folks.
[00:13:25.107 --> 00:13:31.192]  Well, this from that company was developed by my dad with the owner, who's a huge listener, the head scientist.
[00:13:31.192 --> 00:13:32.793]  And so no one even actually has this.
[00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:34.775]  This is just the patented nano silver in here.
[00:13:34.775 --> 00:13:38.758]  And you can also ingest it because it's at 15 parts per million.
[00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:39.438]  You don't want to go above 30.
[00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:41.080]  I think so.
[00:13:56.772 --> 00:14:00.954]  Because I'm not going to raise it back to retail or jack the prices up.
[00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:05.016]  You know, we had thousands of masks, antiviral masks and others.
[00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:05.757]  We always sell them.
[00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:08.418]  It's something people need in their emergency kits.
[00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:11.280]  We left it at sales price, sold out in one day last week.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.681]  We could have made them cost you 10 times more.
[00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:19.042]  Amazon selling single masks for like a hundred dollars.
[00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:21.843]  We didn't do that because I'm on opportunists.
[00:14:21.843 --> 00:14:31.906]  I'm selling things you need up front that I know will help you and your family that also fund our operation that then defends the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, the unborn, and all the good things this broadcast does.
[00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:36.808]  So we have it in the 16 ounce and we have it in the two other smaller container sizes.
[00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:45.487]  In fact, one of these, again, has a little spray top, great to take with you to the airport, great to take to work.
[00:14:45.487 --> 00:14:50.870]  You know, the chemical sanitizers don't work as well, and they can also lower your fertility and cause a lot of problems.
[00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.091]  Silver is toxic to bacteria and viruses.
[00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.453]  That means overall, a little bit of it's good for you, but consult your physician.
[00:14:56.453 --> 00:14:57.754]  A lot of it, not so much.
[00:14:57.754 --> 00:14:58.595]  Just like antibiotics.
[00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:03.098]  It's just another weapon in the arsenal to protect yourself up front.
[00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:08.361]  So you put the super silver wound gel on your hands and things first, it creates an invisible barrier.
[00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:10.262]  It's not used after, it's used before.
[00:15:10.262 --> 00:15:14.665]  But yes, I use it when I have cuts and things and they just heal so much faster.
[00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:14.926]  Also...
[00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:23.415]  Almost forgot, this Super Silver Immune Gargle has iodine in it as well that's so good for the body and so good for the teeth.
[00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:26.537]  And when you don't have enough of the iodine, it lowers your immune and everything else as well.
[00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:27.878]  So this is really a proprietary product.
[00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:28.678]  We're very, very proud of it.
[00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:37.584]  We also have the Nano Silver Whitening Toothpaste that has the same patented nano silver in it as well that also remineralizes the teeth.
[00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:39.365]  So all of the silver products are $40.99.
[00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:46.414]  To 50% off, even though if you watch by the end of next week, they're gonna all be sold out.
[00:15:46.414 --> 00:15:47.654]  Everybody needs this.
[00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:51.738]  Not just for this virus, but for all the crap going on and all the things happening.
[00:15:51.738 --> 00:15:52.959]  And it funds the Infowar.
[00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:54.680]  And the storable food's selling out as well.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.801]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:16:01.538]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:06.402]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:12.787]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:18.171]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:20.692]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:22.132]  Oh, can I ever?
[00:16:22.132 --> 00:16:27.273]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[00:16:27.273 --> 00:16:28.054]  Guess what?
[00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:33.095]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[00:16:33.095 --> 00:16:43.378]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[00:16:44.358 --> 00:16:47.500]  If you are trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.241]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.702]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:12.401]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:17.488]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:17:17.488 --> 00:17:22.195]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:25.716]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[00:19:02.844 --> 00:19:05.586]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:19:05.586 --> 00:19:08.048]  I'm pointing out the way forward.

[00:19:24.782 --> 00:19:31.449]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:37.455]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip.
[00:19:38.596 --> 00:19:43.599]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:51.284]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you, folks, get it.
[00:19:51.284 --> 00:19:52.465]  It's amazing.

[00:19:56.047 --> 00:20:01.931]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:04.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:36.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, something big is afoot.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.723]  I told you, last week and over the weekend,
[00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:53.647]  That storable food companies have had FEMA and other federal agencies call up and buy all the storable food up.
[00:20:53.647 --> 00:20:55.548]  That really happened.
[00:20:55.548 --> 00:21:00.730]  And that they are preparing for a major pandemic here in the United States.
[00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.111]  And that obviously the virus is much worse.
[00:21:04.111 --> 00:21:08.093]  It's been spread much further and much more widely
[00:21:09.687 --> 00:21:15.771]  And that's why Trump can't really do a bunch of quarantining or block everything at this point because it's already here.
[00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:19.833]  And we're already seeing a lot of deaths from pneumonia.
[00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:21.675]  And we know that.
[00:21:21.675 --> 00:21:25.537]  And so the question is then, what is the UN and what is China up to?
[00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:28.479]  I want to talk with Matt Bracken next segment.
[00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:29.780]  He's going to join us now on another subject.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:46.888]  About the breakdown of society, because he talks about this, and I've said this a lot, and I know he's absolutely right, and everything the globalists have done is about making the climate politically and economically and culturally perfect for a societal breakdown.
[00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:57.134]  We are soft, we are hand-to-mouth, we are absolutely domesticated compared to just a few generations ago.
[00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:58.315]  I'm not putting everybody down.
[00:21:58.315 --> 00:22:00.316]  I'm an idiot too.
[00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:06.104]  When it comes to the stuff that my grandfather, especially my dad's dad, could fix or do anything.
[00:22:06.104 --> 00:22:08.385]  And they were all into that, being able to do that.
[00:22:08.385 --> 00:22:10.025]  And they had fun doing it.
[00:22:10.025 --> 00:22:12.046]  And they knew how to do all sorts of stuff.
[00:22:12.046 --> 00:22:13.766]  And they were business people, too.
[00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:16.487]  You know, the Hank Williams Jr.
[00:22:16.487 --> 00:22:21.988]  song is, my dad taught me to live off the land and his dad taught him to be a businessman.
[00:22:21.988 --> 00:22:26.409]  But no, people, rural folks, farmers and people are business people, too.
[00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:29.470]  And just that common sense, street smarts, is gone.
[00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:31.516]  Compared to what it was.
[00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.978]  And it's scary how domesticated people are.
[00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:35.439]  As we'll talk about that with Matt Bracken next segment.
[00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:39.563]  But I wanted to get to this because we've got the horrible Adam Schiff up behind us.
[00:22:39.563 --> 00:22:40.444]  Very triggering to me.
[00:22:40.444 --> 00:22:42.065]  I got very... I'm not just kidding.
[00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:44.548]  I got very upset when I came in here and saw him.
[00:22:44.548 --> 00:22:46.349]  What is wrong with him?
[00:22:46.349 --> 00:22:48.211]  The crimes he's committed, the things he's done.
[00:22:48.211 --> 00:22:52.575]  And him and Jerry Nadler fighting over who can make the closing statements last night.
[00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:53.516]  We've got some video of that.
[00:22:54.196 --> 00:22:56.397]  And Trump, I believe, will get acquitted.
[00:22:56.397 --> 00:23:00.039]  I figured they'd have the votes for witnesses, but now it looks like they don't.
[00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:03.041]  We're going to follow that as it unfolds.
[00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:10.364]  John Roberts saying, oh, we can't read the name of the so-called whistleblower, Eric Shiromala.
[00:23:10.364 --> 00:23:11.965]  So now you can't face your accusers.
[00:23:11.965 --> 00:23:14.786]  I mean, this is getting out of control.
[00:23:14.786 --> 00:23:16.847]  Matt, so where do you see it going?
[00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:19.649]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:23.411]  I think it's a really great sign that it ended with disunity by the
[00:23:24.284 --> 00:23:26.025]  By Nadler and Schiff.
[00:23:26.025 --> 00:23:35.210]  You know, and you can tell that Nadler was trying to reign it in because he had blown it so badly in his last closing argument when he, you know, was accusing the Senators of treason.
[00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.671]  They didn't call for witnesses.
[00:23:37.671 --> 00:23:45.635]  But I think that a real wild card in this is Romney because Romney is not his own man.
[00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:47.596]  Romney is a CIA stooge.
[00:23:47.596 --> 00:23:49.537]  You know, they put him in.
[00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:51.578]  He's run by a guy named Kofor Black.
[00:23:52.253 --> 00:23:58.356]  Who is a close confidant of Brennan, who is actually still running the CIA from the outside.
[00:23:58.356 --> 00:24:07.041]  The top three at the CIA are all Brennan mentees, acolytes.
[00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:12.423]  People are still hoping if they can get rid of Trump or vote him out, the old order comes back in.
[00:24:12.423 --> 00:24:16.765]  You have to understand about the CIA, you're never ex-CIA at that level.
[00:24:16.765 --> 00:24:19.647]  So, Kofor Black is sort of the Rasputin.
[00:24:20.154 --> 00:24:22.035]  He's of Mitt Romney.
[00:24:22.035 --> 00:24:28.298]  So whatever Kofor Black and John Brennan tell Mitt Romney to do, that's what he's going to do.
[00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:30.539]  So he could actually flip the vote either way.
[00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:33.120]  He's not an ideological person like Collins.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.722]  She's confused and she's, you know, a dingbat.
[00:24:36.722 --> 00:24:40.964]  But Mitt Romney is going to strictly follow orders, and we don't know how he's going to fall down.
[00:24:40.964 --> 00:24:49.308]  Then the next thing is, if it is a 50-50 tie, and in this era, I mean, it always looks like we're on the cusp of amazing things.
[00:24:49.918 --> 00:24:50.178]  If it's
[00:25:01.747 --> 00:25:05.488]  If it looks like it'll benefit the Deep State to call witnesses, they will.
[00:25:05.488 --> 00:25:19.512]  And if they don't, if they're going to cut their losses because they're afraid that if they do call witnesses, this can drag out for months and turn into, you know, Eric Caramello being interviewed, Sean Misko, Abby Grace, both Vindman brothers.
[00:25:19.512 --> 00:25:25.814]  You know, this is a plot that's clearly hatched up in the National Security Council by the Obama holdovers.
[00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:31.356]  So, so, you know, if all of these people are called in to testify and they have to take the fifth,
[00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:37.049]  Then the Republican lawyers are going to just lay out the conspiracy around them.
[00:25:37.049 --> 00:25:39.511]  You know, if they take the fifth, that'll look terrible.
[00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:40.012]  How long?
[00:25:40.012 --> 00:25:42.874]  I've been trying to get a straight answer on this.
[00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:49.319]  How long until we find out if they're going to have that vote and whether he's going to get acquitted today or whether they're going to drag this into next week?
[00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:51.781]  I think it's going to go till tonight.
[00:25:51.781 --> 00:26:01.049]  Also, just for a moment, if you can indulge me, I want to give a shout out to the Appalachian Battalion of the Mossy Oak Militia.
[00:26:01.934 --> 00:26:08.755]  And this is our secret, one of our secret ritual recognition signs right here, okay?
[00:26:08.755 --> 00:26:10.796]  You can get a picture of that.
[00:26:10.796 --> 00:26:11.136]  Okay.
[00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:13.716]  This is the Mossy Oak Militia, okay?
[00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:18.037]  Anyway, I'm wearing, I happen to be wearing this today, so.
[00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:22.178]  Anyway, it's kind of an inside joke among people that like to shoot in the woods.
[00:26:22.178 --> 00:26:22.798]  I understand.
[00:26:22.798 --> 00:26:28.639]  But, yeah, anyway, haven't been doing enough a lot lately, but pretty much, you know, enough.
[00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:30.519]  I got brass all over the table.
[00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:33.917]  Reloading.
[00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:47.971]  But anyway, the vote comes tonight, and it's a poker game, and Justice Roberts is one of the potential kingmakers if it's a 50-50, and whichever way the deep state tells him to go, that's the way he's going to go.
[00:26:49.571 --> 00:26:53.072]  Well, it's certainly a big day today and we're going to be watching it all.
[00:26:53.072 --> 00:27:00.055]  In fact, I'll probably just end up staying up here late tonight and doing a special broadcast if I can get the crew in here because this is history happening right now.
[00:27:00.055 --> 00:27:07.859]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back and talk about this virus and why we've seen this unprecedented response.
[00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:18.320]  I know you want to get into the technicals of how dangerous it could be during a lockdown or similar things here and how riots would probably break out in many cities.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.882]  That's all been pre-programmed by the media and the culture.
[00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:25.205]  But from your own research, do you think it's man-made?
[00:27:25.205 --> 00:27:26.787]  Do you think it escaped from a lab?
[00:27:26.787 --> 00:27:28.568]  Do you think it's a natural mutation?
[00:27:28.568 --> 00:27:29.689]  Why is it being hyped up?
[00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:31.591]  I mean, gut level, what do you think this virus is?
[00:27:33.228 --> 00:27:44.174]  I think at a huge pandemic like this today, you know, it almost is a moot point, whether it's natural or man-made, because we'll never really know the truth.
[00:27:44.174 --> 00:27:47.456]  There's never going to be a record that comes out that everybody believes.
[00:27:47.456 --> 00:27:52.839]  You know, there's always going to be, you know, theories that are competing.
[00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:59.603]  So I would say, you know, sure, it could be snake to bat to man, or it could be, you know, the Canadian bio,
[00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:10.110]  Research lab to Wuhan biochem lab or research lab and then it gets out, you know, it infects somebody in the lab and they go home and it gets out that way.
[00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:28.517]  But I don't think we'll ever know definitively unless there is a chance if they can if they take this virus apart and they can see that there are spliced in sections that that that are absolutely impossible to have occurred in nature, you know, kind of like a Frankenstein virus then we might know.
[00:28:29.284 --> 00:28:31.466]  But that's way down the road.
[00:28:31.466 --> 00:28:39.812]  But the problem is the very same groups that are doing the testing are groups that have called for population control and have been caught in secret experimentation before.
[00:28:39.812 --> 00:28:41.594]  We're going to look at every angle of it.
[00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:45.857]  The UN has said it's a global emergency but doesn't want travel restricted.
[00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.999]  But most countries are restricting travel.
[00:28:47.999 --> 00:28:49.940]  So why hasn't Trump done that yet?
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.642]  We're going to answer that question as best we can on the other side.
[00:28:52.642 --> 00:28:53.163]  It's Friday.
[00:28:53.163 --> 00:28:53.983]  We're live.
[00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:54.404]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.396 --> 00:29:03.458]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:08.821]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:16.864]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[00:30:06.032 --> 00:30:11.335]  You gotta get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[00:30:11.335 --> 00:30:14.776]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[00:30:14.776 --> 00:30:21.979]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part of survival covered.
[00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:28.841]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever the case may be.
[00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:31.841]  The RZ air filtration mask, M2 mesh.
[00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:33.182]  I have one of those personally.
[00:30:33.182 --> 00:30:36.642]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[00:30:36.642 --> 00:30:37.563]  I am prepared.
[00:30:37.563 --> 00:30:37.903]  Are you?
[00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:40.923]  If you're not, InfoWarsStore.com on sale now.
[00:30:40.923 --> 00:30:43.644]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[00:30:43.644 --> 00:30:48.025]  It's not necessarily the disease, it's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[00:30:48.025 --> 00:30:51.646]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:56.162]  Food will be off the shelves, water won't be available, you might not even be able to leave your house.
[00:30:56.162 --> 00:30:57.928]  You gotta be prepared before it comes down.
[00:30:59.212 --> 00:31:08.494]  This time of year, I'm always promoting winter sun, our high quality organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[00:31:08.494 --> 00:31:25.318]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring, that people aren't getting sunlight, so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs, and then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:30.900]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:37.922]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter, and spring.
[00:31:37.922 --> 00:31:47.125]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off, $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price.
[00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:51.547]  Because I want you to get it, and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:58.772]  So, winner, son, taken under the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:23.368]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[00:32:23.368 --> 00:32:24.689]  The New World Order's real.
[00:32:24.689 --> 00:32:25.730]  Satanism's real.
[00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.091]  The pedophile elite are real.
[00:32:27.091 --> 00:32:30.914]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[00:32:30.914 --> 00:32:35.677]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:39.240]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.563]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[00:32:43.843 --> 00:32:46.204]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[00:32:46.204 --> 00:32:47.584]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:32:47.584 --> 00:32:50.546]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:57.668]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[00:32:57.668 --> 00:33:01.370]  So please take action.
[00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.249 --> 00:33:31.754]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:31.754 --> 00:33:38.100]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:51.852]  Matt Bracken is our guest, and I was listening to him yesterday talk about, during the fourth hour, how dangerous it would be to have a Great Depression today, or a Spanish Flu-type pandemic that killed between 30 and 50 million people.
[00:33:51.852 --> 00:33:52.692]  The numbers vary.
[00:33:53.817 --> 00:34:02.421]  And how criminals and other groups would definitely use that to have what you saw during the Los Angeles riots on a mass scale.
[00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:15.847]  And then if you try to have people shelter in place for weeks and weeks, like they're saying in Hunan and other areas, and welding people in to apartment buildings, that would just be a recipe for total collapse.
[00:34:15.847 --> 00:34:19.408]  You know, the Japanese had crime go down after Fukushima.
[00:34:19.408 --> 00:34:20.309]  They have almost no crime.
[00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:26.242]  Other than, you know, gang stuff, people fighting and, you know, some theft, but very low crime rate.
[00:34:26.242 --> 00:34:29.823]  It went down during the tsunami and the crisis.
[00:34:29.823 --> 00:34:30.663]  They came together.
[00:34:30.663 --> 00:34:35.725]  And there's a lot of great Americans, and we come together as well, but there's also a lot of wild folks that would take advantage of it.
[00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:39.246]  We'll talk about that with Matt Bracken, but a drudge siren, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:39.986 --> 00:34:51.634]  Just went up, we're linking it at Infowars.com, but DrugReport.com links to the New York Times, the same New York Times that worked with Bolton to make up lies about WMDs in Iraq.
[00:34:52.912 --> 00:34:53.753]  Well, they're back again.
[00:34:53.753 --> 00:35:04.240]  A known, certified liar that backed Trump's policy before with Ukraine and said Trump was doing great on Voice of America interviews he did, and said that they were fighting corruption in Ukraine.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:15.968]  Well, now he's got a book and millions of dollars, and the known, certified criminal liar, why the hell did Trump hire him, he warned him, is trying to sink Trump right now as they try to get witnesses, which will be Bolton.
[00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.109]  And all the rest of them.
[00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:21.072]  Trump told Bolton to help his Ukraine pressure campaign.
[00:35:21.072 --> 00:35:31.643]  Book says, oh, oh, he said, help Giuliani with his contacts and that Giuliani was looking into corruption.
[00:35:31.643 --> 00:35:35.767]  We've got Ezra Levant coming on, who shot the most incredible undercover video.
[00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.670]  I mean, it's like beyond a movie with Senior.
[00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:49.413]  Royal Mounted Police in suits and ties saying you're guilty, you're going to go to prison because you wrote a book about Justin Trudeau.
[00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:50.894]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:35:50.894 --> 00:35:51.795]  He's on next hour.
[00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:54.838]  And we've got such huge news right now.
[00:35:56.021 --> 00:35:57.743]  But this is big.
[00:35:57.743 --> 00:36:00.886]  They're saying, arrest Rand Paul, arrest me.
[00:36:00.886 --> 00:36:02.427]  Don't say Eric Siromala.
[00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:03.989]  You can't face your accuser.
[00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:06.912]  And they tell him, they go, oh, who made the complaint about your book?
[00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:08.053]  It's secret.
[00:36:08.053 --> 00:36:09.935]  But you criticized Trudeau during an election.
[00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:11.196]  He goes, that's totally legal.
[00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:12.698]  He reads them the law.
[00:36:12.698 --> 00:36:13.579]  They go, no, it's not.
[00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:18.746]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:22.809]  So there's such tyranny, such authoritarianism taking place.
[00:36:22.809 --> 00:36:24.891]  And I'm reading this New York Times article.
[00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:34.219]  Mr. Trump told Bolton to call the President, who had recently won election as President of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a trip to Ukraine.
[00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:37.761]  So the President wanted his lawyer to meet with someone.
[00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:41.364]  My, I've never heard of such... The crime is this.
[00:36:42.435 --> 00:36:53.962]  The Obama, Biden, Soros, Schiff, Bolton, Pelosi, Kerry, Romney, Clinton, they all used the billions a year going into Ukraine since the Cold War and after to launder the money back to themselves.
[00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:56.004]  It's the watering hole.
[00:36:56.004 --> 00:36:57.024]  People always talk about how the U.S.
[00:36:57.024 --> 00:36:58.946]  sends aid to Israel that comes back.
[00:36:58.946 --> 00:36:59.706]  Absolutely.
[00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:00.487]  I don't like it.
[00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:02.328]  I'm not anti-Israel, but that's corrupt and wrong.
[00:37:03.749 --> 00:37:08.515]  The amount of money sent into Ukraine is even more than Israel.
[00:37:08.515 --> 00:37:12.480]  And that's the watering hole of these people, and that's why they're so pissed.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.946]  And so our president is indicted in a trial, will be removed right now, because Bolton
[00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:22.847]  This is a death match because Charimella is just a symptom.
[00:37:22.847 --> 00:37:24.488]  Charimella went on the airplane at least once
[00:37:45.367 --> 00:37:52.853]  With Joe Biden to visit Ukraine while Hunter was on the board of Burisma making, you know, a million a year.
[00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:56.115]  So, Charum Mela has a stake in this.
[00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:59.037]  If Biden goes down, Charum Mela goes down with him.
[00:37:59.037 --> 00:38:04.061]  So, they've been trying to come up with a way after the collapse of the Russian collusion hoax.
[00:38:04.061 --> 00:38:13.468]  You know, the Ukraine thing is just another attempt to throw the dogs off the trail by doing a preemptive strike against Trump.
[00:38:13.468 --> 00:38:14.809]  Put Trump on the defensive.
[00:38:15.313 --> 00:38:23.278]  Instead of them having to answer for, you know, what did Sharmilla know about all the dirty corrupt dealings that the Bidens were doing in Ukraine?
[00:38:23.278 --> 00:38:24.939]  I mean, it's preemptive.
[00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:27.141]  It's like a backfire.
[00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:30.223]  I just want to ask a question for people watching them on the TV screen right now.
[00:38:30.223 --> 00:38:33.765]  Would anyone let any of those people babysit your children?
[00:38:33.765 --> 00:38:36.207]  Would you let Brennan get anywhere near you?
[00:38:36.207 --> 00:38:36.948]  Biden?
[00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:37.228]  Schiff?
[00:38:38.484 --> 00:38:42.126]  Strzok, Sirmala, Misko, Vitamin.
[00:38:42.126 --> 00:38:45.348]  Vitamin looks like just a raving lunatic.
[00:38:45.348 --> 00:38:46.048]  What the hell?
[00:38:46.048 --> 00:38:47.769]  Clinesmith.
[00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:48.830]  Look at Chalupa.
[00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.312]  By the way, we were exposing Chalupa three years ago.
[00:38:51.312 --> 00:38:54.593]  And these people are sick.
[00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:58.216]  Yeah, and some of them are still on the National Security Council.
[00:38:58.216 --> 00:39:02.138]  So, Trump, you asked a few minutes ago, why did Trump hire Bolton?
[00:39:02.754 --> 00:39:15.269]  One of the most effective weapons that the deep state used against Trump from his election on was to warn national experts, subject matter experts, do not work for Trump.
[00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:19.314]  If you work for Trump, you'll be blackballed from elite society.
[00:39:19.764 --> 00:39:26.106]  So he had to take what was left over, and Bolton was definitely a retread leftover.
[00:39:26.106 --> 00:39:32.549]  That's why he wound up with people like Papadopoulos, who's way smarter than they thought he was.
[00:39:32.549 --> 00:39:39.271]  But a guy like Papadopoulos was a lightweight, obviously, to be considered as one of Trump's foreign policy experts.
[00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:45.379]  It just makes the point that Trump was being starved of any, you know, legit leaders.
[00:39:45.379 --> 00:39:49.884]  He wound up bringing poison pills aboard, like McMaster.
[00:39:49.884 --> 00:39:51.546]  You know, McMaster... Exactly.
[00:39:51.546 --> 00:39:54.749]  All the mid-level, even high-level, that might have been good were threatened off of him.
[00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.972]  Everybody gets targeted, harassed.
[00:39:56.972 --> 00:39:59.234]  Anybody that gives the president good advice comes under attack.
[00:39:59.234 --> 00:40:01.516]  They didn't want our guest or info getting the president.
[00:40:01.516 --> 00:40:02.717]  That's been all the news.
[00:40:02.717 --> 00:40:05.280]  And so, but then like, oh, but these people will help.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.962]  And then they were establishment.
[00:40:06.962 --> 00:40:08.263]  They were authorized.
[00:40:08.263 --> 00:40:11.987]  They came and pledged allegiance to Trump, but really were stabbing him in the back the whole time.
[00:40:12.887 --> 00:40:28.356]  Stabbing him in the back, and Bolton, McMaster, others like that, they're overtly backstabbing him now, but even during their tenure, they were helping people like Vindman and Caramella with their leaks against Trump.
[00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:37.362]  So Trump has been, for all that he's done, imagine what he could have done if he wasn't hip deep in Cobras and Vipers.
[00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:39.362]  Which is what he's had to deal with.
[00:40:39.362 --> 00:40:46.329]  So he's, you know, got the Democrat enemy out in front of him and he's got all these backstabbing lying rhinos behind him.
[00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:48.090]  But don't they get the optics?
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:52.595]  Everyone hears the president's in trouble for going after corruption.
[00:40:52.595 --> 00:40:58.400]  And then Hillary was using Russians and millions of dollars to create a fake trail on Trump.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.141]  Everything they say Trump did, they did.
[00:41:00.141 --> 00:41:02.604]  I mean, this has really backfired on them in a massive way.
[00:41:03.553 --> 00:41:04.474]  I hope so.
[00:41:04.474 --> 00:41:07.576]  I hope it comes out in the election.
[00:41:07.576 --> 00:41:15.281]  I'd make a comparison between Brexit and then, you know, the resistance of the British elites dragging it out, refusing to go along.
[00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:16.922]  That backfired.
[00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:19.804]  And then Bojo gets elected in a landslide.
[00:41:19.804 --> 00:41:23.967]  And it's not that the Tories are great, but the Labour got punished.
[00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:27.929]  And I see the initial election of Trump being like Brexit.
[00:41:27.929 --> 00:41:29.530]  Hey, we voted for our guy.
[00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.453]  And then he's just resisted and fought every step, backstabbed.
[00:41:33.877 --> 00:41:41.681]  And in November, I think a lot of Democrats are going to come out and vote against the Democrat Party, just like they slammed Labor.
[00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:42.841]  And that's what Trump needs.
[00:41:42.841 --> 00:41:48.544]  Trump needs to have the Senate, the House, you know, and the Executive with loyal people by next year.
[00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:51.166]  Hopefully no more of these... We need a total refugiation.
[00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.867]  And I said this when they passed Brexit four-plus years ago.
[00:41:53.867 --> 00:42:00.110]  I said, they're going to fight it for years, they're going to drag it out, but then it's going to blow up in their face and cause even bigger rebellion.
[00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:02.951]  Exactly.
[00:42:02.951 --> 00:42:04.552]  I see the exact same pattern here.
[00:42:04.552 --> 00:42:07.452]  When we come back, though, let's talk about flying the ointment.
[00:42:07.452 --> 00:42:08.253]  This virus.
[00:42:08.253 --> 00:42:12.253]  Why the UN is supporting China and their draconian measures.
[00:42:12.253 --> 00:42:18.615]  What would happen here if they tried to quarantine cities the size of Wuhan that don't even exist in this country?
[00:42:18.615 --> 00:42:21.216]  I mean, that one city is bigger than any city we've got.
[00:42:21.216 --> 00:42:22.016]  Bigger than New York.
[00:42:22.016 --> 00:42:23.116]  Bigger than L.A.
[00:42:23.116 --> 00:42:24.316]  Matt Bracken is our guest.
[00:42:24.316 --> 00:42:25.517]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:25.517 --> 00:42:26.077]  By the way, listeners,
[00:42:26.937 --> 00:42:28.978]  We'll track all this as it unfolds.
[00:42:28.978 --> 00:42:30.920]  I intend to open the phones up later as well.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.621]  I wouldn't even have a guest on like Ezra Loran.
[00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:34.222]  He's a great guy.
[00:42:34.222 --> 00:42:35.143]  Dearing news like this.
[00:42:35.143 --> 00:42:37.304]  But what happened to him is so crazy.
[00:42:37.304 --> 00:42:38.665]  Because he's got a hidden camera.
[00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:40.206]  And they're like, you're guilty.
[00:42:40.206 --> 00:42:42.087]  You wrote a book criticizing Trudeau.
[00:42:42.087 --> 00:42:44.269]  You just want to come clean with that?
[00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:46.150]  And he just tears the hell out of them.
[00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.392]  That's videos on Infowars.com as well.
[00:42:48.392 --> 00:42:55.877]  We're going to come back and talk about the time bomb that is the leftist cities, the blue droppings across the red landscape of America.

[00:45:03.156 --> 00:45:05.297]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:45:05.297 --> 00:45:07.758]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[00:45:07.758 --> 00:45:21.223]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[00:45:21.863 --> 00:45:21.943]  Yes.
[00:45:38.306 --> 00:45:43.310]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:50.996]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[00:45:50.996 --> 00:45:52.177]  It's amazing.

[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.141]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:00.118]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:46:00.118 --> 00:46:06.405]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[00:46:06.405 --> 00:46:17.217]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[00:46:18.223 --> 00:46:19.964]  The adult or the children's.
[00:46:19.964 --> 00:46:23.527]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[00:46:23.527 --> 00:46:24.428]  People love it.
[00:46:24.428 --> 00:46:32.554]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[00:46:33.314 --> 00:46:36.075]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[00:46:36.075 --> 00:46:38.796]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.617]  This is all proven.
[00:46:39.617 --> 00:46:41.157]  You can make claims with this.
[00:46:41.157 --> 00:46:52.342]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.702]  So, we're really proud of it.
[00:46:53.702 --> 00:46:54.622]  It funds the operation.
[00:46:54.622 --> 00:46:56.343]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:56.343 --> 00:46:57.984]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you!
[00:47:02.412 --> 00:47:14.095]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.095 --> 00:47:16.376]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:17.936]  Matt Bracken's our guest.
[00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:23.798]  I keep trying to get to the main reason I had him on, the coronavirus, but things keep breaking and this just broke.
[00:47:23.798 --> 00:47:28.199]  Mar-a-Lago gate crashed, shots fired.
[00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:29.919]  That's being reported by WSVN 7 News.
[00:47:32.955 --> 00:47:37.919]  Had someone try to ram through and shots fired.
[00:47:37.919 --> 00:47:42.782]  There have been an incident in Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's property in Palm Beach, or his winter White House.
[00:47:42.782 --> 00:47:47.126]  Florida, according to a local news report involving gate crashing and shots being fired.
[00:47:47.126 --> 00:47:54.711]  WSVN News 7 reported the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office sources said there was an incident at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.
[00:47:54.711 --> 00:47:56.713]  It just happened 30 minutes ago.
[00:47:56.713 --> 00:48:00.015]  Someone ran the northern checkpoint near the property.
[00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:02.237]  The deputies fired at this person.
[00:48:02.237 --> 00:48:07.660]  The journalist said on the air, Secret Service officials have fired at the person as well.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.023]  The person, who is sourced to believe is a woman, was still able to get away.
[00:48:12.023 --> 00:48:18.327]  Officials are saying the person ran from the scene and is still out there.
[00:48:18.327 --> 00:48:22.690]  And it's just somebody off their medication.
[00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.491]  That's happened before.
[00:48:25.433 --> 00:48:29.136]  Or is it a psycho trying to kill the president or trying to attack him?
[00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:32.339]  I mean, I physically have had people, you've seen it, attack me.
[00:48:32.339 --> 00:48:33.881]  So a Fox News host, everybody.
[00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:38.625]  Tucker Carlson's basically moved to Maine.
[00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:40.286]  It's serious.
[00:48:40.286 --> 00:48:47.593]  And as Trump doesn't get convicted in the Senate, as he wins re-election, we hope, and it looks like that's where we're going with 276 days out,
[00:48:49.457 --> 00:48:54.038]  That's what they taught with Hillary as well, so it's classic to be overconfident.
[00:48:54.038 --> 00:48:58.680]  They're going to get more aggressive, more radical, more out of control.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.841]  What do you make of this, Matt Bracken?
[00:49:01.841 --> 00:49:06.862]  I think it's an indicator of what I call the social boiling point.
[00:49:06.862 --> 00:49:17.005]  You know, the social temperature is rising and people who are emotionally labile, they become more and more easily triggered.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:22.802]  And I can tie this to the coronavirus thing in this sense.
[00:49:22.802 --> 00:49:28.443]  When I talk about, you know, cities imploding, I'm not saying it's because of a pandemic.
[00:49:28.443 --> 00:49:37.166]  It's just almost anything that would disrupt the modern infrastructure can lead to a total implosion of our cities.
[00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:44.448]  You mentioned before, you know, China, they're very docile, and Japan, they also follow orders, kind of more like America in 1918 during the Spanish flu.
[00:49:46.596 --> 00:50:02.882]  When you look at the pictures from the Spanish flu era of just, you know, hundreds of cots lined up with people that are dying in cots that are just like, you know, a couple feet apart, all up and down in barracks and hangers.
[00:50:02.882 --> 00:50:04.222]  They didn't panic and freak out.
[00:50:04.222 --> 00:50:08.504]  You know, the overall American social temperature was low there.
[00:50:08.504 --> 00:50:11.505]  Americans were very, very stoic in the old Roman sense.
[00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:15.052]  Very stoic, and there was unity.
[00:50:15.052 --> 00:50:16.833]  There was a war, so there was censorship.
[00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:20.857]  There were no alternate theories about things.
[00:50:20.857 --> 00:50:26.441]  But if you can put it in water terms, or human terms, we're 98.6 and water boils at 212.
[00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.282]  Let's say that in 1918, or maybe in Japan today,
[00:50:32.694 --> 00:50:35.195]  The social temperature is fairly low.
[00:50:35.195 --> 00:50:40.917]  So when you throw in something like a 50 degree raise, they can compensate and deal with it.
[00:50:40.917 --> 00:50:46.059]  Like the Fukushima reactor meltdown, people didn't even loot stores.
[00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:55.723]  But in the United States, we're so close to the boiling point that you throw a 50 degree raise in and the pot boils all over the kitchen.
[00:50:55.723 --> 00:50:57.744]  And once that happens, all bets are off.
[00:50:57.744 --> 00:50:59.985]  Because what we saw in the Spanish flu,
[00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:07.158]  In some cities, like in Philadelphia, it came right to the edge of total societal collapse.
[00:51:07.158 --> 00:51:16.963]  And that's in the religious, unified, social harmony compared to today of that era.
[00:51:16.963 --> 00:51:20.045]  And it almost came close to a collapse.
[00:51:20.045 --> 00:51:28.569]  So I would say that as far as the coronavirus goes, as long as the mortality rate is 2 or 3 percent, I think we can weather it.
[00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:29.430]  It's out.
[00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.250]  It's going to spread.
[00:51:30.728 --> 00:51:30.868]  What's
[00:51:50.561 --> 00:51:57.545]  And it's much worse in urban areas and compact areas like military bases, on troop ships, things like that.
[00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:01.928]  It just spreads like a nuclear bomb, you know, like a chain reaction.
[00:52:01.928 --> 00:52:07.071]  When you have a 10 or a 20% mortality rate, there are not enough gravediggers.
[00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:09.553]  There are not enough, you know, the doctors are all sick.
[00:52:10.183 --> 00:52:15.226]  And everything just, you know, the disease runs wild, but there's nowhere to bury them.
[00:52:15.226 --> 00:52:17.047]  There's nobody to bury them.
[00:52:17.047 --> 00:52:18.727]  The food supply stops.
[00:52:18.727 --> 00:52:22.730]  We got to the border of that with the Spanish flu in 1918.
[00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:32.174]  But if it happened today, it might not take as much because of a mortality rate, because our society is so close to already boiling over.
[00:52:32.174 --> 00:52:35.016]  You know, in Jacksonville, near where I live,
[00:52:35.436 --> 00:52:42.802]  There are stores now, you can imagine, that have a policy they do not allow more than five people in the dollar store.
[00:52:42.802 --> 00:52:46.025]  Because crowds of kids come in and just loot the place every day.
[00:52:46.025 --> 00:52:48.967]  You know, this is nothing like America of 1918.
[00:52:50.669 --> 00:52:55.132]  You know, we're already at that flash mob, you know, ready to go crazy.
[00:52:55.132 --> 00:52:56.893]  People aren't self-sufficient.
[00:52:56.893 --> 00:52:59.894]  A lot of people feel entitled.
[00:52:59.894 --> 00:53:02.576]  Everywhere the news is white people are inherently bad.
[00:53:02.576 --> 00:53:11.121]  By the way, most minorities are really nice, cool people, but it's weird white people trying to program them to attack whites, to further destabilize things during a crisis.
[00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:16.724]  I mean, this is being done by design in a giant cloward and pivot on steroid strategy.
[00:53:16.724 --> 00:53:18.805]  Yes, and Alex, you mentioned race.
[00:53:19.648 --> 00:53:28.099]  Nobody in 1918 would have thought that this was a bioengineered weapon designed to wipe out this or that race.
[00:53:28.099 --> 00:53:36.209]  But you can bet that there will be every kind of rumor or theory that this is a racially engineered bioweapon.
[00:53:36.209 --> 00:53:37.551]  And even if that doesn't happen,
[00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:48.656]  Poorer people, minorities, will feel like, oh, they'll be told, they'll hear rumors that all the supplies are going to the rich white neighborhoods and we're getting nothing.
[00:53:48.656 --> 00:53:59.441]  Oh, you know the Democratic Party on the left, Obama got caught in Kenya with his cousin, also in Egypt, but also here with the whole Trayvon Martin thing they kicked off.
[00:53:59.441 --> 00:54:01.102]  It's not about who's right or wrong.
[00:54:01.102 --> 00:54:02.743]  It came out, as you know, in documents.
[00:54:02.743 --> 00:54:06.605]  They were trying to foment a race war and literally trying to get us all to kill each other.
[00:54:06.605 --> 00:54:07.286]  It didn't work, Vin.
[00:54:08.226 --> 00:54:15.368]  You know, if there is a regular virus or a contrived virus, whatever it is, the deep state is going to try to use it against Trump and against America.
[00:54:15.368 --> 00:54:21.909]  And I think that's why Trump's been so restrained in not having countermeasures, because he doesn't want to add to the hysteria.
[00:54:21.909 --> 00:54:24.970]  I'm not saying that's a good or a bad thing, but what do you think, Matt?
[00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:33.852]  Well, if it stays within that, like, two to three percent mortality rate, then no matter how, it spreads great.
[00:54:33.852 --> 00:54:35.773]  I mean, it's not as bad as measles.
[00:54:36.286 --> 00:54:43.150]  Measles can float in the air like in an airport for hundreds of feet and land on a surface and infect you long after.
[00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:49.774]  But this is not as deadly as the SARS virus, but it spreads a lot more.
[00:54:49.774 --> 00:54:56.038]  But if it stays at a 2%, we can ride it out as long as the social cohesion holds.
[00:54:56.038 --> 00:54:56.818]  If it gets up 5, 8, 10%,
[00:54:58.809 --> 00:55:06.372]  I think all bets are off because it'll start affecting the transportation infrastructure if supermarkets don't get resupplied with food.
[00:55:06.372 --> 00:55:06.692]  Stay there.
[00:55:06.692 --> 00:55:07.573]  I've got to go to break.
[00:55:07.573 --> 00:55:14.295]  We've got Ezra Lamont coming up and a lot more and we're following the Senate trial and all this new Bolton stuff and shots fired at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:55:14.295 --> 00:55:16.136]  But we're getting more on that when we come back.
[00:55:16.136 --> 00:55:18.037]  But we've got more coming in right now.
[00:55:18.037 --> 00:55:18.917]  Stay right there.
[00:55:18.917 --> 00:55:19.397]  Matt Bracken.
[00:55:19.397 --> 00:55:20.318]  Do a little bit more time with us.
[00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:21.898]  NBSFireDomestic.com.
[00:55:21.898 --> 00:55:22.559]  By the way, listeners.
[00:55:23.499 --> 00:55:29.567]  I'm here saying get vitamin D3 with vitamin K to help fight off viruses and bacteria before this hit.
[00:55:29.567 --> 00:55:33.232]  We have the best products about to sell out and that's Winter Sun.
[00:55:33.232 --> 00:55:37.577]  We also have something nobody else has, patented nano silver that
[00:55:38.817 --> 00:55:39.417]  It's what the U.S.
[00:55:39.417 --> 00:55:41.399]  military uses, and I don't even have time to get into all this.
[00:55:41.399 --> 00:55:42.119]  I showed it to you yesterday.
[00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:46.262]  I mean, this is congressional restricted documents.
[00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:49.044]  Where do you think I get the stuff we sell, okay?
[00:55:49.044 --> 00:55:50.505]  And we don't play games, all right?
[00:55:50.505 --> 00:55:51.846]  I go out to get the best.
[00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:53.967]  And a lot of times, the best are our listeners.
[00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:56.149]  So we are the only people that can private label this.
[00:55:56.149 --> 00:55:58.790]  But this is a product my dad developed with them.
[00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.072]  And next hour, I'm going to spend five minutes on this, because it's important.
[00:56:01.072 --> 00:56:03.453]  I'm going to show you the company and who they are, because they don't care.
[00:56:03.453 --> 00:56:07.476]  I've always left our private labelers alone, because I don't want to get harassed.
[00:56:07.476 --> 00:56:08.197]  These people are patriots.
[00:56:08.197 --> 00:56:08.597]  They don't care.
[00:56:09.518 --> 00:56:10.199]  No, tell them.
[00:56:10.199 --> 00:56:11.821]  In fact, here's some documents.
[00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:13.923]  We just got authorized by Congress to show these.
[00:56:13.923 --> 00:56:15.105]  From a congressman.
[00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:18.669]  So, this is all going down right here, folks.
[00:56:18.669 --> 00:56:22.354]  So we've got it, and it's going to sell out at current sales rates by the middle of next week.
[00:56:24.056 --> 00:56:26.577]  Everybody else would go to full retail on this for jack of the price.
[00:56:26.577 --> 00:56:27.757]  Not us.
[00:56:27.757 --> 00:56:28.857]  Not us.
[00:56:28.857 --> 00:56:29.317]  Not us.
[00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:30.937]  It's 40% off right now.
[00:56:30.937 --> 00:56:34.418]  Infowarstore.com because I want you to get it.
[00:56:34.418 --> 00:56:35.498]  I want you to have it.
[00:56:35.498 --> 00:56:38.679]  And please don't forget, we have the very best storable food.
[00:56:38.679 --> 00:56:41.500]  And at the price, you can pay, again, a lot more, get something that tastes better.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.400]  But people really like this.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.900]  It's high quality.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.481]  I go out and get the best sponsors so you like it and want to reorder it.
[00:56:47.481 --> 00:56:52.022]  And so if there's ever a giant spike in demand, they can actually supply it.
[00:56:53.266 --> 00:56:54.547]  This isn't my first rodeo!
[00:56:54.547 --> 00:57:00.252]  So I've had these folks for almost 12 years, and they're probably the largest food company in the U.S.
[00:57:00.252 --> 00:57:00.592]  now.
[00:57:00.592 --> 00:57:07.217]  They're the top three uncontested, and it just, it's drop-shipped from them.
[00:57:07.217 --> 00:57:08.458]  They're in our computer system.
[00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.480]  We have a partnership with them, and it just goes right out to you.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.902]  7 to 10 days.
[00:57:12.902 --> 00:57:15.684]  They have the food, but they're 24 hours a day packing it.
[00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:16.584]  So it's super fresh.
[00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:17.725]  Last 25 years.
[00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:18.646]  It's in great containers.
[00:57:18.646 --> 00:57:19.587]  It's My Patriot Supply.
[00:57:19.987 --> 00:57:21.308]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:21.308 --> 00:57:26.051]  The full catalog, the very best specials you can get on their line of food.
[00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:27.291]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:27.291 --> 00:57:32.614]  And the fact that government's buying it all up, they're one of the only companies that wouldn't sell it to FEMA and this other government agency.
[00:57:32.614 --> 00:57:35.636]  And I'm going to interview the CEO of the company in the fourth hour.
[00:57:35.636 --> 00:57:38.397]  InfowarStore.com and your purchase funds the Infowar.
[00:57:38.397 --> 00:57:39.638]  And it's insurance you can eat.
[00:57:39.638 --> 00:57:43.540]  The only way you fail is not taking action and protecting yourself and your family.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.401]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:47.853 --> 00:57:55.560]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China, and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:04.988]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries, and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States West Coast.
[00:58:04.988 --> 00:58:10.053]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out.
[00:58:10.413 --> 00:58:14.215]  of supplies of affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[00:58:14.215 --> 00:58:14.655]  That's right.
[00:58:14.655 --> 00:58:19.937]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[00:58:19.937 --> 00:58:25.719]  Infowars, private labels from MyPatriotSupply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:33.002]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks, and that people need to order now.
[00:58:33.002 --> 00:58:35.863]  They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[00:58:35.863 --> 00:58:35.923]  But
[00:58:36.463 --> 00:58:38.666]  If people wait, it may end up being longer.
[00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:46.017]  But if you get your order in now at InfoWarStore.com, you will be secured to get the food within 7 to 10 days.
[00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:59.170]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:05.176]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:06.998]  But it's true.
[00:59:06.998 --> 00:59:09.541]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[00:59:10.161 --> 00:59:21.651]  That's why, Kodrac is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:29.818]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump, will also be targeted by Kodrac in the future.
[00:59:31.932 --> 00:59:45.920]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.100]  Ha ha!
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:51.903]  Hail Cobra!
[00:59:51.903 --> 00:59:54.565]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:04.823]  Let's just dispense with even the intro.
[01:00:04.823 --> 01:00:06.945]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:00:06.945 --> 01:00:10.047]  Matt Bracken, during the short break, is shaking his head.
[01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:11.288]  We have him on the show a lot.
[01:00:11.288 --> 01:00:12.528]  He's a great contributor.
[01:00:12.528 --> 01:00:15.050]  I never seen him do that.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:15.651]  What's breaking?
[01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:16.751]  What are you seeing now?
[01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:19.373]  We have breaking shots fired outside Mar-a-Lago.
[01:00:19.373 --> 01:00:21.374]  Somebody reportedly tried to crash through the gate.
[01:00:21.374 --> 01:00:22.695]  The Secret Service and police shot him.
[01:00:22.695 --> 01:00:23.356]  They got away.
[01:00:23.356 --> 01:00:25.177]  I mean, what the hell's going on?
[01:00:25.177 --> 01:00:26.197]  Here's the headline.
[01:00:26.197 --> 01:00:27.959]  Mar-a-Lago gate crash shots fired.
[01:00:27.959 --> 01:00:31.061]  Bolton's dropped a bunch of little new propaganda
[01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.242]  Poodle bombs.
[01:00:33.242 --> 01:00:35.544]  And they're acting like it's the end of the world there.
[01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:37.365]  Will the president be acquitted today?
[01:00:37.365 --> 01:00:39.747]  We're going to be covering more of this when we come back.
[01:00:39.747 --> 01:00:42.309]  We've got the video of what happened at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:43.910]  So we'll have some of that next segment.
[01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:48.554]  But in closing, breakdown of society.
[01:00:48.554 --> 01:00:50.015]  Why do you think the drill is so big?
[01:00:50.015 --> 01:00:52.156]  Why are they acting like the virus is so deadly?
[01:00:52.156 --> 01:00:55.058]  Why do you think Trump's responded this way?
[01:00:55.058 --> 01:00:55.639]  Other key points.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.322]  So far, the disease does not appear to be that deadly.
[01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:03.503]  Not that we can trust any figures coming out of China.
[01:01:03.503 --> 01:01:05.985]  So, there could be a cover-up going on.
[01:01:05.985 --> 01:01:14.629]  Once it gets into other countries, like Italy, this cruise ship, if this has a high mortality rate, then they'll be dragging bodies off that cruise ship like you can't believe.
[01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.270]  That's right.
[01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.231]  They won't be able to cover it up long.
[01:01:17.231 --> 01:01:17.951]  No way.
[01:01:17.951 --> 01:01:19.752]  I was smiling during the break.
[01:01:19.752 --> 01:01:21.313]  I was listening to Cobra.
[01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:26.627]  And it occurred to me that if, if, um, for, you know, if they managed to complete the shutdown... Cobra!
[01:01:26.627 --> 01:01:28.408]  You're listening to Cobra.
[01:01:28.408 --> 01:01:29.949]  Good, Matt.
[01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:38.716]  I could have a good job for you at a partnership at Cobra Industries with my good friend Destro and Baroness.
[01:01:38.716 --> 01:01:43.459]  Alex, you and Owen, you and Owen can make a complete side living.
[01:01:43.459 --> 01:01:44.180]  Maybe better.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.121]  Hollywood.
[01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:47.683]  You and Owen doing voiceovers.
[01:01:47.683 --> 01:01:48.063]  That's it.
[01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:49.333]  That's it.
[01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:51.876]  You can shut down the store and fund it off of voiceovers.
[01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:56.262]  Hey, you know, I'm not bragging, but I was actually on the road to being like a top voiceover guy.
[01:01:56.262 --> 01:02:02.069]  I mean, I was voicing major trailers, stuff for films, TV ads, insurance company commercials.
[01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:04.953]  But as soon as it went, wait a minute, you're the Alex Jones criticizing Obama.
[01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:06.673]  Right when Obama got in.
[01:02:06.673 --> 01:02:08.254]  I mean, I made, one year, $890,000.
[01:02:08.254 --> 01:02:14.975]  Because I was in the half-tart, you know, the whole Screen Actors Guild whole deal for voiceovers.
[01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:16.355]  And so, it would go through that.
[01:02:16.355 --> 01:02:19.315]  And a lot of this place got built on voiceover money.
[01:02:19.315 --> 01:02:20.256]  But that's what happened.
[01:02:20.256 --> 01:02:24.836]  As soon as I criticized Obama, like a spigot, the jobs went off.
[01:02:24.836 --> 01:02:26.157]  So, yeah.
[01:02:26.157 --> 01:02:29.837]  I had no idea, but it absolutely does not surprise me.
[01:02:29.837 --> 01:02:31.518]  Does not surprise me.
[01:02:31.518 --> 01:02:33.498]  And you and Owen, together, I mean, goodness.
[01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:33.998]  He's good, too.
[01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.372]  Yeah, and he can sing too.
[01:02:37.372 --> 01:02:47.517]  But as far as this virus, it's kind of a good test for maybe, unless it mutates, I think we can ride this one out, unless it mutates to a higher mortality rate.
[01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:51.539]  At 2 or 3 percent, a society can ride it out.
[01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:55.182]  It's not like Ebola just wiping, nuking entire villages.
[01:02:55.182 --> 01:02:57.043]  But this one will spread.
[01:02:57.043 --> 01:03:00.104]  You know, there's sort of a thing, there's like a paradigm.
[01:03:00.104 --> 01:03:03.066]  You have lethality versus mobility.
[01:03:03.496 --> 01:03:08.698]  This one has great mobility and transmissibility, but not high lethality.
[01:03:08.698 --> 01:03:12.740]  If it mutates to a higher lethality, then all bets are off.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.121]  But for now, I think we can just afford to study it.
[01:03:17.121 --> 01:03:20.042]  And I'm glad that Trump hasn't hit the panic button on it.
[01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.423]  There's something I wanted to say before.
[01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.064]  The whole anti-vaxxing thing.
[01:03:25.299 --> 01:03:35.490]  If there was a big pandemic, you can bet that they would outlaw talking about vaccines except to say, you know, salute and take your vaccine.
[01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:38.853]  They would call it national security, a national emergency.
[01:03:38.853 --> 01:03:40.235]  That's why I think this may be staged.
[01:03:40.235 --> 01:03:45.881]  For six months, there's been a total war on people even questioning vaccine efficacy, and there's been a total shutdown.
[01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:52.887]  And if there's a real pandemic and people are really frightened, it'll be like 9-11 bringing in the Patriot Act.
[01:03:52.887 --> 01:04:01.389]  If you want to get rid of the First Amendment, you need to get people to think there's something so bad that we just can't allow people to say, don't take a vaccine.
[01:04:01.389 --> 01:04:05.430]  Even, let's just hypothetically say, they created the greatest vaccine in the world.
[01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:08.031]  It was 100% effective and no risk.
[01:04:08.031 --> 01:04:09.551]  There are going to be people that doubt it.
[01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:16.293]  Well, they'll just say, you may not doubt it because of the national... Well, there's also like Orthodox Jews and people that's against their religion.
[01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:17.843]  Right.
[01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:26.789]  And in World War I, they arrested thousands of people for just slightly hinting that the war was wrong in the teens.
[01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:31.272]  So we have a history in this country like Alien and Sedition Act.
[01:04:31.272 --> 01:04:34.234]  We have a history of doing this.
[01:04:34.234 --> 01:04:36.075]  Matt Bracken, thank you so much for the time.
[01:04:36.075 --> 01:04:37.356]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:04:37.356 --> 01:04:38.497]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:39.990]  Thank you.
[01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:44.914]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to cover the latest breaking news in Mar-a-Lago, the latest on the virus.
[01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:56.964]  And this is a short little special report by Greg Reese on this Chinese city, where this all started, is the first testbed for 5G and 6G.
[01:04:56.964 --> 01:05:02.568]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week.
[01:05:02.568 --> 01:05:05.190]  And that's Ultimate Fish Oil for
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.181]  33% off.
[01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:09.002]  It's amazing.
[01:05:09.002 --> 01:05:10.542]  Go check it out for yourself.
[01:05:10.542 --> 01:05:18.987]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[01:05:18.987 --> 01:05:21.188]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:26.071]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:28.453]  So just check it out for yourself.
[01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:28.973]  40% off.

[01:05:30.294 --> 01:05:31.214]  And it funds the M4.
[01:05:31.214 --> 01:05:32.415]  And then Vitamin
[01:05:32.975 --> 01:05:35.836]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[01:05:35.836 --> 01:05:37.097]  Super high quality.
[01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:38.157]  Winter sun.
[01:05:38.157 --> 01:05:39.958]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:42.599]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:43.859]  That's why people get so sick.
[01:05:43.859 --> 01:05:44.659]  That's the main reason.
[01:05:44.659 --> 01:05:46.920]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.781]  Get higher absorption.
[01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:48.641]  It's amazing.
[01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:53.403]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarStore.com.
[01:05:53.403 --> 01:05:55.143]  Protect yourself and fund the Infowar.

[01:06:03.137 --> 01:06:15.806]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:19.508]  There are strange facts surrounding the coronavirus outbreak of 2020.
[01:06:22.321 --> 01:06:28.743]  In 2018, the Peer Bright Institute was granted a patent for the coronavirus.
[01:06:28.743 --> 01:06:34.564]  The Peer Bright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:06:34.564 --> 01:06:49.589]  On October 18th of 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with John Hopkins and the World Economic Forum, hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic simulation in New York City.
[01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:57.250]  The simulation, which was held just three months ago, was based on the coronavirus.
[01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:07.192]  They concluded that it could kill 65 million people and decided the solution was to have a vaccine within months of an epidemic.
[01:07:07.192 --> 01:07:15.854]  The same week that the coronavirus makes headlines, Netflix releases the docuseries, Pandemic, How to Prevent an Outbreak.
[01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:23.377]  Wherein the solution is vaccines, and the trusted hero is Bill Gates.
[01:07:23.377 --> 01:07:29.399]  Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fund Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
[01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:33.779]  to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
[01:07:33.779 --> 01:07:36.480]  It's weird, right?
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.021]  Or am I just a conspiracy theorist?
[01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:40.661]  What about this?
[01:07:42.903 --> 01:07:50.086]  5G, an emerging technology upgrade that has many countries concerned about its impact on human health.
[01:07:50.086 --> 01:07:55.049]  Experts from all over the world warn of the dangers of 5G.
[01:07:55.049 --> 01:08:05.573]  In 2018, it was reported locally that Wuhan would be the testbed city for full 5G network operation in China.
[01:08:05.573 --> 01:08:08.675]  The article went on to say that it would be fully operational by 2020.
[01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:17.237]  And on Halloween of 2019, they turned it on.
[01:08:17.237 --> 01:08:23.380]  Scientists warn that 5G causes flu-like symptoms.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.500]  Interesting?
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:37.085]  What is also interesting is that when trying to share the link of 5G being launched in Wuhan, Facebook blocks you from doing so because it violates their community guidelines.
[01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:56.695]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:08:56.695 --> 01:08:57.816]  InfoWars.
[01:08:57.816 --> 01:09:01.659]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:02.760]  There was an article
[01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:07.167]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:13.251]  Last week saying, meet the real Umbrella Corporation.
[01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:16.313]  And I'm not a huge Resident Evil fan.
[01:09:16.313 --> 01:09:20.556]  I am a fan of that Eastern European chick, whatever her name is.
[01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:23.197]  But I've seen a couple of them.
[01:09:23.197 --> 01:09:30.442]  And it's about an evil corporation that's called Umbrella, but really it's the Red Cross of the secret societies.
[01:09:32.659 --> 01:09:43.962]  And so whoever wrote it was really smart, because the Red Cross is actually the oldest operating intelligence agency, continual operating secret society that's ever been.
[01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:47.363]  There are some that are older, they're just not continually operating.
[01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:50.744]  And everybody's like, yeah, this is like the Umbrella Corporation.
[01:09:50.744 --> 01:09:54.225]  And then my buddy Shane Steiner sent me this, this image.
[01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:57.306]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[01:09:57.306 --> 01:09:59.347]  And it says Umbrella Corporation.
[01:10:01.607 --> 01:10:02.487]  Overhead shot if we could.
[01:10:02.487 --> 01:10:03.068]  That'd be awesome.
[01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:04.908]  Thanks.
[01:10:04.908 --> 01:10:14.953]  And the actual research laboratory where this happened has the exact same symbol, but instead of red and gray, it's green and gray.
[01:10:14.953 --> 01:10:18.214]  I mean, it's the exact same symbol.
[01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.795]  And I'm like, OK, that's got to be a joke.
[01:10:19.795 --> 01:10:24.637]  And then Corona translates to Raccoon City, and that ties back to the movie.
[01:10:26.536 --> 01:10:29.718]  And I went and looked this up, and again, I miss a lot of stuff.
[01:10:29.718 --> 01:10:31.199]  People are always asking, why aren't you covering this?
[01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.459]  Why aren't you covering that?
[01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:44.586]  I just see a Zero Hedge article, read a little bit of it, and like, hey, this is really an evil corporation, and they've done bad stuff before, and it's just like the resident evil corporation.
[01:10:44.586 --> 01:10:49.509]  But I didn't even pay attention to the photo they had on there and the underwriting under it.
[01:10:49.509 --> 01:10:50.590]  I thought it was a joke.
[01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:58.205]  No, they really have the same symbol as the Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation.
[01:10:58.205 --> 01:11:02.048]  What in the world is going on?
[01:11:02.048 --> 01:11:06.432]  I mean, it's not just close.
[01:11:06.432 --> 01:11:10.755]  It's dead on.
[01:11:10.755 --> 01:11:12.156]  In fact, it's the same symbol.
[01:11:12.156 --> 01:11:18.421]  If you look at it in night vision view, it's just in night vision view.
[01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:20.102]  It's the exact symbol.
[01:11:24.264 --> 01:11:38.700]  And by the way, that's the symbol of a lot of secret societies, some good, some bad, but that particular one is Nazi lore, the Iron Cross, all of it.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:46.008]  Why would the CHICOMS in a known lab connected to the government and bioweapons development, that's, in fact, queue up.
[01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:48.790]  Senator Cotton, please.
[01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:49.731]  Yesterday.
[01:11:49.731 --> 01:11:53.294]  Why in the hell would they have that symbol?
[01:11:53.294 --> 01:11:54.355]  Now, I've got to look it up.
[01:11:54.355 --> 01:12:00.480]  I spent like 10 minutes this morning and couldn't find when they got that logo.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.363]  But it appears the company and the logo comes after Resident Evil.
[01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:09.187]  So why would you pick the Resident Evil symbol of the Evil Global Corporation?
[01:12:09.187 --> 01:12:10.007]  Why?
[01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:11.248]  Why?
[01:12:11.248 --> 01:12:12.850]  This is big, folks.
[01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:13.250]  This is big.
[01:12:14.619 --> 01:12:18.581]  Because the globalists are obsessed with putting their fingerprints on it.
[01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:20.562]  Just like anybody, a good guy, a bad guy.
[01:12:20.562 --> 01:12:20.642]  U.S.
[01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:28.365]  Special Forces, you can say we're the good guys, we're the bad guys in Vietnam, depending on how you look at it, but they'd leave an ace of spades when they killed somebody in their mouth.
[01:12:28.365 --> 01:12:29.545]  Or at the scene, so you know who did it.
[01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:38.865]  Where this came from, a lot of experts believe, and shadowy groups tied to the U.S.
[01:12:38.865 --> 01:12:55.079]  military and tied to thefts in Canada of a coronavirus genome, RNA, is now being tracked back to this company.
[01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:58.002]  And you've had four releases of coronaviruses before.
[01:12:58.002 --> 01:12:59.043]  SARS is a coronavirus.
[01:13:00.455 --> 01:13:02.316]  By Chinese labs.
[01:13:02.316 --> 01:13:06.277]  But the Washington Post says, oh, you better not ask questions.
[01:13:06.277 --> 01:13:07.278]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:07.278 --> 01:13:11.560]  Well, here's Senator Cotton talking about it yesterday.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:20.183]  They also claimed, for almost two months until earlier this week, that it originated in a seafood market in Wuhan.
[01:13:20.183 --> 01:13:26.165]  That locals had contracted it from animals in, say, bat soup or snake tartare.
[01:13:26.165 --> 01:13:27.006]  That is not the case.
[01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:38.929]  The Lancet published a study last weekend demonstrating that of the original 40 cases, 14 of them had no contact with the seafood market, including patient zero.
[01:13:38.929 --> 01:13:44.853]  As one epidemiologist said, that virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.
[01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.594]  We still don't know where it originated.
[01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:48.175]  Could have been another seafood market.
[01:13:48.175 --> 01:13:49.436]  Could have been a farm.
[01:13:49.436 --> 01:13:50.897]  Could have been a food processing company.
[01:13:51.909 --> 01:14:04.762]  I would note that Wuhan also has China's only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that works with the world's most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.
[01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:07.945]  Oh!
[01:14:07.945 --> 01:14:11.848]  And he calls for shutting down all flights to the U.S.
[01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:16.293]  If it's as deadly as Landsat's saying, up to 15% death rate, which I don't believe,
[01:14:19.636 --> 01:14:25.219]  Then you better damn well shut down flights from China.
[01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:31.883]  Now, I would not preempt the coverage of the trial of the President.
[01:14:31.883 --> 01:14:42.089]  And the gate crasher, and shots fired at Mar-a-Lago, and the coronavirus, and your phone calls, that's what I'm really wanting to take.
[01:14:42.089 --> 01:14:44.330]  Because you just bring up angles I wouldn't have thought of.
[01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:49.837]  Or a lot of times I already thought that, then later I'm like, oh, I forgot to say that.
[01:14:49.837 --> 01:14:51.018]  We're thinking the same thing here.
[01:14:51.018 --> 01:14:52.560]  We're getting something done here.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.902]  In a big brainstorm session, that's what this is.
[01:14:54.902 --> 01:14:56.543]  There's not talking points coming down from on high.
[01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:58.525]  We're trying to suss this out.
[01:14:58.525 --> 01:14:59.486]  And some listeners get confused.
[01:14:59.486 --> 01:15:00.827]  They go, wait a minute, you got one guest saying this.
[01:15:00.827 --> 01:15:03.670]  And I guess, yeah, we're not a cult, man.
[01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.231]  It's like when they depose me on Sandy Hook.
[01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:08.735]  They go, well, one of your hosts says they thought it happened, but others were questioning.
[01:15:08.735 --> 01:15:09.415]  And I go, yeah, man.
[01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.947]  We're not a cult here.
[01:15:11.947 --> 01:15:13.908]  We question everything.
[01:15:13.908 --> 01:15:16.450]  Cults tell you don't question.
[01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.971]  You should question InfoWars.
[01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:19.412]  You should question yourself.
[01:15:19.412 --> 01:15:21.254]  You should question the government.
[01:15:21.254 --> 01:15:22.655]  You should be engaged.
[01:15:22.655 --> 01:15:23.796]  And I'm out here preaching at you.
[01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:27.198]  I'm telling you what I need to do.
[01:15:27.198 --> 01:15:29.380]  But I've got to get Ezra Levant on because
[01:15:30.555 --> 01:15:35.037]  I already admired him, because I know about the work he's been through, and he's super smart.
[01:15:35.037 --> 01:15:40.200]  But man, I watched this video this morning, and I watched it twice, because I've been up since 3 o'clock this morning.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.402]  And, I mean, this is like the real Perry Mason.
[01:15:44.402 --> 01:15:51.646]  He's the Perry Mason when he runs into these federal police that are trying to put him in jail for writing a book.
[01:15:51.646 --> 01:15:52.987]  Wait until you see this.
[01:15:56.222 --> 01:15:57.483]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:57.483 --> 01:15:58.784]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:15:58.784 --> 01:16:02.507]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:03.607]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:03.607 --> 01:16:05.429]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:05.429 --> 01:16:07.130]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:32.023]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:32.023 --> 01:16:35.065]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:35.065 --> 01:16:41.008]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:41.008 --> 01:16:44.790]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:46.050]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:47.071]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:53.594]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:53.594 --> 01:16:55.035]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:56.007 --> 01:16:57.969]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:57.969 --> 01:17:03.274]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:03.274 --> 01:17:04.876]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:13.224]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:56.946 --> 01:17:59.928]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[01:17:59.928 --> 01:18:02.730]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:04.511]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[01:18:04.511 --> 01:18:05.271]  I hope it doesn't.
[01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:09.994]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause, well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[01:18:09.994 --> 01:18:13.236]  So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[01:18:13.236 --> 01:18:14.457]  It's insurance you can eat.
[01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:15.638]  It lasts 25 years.
[01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:20.020]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.501]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:25.904]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it as
[01:18:26.124 --> 01:18:27.744]  Infowars Select.
[01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:30.565]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[01:18:30.565 --> 01:18:33.386]  They're still able, within 7 to 10 days, to ship it to you.
[01:18:33.386 --> 01:18:41.207]  If you get your orders in, on their small orders, their big orders, 7 to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you, if you get your order in now.
[01:18:41.207 --> 01:18:44.948]  But, just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.

[01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:56.972]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:56.972 --> 01:18:57.772]  Well, it's here.
[01:18:57.772 --> 01:18:59.153]  The year 2020.
[01:18:59.153 --> 01:19:00.673]  World governments out in the open.
[01:19:00.673 --> 01:19:05.135]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[01:19:05.135 --> 01:19:08.497]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place.
[01:19:08.497 --> 01:19:18.982]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[01:19:18.982 --> 01:19:19.162]  Wow.
[01:19:19.742 --> 01:19:21.243]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[01:19:21.243 --> 01:19:22.543]  The New World Order's real.
[01:19:22.543 --> 01:19:23.603]  Satanism's real.
[01:19:23.603 --> 01:19:24.964]  The pedophile elite are real.
[01:19:24.964 --> 01:19:28.785]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[01:19:28.785 --> 01:19:33.527]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:37.088]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[01:19:37.088 --> 01:19:41.390]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:44.113]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.434]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:19:45.434 --> 01:19:48.397]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[01:19:48.397 --> 01:19:55.544]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[01:19:55.544 --> 01:19:59.969]  So please take action.
[01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:02.572]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.882 --> 01:20:23.826]  Yeah.
[01:20:26.317 --> 01:20:31.400]  Well, Wolf, right behind me is Mar-a-Lago, and I'm not sure if you can hear, but there are multiple helicopters over the location.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.461]  Now, we have just heard from the Florida police.
[01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:37.182]  They say a vehicle and suspects are currently in custody.
[01:20:37.182 --> 01:20:47.968]  So the way that they describe the situation is essentially the Florida Highway Patrol was following a black SUV as it barreled towards two security points outside of Mar-a-Lago.
[01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:54.371]  It broke through both of those security points before eventually officials launching fire into that vehicle.
[01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:55.752]  Now, again, the vehicle then
[01:20:57.272 --> 01:21:04.174]  They were eventually tracked down and again this vehicle and these suspects are currently in custody.
[01:21:04.174 --> 01:21:05.614]  We have reached out to Secret Service.
[01:21:05.614 --> 01:21:08.695]  We know of course President Trump is supposed to be here later today.
[01:21:08.695 --> 01:21:11.116]  He's spending his weekend here in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:15.837]  This is a developing situation but you should see the kind of security presence that's around us right now.
[01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:22.439]  Streets blocks away from Mar-a-Lago are completely shut down and we talked to one eyewitness who was at Mar-a-Lago when this occurred.
[01:21:22.439 --> 01:21:23.859]  He said he heard about eight
[01:21:24.099 --> 01:21:24.640]  Thank you so much.
[01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:42.966]  That vehicle was headed towards Mar-a-Lago intentionally.
[01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:45.148]  Were they on a chase for any reason?
[01:21:45.148 --> 01:21:47.790]  Why exactly were they following this car in the first place?
[01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.752]  And why was it heading towards Mar-a-Lago?
[01:21:49.752 --> 01:21:59.002]  And of course with this just a developing situation, we're going to keep our ear to the ground, keep talking to our sources to figure out what exactly happened.
[01:21:59.002 --> 01:22:00.604]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:01.747 --> 01:22:07.410]  I am your host Alex Jones and there is a lot of breaking news obviously unfolding.
[01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:10.672]  This could have just been somebody that was going the wrong way and not paying attention.
[01:22:10.672 --> 01:22:19.037]  They could have been drinking and could have been driven in and driven out and then you do that in a secure area like that you're going to get shot at.
[01:22:19.037 --> 01:22:30.824]  That's sad but there's going to be collateral damage in a climate where they're saying Trump is literally Hitler and having a nation is Hitler.
[01:22:32.065 --> 01:22:41.251]  And then the only person with any connection to Hitler we see is George Soros, who literally was a Nazi collaborator and said it was the best time of his life.
[01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:47.976]  And then he finances a whole network saying Trump is Hitler.
[01:22:47.976 --> 01:22:50.898]  You can't make this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:50.898 --> 01:22:54.661]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:22:54.661 --> 01:22:56.382]  So there's that.
[01:22:56.382 --> 01:22:58.964]  You know, sometimes you see something
[01:23:03.959 --> 01:23:04.560]  It blows your mind.
[01:23:29.873 --> 01:23:54.536]  I watched it and I was like I gotta get this guy on tomorrow but there's all this huge breaking news but I said this is important because what it illustrates for everybody it's it's like a skeleton key or a Rosetta Stone but I'm gonna get Ezra Lamont's take on the impeachment of Trump the trial the virus first in this segment then we'll get to what we're talking about we come back but I mean
[01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:17.455]  I don't have enough words to describe how these senior, former federal police, now attached to another federal group, 30-year veteran Royal Mounties in their suits sit there and act like something out of a movie about the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[01:24:17.455 --> 01:24:19.456]  I mean, it's like that scene when
[01:24:21.263 --> 01:24:25.046]  Mr. Anderson and the First Matrix meets the Agent Smith.
[01:24:25.046 --> 01:24:29.349]  I mean, I watched this and it's horrifying.
[01:24:29.349 --> 01:24:31.851]  And then I went and read like hundreds of comments on YouTube.
[01:24:31.851 --> 01:24:32.291]  I sat there
[01:24:33.976 --> 01:24:38.398]  And then, you know, my kids start waking up, come in at like 6.30, I'm making them breakfast, and they're like, what are you doing?
[01:24:38.398 --> 01:24:41.019]  And I'm reading the comments, everyone sees what it is.
[01:24:41.019 --> 01:24:44.160]  Like the new Soviet Union, it's insane.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.721]  And here's the thing, you watch, they're going to charge him, you can smell it.
[01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:49.402]  They say, you're guilty.
[01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:50.462]  You want to walk that back?
[01:24:50.462 --> 01:24:53.664]  You just admitted you're guilty of writing a book during an election.
[01:24:53.664 --> 01:24:56.445]  And Ezra Levin's like, well, I've got the law here.
[01:24:57.486 --> 01:24:58.467]  That's totally legal, right?
[01:24:58.467 --> 01:25:00.148]  They go, you're going to jail.
[01:25:00.148 --> 01:25:06.532]  This is America with cops in a room trying to hotbox somebody.
[01:25:06.532 --> 01:25:12.436]  Oh, but it's over a book and it's like a sick parody, but it's not!
[01:25:12.436 --> 01:25:12.877]  This is...
[01:25:14.724 --> 01:25:16.326]  Kevin Blackface Trudeau.
[01:25:16.326 --> 01:25:18.909]  Like, what's up with dudes in blackface trying to take our freedoms?
[01:25:18.909 --> 01:25:22.434]  In Virginia, and I'm gonna stop there, this is a limited time in this segment.
[01:25:22.434 --> 01:25:32.026]  As we're gonna get to this and the whole climate and what, and they're calling for Rand Paul's arrest for exposing the fake whistleblower and sending the President's bill to face his accuser.
[01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.347]  What I got from this is what I already knew.
[01:25:34.068 --> 01:25:37.111]  Whether it's Europe, or Canada, or the US, or Australia, or anywhere.
[01:25:37.111 --> 01:25:43.756]  The left are communist authoritarians, and they've decided to do this, and they're taking over, and they want to put us all in prison.
[01:25:43.756 --> 01:25:49.060]  And I have empathy for you, not because I'm a candy ass, but because I'm in the same boat.
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.842]  And like, we need to push back.
[01:25:50.842 --> 01:25:53.184]  And I love what you said to them.
[01:25:53.184 --> 01:25:56.667]  Hey, I'm not looking for trouble, but you're damn right I did that.
[01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:57.768]  You bet I published a book.
[01:25:58.288 --> 01:26:00.710]  Because I'm a free person, and that's in our Constitution.
[01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:01.430]  Look at you.
[01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:02.351]  You are shameful.
[01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:05.973]  It's like Oscar-level, but it's beyond that, because it's real!
[01:26:05.973 --> 01:26:07.794]  They really are trying to put you in jail.
[01:26:07.794 --> 01:26:11.637]  They really banned your TV network when it was one of the top-rated deals.
[01:26:11.637 --> 01:26:15.900]  I mean, you've already been effed over by this authoritarianism, and now they want you to fear them?
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.142]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[01:26:18.142 --> 01:26:18.702]  I'm ranting.
[01:26:18.702 --> 01:26:21.124]  We'll get to it next segment, but I said I'd get to it next segment.
[01:26:21.124 --> 01:26:21.824]  I'm doing it now.
[01:26:21.824 --> 01:26:27.488]  What do you make of the general climate, though, and Trump and the left and their drooling desire to put us in prison?
[01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:34.722]  Well, look, it's part of the same thing to ban a book or to impeach a president.
[01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:35.963]  What are those?
[01:26:35.963 --> 01:26:43.109]  Those are using the power of the authoritarian state to undo the natural will of the people.
[01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:46.491]  In my case, I wrote a popular book about Crudeau.
[01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:49.714]  Well, the government was going to squash that by prosecuting me.
[01:26:50.314 --> 01:26:54.157]  In the case of Trump's impeachment, he won the election fair and square.
[01:26:54.157 --> 01:26:56.559]  He looks like he might win again.
[01:26:56.559 --> 01:27:00.962]  So use the power of the state to stop it undemocratically.
[01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:03.124]  It's also what happened to Brexit.
[01:27:03.124 --> 01:27:06.787]  For three and a half years, they managed to foil the will of the people.
[01:27:06.787 --> 01:27:09.489]  Today, finally, Brexit is happening.
[01:27:09.489 --> 01:27:12.091]  So all of these are cautionary tales.
[01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:15.113]  Don't give up your power to a authoritarian.
[01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:19.737]  But all of them give us a little glimmer of hope, too, that if you fight hard,
[01:27:20.376 --> 01:27:23.438]  You might win in the end.
[01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:25.179]  Well, I mean, I've got to say it.
[01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:26.400]  I watched the video twice.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.781]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:27.781 --> 01:27:29.302]  It's also on your site.
[01:27:29.302 --> 01:27:31.363]  I know you've got a lot of sites.
[01:27:31.363 --> 01:27:34.405]  What is the best site to go find the video?
[01:27:34.405 --> 01:27:38.969]  Well, we have a special page for it called SaveRebelNews.com.
[01:27:38.969 --> 01:27:44.072]  And I'll take your cue about timing, but I sent your producer a few clips.
[01:27:44.714 --> 01:27:46.335]  One of them is so incredible.
[01:27:46.335 --> 01:27:47.835]  So I'm summoned there.
[01:27:47.835 --> 01:27:48.956]  I mean, you tell me if we want it.
[01:27:48.956 --> 01:27:51.837]  I don't know what you want to talk about now on your timing.
[01:27:51.837 --> 01:27:54.838]  Well, we're going to break up in a minute, but yeah.
[01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:56.578]  You know, I go down there.
[01:27:56.578 --> 01:27:59.199]  They take me to a high security location.
[01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:01.360]  They tell me no videotaping.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:08.342]  Well, I'm not going to listen to them because I know if they're telling me I can't tape it, it's because they're saying things they don't want shown to the world.
[01:28:08.342 --> 01:28:12.624]  So I have on me a concealed camera, James O'Keefe style.
[01:28:13.417 --> 01:28:17.941]  And I'm so glad I did because I don't think people would have believed it if they didn't see him.
[01:28:17.941 --> 01:28:23.347]  When we come back from the break, I'll show you the most terrifying thing I said to them.
[01:28:23.347 --> 01:28:24.608]  Show me the complaint against me.
[01:28:24.608 --> 01:28:26.269]  I'm ready to meet the charges.
[01:28:26.269 --> 01:28:28.992]  They said, we're not going to show you the complaint.
[01:28:29.907 --> 01:28:30.928]  I said, is it a secret?
[01:28:30.928 --> 01:28:32.650]  Well, I'll let you show how that goes.
[01:28:32.650 --> 01:28:33.331]  We're going to come back.
[01:28:33.331 --> 01:28:38.175]  We're going to get to it all with Ezra LeVant because there's such huge news breaking, but this is the authoritarianism.
[01:28:38.175 --> 01:28:39.817]  These people are dangerous.
[01:28:39.817 --> 01:28:45.603]  And I've read about stuff like this in Nazi Germany and Russia, but now you're seeing it in Canada, folks.
[01:28:45.603 --> 01:28:46.884]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:46.884 --> 01:28:49.326]  They go, you're guilty of publishing that book.
[01:28:49.326 --> 01:28:51.649]  And they're guys in shark suits.
[01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:52.650]  And they're on a power trip.
[01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:53.631]  They're enjoying this.
[01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:59.228]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:28:59.228 --> 01:29:02.130]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:09.354]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[01:29:56.917 --> 01:30:04.624]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[01:30:04.624 --> 01:30:14.053]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States west coast.
[01:30:14.053 --> 01:30:19.118]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out
[01:30:19.418 --> 01:30:20.719]  That's right.
[01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:29.007]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:34.792]  Infowars, private labels from MyPatriotSupply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[01:30:34.792 --> 01:30:42.078]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, that that's going to run out probably in a few weeks, and that people need to order now.
[01:30:42.078 --> 01:30:44.901]  They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.723]  If people wait, it may end up being longer.
[01:30:47.723 --> 01:30:56.969]  But if you get your order in now at InfowarStore.com, you will be secured to get the food within 7 to 10 days.
[01:30:56.969 --> 01:31:01.092]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[01:31:01.092 --> 01:31:02.373]  You don't want my thanks.
[01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:08.967]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[01:31:08.967 --> 01:31:10.148]  And you know what?
[01:31:10.148 --> 01:31:13.431]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[01:31:13.431 --> 01:31:22.761]  And it's why M4's has been delivering time and time again, when it's clutch time, to focus the people on taking action against the globalists.
[01:31:22.761 --> 01:31:24.162]  Because I'm committed to a future.
[01:31:25.185 --> 01:31:26.486]  For humanity.
[01:31:26.486 --> 01:31:28.108]  And I know you are as well.
[01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:36.216]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Infowar and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[01:31:36.216 --> 01:31:44.925]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[01:31:45.962 --> 01:31:47.583]  You have made history.
[01:31:47.583 --> 01:31:48.784]  We have made history together.
[01:31:48.784 --> 01:31:56.649]  Infowars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[01:31:56.649 --> 01:32:01.532]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high-quality,
[01:32:01.872 --> 01:32:05.934]  Organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[01:32:05.934 --> 01:32:22.981]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs and then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[01:32:22.981 --> 01:32:28.344]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[01:32:28.344 --> 01:32:28.884]  So right now,
[01:32:29.164 --> 01:32:35.347]  We have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter, and spring.
[01:32:35.347 --> 01:32:49.214]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off, $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price, because I want you to get it, and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[01:32:49.214 --> 01:32:55.697]  So, Winter Sun, taken under the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:32:59.847 --> 01:33:09.751]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:10.832]  News.
[01:33:10.832 --> 01:33:12.152]  Analysis.
[01:33:12.152 --> 01:33:13.613]  Reports.
[01:33:13.613 --> 01:33:16.214]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.214 --> 01:33:22.977]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com and it's just insane.
[01:33:28.177 --> 01:33:29.897]  Everybody knows they're doing this in Europe.
[01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:36.279]  Everybody knows they've hired the former SCSI to help suppress nationalists and patriots and people just promoting freedom.
[01:33:36.279 --> 01:33:45.401]  But now in Canada, they've been persecuting the press and shut down his network on national TV that was popular, taking away its license.
[01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:49.142]  This is what goes on, and now they're trying to do that here in America.
[01:33:50.595 --> 01:33:53.636]  And so you're like, oh, it's a private company, you know, let big tech censor you.
[01:33:53.636 --> 01:33:58.839]  Well, now it's Royal Mountain Police coming in suits and ties, calling you with a letter.
[01:33:58.839 --> 01:33:59.899]  You go in and meet with them.
[01:33:59.899 --> 01:34:02.321]  And it's right out of a cop movie.
[01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:07.543]  They're not asking if he sold cocaine or if he money laundered or if he kidnapped somebody.
[01:34:07.543 --> 01:34:10.565]  No, it's about the book he wrote.
[01:34:10.565 --> 01:34:11.065]  It's incredible.
[01:34:11.065 --> 01:34:13.026]  Here's a few minutes from the intro.
[01:34:13.026 --> 01:34:16.708]  Today we're here to vote Rebel News Network Limited.
[01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:17.248]  Oh, I know that.
[01:34:18.188 --> 01:34:26.190]  And I'm just asking you to confirm that not a single other loving book of Trudeau is being investigated.
[01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:31.371]  But once we're done, if you believe that there should be complaints that are... No, because I'm not a censor like you.
[01:34:31.371 --> 01:34:33.512]  I'm not a bully and a censor.
[01:34:33.512 --> 01:34:37.113]  I'm not a bureaucrat looking to justify my budget like you.
[01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:38.793]  I go out and earn my living every day, fella.
[01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:47.273]  You call in authors to grill them about a book criticizing your boss.
[01:34:47.273 --> 01:34:48.794]  Think about who you are.
[01:34:48.794 --> 01:34:52.536]  We call the director of Rebel News Network Limited.
[01:34:52.536 --> 01:34:55.177]  Yeah, who happens to be the author of the book.
[01:34:55.177 --> 01:34:58.478]  I think there's going to be a chapter about you two fellas in the next edition.
[01:34:58.478 --> 01:35:07.263]  Do you have any more questions there?
[01:35:07.263 --> 01:35:07.743]  Certainly do.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.421]  All right, let's just stop there.
[01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:16.006]  Ezra, the best way to do this is just let you take control for this segment and part of the next.
[01:35:16.006 --> 01:35:17.507]  You've got a bunch of clips here.
[01:35:17.507 --> 01:35:20.590]  You've got a lot to say, and we're honored to have you with us.
[01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:28.638]  But again, they're trying to use campaign finance law, just like Democrats have said, ban Drudge, ban Alex Jones, use campaign finance law.
[01:35:28.638 --> 01:35:29.398]  We're under speech.
[01:35:29.398 --> 01:35:31.620]  We're not under campaign.
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.802]  Sure, I support Second Amendment, pro-life, things like that.
[01:35:34.923 --> 01:35:36.744]  And I'm a Republican when it's for President Trump.
[01:35:36.744 --> 01:35:40.425]  I hate a lot of the Republicans, but if I want to publish a book around an election, I can.
[01:35:40.425 --> 01:35:49.468]  Well, Canada's put laws in place, and maybe you can briefly explain that, but you're reading them the law and they're saying, sorry, you're a criminal.
[01:35:49.468 --> 01:35:50.648]  He says twice.
[01:35:50.648 --> 01:35:52.088]  Well, just you take over.
[01:35:52.088 --> 01:35:53.229]  Go ahead.
[01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.469]  Sure.
[01:35:53.469 --> 01:36:00.171]  I mean, in Canada election law, there's a special exemption for books and the promotion of books.
[01:36:01.327 --> 01:36:04.369]  I mean, I've written, I don't know, almost 10 books or so.
[01:36:04.369 --> 01:36:05.389]  I'd have to count.
[01:36:05.389 --> 01:36:07.210]  Some of them are bestsellers.
[01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:12.733]  So the book is clearly protected under our laws and yet they still brought me in.
[01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.154]  Here's the crazy thing.
[01:36:14.154 --> 01:36:21.258]  There were 24 books published about Justin Trudeau, our left-wing Prime Minister, the same time as mine.
[01:36:21.258 --> 01:36:24.660]  But I was the only author that was brought in.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.361]  So that's not a coincidence.
[01:36:28.374 --> 01:36:31.035]  I thought, well, should I even go there?
[01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:37.337]  But I knew that I could get them to admit things if they didn't realize I was videotaping them.
[01:36:37.337 --> 01:36:39.878]  So I asked them a basic question.
[01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:40.859]  Let me start with this one.
[01:36:40.859 --> 01:36:44.240]  Let me show you how Kafkaesque it is.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.681]  I went to Ottawa, this high security location.
[01:36:47.681 --> 01:36:49.542]  They took me into a windowless room.
[01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:54.144]  There was these two 30-year veterans of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
[01:36:54.144 --> 01:36:55.444]  I'm not sure their status now.
[01:36:55.444 --> 01:36:56.965]  They wouldn't give me their business card.
[01:36:57.478 --> 01:37:01.179]  So I don't even know they're, you know, technically who they're working for.
[01:37:01.179 --> 01:37:09.901]  I know we were at the Elections Canada head office, high security, and I said, all right, can I see the complaint against me?
[01:37:09.901 --> 01:37:12.861]  Let me ask your producers to roll that clip.
[01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:16.782]  It's called, um, uh, see the complaint.
[01:37:16.782 --> 01:37:19.563]  I, this is how we started and it just got crazier.
[01:37:19.563 --> 01:37:20.323]  Take a look.
[01:37:20.323 --> 01:37:22.404]  Here he is asking for the complaint.
[01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:23.804]  The complaints against me.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.161]  The letter that you received?
[01:37:27.161 --> 01:37:31.045]  No, I presume that you're investigating based on a complaint.
[01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:35.910]  Oh, this is still part of the investigation, so we'll have to, once the investigation's been...
[01:37:37.682 --> 01:37:38.122]  Completed.
[01:37:38.122 --> 01:37:41.504]  The commission will have to make a decision at that point.
[01:37:41.504 --> 01:37:44.286]  You'll have to decide if that is releasable or not.
[01:37:44.286 --> 01:37:46.547]  It's not something that usually is released, no.
[01:37:46.547 --> 01:37:48.289]  So it's a secret complaint?
[01:37:48.289 --> 01:37:49.409]  It's not a secret complaint.
[01:37:49.409 --> 01:37:51.871]  It's just a complaint that's part of the investigation.
[01:37:51.871 --> 01:37:59.515]  And to keep the integrity of the investigation right now, you'll understand that we can't share everything that we have.
[01:37:59.515 --> 01:38:01.617]  Well, I don't want everything that you have.
[01:38:01.617 --> 01:38:06.580]  If I'm here to meet a complaint, but you won't show me the complaint,
[01:38:07.688 --> 01:38:09.630]  How can I possibly meet the complaint?
[01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:15.395]  How can I possibly respond to something that you won't show me?
[01:38:15.395 --> 01:38:23.181]  Well, I think the letter was quite clear on what the infraction is alleged, and this is where we want to clarify with you.
[01:38:24.045 --> 01:38:28.168]  Well, did you generate the complaint, or was it from an outside party?
[01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:29.669]  No, we didn't generate the complaint.
[01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:31.430]  The office usually does not generate the complaint.
[01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:35.633]  So someone external to your office generated the complaint?
[01:38:35.633 --> 01:38:37.073]  That is usually the case.
[01:38:37.073 --> 01:38:38.534]  Is that the case in this case?
[01:38:38.534 --> 01:38:39.355]  Yeah.
[01:38:39.355 --> 01:38:40.616]  Yeah, we did not generate the complaint.
[01:38:40.616 --> 01:38:42.957]  Okay, was it the Liberal Party that generated the complaint?
[01:38:42.957 --> 01:38:44.678]  We can't point to that, sir.
[01:38:44.678 --> 01:38:48.681]  So you won't tell me who the complainant is?
[01:38:48.681 --> 01:38:49.501]  Is that the secret?
[01:38:49.501 --> 01:38:50.222]  No, not at this point.
[01:38:52.208 --> 01:38:54.790]  So at what point do you tell me who the senior complainant is?
[01:38:54.790 --> 01:39:02.637]  The commissioner is the ultimate responsible person for the investigation and how this is decided.
[01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:09.522]  So how do I know what conduct has been complained about if you won't tell me?
[01:39:09.522 --> 01:39:10.924]  This is Kafka-esque.
[01:39:10.924 --> 01:39:13.246]  Can you make that point for those folks who haven't read Kafka?
[01:39:14.396 --> 01:39:21.118]  That's a famous novel of a nightmare future scenario where someone's on trial but they're not being told the crime they committed.
[01:39:21.118 --> 01:39:24.539]  Or you can't face your accuser, just like President Trump can't face your accuser.
[01:39:24.539 --> 01:39:30.021]  And when a senator says the name of Eric Saramala, the Chief Justice shuts him down.
[01:39:30.021 --> 01:39:32.221]  I mean, again, it's just everywhere.
[01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:33.342]  The attacks on free speech.
[01:39:33.342 --> 01:39:40.044]  Now they're calling, Democrats are, for the arrest or censure, Senator Blumenthal and others, of Rand Paul.
[01:39:40.044 --> 01:39:41.364]  The point is, these are authoritarians.
[01:39:44.824 --> 01:39:56.188]  Well, listen, the lesson I hope your viewers take from my experience here in Canada is never give up your First Amendment, and to ensure that, never give up your Second Amendment.
[01:39:56.188 --> 01:40:03.990]  I should tell you that in Canada and Europe, we don't have the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, and it shows.
[01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:09.732]  And the fact that many Americans have lawful firearms, that
[01:40:10.806 --> 01:40:11.047]  All right.
[01:40:30.146 --> 01:40:30.867]  I don't know.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:41:00.193]  Uh, who, you know, are dressed nice and look like FBI agents, look like Royal Mounted Police, and they're enjoying meshing with you and enjoying running over people's speech in a book you wrote that was number two on Amazon.
[01:41:00.193 --> 01:41:01.834]  And they know why they're there to try to scare you.
[01:41:01.834 --> 01:41:03.776]  These are dangerous people, in my view.
[01:41:03.776 --> 01:41:07.900]  I mean, I mean, this is the closest things to Nazis I've ever seen in Canada, I'll tell you that.
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:17.024]  I'm not saying they're Nazis, but men in suits, oppressing speech, trying to digitally burn books, and you're facing years in prison if they charge you with this for campaign finance fraud.
[01:41:17.024 --> 01:41:19.945]  I mean, these guys are a menace.
[01:41:19.945 --> 01:41:22.026]  And obviously, Trudeau gave them the order.
[01:41:22.026 --> 01:41:22.906]  They're a menace.
[01:41:22.906 --> 01:41:27.688]  You've already had courts rule when Trudeau's tried to bar your reporters that he broke the law.
[01:41:27.688 --> 01:41:28.549]  He's the criminal!
[01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:31.930]  Well, it's a big battle.
[01:41:33.692 --> 01:41:37.275]  Let me know if you have time for another clip, because there's one more that might be of interest.
[01:41:37.275 --> 01:41:38.056]  Oh, you've got a bunch.
[01:41:38.056 --> 01:41:39.958]  When we come back, we've got another segment.
[01:41:39.958 --> 01:41:40.979]  I'm going to play these.
[01:41:40.979 --> 01:41:50.088]  I just... The video made my blood pressure go up, because, I mean, I watched it twice, and the arrogance of these men... Let me just ask this with a minute to break.
[01:41:50.088 --> 01:41:56.614]  Is the average federal police officer that arrogant in Canada, or are these special commissars, special guys they've picked?
[01:41:58.331 --> 01:42:16.864]  Well, I was trying to find out who they were, and like I said, they wouldn't give me their business card, so I sort of took a picture of their ID cards, and then I Googled them, and these guys, 30-year veterans of the RCMP, they worked on counterterrorism matters, one of them worked for Interpol, organized crime.
[01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:20.306]  I think those are legitimate policing duties.
[01:42:21.041 --> 01:42:23.002]  So for them to be assigned to an office?
[01:42:23.002 --> 01:42:27.925]  They sent, they sent real, you can tell, these people are trying to put you in prison.
[01:42:27.925 --> 01:42:28.785]  I mean, I watched it.
[01:42:28.785 --> 01:42:33.408]  I'm just like, and it's like, I don't even hate these people, but it's like at a deep level, like this is dangerous.
[01:42:33.408 --> 01:42:34.688]  These are dangerous people.
[01:42:34.688 --> 01:42:35.709]  This is what evil looks like.
[01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:37.770]  These are bad people, man.
[01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:38.430]  Oh my God.
[01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:39.471]  Oh, just stay right there.
[01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:40.912]  I mean, folks, you got to watch the full video.
[01:42:40.912 --> 01:42:41.932]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:41.932 --> 01:42:42.913]  It is sickening.
[01:42:42.913 --> 01:42:47.855]  I got all this huge news, but I'm doing this because it is archetypal.
[01:42:47.855 --> 01:42:48.776]  Everything we're facing.
[01:42:50.776 --> 01:42:51.198]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:51.500]  Stay with us.
[01:42:55.868 --> 01:42:58.849]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[01:42:58.849 --> 01:43:01.651]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[01:43:01.651 --> 01:43:03.431]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[01:43:03.431 --> 01:43:04.192]  I hope it doesn't.
[01:43:04.192 --> 01:43:08.914]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause... Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[01:43:08.914 --> 01:43:14.556]  So, I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality, it's insurance you can eat, it lasts 25 years.
[01:43:14.556 --> 01:43:18.938]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[01:43:18.938 --> 01:43:20.419]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[01:43:20.419 --> 01:43:24.541]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it.
[01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:25.561]  We're good to go!

[01:45:29.863 --> 01:45:31.204]  I have one of those personally.
[01:45:31.204 --> 01:45:34.687]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[01:45:34.687 --> 01:45:35.607]  I am prepared.
[01:45:35.607 --> 01:45:35.948]  Are you?

[01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:41.672]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[01:45:41.672 --> 01:45:46.075]  It's not necessarily the disease, it's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[01:45:46.075 --> 01:45:49.698]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[01:45:49.898 --> 01:45:51.419]  Food will be off the shelves.
[01:45:51.419 --> 01:45:52.559]  Water won't be available.
[01:45:52.559 --> 01:45:54.179]  You might not even be able to leave your house.
[01:45:54.179 --> 01:45:57.020]  You gotta be prepared before it comes down.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:57.801]  Well, it's here.
[01:45:57.801 --> 01:45:58.741]  The year 2020.
[01:45:58.741 --> 01:46:00.722]  World government's out in the open.
[01:46:00.722 --> 01:46:05.143]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[01:46:05.143 --> 01:46:19.008]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[01:46:19.008 --> 01:46:19.188]  Wow.
[01:46:19.768 --> 01:46:21.269]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[01:46:21.269 --> 01:46:22.590]  The New World Order's real.
[01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:23.631]  Satanism's real.
[01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:24.992]  The pedophile elite are real.
[01:46:24.992 --> 01:46:28.815]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:33.578]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[01:46:33.578 --> 01:46:37.141]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[01:46:37.141 --> 01:46:41.444]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[01:46:41.744 --> 01:46:44.105]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[01:46:44.105 --> 01:46:45.485]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:46:45.485 --> 01:46:48.447]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[01:46:48.447 --> 01:46:55.569]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[01:46:55.569 --> 01:46:59.431]  So please take action.
[01:46:59.431 --> 01:47:02.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.511 --> 01:47:20.917]  I don't even understand what I've been accused of doing.
[01:47:20.917 --> 01:47:25.420]  I don't understand who accused me.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.941]  I don't understand when.
[01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:27.622]  So this is a
[01:47:35.245 --> 01:47:39.487]  Frankly, this is a Star Chamber that is illegal.
[01:47:39.487 --> 01:47:44.489]  I'm here because, really, I wanted to ask a few questions about what you're going to do if I don't give you documents.
[01:47:44.489 --> 01:47:45.210]  You wouldn't answer.
[01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:47.271]  I wanted to ask who complained.
[01:47:47.271 --> 01:47:48.011]  You wouldn't answer.
[01:47:48.011 --> 01:47:48.952]  I wanted to see the complaint.
[01:47:48.952 --> 01:47:49.692]  You wouldn't answer.
[01:47:49.692 --> 01:47:55.135]  I wanted to check you guys out, learn a little bit about how many folks are on the file.
[01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:59.056]  You didn't really answer, but I can count.
[01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:00.657]  I guess my message to the Commissioner is,
[01:48:03.704 --> 01:48:09.068]  I don't even know who it is, to be honest.
[01:48:09.068 --> 01:48:11.509]  But that'll change.
[01:48:11.509 --> 01:48:27.740]  And I guess my message is every ounce of energy I have, every dollar I have and can raise, every trick of the trade I can deploy, I will deploy to smashing this law.
[01:48:29.364 --> 01:48:30.425]  And I think you know that's true.
[01:48:30.425 --> 01:48:38.670]  I think we'll have books and billboards and TV videos and lawn signs.
[01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:45.715]  And we'll do all sorts of crazy things in defense of free speech and freedom of the press.
[01:48:45.715 --> 01:48:46.676]  And we'll do it all.
[01:48:48.019 --> 01:48:49.880]  And it's not what I really want to do.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.823]  I want to live my life and do my journalism.
[01:48:52.823 --> 01:49:07.616]  But if you guys are going to put me through a trial because I wrote and published and promoted an election book during an election, I'm going to do everything I can to show you and the country that's not Canadian.
[01:49:08.231 --> 01:49:11.696]  You're being un-Canadian by summoning an author to your offices.
[01:49:11.696 --> 01:49:14.380]  You're being un-Canadian and you need a reminder.
[01:49:24.415 --> 01:49:25.836]  But they're jerks, okay?
[01:49:25.836 --> 01:49:29.859]  He's just playing what he responded to, and I think that's good because he was very eloquent.
[01:49:29.859 --> 01:49:39.305]  And it was beyond tears to my eyes this morning when I heard him after, like, you know, you're guilty, so you want to probably walk this back and do what we tell you right now.
[01:49:39.305 --> 01:49:40.306]  And he says, no, you know what?
[01:49:40.306 --> 01:49:41.226]  You're guilty.
[01:49:41.226 --> 01:49:41.807]  You're the ones.
[01:49:41.807 --> 01:49:44.148]  It's pathetic how you follow orders.
[01:49:44.148 --> 01:49:46.049]  What level of orders won't you follow?
[01:49:46.049 --> 01:49:46.390]  It's like
[01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:50.798]  A Perry Mason or Kill a Mockingbird moment, but this is real.
[01:49:50.798 --> 01:49:55.748]  The stuff Hollywood made about tyranny, I'm watching it, and I looked up the law.
[01:49:55.748 --> 01:49:58.453]  You're facing years in prison for this, and they're clearly...
[01:50:00.163 --> 01:50:03.245]  You're like, well, you can leave now if you want, but you need to answer our questions.
[01:50:03.245 --> 01:50:04.446]  And yeah, we're going to come get you.
[01:50:04.446 --> 01:50:05.928]  Are you going to come to my offices and raid me?
[01:50:05.928 --> 01:50:08.910]  And they're like, yeah, we want to know about your employees.
[01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:09.450]  We want to get there.
[01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:10.591]  Like, this isn't about your book.
[01:50:10.591 --> 01:50:12.032]  And then later, it's like, it's the book.
[01:50:12.032 --> 01:50:12.793]  It's about the book.
[01:50:12.793 --> 01:50:14.454]  I mean, they're lying.
[01:50:14.454 --> 01:50:16.356]  They're changing what they're saying.
[01:50:16.356 --> 01:50:18.237]  And they are enjoying it.
[01:50:18.237 --> 01:50:22.120]  It's one thing if they followed orders and were like, we're here to ask you this, sir, to please answer.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:22.861]  That'd be bad enough.
[01:50:22.861 --> 01:50:24.622]  But they are loving it.
[01:50:24.622 --> 01:50:28.105]  I mean, they are so pompous.
[01:50:28.105 --> 01:50:29.646]  And just, it's disgusting.
[01:50:30.939 --> 01:50:33.001]  You know, they asked me a lot of strange things.
[01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:36.344]  I mean, I predict, Alex, that there will be probably
[01:50:37.934 --> 01:50:42.135]  1,000 books this year about Donald Trump and the election.
[01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:46.797]  Not all of them will be published by big-name publishing houses, but these days there's a lot of amateur authors.
[01:50:46.797 --> 01:50:47.277]  Well, quantify that.
[01:50:47.277 --> 01:50:51.678]  There were dozens of books pro Trudeau, and it's totally legal to publish a book.
[01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.959]  They're claiming you're doing campaign finance.
[01:50:53.959 --> 01:50:54.859]  They say it all.
[01:50:54.859 --> 01:50:56.039]  You're like, here's the law!
[01:50:56.039 --> 01:50:56.659]  I'm not!
[01:50:56.659 --> 01:50:57.760]  I'm a media person!
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.080]  Yes, I don't like Mr. Blackface!
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.421]  And they're like, well, you're going to jail.
[01:51:03.467 --> 01:51:09.850]  Well, and that's the thing, is of course the books are published during the election, because I want to... They're like, why did you do that during the election?
[01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:10.971]  You're like, for the election.
[01:51:10.971 --> 01:51:12.532]  He goes, we got you, sir.
[01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:13.292]  That's a crime.
[01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:15.573]  You're like, dude, what are you talking about?
[01:51:15.573 --> 01:51:17.854]  It's insane.
[01:51:17.854 --> 01:51:24.658]  You know, I don't know if we have time, but there's one clip your producers have called, did you think about the timing of the book?
[01:51:24.658 --> 01:51:29.240]  And if we got time, maybe it's interesting to watch it, because they're implying... Yeah, that's clip three.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.801]  Did you think about the timing of the book?
[01:51:30.801 --> 01:51:31.141]  Here it is.
[01:51:32.162 --> 01:51:37.306]  ...knowledge that you would have or not have of the Election Act, the Canada Elections Act.
[01:51:37.306 --> 01:52:00.921]  When you are planning the book, and you, the new third party rules, because I believe there's some comments on your set as well about that, did you give any consideration of saying, maybe I should register as a third party for this circumstance, or maybe I shouldn't, because of my interpretation of what I'm going to do, or did you
[01:52:02.361 --> 01:52:04.741]  Not make that determination.
[01:52:04.741 --> 01:52:06.422]  Tim, I appreciate the question.
[01:52:06.422 --> 01:52:08.662]  Yeah, I absolutely did think about that at great length.
[01:52:08.662 --> 01:52:15.523]  Do you want to share any of those thoughts?
[01:52:15.523 --> 01:52:16.603]  I'm sure some of them.
[01:52:16.603 --> 01:52:30.746]  I mean, I thought the day I register with the government to write a book is the day we no longer are the True North strong and free.
[01:52:30.746 --> 01:52:31.186]  And if
[01:52:32.429 --> 01:52:45.880]  Elections Canada's commissioners are stupid enough to prosecute me for writing, publishing, and promoting a book about an election during an election, then that's an important fight to have.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:51.545]  Because we need to roll back these pencil-neck bureaucrats and their blackface boss.
[01:52:51.545 --> 01:52:54.767]  And we need to remind them that we're still a free country.
[01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.469]  So I thought about it long and hard, Tim.
[01:52:57.561 --> 01:53:01.810]  And folks, playing clips can't even do it justice when you see the stuff they're saying to him and how he responds.
[01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:04.375]  But I can't listen to their voices, so we're not going to play it.
[01:53:04.375 --> 01:53:07.461]  If you want to go watch it, it's at InfoWars.com and the article.
[01:53:07.461 --> 01:53:08.222]  You need to spread it, but...
[01:53:09.266 --> 01:53:19.350]  This is real tyranny, ladies and gentlemen, because I've read the Canadian law and it's like, oh, of course, if you're just a citizen or a group and it's your speech, you can publish a book any way you want.
[01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:26.033]  But if you're a political group and it's a political publication by the party or by a third party as an action group, you've got to tell us.
[01:53:26.033 --> 01:53:31.635]  They're trying to get him to say, yes, I'm a political action group and opt in to go into jail.
[01:53:31.635 --> 01:53:33.735]  And they're telling him, you're guilty, buddy.
[01:53:33.735 --> 01:53:35.716]  You admit you did this in the election.
[01:53:35.716 --> 01:53:37.037]  No crap, Sherlock.
[01:53:37.817 --> 01:53:41.039]  Of course I don't like this piece of garbage and I'm doing this.
[01:53:41.039 --> 01:53:42.200]  It's my speech.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.101]  The Magna Carta 1215.
[01:53:44.101 --> 01:53:45.842]  That's still in charge in Canada.
[01:53:45.842 --> 01:53:46.903]  Common law.
[01:53:46.903 --> 01:53:49.425]  And it's just outrageous.
[01:53:49.425 --> 01:53:54.969]  It's not tiptoeing towards North Korea or Communist China or Nazi Germany or Mao.
[01:53:54.969 --> 01:53:55.969]  It's here.
[01:53:55.969 --> 01:53:58.451]  And again, the enjoyment.
[01:53:58.451 --> 01:54:03.194]  These guys look like they are on cloud nine when they're looking at you.
[01:54:03.194 --> 01:54:06.957]  They are enjoying this because they're superior to you.
[01:54:06.957 --> 01:54:07.497]  But it's obvious.
[01:54:07.777 --> 01:54:11.598]  You're superior to them in intellect and justice and will.
[01:54:11.598 --> 01:54:14.138]  Because I know your story, all the great work you've done, how you've been persecuted.
[01:54:14.138 --> 01:54:15.238]  You don't make a big deal about it.
[01:54:15.238 --> 01:54:16.539]  We've been persecuted too.
[01:54:16.539 --> 01:54:18.579]  And it's not like we're victims.
[01:54:18.579 --> 01:54:23.020]  I see this and I just am saying to humanity, we're not putting up with this.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.340]  This is B.S.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:29.941]  Well, you know, it's funny you mentioned earlier that my book hit number two in the Canadian bestseller list.
[01:54:29.941 --> 01:54:31.461]  I was pretty proud of that.
[01:54:31.461 --> 01:54:36.822]  But yesterday, after we published these hidden videos, my book
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:38.360]  We're good to go.
[01:54:54.884 --> 01:54:57.505]  By what they saw in this video, it was trending in Canada.
[01:54:57.505 --> 01:54:58.365]  Oh, that's the good news!
[01:54:58.365 --> 01:54:59.226]  Total revulsion!
[01:54:59.226 --> 01:55:00.546]  Michael's the number one!
[01:55:00.546 --> 01:55:02.227]  Well, number one, congratulations.
[01:55:02.227 --> 01:55:03.047]  I haven't read your book.
[01:55:03.047 --> 01:55:04.668]  We need to sell it.
[01:55:04.668 --> 01:55:06.089]  It's amazing.
[01:55:06.089 --> 01:55:07.789]  I know you've got to go, but we've got to go to break.
[01:55:07.789 --> 01:55:10.030]  Come back and do five more minutes on where you see all this going.
[01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:17.273]  And we have former Congressman Bob Barr joining us, who ran the impeachment, started the impeachment against Clinton to give us his expert take.
[01:55:17.273 --> 01:55:20.175]  You couldn't do better on a day like this with the president.
[01:55:20.175 --> 01:55:20.935]  And we'll have the latest.
[01:55:21.135 --> 01:55:22.056]  Are they going to go with witnesses?
[01:55:22.056 --> 01:55:22.636]  We don't know yet.
[01:55:22.636 --> 01:55:23.397]  We're checking.
[01:55:23.397 --> 01:55:24.538]  Shots fired at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:55:24.538 --> 01:55:29.001]  Speaking of funding, that's the lifeblood.
[01:55:29.001 --> 01:55:32.824]  An intellectual pit bull like Ezra Levant can stay in the fight.
[01:55:32.824 --> 01:55:33.604]  He'll win the fight.
[01:55:33.604 --> 01:55:35.386]  But he's got to have oxygen.
[01:55:35.386 --> 01:55:36.867]  He's got to have oxygen.
[01:55:36.867 --> 01:55:39.409]  If he doesn't have oxygen, he's got the spirit to fight.
[01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:44.003]  But he's, the spirit's willing, okay, but the body's weak.
[01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.004]  He will not be able to fight.
[01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:48.889]  And I know they've decimated him from where he was, going to the very top.
[01:55:48.889 --> 01:55:50.270]  And they said, nope, you're done.
[01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:51.432]  You invested everything you had.
[01:55:51.432 --> 01:55:52.152]  Same with us.
[01:55:52.152 --> 01:55:54.835]  They're trying to wrecking ball us, because they're trying to wrecking ball you.
[01:55:55.396 --> 01:55:57.519]  And that's why everybody needs storable food.
[01:55:57.519 --> 01:55:59.823]  Yeah, this virus may be terrible, may not be.
[01:55:59.823 --> 01:56:00.764]  Everybody needs storable food.
[01:56:00.764 --> 01:56:01.525]  We've got the best.
[01:56:01.525 --> 01:56:02.827]  It's selling out all over the country.
[01:56:02.827 --> 01:56:03.608]  We still have it.
[01:56:03.608 --> 01:56:04.930]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:04.930 --> 01:56:06.813]  We have the very best nano.
[01:56:06.813 --> 01:56:08.576]  I haven't even gotten to this.
[01:56:08.576 --> 01:56:10.358]  I have congressional reports.
[01:56:10.859 --> 01:56:19.661]  Confirm, University A&M, that we have the patented nano-silver that is the very best, and of course they're patriots, and we have developed this immune gargle.
[01:56:19.661 --> 01:56:23.042]  And I'm not going back to full price, even though we're going to sell out of it very soon.
[01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:26.123]  It's still 40% off, Infowarshore.com.
[01:56:26.123 --> 01:56:29.763]  16 ounces of nano-silver, beyond colloidal, immune gargle.
[01:56:29.763 --> 01:56:32.144]  It also has iodine, Infowarshore.com.
[01:56:32.144 --> 01:56:35.465]  And we have it in these smaller containers as well, in the little spray bottles.
[01:56:36.425 --> 01:56:41.229]  That's something you need that's great, that's a good value, an excellent value, that funds us.
[01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:45.092]  And believe me, man, it's, for me, I don't give a rat's ass about status and stuff.
[01:56:45.092 --> 01:56:45.832]  Everybody knows that.
[01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:46.893]  I could have already had all that.
[01:56:46.893 --> 01:56:48.915]  They tried to get me on their team.
[01:56:48.915 --> 01:56:50.596]  They're like, don't you want to star in major movies?
[01:56:50.596 --> 01:56:52.417]  This was like 15 years ago, the last time I said no.
[01:56:52.417 --> 01:56:53.638]  They're like, how about 10 million?
[01:56:53.638 --> 01:56:53.918]  I'm like, no.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:59.741]  All I care about is authenticity, just like you do.
[01:56:59.741 --> 01:57:02.262]  I don't want to have sex with a sex robot that's plastic.
[01:57:02.262 --> 01:57:02.963]  I want my wife.
[01:57:02.963 --> 01:57:04.904]  I mean, it's not like that's even a big deal.
[01:57:04.904 --> 01:57:06.324]  Yeah, obviously.
[01:57:06.324 --> 01:57:07.125]  I'm the real McCoy.
[01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:08.345]  You're the real McCoy.
[01:57:08.345 --> 01:57:10.026]  But you need these products.
[01:57:10.026 --> 01:57:11.207]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:11.207 --> 01:57:11.827]  And I can tell you,
[01:57:12.881 --> 01:57:16.183]  Within 12 days or so, MyPatriot's going to be sold out.
[01:57:16.183 --> 01:57:17.604]  They're trying to get more food supplies.
[01:57:17.604 --> 01:57:18.805]  They're trying to get them in.
[01:57:18.805 --> 01:57:19.626]  That may happen.
[01:57:19.626 --> 01:57:21.187]  All the other competitors are sold out.
[01:57:21.187 --> 01:57:22.507]  They're telling you they're not.
[01:57:22.507 --> 01:57:23.548]  They're lying to you.
[01:57:23.548 --> 01:57:25.690]  That's why at MyPatriot, they don't do that.
[01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:26.870]  It's drop-shipped instantly.
[01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:28.632]  They're on our computer system, linked up.
[01:57:28.632 --> 01:57:30.353]  It just comes in, boom, front of the line.
[01:57:30.353 --> 01:57:30.833]  It goes out.
[01:57:30.833 --> 01:57:33.135]  Best deals you're going to find on their amazing food.
[01:57:33.135 --> 01:57:34.215]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:57:34.215 --> 01:57:36.977]  And then it's that good peace of mind, and it funds the Infowar.
[01:57:36.977 --> 01:57:38.938]  All points of the compass are then covered.
[01:57:38.938 --> 01:57:40.259]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:57:40.259 --> 01:57:41.200]  Take action.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.561]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:42.561 --> 01:57:42.821]  Stay with us.
[01:57:45.883 --> 01:57:50.045]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[01:57:50.045 --> 01:58:00.412]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:58:00.412 --> 01:58:07.176]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[01:58:07.936 --> 01:58:17.709]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:20.392]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[01:58:21.237 --> 01:58:26.400]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:31.362]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[01:58:31.362 --> 01:58:33.743]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[01:58:33.743 --> 01:58:39.526]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[01:58:39.526 --> 01:58:41.507]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[01:58:41.507 --> 01:58:44.609]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[01:58:47.014 --> 01:58:48.735]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:58:48.735 --> 01:58:50.835]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:58:50.835 --> 01:58:52.596]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:58:52.596 --> 01:58:54.336]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:58:54.336 --> 01:58:59.678]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:58:59.678 --> 01:59:01.539]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:59:01.539 --> 01:59:02.839]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:59:02.839 --> 01:59:04.600]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.080]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:08.781]  And I want to expand to the face of the globalist, not contract.
[01:59:08.781 --> 01:59:09.921]  I don't want them to win.
[01:59:09.921 --> 01:59:10.741]  So listen.
[01:59:10.741 --> 01:59:11.882]  You've got this guarantee from me.
[01:59:12.847 --> 01:59:15.949]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:59:15.949 --> 01:59:19.111]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists enough of their money.
[01:59:19.111 --> 01:59:22.914]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:59:22.914 --> 01:59:24.495]  These will change your life.
[01:59:24.495 --> 01:59:25.896]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:59:25.896 --> 01:59:27.897]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:59:27.897 --> 01:59:28.578]  Check it all out.
[01:59:28.578 --> 01:59:30.539]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:59:30.539 --> 01:59:32.320]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.721]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:59:33.721 --> 01:59:35.282]  You'll get great products at the same time.
[01:59:35.282 --> 01:59:37.744]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:59:37.744 --> 01:59:39.925]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[01:59:39.925 --> 01:59:42.807]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[01:59:50.351 --> 01:59:52.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:10.623 --> 02:00:14.285]  Democrats just rolled out a massive voter suppression program.
[02:00:14.285 --> 02:00:15.346]  Everything with them is inverted.
[02:00:15.346 --> 02:00:17.527]  They say, oh, we're going to stop voter suppression.
[02:00:17.527 --> 02:00:24.571]  So if you criticize someone politically, if you're a conservative or nationalist or patriot, they call that suppression.
[02:00:24.571 --> 02:00:26.872]  So arguing with someone is censoring them.
[02:00:26.872 --> 02:00:27.673]  So then they censor you.
[02:00:28.649 --> 02:00:31.310]  The left's always like, oh, don't censor me when I'm arguing.
[02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:32.951]  Me arguing with you is not censorship.
[02:00:32.951 --> 02:00:36.593]  But see, disagreeing with the left is, then they suppress you.
[02:00:36.593 --> 02:00:43.697]  Ezra Levant, again, we can't do justice here in the time we have to the footage.
[02:00:43.697 --> 02:00:51.080]  And again, the fact that these are a federal police, a federal body, they call you there with this letter.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:52.521]  You go there.
[02:00:52.521 --> 02:00:54.702]  You're a very professional, better named lawyer, I've heard.
[02:00:56.303 --> 02:00:59.905]  They're all secretive and just act very, very bizarre.
[02:00:59.905 --> 02:01:02.347]  It's amazing.
[02:01:02.347 --> 02:01:07.730]  Other comments about where this is going and how many years in jail, because he tells you you're guilty.
[02:01:07.730 --> 02:01:09.651]  And I was looking at the statutes.
[02:01:09.651 --> 02:01:18.497]  I mean, you could spend years in jail, according to them, saying that you're a political action group violating campaign law when you're a publisher that wrote a book.
[02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:27.203]  Yeah, I've never seen any other author be summoned in by the police, except in tyrannical regimes.
[02:01:27.203 --> 02:01:30.645]  You know, he asked me why I didn't register my book with the government.
[02:01:30.645 --> 02:01:32.366]  I think we played that clip there.
[02:01:32.366 --> 02:01:41.131]  When I was a kid, I learned that in the Soviet bloc, typewriters in the country of Romania that was under the Soviet domination... Well registered.
[02:01:42.105 --> 02:01:42.766]  That's right.
[02:01:42.766 --> 02:01:43.586]  And you know what?
[02:01:43.586 --> 02:01:50.733]  You had to not only tell the police you had it, but you had to do a typing sample, because you know each typewriter is slightly different.
[02:01:50.733 --> 02:01:53.495]  It's like a fingerprint the way those metal keys strike.
[02:01:53.495 --> 02:02:03.264]  So they would keep a sample of how your typewriter typed in case they were to find some illegal samizdat, some illegal propaganda.
[02:02:03.264 --> 02:02:06.007]  They would know whose typewriter it came from.
[02:02:06.007 --> 02:02:08.449]  I don't believe in registering books with the government.
[02:02:09.361 --> 02:02:16.273]  Or typewriters, or whatever the media of the day is, but these guys apparently do.
[02:02:16.273 --> 02:02:18.276]  Well, again, I watch Body Language, and...
[02:02:19.758 --> 02:02:22.421]  Those guys are arrogant and dangerous.
[02:02:22.421 --> 02:02:26.845]  I mean, I think they're the clear and present danger, and Trudeau's a danger, and the left everywhere.
[02:02:26.845 --> 02:02:28.066]  This isn't like in a vacuum.
[02:02:28.066 --> 02:02:29.188]  Everywhere they're doing this.
[02:02:29.188 --> 02:02:34.893]  Europe, the U.S., universities, and they just do it like they have the right because they know best.
[02:02:34.893 --> 02:02:41.720]  And dammit, you published a book about the Prime Minister that's a bestseller and exposing him, so we're getting you ready for criminal charges.
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.022]  And I think they're arrogant enough.
[02:02:44.255 --> 02:02:54.900]  Ezra to do it, but just like them trying to block Brexit only blew up bigger, them trying to crush Trump only blew up bigger, the tyrants are following the same dead end right down a black hole.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:57.761]  Thanks to you, the few good men that have courage.
[02:02:57.761 --> 02:02:58.901]  And I do admire you.
[02:02:58.901 --> 02:03:01.963]  You've got the spirit, brother, and I thank you.
[02:03:01.963 --> 02:03:03.683]  Well, you're very kind to say it.
[02:03:03.683 --> 02:03:05.124]  Let me make one observation.
[02:03:06.034 --> 02:03:09.155]  In Canada, we have groups like the ACLU.
[02:03:09.155 --> 02:03:12.396]  Up here, it's called the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.
[02:03:12.396 --> 02:03:14.637]  We have something called PEN Canada.
[02:03:14.637 --> 02:03:17.338]  We got Canadian Journalists for Free Expression.
[02:03:17.338 --> 02:03:21.320]  We got the Canadian... Let me guess, they're all missing in action?
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.701]  I haven't heard from one of them.
[02:03:23.701 --> 02:03:30.123]  I can assure you if the shoe were on the other foot, if it was under our former... Chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:03:30.123 --> 02:03:32.564]  Chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:03:32.564 --> 02:03:34.965]  Well, you know, they keep saying Trump is...
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:40.183]  He's at war with the media, he's rolling back press freedoms.
[02:03:40.183 --> 02:03:42.325]  No, no, he's only speaking back against them.
[02:03:42.325 --> 02:03:43.105]  Sorry, go ahead, you're right.
[02:03:43.105 --> 02:03:45.707]  Yeah, that's all he's doing is talking back and they don't like it.
[02:03:45.707 --> 02:03:52.872]  Here in Canada we have true government restrictions on journalism and authors and complete silence from the left.
[02:03:52.872 --> 02:04:02.499]  In fact, I've got to tell you, I've had more interest from American talk radio hosts than from Canada because even our media has learned to be submissive.
[02:04:02.899 --> 02:04:05.601]  And I have a streak of independence.
[02:04:05.601 --> 02:04:11.064]  The left are only clients for islamicists and globalists who they're bringing in to be their client groups to dominate us.
[02:04:11.064 --> 02:04:12.465]  We're being enslaved.
[02:04:12.465 --> 02:04:18.008]  And western values are being completely overthrown and we have to just admit it.
[02:04:18.008 --> 02:04:20.950]  Well listen, we'll keep fighting up here as long as we can.
[02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:28.295]  We have so much culturally in common with America because we both come from the same tradition of the Magna Carta as you said in the UK.
[02:04:29.326 --> 02:04:31.688]  I regret that we didn't stand firm.
[02:04:31.688 --> 02:04:37.631]  We didn't get the First Amendment style protections put in our Constitution when we were born.
[02:04:37.631 --> 02:04:40.193]  So keep yours, Alex.
[02:04:40.193 --> 02:04:40.913]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:40.913 --> 02:04:42.314]  Please come on soon.
[02:04:42.314 --> 02:04:43.595]  Just about the news and what's happening.
[02:04:43.595 --> 02:04:45.396]  I want to get you as a mainstay.
[02:04:45.396 --> 02:04:46.397]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:46.397 --> 02:04:47.057]  Ezra Ravine.
[02:04:47.057 --> 02:04:49.258]  Incredibly powerful video up on Infowars.com.
[02:04:49.258 --> 02:04:50.679]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:50.679 --> 02:04:51.400]  Thank you.
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.041]  We'll be back with Bob Barr.
[02:04:54.994 --> 02:04:59.756]  There's a new way to show your support for the InfoWars crew at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:05:22.143 --> 02:05:24.464]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[02:05:24.804 --> 02:05:28.627]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[02:05:28.627 --> 02:05:33.471]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.

[02:05:42.378 --> 02:05:49.583]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[02:05:49.583 --> 02:05:54.127]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[02:06:06.741 --> 02:06:13.205]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.205 --> 02:06:15.266]  Okay, we're back live.
[02:06:32.433 --> 02:06:57.277]  And again, if you were just with us last hour, no one in the middle of the Senate trial coming to the head of the president, and shots fired at Mar-a-Lago, and giant viral outbreak, and UN global emergencies, and China secretly burning bodies, and mass fire graves, would spend three segments, four segments with a journalist.
[02:06:59.161 --> 02:07:02.022]  But I know the stuff they've done to Ezra Vance.
[02:07:02.022 --> 02:07:05.683]  And he just keeps beavering on.
[02:07:05.683 --> 02:07:14.447]  But it's like... I got violently angry yesterday when I saw senators saying we should maybe arrest Rand Paul.
[02:07:14.447 --> 02:07:16.687]  These are dangerous people, okay?
[02:07:16.687 --> 02:07:17.968]  Not Rand Paul.
[02:07:17.968 --> 02:07:25.231]  He's the one trying to stop wars.
[02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:25.351]  And...
[02:07:26.641 --> 02:07:28.321]  I just want them off our back, man.
[02:07:28.321 --> 02:07:31.982]  I just want these globalists off our back, and I know you do as well.
[02:07:31.982 --> 02:07:34.343]  I just respect you as listeners.
[02:07:34.343 --> 02:07:37.384]  I mean, you're so frickin' precious, man.
[02:07:37.384 --> 02:07:39.804]  You're the people that actually care.
[02:07:39.804 --> 02:07:43.205]  And you're so humble, you're always like, oh Alex, thank you, thank you.
[02:07:43.205 --> 02:07:47.326]  Do you understand, for my children, how important you are?
[02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:48.687]  The future we're building together?
[02:07:48.687 --> 02:07:50.647]  I mean, we're together.
[02:07:50.647 --> 02:07:52.568]  Black, white, old, young, you name it.
[02:07:54.039 --> 02:08:00.302]  They want to tell us, come together under the unification of the globalists while they're doing nothing but stirring us up against each other.
[02:08:00.302 --> 02:08:06.645]  We need the natural, real unity of common sense and God that brings us together.
[02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:10.667]  But I mean, I'll just, I'll just, I'll just spell it out here.
[02:08:10.667 --> 02:08:19.631]  I am blown away by how evil the deep state is and how sick they are and how filthy they are and how lying and stupid.
[02:08:19.631 --> 02:08:20.752]  And then it hits me.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:25.801]  These people have been winning for a long time.
[02:08:25.801 --> 02:08:32.563]  They have been absolutely dominating us.
[02:08:32.563 --> 02:08:35.565]  And so, that makes me feel like a wimp.
[02:08:35.565 --> 02:08:39.366]  Because I don't have something to prove, but I also am not going to lay down.
[02:08:39.366 --> 02:08:41.987]  And again, there's a lot of guys that can kick my ass, okay?
[02:08:41.987 --> 02:08:51.190]  But I remember being a little kid and getting off the bus in like 6th grade, 5th grade, and kids were 3 or 4 years old getting on me and beating me up and stuff.
[02:08:53.450 --> 02:09:02.136]  Until that moment when I just got angry and picked up, you know, a rock that was on the ground and, yeah, basically put the kid's eye out.
[02:09:02.136 --> 02:09:06.580]  And their parents got mad, like, well, your 15-year-old, 16-year-old shouldn't be trying to beat up 11-year-olds.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:09.582]  But they don't have the killer instinct, folks.
[02:09:09.582 --> 02:09:10.663]  We do.
[02:09:10.663 --> 02:09:12.564]  That's why they're bullies and scum.
[02:09:12.564 --> 02:09:14.886]  Those of us that have it don't need to abuse the power.
[02:09:14.886 --> 02:09:16.086]  We've got it.
[02:09:16.086 --> 02:09:17.768]  Much voltage as we need, God will give it to us.
[02:09:18.663 --> 02:09:24.026]  And every time the enemy stands up and tries to take us on, they find out that, oh, we weren't acting powerful.
[02:09:24.026 --> 02:09:26.848]  We weren't trying to run people's lives because we didn't need to do that.
[02:09:26.848 --> 02:09:29.129]  We already had the power.
[02:09:29.129 --> 02:09:37.234]  And what I'm getting at is, we have allowed these people to do this to us.
[02:09:37.234 --> 02:09:38.075]  And so it's our fault.
[02:09:38.075 --> 02:09:40.276]  If you want to know who's to blame, look in the mirror.
[02:09:40.276 --> 02:09:42.297]  And I'm saying that myself.
[02:09:42.297 --> 02:09:43.218]  I've made a lot of mistakes.
[02:09:44.605 --> 02:09:47.207]  So when I preach this stuff, it's what I think we ought to do.
[02:09:47.207 --> 02:09:48.128]  And I think you agree with me.
[02:09:48.128 --> 02:09:55.713]  It's not me up here on some damn high horse like some glitterbug preacher acting like he's perfect and he's got all the answers.
[02:09:55.713 --> 02:09:57.855]  B.S.
[02:09:57.855 --> 02:09:59.596]  God's got all the answers.
[02:09:59.596 --> 02:10:02.738]  And right action will prove those answers and will make you stronger.
[02:10:02.738 --> 02:10:05.160]  And that's a path we've all got to walk.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.784]  Anybody telling you they got it all figured out, they got a one-size-fits-all, and they got it all right, they better watch that person.
[02:10:10.784 --> 02:10:11.725]  That's a cult leader right there.
[02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:15.473]  There's no cult here, except the cult of Jesus Christ.
[02:10:15.473 --> 02:10:22.399]  And people say, man, the more and more you preach, it's not all I got, it's everything.
[02:10:22.399 --> 02:10:26.543]  It's expansive, it's real, and the enemy runs from it.
[02:10:26.543 --> 02:10:28.344]  That name is real.
[02:10:28.344 --> 02:10:33.208]  And you could just be a scientist and wonder why the hell these people run from it.
[02:10:33.208 --> 02:10:34.169]  Why they're so scared of it.
[02:10:35.663 --> 02:10:37.724]  I get obsessed with silly stuff like this.
[02:10:37.724 --> 02:10:39.625]  I've got this lav mic on so I can walk around.
[02:10:39.625 --> 02:10:42.586]  I haven't been walking around today.
[02:10:42.586 --> 02:10:43.686]  There's a lot of news to cover.
[02:10:43.686 --> 02:10:45.467]  I didn't really get to a lot of calls today.
[02:10:45.467 --> 02:10:50.049]  We've got Bob Barr, who actually initiated the impeachment against Bill Clinton, coming up.
[02:10:50.049 --> 02:10:55.111]  I couldn't think of a better guest in this whole constellation of news.
[02:10:55.111 --> 02:10:57.512]  I want to get Robert Barnes back on as well.
[02:10:57.512 --> 02:11:03.454]  I was saying, get Barnes on, get Barnes on, but I must have mumbled over the phones that they got Bob Barr, but see how
[02:11:05.194 --> 02:11:07.135]  Sometimes God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.
[02:11:07.135 --> 02:11:08.555]  Because I want to get Barnes back on too.
[02:11:08.555 --> 02:11:09.276]  He's always so busy.
[02:11:09.276 --> 02:11:11.376]  But Bob Barr, oh that's really great.
[02:11:11.376 --> 02:11:12.097]  I'm glad.
[02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.437]  Are you mad we actually got Bob Barr?
[02:11:13.437 --> 02:11:15.398]  I'm like, no, I'm glad you got Bob Barr.
[02:11:15.398 --> 02:11:17.439]  In fact, you should have thought of that.
[02:11:17.439 --> 02:11:18.279]  We should get him on.
[02:11:18.279 --> 02:11:27.803]  He started the impeachment and, you know, got that initiated in the House of Representatives and got punished by the political establishment for it.
[02:11:27.803 --> 02:11:28.483]  So that's coming up.
[02:11:35.239 --> 02:11:45.265]  Something big's about to happen, and I'm not sure it's this virus, but we need to have our bases covered with the virus.
[02:11:45.265 --> 02:11:55.230]  And, you know, I said I would talk about this, but it's such big news that we'll go to a break and come back with a guest, so I'm going to do it right now, because this is an important decision for all you out there to think about and decide what you're going to do.
[02:11:55.230 --> 02:11:56.611]  But can I get an overhead shot, guys?
[02:11:56.611 --> 02:12:00.293]  I want to show you something that I've been authorized to show you.
[02:12:00.293 --> 02:12:02.314]  This is in Congress.
[02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:02.774]  This is 13 years ago.
[02:12:05.706 --> 02:12:07.847]  And this is the company.
[02:12:07.847 --> 02:12:15.468]  And when I got this information four or five days ago, I said, listen, are you sure you want me to do this?
[02:12:15.468 --> 02:12:20.069]  Because you've got Department of Defense contracts, you've got a lot of others, and they might mess with you.
[02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:22.050]  No, no, we're the owners.
[02:12:22.050 --> 02:12:22.670]  We like what you're doing.
[02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:23.610]  We've got a partnership with you.
[02:12:23.610 --> 02:12:25.911]  We want people to know how important this is.
[02:12:25.911 --> 02:12:33.513]  The Department of Defense and congressional reports say that this product, NanoSilver, has been found to knock out SARS.
[02:12:33.513 --> 02:12:34.873]  Well, no crap, Sherlock.
[02:12:36.374 --> 02:12:37.535]  Of course it does.
[02:12:37.535 --> 02:12:39.336]  Viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[02:12:39.336 --> 02:12:42.618]  Nobody's selling 16 ounces of nano-silver that's patented.
[02:12:42.618 --> 02:12:43.979]  This is the top company in the U.S.
[02:12:43.979 --> 02:12:45.520]  that we're not even proud to label.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.121]  This is something they developed with my dad.
[02:12:47.121 --> 02:12:48.281]  The Immune Gargle.
[02:12:48.281 --> 02:12:52.504]  Ridiculous name, but that's a technical, medical name, and you can drink it, and it's all...
[02:12:54.753 --> 02:12:56.893]  That's what my dad, who's an oral surgeon and dentist, named it.
[02:12:56.893 --> 02:12:58.294]  So, that's what we're going to call it.
[02:12:58.294 --> 02:13:03.275]  But SuperSilver Immune Gargle in three different sizes is selling out, but I'm still keeping it at 40% off.
[02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:08.096]  Despite that, 50% off and you get all three together because we're not going to raise prices during a crisis.
[02:13:08.096 --> 02:13:09.996]  We're not going to gouge people.
[02:13:09.996 --> 02:13:11.897]  But here's the deal.
[02:13:11.897 --> 02:13:17.398]  Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, Tampa Point Boulevard.
[02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:33.881]  And it goes into Andrew C. von Edenbach, Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration, and they go on to say that with antibiotic resistance and all the rest of it, we have found that this particular type of nanosilver is effective against SARS and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:13:33.881 --> 02:13:36.704]  Then it goes on here.
[02:13:36.704 --> 02:13:41.667]  The Texas A&M System Health Science Center.
[02:13:41.667 --> 02:13:44.850]  And it says confidential.
[02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.130]  Because
[02:13:47.202 --> 02:13:49.864]  They don't want this type of stuff out for a lot of reasons.
[02:13:49.864 --> 02:13:59.912]  And it goes over the fact and says, Dear Secretary Ridge, and they go on to say the Office of Homeland Security, John B. Conley building.
[02:13:59.912 --> 02:14:03.755]  So that A&M is running a whole secret project for the government.
[02:14:03.755 --> 02:14:14.803]  And they say this particular nano silver we found in our trials, secret trials, with American biotech labs was very effective.
[02:14:16.872 --> 02:14:24.457]  This report is that the coronavirus, like the SARS, same family virus, Homeland Defense, put out the data that our product could kill that one.
[02:14:24.457 --> 02:14:34.284]  See the above letter from the Director of Homeland Security, the Secretary, Dr. Carlton, ex-Surgeon General Air Force, is a brilliant man who came up with the model hospital system, mobile hospital system.
[02:14:34.284 --> 02:14:42.769]  We only received a copy of it because our testimony before Congress on malaria, and it was included in the addendum of the testimony.
[02:14:42.769 --> 02:14:46.292]  We never received a good copy, but we did get a copy, and it's worth reading.
[02:14:47.473 --> 02:14:48.815]  And it goes on.
[02:14:48.815 --> 02:14:50.959]  So, I mean, look.
[02:14:50.959 --> 02:14:53.984]  It's the grace of God that stuff like this happens.
[02:14:53.984 --> 02:14:56.749]  He's killing himself still doing dentistry and managing a bunch of companies.
[02:14:57.850 --> 02:15:00.632]  Like seven, eight years ago, and I said, Dad, I need you to come in and manage supplements.
[02:15:00.632 --> 02:15:02.334]  We need to put on our own, put out the best.
[02:15:02.334 --> 02:15:03.455]  And you've brought stuff.
[02:15:03.455 --> 02:15:05.737]  He's done research scientists as well, does some things.
[02:15:05.737 --> 02:15:08.739]  I said, we need you to bring us really the best stuff and help certify everything.
[02:15:08.739 --> 02:15:09.900]  And he did it.
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.944]  And then he brought us the folks that are in the super silver toothpaste, the super blue toothpaste.
[02:15:14.944 --> 02:15:16.366]  It has the nano silver.
[02:15:16.366 --> 02:15:18.648]  This is the top company, folks.
[02:15:18.648 --> 02:15:20.909]  And they're like, no, just say who we are.
[02:15:20.909 --> 02:15:23.812]  Dr. Keith Moeller, CEO, American Biotech Labs, LLC.
[02:15:23.812 --> 02:15:24.853]  That's the big one.
[02:15:24.853 --> 02:15:26.214]  They're the only ones that have approved.
[02:15:28.999 --> 02:15:31.240]  Over-the-counter, super silver womb gel.
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:32.480]  Do not take this internally.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.321]  This is super... Well, let's just say what it is.
[02:15:35.321 --> 02:15:40.403]  Poisonous to bacteria and viruses, which means it ain't too good for you, but it's better than dying, right?
[02:15:40.403 --> 02:15:42.004]  So, this goes on the hands and things.
[02:15:42.004 --> 02:15:42.904]  It's a protective shield.
[02:15:42.904 --> 02:15:46.666]  If you get cut or something, or micro-scratches, it seals it in.
[02:15:46.666 --> 02:15:51.048]  But all the other products, they're all discounted right now during this crisis.
[02:15:51.048 --> 02:15:51.488]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:54.031 --> 02:16:05.219]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:05.219 --> 02:16:08.962]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[02:16:09.102 --> 02:16:14.524]  On our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:16:14.524 --> 02:16:19.807]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:16:19.807 --> 02:16:32.012]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[02:16:32.012 --> 02:16:33.252]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:16:33.252 --> 02:16:35.253]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[02:16:35.433 --> 02:16:36.853]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:36.853 --> 02:16:41.615]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:41.615 --> 02:16:43.135]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:43.135 --> 02:16:44.955]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:08.885]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:08.885 --> 02:17:10.086]  I can help you too.
[02:17:10.086 --> 02:17:13.008]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:17:54.815 --> 02:17:58.417]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:17:58.417 --> 02:18:00.178]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:18:00.178 --> 02:18:11.465]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:18:12.225 --> 02:18:21.011]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:18:21.011 --> 02:18:32.478]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:18:32.478 --> 02:18:34.720]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:36.801]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:18:36.801 --> 02:18:46.808]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:18:46.808 --> 02:18:49.450]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:54.154]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:18:54.614 --> 02:19:00.437]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[02:19:00.437 --> 02:19:03.999]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:19:03.999 --> 02:19:06.300]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:08.121]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[02:19:08.121 --> 02:19:15.705]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:19:15.705 --> 02:19:16.166]  And I'm 45 years old.
[02:19:16.946 --> 02:19:18.927]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[02:19:18.927 --> 02:19:20.627]  And it's fluoride-free.
[02:19:20.627 --> 02:19:23.868]  I think the big difference, the game-changer in this, is the coral calcium.
[02:19:23.868 --> 02:19:27.490]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[02:19:27.490 --> 02:19:32.151]  And the toothpaste, I don't even rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[02:19:32.151 --> 02:19:34.392]  It feels so good.
[02:19:34.392 --> 02:19:37.593]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[02:19:37.593 --> 02:19:43.795]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day, rather than just twice a day now.
[02:19:43.795 --> 02:19:45.456]  Because I like the way it feels.
[02:19:57.862 --> 02:20:00.486]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:35.397 --> 02:20:41.259]  Well, we're really blessed to have former Congressman Bob Barr joining us.
[02:20:41.259 --> 02:20:45.080]  He helped initiate the impeachment of Clinton.
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:50.362]  There were so many crimes the Clintons were committing, but they could nail them down on that one.
[02:20:50.362 --> 02:21:04.447]  And we couldn't have somebody better to lay out his view on this whole fiasco and what he thinks is about to currently happening, what Ambassador Bolton is up to, who extolled on
[02:21:06.408 --> 02:21:06.728]  U.S.
[02:21:06.728 --> 02:21:14.553]  radio that Trump was doing a great job in Ukraine and was fighting corruption.
[02:21:14.553 --> 02:21:19.136]  He said that on Voice of America, but now he's got millions of dollars and he's telling a different story.
[02:21:19.136 --> 02:21:25.840]  But our guest is so smart, instead of me asking questions, I should just ask Bob Barr of LibertyGuard.org.
[02:21:27.677 --> 02:21:34.720]  Who's got a long pedigree of work in industry and the CIA before that and Congress as a lawyer.
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:35.700]  What is front and center?
[02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:37.081]  I mean, what would you call this?
[02:21:37.081 --> 02:21:41.303]  Because when I look at Schiff and Nadler and Pelosi, I see
[02:21:43.281 --> 02:21:46.886]  I see something more frightening than even pure evil.
[02:21:46.886 --> 02:21:59.043]  It's delusional narcissism, making fools out of themselves but never stopping, and then Trump's Justice Department, which you also work for, I know, at a high level, never reacting to their crimes.
[02:21:59.844 --> 02:22:04.465]  Is enabling it to get even more crazy like toddlers acting out, but these aren't toddlers.
[02:22:04.465 --> 02:22:13.408]  So I'm getting more angry at Trump, quite frankly, than I'm getting at Schiff and people, because he's not going after these people.
[02:22:13.408 --> 02:22:18.649]  I don't want some big clash inside the government, but we already have it, don't we, Bob Barr?
[02:22:18.649 --> 02:22:20.630]  Or am I wrong?
[02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:22.170]  No, you're not wrong, Alex.
[02:22:22.170 --> 02:22:24.371]  And there are so many
[02:22:25.202 --> 02:22:26.703]  Different aspects to this.
[02:22:26.703 --> 02:22:29.645]  There are so many things going wrong.
[02:22:29.645 --> 02:22:42.293]  It's like taking your car to a mechanic and the mechanic says, look, your air system isn't working, your fuel injections aren't working, your exhaust system isn't working, your spark plugs aren't working.
[02:22:42.293 --> 02:22:43.453]  There's everything wrong.
[02:22:43.453 --> 02:22:49.257]  But what we have to do, I think, is not lose sight of the short term goal here, and that is to
[02:22:49.724 --> 02:22:59.171]  Get rid of and put a stop to this nonsense in the Senate and then tackle these broader and deeper issues that you've identified the deep state itself.
[02:22:59.171 --> 02:23:11.060]  The short term problem here is for Mitch McConnell to keep the Republicans in line and many of these Republicans are always looking for ways to go over to the other side.
[02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:24.580]  Mitch has a job here to at least keep a majority in line to stop this nonsense so that we can then move on and tackle these other more important systemic problems with the government.
[02:23:24.580 --> 02:23:37.331]  Well as a former federal prosecutor, and again I'm not going to go over the whole pedigree, somebody that ignited the legitimate impeachment of Bill Clinton, what are you seeing here as an expert that we don't see?
[02:23:39.572 --> 02:23:45.274]  I'm really not seeing anything that you and the vast majority, I think, Alex, of the American people see.
[02:23:45.274 --> 02:23:58.817]  And that is a Democrat majority in both the House and the Senate that are so blinded by their hatred, their sheer hatred for Donald Trump, that they have lost sight of their responsibility.
[02:23:58.817 --> 02:24:00.397]  They have lost sight of history.
[02:24:00.397 --> 02:24:02.498]  They have lost sight of the American people.
[02:24:02.498 --> 02:24:04.758]  They have lost sight of everything.
[02:24:04.758 --> 02:24:06.999]  And they have this tunnel vision focused on
[02:24:07.523 --> 02:24:11.806]  Donald Trump in the crosshairs of their efforts.
[02:24:11.806 --> 02:24:27.996]  Hopefully, hopefully Mitch McConnell can keep any other Republican squishes from going over to the Democrats so that we don't open this up in ways that it should not constitutionally be open.
[02:24:27.996 --> 02:24:30.978]  And that is for witnesses and new evidence.
[02:24:31.648 --> 02:24:47.146]  So that we can stop this now and then hopefully move on to defeat the Democrats with their House majority in the fall, re-elect the president, and really attack the systemic problems that are the deep state in Washington.
[02:24:47.554 --> 02:24:51.658]  You know, define that because people say, oh, Bob Barr, he's former CIA.
[02:24:51.658 --> 02:24:52.239]  What are you doing?
[02:24:52.239 --> 02:24:53.561]  Well, there's a lot of good.
[02:24:53.561 --> 02:24:55.443]  The CIA is bigger than Coca-Cola.
[02:24:55.443 --> 02:24:58.466]  That just means clandestine operations in the government.
[02:24:58.466 --> 02:25:00.048]  We need people that have been in the CIA.
[02:25:00.048 --> 02:25:03.311]  They can tell us what's going on and help decipher that, obviously.
[02:25:03.311 --> 02:25:09.157]  And Trump has been at war with corporate elements, governmental elements using the cloak
[02:25:09.978 --> 02:25:10.898]  Of different U.S.
[02:25:10.898 --> 02:25:14.520]  intelligence agencies to operate, and we have the FISA Court.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:16.820]  You're a former prosecutor.
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:22.222]  The FISA Court said they illegally did this, so I'm not even saying, oh, the CIA giving them a pass.
[02:25:22.222 --> 02:25:32.826]  I'm giving the facts that this is illegitimate operatives and networks inside government using the apparatus for their own political attempt to coup against the president.
[02:25:32.826 --> 02:25:33.406]  Is that accurate?
[02:25:34.614 --> 02:25:35.216]  It's accurate.
[02:25:35.216 --> 02:25:41.229]  You've really put your finger, Alex, on two very, very important aspects of what we need to be concerned about here.
[02:25:41.229 --> 02:25:45.277]  One is the unholy relationship between corporate America
[02:25:45.994 --> 02:25:48.457]  And the government itself.
[02:25:48.457 --> 02:25:58.026]  The government, there are restrictions, often not followed, but there are restrictions on information the government can obtain and use.
[02:25:58.026 --> 02:26:02.270]  If they use the FISA report properly, that serves as a limitation.
[02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:09.877]  But one way that the government gets around those limitations is to use corporations to do its work for it.
[02:26:10.504 --> 02:26:14.165]  In gathering, databasing and then sharing information.
[02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:17.387]  So that's one serious problem that we have here.
[02:26:17.387 --> 02:26:27.710]  The second is now we have an opportunity with the abuses of FISA that have come that we've known about now that have come to light publicly.
[02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:38.234]  What we now need to do is try and fashion a majority of members in the House and the Senate to make some real reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[02:26:38.234 --> 02:26:39.715]  There's legislation pending.
[02:26:40.162 --> 02:27:00.835]  But my worry is that as soon as we move past impeachment and then have the opportunity to focus on reforming, really reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the courts, that the government will prod out all of the national security people and say, oh, we can't make any reforms, it's national security.
[02:27:00.835 --> 02:27:03.337]  That's what we have to really be working on.
[02:27:03.337 --> 02:27:09.501]  FISA has to be reformed because it's a backdoor now that the government can drive a Mack truck through.
[02:27:09.981 --> 02:27:28.724]  Yeah, if Obama and Hillary and a few others and people like Brennan are willing to use that against the candidate, the nominee, and then the elected president, and then the sworn in president, they'll go after anybody.
[02:27:28.724 --> 02:27:36.346]  That takes some big huevos to start shooting at POTUS with a spy grid.
[02:27:36.346 --> 02:27:36.646]  It does.
[02:27:36.646 --> 02:27:38.286]  I mean, if the U.S.
[02:27:38.286 --> 02:27:38.546]  government
[02:27:39.565 --> 02:27:44.329]  And that shows they've gotten way too big for their britches, right?
[02:27:59.281 --> 02:28:03.242]  So how do we, when we come back, how do we reform?
[02:28:03.242 --> 02:28:08.924]  Because I know you've seen every angle of it, and Bob Barr is our guest, libertyguard.org.
[02:28:08.924 --> 02:28:10.904]  How do we deal with that?
[02:28:10.904 --> 02:28:12.185]  And what do you predict comes next?
[02:28:12.185 --> 02:28:18.487]  Because if Trump and the Justice Department don't move on these people somehow, then what will their new attack be?
[02:28:18.487 --> 02:28:22.528]  Because I've already enjoyed, I love the fact that Tulsi Gabbard is shooing
[02:28:23.348 --> 02:28:26.050]  Hillary, for all this money, for calling her a Russian agent.
[02:28:26.050 --> 02:28:28.591]  Hey, they did that to me, and they took bank accounts away.
[02:28:28.591 --> 02:28:30.192]  They almost shut us down.
[02:28:30.192 --> 02:28:34.374]  I mean, they used national security apparatus to come after us by that designation.
[02:28:34.374 --> 02:28:39.978]  And so, I'm glad there's even people pushing back, because if I'm anything, folks, it's not a Russian agent.
[02:28:39.978 --> 02:28:42.519]  But anybody that opposes tyranny is called one.
[02:28:42.519 --> 02:28:43.680]  They've bit off more than they can chew.
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:44.580]  Bob Barr is our guest.
[02:28:44.580 --> 02:28:45.621]  We'll come right back.
[02:28:45.621 --> 02:28:50.524]  We'll talk about the whistleblower, Eric Suramala, as well, and the calls to arrest Senator Rand Paul.
[02:28:54.013 --> 02:29:05.195]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:05.195 --> 02:29:14.497]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.497 --> 02:29:19.578]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.778 --> 02:29:24.003]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:24.003 --> 02:29:31.992]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:31.992 --> 02:29:33.234]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:33.234 --> 02:29:35.236]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system
[02:29:35.376 --> 02:29:35.956]  That's right.
[02:29:56.343 --> 02:29:59.607]  This should really be easier than it is.
[02:29:59.607 --> 02:30:01.749]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[02:30:01.749 --> 02:30:04.212]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[02:30:04.212 --> 02:30:12.641]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[02:30:13.241 --> 02:30:20.947]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[02:30:20.947 --> 02:30:27.611]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[02:30:27.611 --> 02:30:33.615]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip.
[02:30:34.776 --> 02:30:39.758]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[02:30:39.758 --> 02:30:47.440]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[02:31:04.906 --> 02:31:06.268]  33% off.
[02:31:06.268 --> 02:31:07.088]  It's amazing.

[02:31:17.096 --> 02:31:19.298]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[02:31:19.298 --> 02:31:24.162]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[02:31:24.162 --> 02:31:26.544]  So just check it out for yourself.

[02:31:35.188 --> 02:31:36.249]  Winter sun.
[02:31:36.249 --> 02:31:38.049]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[02:31:38.049 --> 02:31:40.690]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[02:31:40.690 --> 02:31:41.951]  That's why people get so sick.
[02:31:41.951 --> 02:31:42.751]  That's the main reason.
[02:31:42.751 --> 02:31:45.012]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.

[02:33:10.354 --> 02:33:12.396]  The tip of the spear.
[02:33:12.396 --> 02:33:21.103]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.103 --> 02:33:34.954]  Could you please respond to the answer just given by the President's Council and provide any other comments the Senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the evening?
[02:33:34.954 --> 02:33:38.617]  Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate,
[02:33:43.509 --> 02:33:48.752]  Yeah, let's hear from the President right there.
[02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:50.753]  This is the President giving his view.
[02:33:58.393 --> 02:34:00.014]  I'm not, why am I not worried?
[02:34:00.014 --> 02:34:01.474]  I should be worried.
[02:34:01.474 --> 02:34:04.115]  You know, remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right?
[02:34:04.115 --> 02:34:05.296]  A very dark period.
[02:34:05.296 --> 02:34:08.477]  It was like, oh, you think about it, right?
[02:34:08.477 --> 02:34:10.418]  And with Clinton, it was not good.
[02:34:10.418 --> 02:34:13.860]  They say that with Johnson, that was a long time ago.
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:17.981]  None of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period.
[02:34:17.981 --> 02:34:19.602]  This is a happy period for us.
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:31.310]  Yeah, they're calling it America's Nightmare, and then they go, oh, it's terrible, we didn't want to do this, and then Pelosi's handing out pins at signing ceremonies.
[02:34:31.310 --> 02:34:34.874]  I'm actually going to be honest with people, because I don't usually get scared.
[02:34:36.324 --> 02:34:38.425]  And I don't like to even use that term.
[02:34:38.425 --> 02:35:01.454]  I'm really concerned, Bob Barr, former congressman who helped initiate the impeachment of Bill Clinton, that we're being too confident here, and that we're not looking for the real problem, and that while we're looking in one direction, it's the other, and they're telling Trump he's assured of victory, just like we heard Hillary was assured of victory three and a half years ago, with the election fraud and the censorship and everything the establishment's done going after the president.
[02:35:01.934 --> 02:35:06.396]  The real place they can try to get him is election fraud and manipulation that we know goes on.
[02:35:06.396 --> 02:35:10.077]  And so I see him saying, yes, it is a great period.
[02:35:10.077 --> 02:35:13.478]  No one's buying, and I know what mainstream media says anymore.
[02:35:13.478 --> 02:35:18.800]  There is a major political realignment towards nationalism and freedom and free market systems worldwide.
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:21.161]  I think nobody denies that.
[02:35:21.161 --> 02:35:26.603]  But still, the behavior of the creatures of the deep state
[02:35:27.665 --> 02:35:36.993]  These toddlers, these babies, these people that were given power and expect they're invincible, their Frankenstein, you know, is not that smart, but he's dangerous.
[02:35:36.993 --> 02:35:41.317]  He can pull your head off, and they're kind of just stumbling around, and no one ever stops them.
[02:35:41.317 --> 02:35:42.218]  Oh, that's Frankenstein.
[02:35:42.218 --> 02:35:43.079]  He's full of crap.
[02:35:43.079 --> 02:35:44.400]  Well, he'll still twist your head off.
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.643]  So, what I'm getting at here is, I guess I could have said it very simply is,
[02:35:48.877 --> 02:35:56.401]  It's not about vindictiveness, but the danger of what the Democrats have done and the hoaxes and the illegal spying and the crimes.
[02:35:56.401 --> 02:36:04.144]  When is the attorney general that shares your name going to do something in your view?
[02:36:04.144 --> 02:36:11.188]  That's a good question, and I wish there were a clear answer to it one way or the other, but I don't know.
[02:36:11.188 --> 02:36:18.051]  One thing that I do know, in addition to the accuracy of what you've just noted, Alex, is the fact that the real
[02:36:18.570 --> 02:36:29.579]  One of the real problems that we're facing is Google and other social media.
[02:36:29.579 --> 02:36:37.985]  Adam Schiff was talking the other day that, well, if we don't remove Trump now, we can't be assured that the election will be fair.
[02:36:37.985 --> 02:36:39.326]  That's not the danger.
[02:36:39.326 --> 02:36:48.353]  The real danger lurking in the area of swaying voters and influencing voters and voter suppression
[02:36:48.848 --> 02:36:49.248]  I think so.
[02:37:11.678 --> 02:37:29.162]  But I'm here to tell you that if you don't do something to get a handle on the power of social media and these search engines like Google to influence voters and influence public opinion, then you are going to lose control of this government permanently.
[02:37:29.162 --> 02:37:32.963]  I mean, it was a truly frightening presentation, and yet
[02:37:33.544 --> 02:37:43.946]  I have not seen any evidence in the last six or seven months since he testified that people in the Congress are serious about doing something about that problem that he identified.
[02:37:43.946 --> 02:37:49.027]  I totally agree with you, and I went and looked at what Twitter announced months ago that made it official today.
[02:37:49.027 --> 02:37:54.328]  The headline is, Twitter users can now report voter suppression misinformation.
[02:37:54.328 --> 02:37:56.209]  Well, their definition is, and here's the form,
[02:37:57.233 --> 02:38:09.504]  Anything someone doesn't agree with, or if someone says it hurt my feelings, it's like a university, you're now suppressing them so you're banned and it will only be done against Trump supporters.
[02:38:09.504 --> 02:38:13.308]  But again, they call it stopping voter suppression when they're the ones doing it.
[02:38:13.308 --> 02:38:16.110]  This isn't just a company doing what it wants.
[02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:20.815]  This is AI, real-time, beyond anything the Soviets could dream of.
[02:38:22.290 --> 02:38:27.735]  Oh, the technology that we have and it is constantly being upgraded.
[02:38:27.735 --> 02:38:32.279]  It is something that George Orwell could only have dreamed about.
[02:38:32.279 --> 02:38:39.465]  When you look at, for example, the way Google and other lesser search engines, the way they manipulate
[02:38:39.821 --> 02:38:39.981]  Okay.
[02:38:58.820 --> 02:39:02.703]  Sway people's thinking and how they react.
[02:39:02.703 --> 02:39:06.206]  And they're paid to do it.
[02:39:06.206 --> 02:39:08.047]  They're paid to do it.
[02:39:08.047 --> 02:39:10.689]  They make billions of dollars off of it.
[02:39:10.689 --> 02:39:13.491]  And Congress, I'm not in favor of censorship.
[02:39:13.491 --> 02:39:16.053]  And it's not a matter of censoring these companies.
[02:39:16.053 --> 02:39:20.036]  It is a matter of recognizing what they're doing.
[02:39:20.036 --> 02:39:27.101]  And saying, OK, you're going to deal with all of this data in your manipulation of people who use search engines.
[02:39:27.768 --> 02:39:35.070]  Uh, we're going to open that up in the same way that the federal government opened up technology and telecommunications a half century ago.
[02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.790]  Well, that's my next question.
[02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:38.731]  I know I'm talking over you and I apologize, but you've got such knowledge on this.
[02:39:38.731 --> 02:39:39.251]  Exactly.
[02:39:39.251 --> 02:39:43.793]  This isn't, this isn't, okay, big tech can do what they want or they're a private company.
[02:39:43.793 --> 02:39:44.613]  They're in there.
[02:39:45.333 --> 02:39:49.197]  It's on record saying the Republican Party's official affiliation is Nazis.
[02:39:49.197 --> 02:39:51.299]  Google did that for months until they got caught.
[02:39:51.299 --> 02:39:55.382]  Okay, and then Sundar gets up and says, we've never manipulated one search result.
[02:39:55.382 --> 02:40:01.007]  I can call Google, okay, and I can pay them to make me the top search for whatever I want.
[02:40:01.007 --> 02:40:03.410]  And I can do it where it doesn't even say it's an ad.
[02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:09.015]  So, the fundamentals is they're lying in front of Congress, telling us a baboon's ass isn't purple.
[02:40:11.802 --> 02:40:17.844]  I'm not quite sure about, I haven't looked at a baboon's anatomy lately, but I think you're probably right.
[02:40:17.844 --> 02:40:19.965]  This is what they do.
[02:40:19.965 --> 02:40:31.548]  There are study after study, and I would encourage people to go back and look at Robert Epstein's testimony before Senator Cruz's subcommittee this past summer.
[02:40:31.548 --> 02:40:34.409]  This is serious business, and that's the real threat.
[02:40:34.409 --> 02:40:38.270]  They can sway, that is the search engines can sway,
[02:40:39.744 --> 02:40:46.787]  Tens of millions of votes by the way they rank and by the way they manipulate search engine inquiries.
[02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:52.970]  I know I'm ranting here, sir, and I really appreciate you being with us.
[02:40:52.970 --> 02:41:00.772]  I got sent by Mike Cernovich two years ago the secret Google documents where they were paying $15 million to one company to down rank us.
[02:41:00.772 --> 02:41:02.833]  So they weren't even doing it their own search thing.
[02:41:02.833 --> 02:41:06.013]  They were just having another company attack us.
[02:41:06.013 --> 02:41:07.514]  Who paid for that?
[02:41:07.514 --> 02:41:11.235]  That's obviously governmental, stay behind networks, Obama put in place.
[02:41:11.235 --> 02:41:13.415]  And then Google said, no, those are real documents.
[02:41:13.415 --> 02:41:14.436]  We made a mistake.
[02:41:14.436 --> 02:41:14.816]  Sorry.
[02:41:15.416 --> 02:41:17.857]  That's a whole congressional investigation!
[02:41:17.857 --> 02:41:20.598]  But again, they demonized me, and not about me, it's what they did.
[02:41:20.598 --> 02:41:24.199]  They demonized me to go, oh, Jones is fair game.
[02:41:24.199 --> 02:41:28.460]  And then they set the precedent that you can have the most dangerous game, hunt Alex Jones.
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:29.620]  Nobody stands up for me.
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:31.581]  You did, and a few others, and we appreciate it.
[02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:35.342]  And then the precedent's set for everybody, and that's what's so dangerous.
[02:41:35.342 --> 02:41:35.902]  It is.
[02:41:35.902 --> 02:41:45.125]  And the American people need to wake up to it and demand that their representatives in the Senate and the House do something about it now, or come election time,
[02:41:45.563 --> 02:41:49.506]  We're going to be on the losing end of this manipulation of voters.
[02:41:49.506 --> 02:41:50.226]  Have we heard yet?
[02:41:50.226 --> 02:41:56.170]  Are they going to allow senators to have guests or have witnesses?
[02:41:56.170 --> 02:41:57.911]  Do we know yet what's going to happen?
[02:41:58.533 --> 02:42:19.858]  No, we don't know yet because there are, as you know, two or three of these squishy Republicans that are always more interested in appearing to be so nice and nonpartisan and fair to the Democrats that that becomes the overriding factor in whether or not they decide to prolong this impeachment debacle.
[02:42:19.858 --> 02:42:20.838]  So we still don't know.
[02:42:21.505 --> 02:42:28.351]  We saw last night that Senator Lamar Alexander thankfully said, I see no need for witnesses and new evidence.
[02:42:28.351 --> 02:42:32.915]  Susan Collins, not unexpectedly, says she wants them.
[02:42:32.915 --> 02:42:36.859]  We're waiting to see, I guess, if Lisa Murkowski in Alaska.
[02:42:36.859 --> 02:42:38.320]  Listen, I've never understood this.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:41.083]  Why an Alaskan, Alaska Senator.
[02:42:41.083 --> 02:42:42.484]  Alaska is a great state.
[02:42:42.484 --> 02:42:43.745]  It's a conservative state.
[02:42:44.739 --> 02:42:59.238]  And yet they have a senator that is so squishy on these things so apparently we're still waiting on One more segment stay with us ladies and gentlemen this time of year I'm always promoting winter sun our high quality organic
[02:42:59.258 --> 02:43:04.100]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:05.020]  So right now we have
[02:43:27.168 --> 02:43:32.672]  Winner Son, still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter, and spring.
[02:43:32.672 --> 02:43:46.540]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off, $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price, because I want you to get it, and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:53.004]  So, Winner Son, taken under the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at Infowarestore.com.
[02:43:54.165 --> 02:44:04.231]  It is I, the leader of COBRA, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[02:44:04.231 --> 02:44:10.214]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[02:44:10.214 --> 02:44:12.035]  But it's true.
[02:44:12.035 --> 02:44:15.217]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[02:44:15.217 --> 02:44:18.399]  That's why COBRA is launching Operation
[02:44:18.579 --> 02:44:19.160]  We're good.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:50.953]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[02:44:50.953 --> 02:44:52.114]  Ha ha!
[02:44:52.114 --> 02:44:52.794]  Hail Cobra!
[02:44:54.929 --> 02:44:57.910]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[02:44:57.910 --> 02:45:00.731]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[02:45:00.731 --> 02:45:02.492]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[02:45:02.492 --> 02:45:03.252]  I hope it doesn't.
[02:45:03.252 --> 02:45:07.994]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause, well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[02:45:07.994 --> 02:45:11.215]  So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[02:45:11.215 --> 02:45:12.436]  It's insurance you can eat.
[02:45:12.436 --> 02:45:13.636]  It lasts 25 years.
[02:45:13.636 --> 02:45:17.998]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very lowest price.
[02:45:17.998 --> 02:45:19.498]  And that's my Patriot Supply.
[02:45:19.498 --> 02:45:23.580]  And then, so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private label it.
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:25.741]  As InfoWars select.
[02:45:25.741 --> 02:45:28.543]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[02:45:28.543 --> 02:45:31.365]  They're still able, within 7 to 10 days, to ship it to you.
[02:45:31.365 --> 02:45:37.669]  If you get your orders in, on their small orders, their big orders, 7 to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you.
[02:45:37.669 --> 02:45:39.210]  If you get your order in now.
[02:45:39.210 --> 02:45:42.952]  But, just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[02:45:42.952 --> 02:45:47.515]  So get your orders in for high quality, affordable foods right now, for all the reasons out there.
[02:45:47.515 --> 02:45:49.956]  And it's insurance you can eat, and it funds the InfoWars.
[02:45:49.956 --> 02:45:50.336]  A total 360 win.
[02:45:51.537 --> 02:45:56.460]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:02.124]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks, it'll be too late to get them.
[02:46:02.124 --> 02:46:07.427]  You gotta get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[02:46:07.427 --> 02:46:10.889]  Trust us, this is not something to be messing around with.
[02:46:10.889 --> 02:46:18.074]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com, make your purchase today, and at least have that part of survival covered.
[02:46:18.574 --> 02:46:24.915]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever the case may be.
[02:46:24.915 --> 02:46:27.916]  The RZ air filtration mask, M2 mesh.
[02:46:27.916 --> 02:46:29.276]  I have one of those personally.
[02:46:29.276 --> 02:46:32.716]  I've got a couple of these things off the old InfoWars store.
[02:46:32.716 --> 02:46:33.657]  I am prepared.
[02:46:33.657 --> 02:46:33.997]  Are you?
[02:46:33.997 --> 02:46:37.017]  If you're not, InfoWarsStore.com on sale now.
[02:46:37.017 --> 02:46:39.718]  Everything you need to prepare yourself for whatever comes next, folks.
[02:46:39.718 --> 02:46:44.118]  It's not necessarily the disease, it's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[02:46:44.118 --> 02:46:47.719]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for.
[02:46:47.959 --> 02:46:49.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:16.377 --> 02:47:20.560]  Congressman, former Congressman Bob Barr is here to help launch the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:25.443]  People always ask, why didn't they go after Clinton for the missile secrets and all the rest of it?
[02:47:25.443 --> 02:47:31.787]  Because that was all shrouded in national security and you couldn't get the other Republicans on board, but you could on him lying.
[02:47:31.787 --> 02:47:34.809]  You could on the other issues that were going on.
[02:47:34.809 --> 02:47:38.292]  We are seeing the fall of the House of Clinton with the Epstein stuff.
[02:47:38.292 --> 02:47:41.253]  We are seeing, really, Hillary's power debase.
[02:47:41.253 --> 02:47:42.334]  She is going to control the
[02:47:44.332 --> 02:47:47.094]  ...convention coming up and something they could have a broker convention.
[02:47:47.094 --> 02:47:49.295]  She's just delusional enough to try it.
[02:47:49.295 --> 02:47:53.298]  She has intended to run again, but I don't know if she'd actually pull that off.
[02:47:53.298 --> 02:47:58.161]  Just in general, what is your feeling about the State of the Republic, your State of the Union, Bob Barger?
[02:47:58.161 --> 02:48:00.143]  I respect you and the listeners respect you.
[02:48:00.143 --> 02:48:02.885]  I mean, is the State of the Republic strong or is it in flux?
[02:48:05.787 --> 02:48:14.995]  The most difficult task I have, Alex, at the beginning of every day when I get up is to remain optimistic about the United States and our future.
[02:48:14.995 --> 02:48:21.341]  I refuse to give up the optimism that is at the foundation of this great land of ours.
[02:48:21.883 --> 02:48:36.530]  It's becoming more and more difficult when you look at, for example, right now in the Senate, you have Senate Republicans who cannot decide whether or not to simply end this, this hoax of a trial and move on.
[02:48:36.530 --> 02:48:37.610]  They're fretting about it.
[02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:38.831]  They're wringing their hands.
[02:48:38.831 --> 02:48:45.274]  They're worrying about how they will appear to the media, how they will appear to their Democrat colleagues.
[02:48:45.274 --> 02:48:50.136]  And then for some reason, I read an article just before I came on the show with you that
[02:48:50.996 --> 02:48:59.304]  The White House lawyers, who I think have done an excellent job so far, now want more time to prepare their closing argument.
[02:48:59.304 --> 02:49:02.087]  What in the heck do you need more time for?
[02:49:02.087 --> 02:49:03.308]  You need to shut this down.
[02:49:03.308 --> 02:49:06.492]  The whole thing was fraudulent, so it's more grandstanding.
[02:49:06.492 --> 02:49:09.214]  So, that may prolong this.
[02:49:10.379 --> 02:49:36.317]  Get this thing voted on, move on, let the president present himself to the American people in a state of union and remind us what a great country we are, how important it is to move forward and lay out some legislation that the president should be supporting that will get a handle on what he knows better than anybody else are the abuses by the deep state.
[02:49:36.317 --> 02:49:39.800]  I totally agree and I began the interview this way and I'm going to end it this way, Bob Barr.
[02:49:41.201 --> 02:49:41.922]  I love Trump.
[02:49:41.922 --> 02:49:42.642]  He's a great guy.
[02:49:42.642 --> 02:49:43.343]  He's the real deal.
[02:49:43.343 --> 02:49:45.344]  He's just Americana, not left or right.
[02:49:45.344 --> 02:49:46.305]  He's not out to get the country.
[02:49:46.305 --> 02:49:47.526]  He wants to be president.
[02:49:47.526 --> 02:49:50.328]  And Deep State's mad that it's not ruled by committee.
[02:49:50.328 --> 02:49:52.770]  We've actually got an executive that's doing the will of the people.
[02:49:52.770 --> 02:49:58.334]  I'd give him an A-plus on effort and being a true blue guy.
[02:49:59.508 --> 02:50:07.315]  Man, it's not that I've been put to the ring by these people and I haven't really gotten to experience the deep state's teeth.
[02:50:07.315 --> 02:50:09.117]  It's that it's going to happen again and again.
[02:50:09.117 --> 02:50:16.784]  I'm all for getting in a fight, but not we win each time and then we let them line up again and attack us when they're committing crimes.
[02:50:16.784 --> 02:50:23.190]  I just really think that we need, I go back to that, everybody waits for that action because it becomes a dereliction of duty.
[02:50:23.911 --> 02:50:26.112]  There are things that can be done.
[02:50:26.112 --> 02:50:26.672]  Trump has to do it.
[02:50:26.672 --> 02:50:27.753]  The Senate has to do it.
[02:50:27.753 --> 02:50:28.393]  Ron Paul has to do it.
[02:50:28.393 --> 02:50:29.093]  And if we don't this year,
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:56.047]  I think we have an excellent chance of retaking the majority in the House, but it will be for naught unless we use the power of the majorities and the White House to attack the deep state.
[02:50:56.047 --> 02:51:04.452]  I mean, we heard the former acting CIA director, Don McLaughlin, a few months ago saying, thank God for the deep state.
[02:51:04.452 --> 02:51:12.517]  The left knows how important it is to retain those positions and to fight any type of reform and Silicon Valley is with them.
[02:51:13.089 --> 02:51:22.334]  We need to get this thing back on track as soon as this impeachment is finished, both legislatively and through the administration's executive powers.
[02:51:22.844 --> 02:51:24.625]  But think about how profound that is.
[02:51:24.625 --> 02:51:27.846]  Even though they're dug in, it's now admitted they're there.
[02:51:27.846 --> 02:51:37.970]  As you said, they go on C-SPAN with Brennan and McLaughlin and say, thank God the intelligence agencies through Congress are removing the president, as if they're the electorate.
[02:51:37.970 --> 02:51:40.872]  The arrogance of criminals, in my view.
[02:51:40.872 --> 02:51:42.492]  The arrogance of them announcing that.
[02:51:42.492 --> 02:51:43.433]  I aired that clip probably 50 times.
[02:51:44.113 --> 02:51:45.274]  People are like, stop playing the clip.
[02:51:45.274 --> 02:51:55.078]  It was so incredible, the admission that we're a rogue group in the government, like a banana republic, like Venezuela, and we're going to overthrow an elected president for made-up crap.
[02:51:55.078 --> 02:51:57.819]  That was absolutely amazing, and you're totally right.
[02:51:57.819 --> 02:52:11.885]  So, as negative as some things are, I believe in the optimism, Mr. Barr, as you said, Congressman Barr, in that at least it's out in the open now that there are bureaucrats that are too big for their britches, and I believe that will be their undoing.
[02:52:14.109 --> 02:52:17.851]  It needs to be, and it needs to begin in earnest this year.
[02:52:17.851 --> 02:52:20.072]  It can't be put off any longer.
[02:52:20.072 --> 02:52:22.313]  We need to do it this year, Alex.
[02:52:22.313 --> 02:52:22.873]  No, you're right.
[02:52:22.873 --> 02:52:23.394]  You're right.
[02:52:23.394 --> 02:52:25.855]  I know you've got a lot of sites and a lot of stuff you're doing.
[02:52:25.855 --> 02:52:28.596]  What is the best site for folks to find all things Bob Barr?
[02:52:28.596 --> 02:52:30.937]  LibertyGuard.org?
[02:52:30.937 --> 02:52:32.058]  Two things, Alex.
[02:52:32.058 --> 02:52:32.458]  Thank you.
[02:52:32.458 --> 02:52:33.579]  Yes, LibertyGuard.org.
[02:52:33.579 --> 02:52:40.562]  They can go to BobBarr.org or the Law Enforcement Education Foundation, which I head to support our men and women in blue.
[02:52:41.488 --> 02:52:46.830]  And as you know, that's critical because the left's trying to take them over and turn them into political police commissars.
[02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:47.990]  You're doing such good work.
[02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:49.230]  Thank you, Bob Barr, for everything.
[02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:50.231]  Appreciate you.
[02:52:50.231 --> 02:52:50.991]  Always a pleasure.
[02:52:50.991 --> 02:52:51.911]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:52:51.911 --> 02:52:52.491]  Thank you.
[02:52:52.491 --> 02:52:53.172]  Thank you.
[02:52:53.172 --> 02:52:53.452]  All right.
[02:52:53.452 --> 02:52:58.573]  I'm going to host the fourth hour and we've got a special guest coming on.
[02:52:58.573 --> 02:53:00.254]  I'm not a victim.
[02:53:00.254 --> 02:53:02.675]  I'm a leader and I'm a target because of it.
[02:53:02.675 --> 02:53:07.056]  But believe me, the enemy is launching on
[02:53:08.556 --> 02:53:09.377]  That's a good question.
[02:53:28.806 --> 02:53:35.070]  I mean, we're talking sex operatives, infiltration, grab their bank accounts, people threatening to kidnap the kids.
[02:53:35.070 --> 02:53:38.431]  I mean, it's beyond any movie you've ever seen, okay?
[02:53:38.431 --> 02:53:44.635]  You just saw a Canadian Royal Mounted Police saying, we're going to put you in prison for a book you wrote against Trudeau.
[02:53:44.635 --> 02:53:48.377]  I mean, these people are unchained.
[02:53:48.377 --> 02:53:50.138]  They have no chivalrous
[02:53:51.787 --> 02:53:52.247]  Connection.
[02:53:52.247 --> 02:53:59.810]  And by the way, chivalry is what powerful people do because they want some rules on themselves.
[02:53:59.810 --> 02:54:01.151]  They want to get rid of the chivalry.
[02:54:01.151 --> 02:54:03.572]  They want to start going down that line.
[02:54:03.572 --> 02:54:05.573]  They're going to reap the whirlwind.
[02:54:05.573 --> 02:54:09.214]  But I got to tell you something from the bottom of my heart.
[02:54:09.214 --> 02:54:11.075]  We're living in incredible historic times.
[02:54:11.075 --> 02:54:13.556]  And I just.
[02:54:13.556 --> 02:54:17.638]  When listeners call up and they say, Alex, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[02:54:19.804 --> 02:54:21.165]  They could put a gun to my head.
[02:54:21.165 --> 02:54:22.246]  I wouldn't stop doing this.
[02:54:22.246 --> 02:54:22.946]  You understand that?
[02:54:22.946 --> 02:54:25.508]  Because this is like getting oxygen.
[02:54:25.508 --> 02:54:29.490]  I'm not a huge skin diver, but I've gone down to about 80 feet and come back to the top.
[02:54:29.490 --> 02:54:34.254]  Some people can really go down like 1,000 feet and do it, because it compresses your blood so that you have more oxygenation.
[02:54:34.254 --> 02:54:35.674]  But it's coming back up.
[02:54:35.674 --> 02:54:36.475]  You've got to watch out for it.
[02:54:36.475 --> 02:54:39.457]  But I've gone down about 80 feet, skin diving.
[02:54:39.457 --> 02:54:44.320]  And down there, man, like a minute, whoa, it's like everything's so bright, everything's so clear.
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:46.542]  And then you come back up, you're like, ah, I need air.
[02:54:48.021 --> 02:55:01.090]  And I start using the whole skin diving analogy, but... I don't know why I was using the skin diving analogy.
[02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:07.575]  I'm not going off talking points here, but this is like... Oh, it's coming back up at the top and getting air.
[02:55:07.575 --> 02:55:13.519]  I mean, I'm like somebody that went down 80 feet, and I'm coming back up with my flippers, and I just want to get that air.
[02:55:14.657 --> 02:55:21.399]  You know, because my blood's not under pressure when I'm at 30, 40 feet down.
[02:55:21.399 --> 02:55:24.920]  And now my brain's going, whoa, you don't have air, dude.
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:33.543]  So me fighting tyranny is not some heroic effort.
[02:55:33.543 --> 02:55:34.583]  It's air in your lungs.
[02:55:40.322 --> 02:55:41.803]  It's hair in your lungs.
[02:55:41.803 --> 02:55:49.246]  It's not like some heroic thing to suck hair in your lungs, or love your children, or somebody walks up and punches you in the face to kick their ass.
[02:55:49.246 --> 02:55:53.808]  That's not heroic!
[02:55:53.808 --> 02:55:55.889]  That's the thing about fighting, you know.
[02:55:55.889 --> 02:55:58.410]  You don't want to get in a fight with some big guy starting a fight with you.
[02:55:58.410 --> 02:56:04.393]  But you know, as soon as they take a swing, or as soon as they connect, you're like, you know what, I'm gonna beat your ass.
[02:56:04.393 --> 02:56:07.154]  And then it starts, and there's something so satisfying when that bully
[02:56:08.573 --> 02:56:17.118]  It's hit really hard, and then rallies again, and you knock them down again, and all of a sudden they go, yeah, and your foot goes right in their face, and rakes their nose and teeth out.
[02:56:17.118 --> 02:56:21.540]  And I don't want to be like that, but I'm telling you, don't thank me for this.
[02:56:21.540 --> 02:56:23.541]  This is everything.
[02:56:23.541 --> 02:56:25.842]  This is the Animating Contest of Liberty.
[02:56:25.842 --> 02:56:27.023]  This is what it's all about.
[02:56:27.023 --> 02:56:32.346]  I wouldn't be anywhere else, because I love you, and I want to be with you in eternity.
[02:56:32.346 --> 02:56:33.546]  I don't want to go with Satan.
[02:56:33.546 --> 02:56:34.227]  I want to go with God.
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:39.764]  I'm not going to put on some fake, candy-ass, Bible-thumper BS up here.
[02:56:39.764 --> 02:56:41.586]  I love Jesus, and that's it.
[02:56:41.586 --> 02:56:44.428]  Jesus made me, and that's it.
[02:56:44.428 --> 02:56:47.431]  And I love God, and whatever God does through me, it happens.
[02:56:47.431 --> 02:57:00.422]  But I just go out the spirit, and God wouldn't want me to stand up there and tell people how pious I am all day, or sit there and tell people how I read this many books of the Bible, and I memorized this, and I've got all... God wants me to get up and take on the New World Order.
[02:57:01.963 --> 02:57:09.605]  Because if you know one thing about God, God hates cowards.
[02:57:09.605 --> 02:57:11.746]  No one knows who originally said that, but it's true.
[02:57:11.746 --> 02:57:14.727]  God hates cowards.
[02:57:14.727 --> 02:57:23.429]  And God loves people who are default positioned to not have fear and who are committed to God's will.
[02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:25.910]  But our flesh is imperfect.
[02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:29.531]  So to be able to line up with God is a process of flame.
[02:57:30.615 --> 02:57:36.338]  And you've got to be put through the fire of hell to separate the metal from the chest.
[02:57:36.338 --> 02:57:38.859]  That's what it's all about.
[02:57:38.859 --> 02:57:39.720]  All right.
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:44.762]  Big fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:57:44.762 --> 02:57:53.186]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:53.186 --> 02:57:54.647]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:55.438 --> 02:58:02.802]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:02.802 --> 02:58:10.287]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:10.287 --> 02:58:19.112]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:19.112 --> 02:58:23.655]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:24.571 --> 02:58:25.191]  This hard.
[02:58:25.191 --> 02:58:29.093]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[02:58:29.093 --> 02:58:39.718]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[02:59:47.310 --> 03:00:03.139]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.139 --> 03:00:10.604]  Alright, you know, I took a lot of calls this week, and I really want to come in here Sunday, and I will be here Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:10.604 --> 03:00:12.024]  Central.
[03:00:12.024 --> 03:00:15.106]  But there is a lot going on, and we're going to be here tracking it.
[03:00:15.106 --> 03:00:15.947]  The war room's coming up.
[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:26.848]  Obviously this virus is already here in the United States and it's a big deal whether it's an exaggerated situation or whether it's really as deadly as they're saying.
[03:00:26.848 --> 03:00:29.090]  I think it's clear that it's killing some people.
[03:00:29.090 --> 03:00:32.292]  And it's a big UN world government drill.
[03:00:32.292 --> 03:00:41.320]  But I'm really excited that a lot of people get what's happening and realize that this is important.
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:44.822]  In fact, we got some time left before this next guest joins us.
[03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:52.978]  Let me just get up and talk about this right now.
[03:00:52.978 --> 03:00:59.442]  I didn't just start selling storable food to the audience last month or six months ago or a year ago.
[03:00:59.442 --> 03:01:04.745]  I've been selling storable food to people that believe they need to get it.
[03:01:04.745 --> 03:01:06.867]  I've been doing that for 20 plus years.
[03:01:08.336 --> 03:01:11.478]  Because it made sense to me to have insurance you can eat during any crisis.
[03:01:11.478 --> 03:01:13.619]  And we hope Trump and America wins.
[03:01:13.619 --> 03:01:16.120]  We hope the globalists get defeated.
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:26.826]  But in a war like this, there isn't any arming that wins a war, politically or militarily, that doesn't have food backing it up.
[03:01:26.826 --> 03:01:28.547]  And so, that's what we're talking about here.
[03:01:28.547 --> 03:01:32.430]  Napoleon went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[03:01:32.430 --> 03:01:34.691]  Hitler went into Russia, he ran out of food, he failed.
[03:01:36.254 --> 03:01:38.335]  So, you know, Adam Schiff wants us to defeat the Russians.
[03:01:38.335 --> 03:01:39.716]  We need lots of food to do that.
[03:01:39.716 --> 03:01:42.577]  No, we need to defeat the Adam Schiff's of the world.
[03:01:42.577 --> 03:01:46.999]  Because if you don't have food, they control you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:46.999 --> 03:01:50.641]  So, I believed in portable food 20-something years ago.
[03:01:50.641 --> 03:01:52.002]  Got it myself.
[03:01:52.002 --> 03:01:53.282]  It's insurance you can always eat.
[03:01:53.282 --> 03:02:00.266]  But then I noticed that even though there were big reputable companies, during a big spike they made people wait months.
[03:02:01.553 --> 03:02:01.833]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:18.601 --> 03:02:23.346]  You could have a nexus point, like a graph, like what's the lowest price versus what's the best quality.
[03:02:23.346 --> 03:02:27.551]  There's some stuff that I pointed out costs way more, 3, 4, 5, 6 times more.
[03:02:27.551 --> 03:02:28.292]  It's like gourmet.
[03:02:28.292 --> 03:02:29.694]  It's ridiculous how good it is.
[03:02:29.694 --> 03:02:31.095]  But it costs way more.
[03:02:31.095 --> 03:02:32.837]  But on a nexus point, this is right in the middle.
[03:02:33.638 --> 03:02:38.341]  Super low cost, the lowest you're going to find for any decent food, and it's really good, high quality stuff.
[03:02:38.341 --> 03:02:39.421]  Some stuff's like gourmet.
[03:02:39.421 --> 03:02:41.002]  It's like, damn, I eat this every day.
[03:02:41.002 --> 03:02:42.443]  Others are like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[03:02:42.443 --> 03:02:49.567]  The point is, it's really good, and it's not a scam, and they're people that are smart and want a long-term relationship.
[03:02:49.567 --> 03:02:51.208]  You buy it at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:02:51.208 --> 03:02:53.189]  They're in the back end of our computers.
[03:02:53.189 --> 03:02:54.830]  It's my patron supply.
[03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:59.412]  We just get some of the money to fund our operation when you buy it there, InfoWare Store, and they ship it out to you.
[03:02:59.412 --> 03:03:01.914]  They've got food for another 12 days or so.
[03:03:02.594 --> 03:03:04.095]  They're honest about that.
[03:03:04.095 --> 03:03:06.457]  What they don't have is the people to package.
[03:03:06.457 --> 03:03:15.462]  So they're going 24 hours a day at their three factories in the United States, one in Utah, the other two big ones, and that's what's happening.
[03:03:15.462 --> 03:03:18.544]  So they're there, and they're taking your orders.
[03:03:18.544 --> 03:03:23.828]  The other big companies just instantly, when institutions called, sold out.
[03:03:24.639 --> 03:03:27.400]  Big corporations, governments called, they sold out.
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:30.360]  The Chi-Coms bought up all the masks, they're trying to buy up all the food they can.
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:31.940]  Great, the Chinese need food.
[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:33.081]  I get it, they're shipping over there.
[03:03:33.081 --> 03:03:34.001]  That's great.
[03:03:34.001 --> 03:03:43.123]  We are selling food to the American people, and that's the message and the mission of Tim Redhawk, the founder, and the CEO that's coming on with us next segment.
[03:03:43.123 --> 03:03:47.344]  But this is something that is the trifecta.
[03:03:47.344 --> 03:03:50.544]  It's great food, you and your family need.
[03:03:50.544 --> 03:03:53.545]  It funds the information war
[03:03:55.663 --> 03:04:02.148]  And at the same time, it gives you the confidence to know that you've taken care of yourself and your family.
[03:04:02.148 --> 03:04:04.009]  So it's that simple.
[03:04:04.009 --> 03:04:06.111]  It's called Ready Hour.
[03:04:06.111 --> 03:04:13.056]  Now, we used to call it InfoWare Select because I could get around the rules they had at their company to go even lower in the prices to dominate the market.
[03:04:13.056 --> 03:04:14.257]  I am their biggest distributor.
[03:04:14.257 --> 03:04:16.899]  That's how we fund this operation.
[03:04:16.899 --> 03:04:19.882]  But they came to me and they said, that's boosting the price to have to private label it.
[03:04:21.459 --> 03:04:23.360]  Not the private label, just call it what we call it.
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:23.860]  Ready Hour.
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:24.540]  So we do.
[03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:26.541]  Just order it at InfoWorksTour.com.
[03:04:26.541 --> 03:04:28.361]  It funds our whole operation.
[03:04:28.361 --> 03:04:29.602]  And it really is excellent.
[03:04:29.602 --> 03:04:30.422]  It's super high quality.
[03:04:30.422 --> 03:04:33.043]  They have special meals for special diets and so much more.
[03:04:33.043 --> 03:04:36.924]  They have four weeks, they have three months, they have four months, they have six months, they have years.
[03:04:36.924 --> 03:04:42.946]  This is something everyone should do to invest in their future and to begin the road towards preparedness.
[03:04:42.946 --> 03:04:47.667]  As the Chinese say, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[03:04:47.667 --> 03:04:49.788]  Well, getting storable food and firearms
[03:04:50.588 --> 03:04:53.509]  Well, it's here.
[03:04:53.509 --> 03:04:54.429]  The year 2020.
[03:04:54.429 --> 03:04:56.409]  World governments out in the open.
[03:04:56.409 --> 03:05:00.850]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[03:05:00.850 --> 03:05:14.713]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[03:05:14.713 --> 03:05:14.893]  Wow.
[03:05:15.473 --> 03:05:16.974]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[03:05:16.974 --> 03:05:18.294]  The New World Order's real.
[03:05:18.294 --> 03:05:19.335]  Satanism's real.
[03:05:19.335 --> 03:05:20.695]  The pedophile elite are real.
[03:05:20.695 --> 03:05:24.537]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[03:05:24.537 --> 03:05:29.259]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[03:05:29.259 --> 03:05:32.821]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[03:05:32.821 --> 03:05:37.143]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[03:05:37.443 --> 03:05:39.807]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[03:05:39.807 --> 03:05:41.189]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:05:41.189 --> 03:05:44.153]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[03:05:44.153 --> 03:05:51.324]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at memphilwarshaw.com is critical.
[03:05:51.324 --> 03:05:52.106]  So please take action.
[03:05:57.828 --> 03:06:00.269]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:00.269 --> 03:06:07.813]  I want to thank listeners for joining us on this Wednesday broadcast, January 29th, 2020.
[03:06:07.813 --> 03:06:11.194]  And we have a very special guest with us.
[03:06:17.987 --> 03:06:20.108]  Obviously, I just straight shoot the listeners.
[03:06:20.108 --> 03:06:21.388]  It's all I can do.
[03:06:21.388 --> 03:06:26.470]  It's my superpower, is that I just tell the truth to what's going on.
[03:06:26.470 --> 03:06:35.754]  A lot of people, two plus weeks ago, said, why are you promoting storable foods and water filtration while this coronavirus is obviously out of control?
[03:06:35.754 --> 03:06:43.477]  And I said, I'm always promoting water filtration and storable foods and the best storable foods and the best water filtration.
[03:06:43.477 --> 03:06:45.658]  I'm not going to sit here and like freak out at this point.
[03:06:47.213 --> 03:06:52.419]  But then we saw the sales over the last weekend just skyrocket.
[03:06:52.419 --> 03:07:01.969]  And then I got some calls, not just from our main supplier, My Patriot Supply, but I got calls from all over the country.
[03:07:03.527 --> 03:07:10.689]  Different companies trying to get me to endorse their product or become sponsors suddenly.
[03:07:10.689 --> 03:07:16.951]  Well, over a long period of time, the last 12 years, I've worked with My Patriot Supply, who's become the leader.
[03:07:16.951 --> 03:07:21.053]  Because I want somebody who's got quality products that get delivered right on time.
[03:07:22.369 --> 03:07:26.551]  So here I am saying, this isn't a pitch, but if I'm going to pitch food, I'm going to pitch it.
[03:07:26.551 --> 03:07:28.411]  But that's only part of the equation.
[03:07:28.411 --> 03:07:30.052]  Because I'm straight shooting you.
[03:07:30.052 --> 03:07:31.673]  Yes, I'm pitching you food right now.
[03:07:31.673 --> 03:07:32.393]  I can't help it.
[03:07:32.393 --> 03:07:33.894]  I'll be honest right up front.
[03:07:33.894 --> 03:07:45.678]  But that's a side issue to the fact that I've been working with these folks 12 years since they began with a philosophy of high quality food at low prices.
[03:07:45.678 --> 03:07:46.919]  But the reason I've got them on is
[03:07:48.379 --> 03:07:48.679]  I think so.
[03:08:04.844 --> 03:08:06.905]  For storable food.
[03:08:06.905 --> 03:08:14.650]  Well, with 2020 and the establishment trying to trigger riots and with what's happening in the economy, it's always smart to have storable food.
[03:08:14.650 --> 03:08:20.915]  That's why I promote what I already personally believe in and live by, being self-sufficient.
[03:08:20.915 --> 03:08:28.520]  If you aren't self-sufficient, if you don't have food and water and basic communications and control your family, you're not free.
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:29.600]  You're a slave.
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:33.303]  So yes, I'm selling storable food, but that said, let me bring on
[03:08:34.690 --> 03:08:38.714]  Keith Bessemer, who is the president of My Patriot Supply.
[03:08:38.714 --> 03:08:43.879]  Now, I've known Matt Redhawk, who is a very shy person, since he started the company.
[03:08:43.879 --> 03:08:47.723]  They've been a sponsor for 11 years of their 12-year history.
[03:08:47.723 --> 03:08:50.485]  But the real reason they're here today is not even to sell you food.
[03:08:50.485 --> 03:08:52.728]  They're selling it out faster than they can get it.
[03:08:52.728 --> 03:08:55.550]  It's to break down the fact that I gave them a call.
[03:08:56.573 --> 03:09:02.184]  A few days ago when I said, I'm getting calls that the food's selling out and they're gearing up for some big emergency.
[03:09:02.184 --> 03:09:03.667]  Do you know about this?
[03:09:03.667 --> 03:09:06.272]  Can you tell me if there's been big governmental buyers coming to you?
[03:09:06.272 --> 03:09:08.176]  And they said, listen, it's no secret.
[03:09:09.127 --> 03:09:22.330]  We've had the General Services Administration, which I should have said up front, coming to us trying to buy up everything we've got, because all the other major food distributors are either sold out or close to selling out.
[03:09:22.330 --> 03:09:33.233]  So, he joins us now, other than me pontificating all day, because obviously I want you to get storable food, I want you to be prepared, I want you to be self-sufficient for whatever's coming on the pipe, but the story
[03:09:34.133 --> 03:09:35.794]  Of how the U.S.
[03:09:35.794 --> 03:09:42.539]  government is trying to buy up the food supply and what's happening with this coronavirus, that's the big issue that's front and center.
[03:09:42.539 --> 03:09:48.603]  So this is 70% news story, 30% selling food because it's so crazy.
[03:09:48.603 --> 03:09:50.524]  So, Keith, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:09:50.524 --> 03:10:03.813]  Again, I just straight shot the audience that, yeah, I'm selling food, but as a father, as a patriot, as an American, as somebody concerned about China, the information you have that I called and solicited from you is what's really crazy for me.
[03:10:05.493 --> 03:10:08.894]  Glad to be on, Alex, and good to speak with you once again here.
[03:10:08.894 --> 03:10:13.316]  Matt is in travel right now, is in the air.
[03:10:13.316 --> 03:10:17.077]  He has travel commitments today or else he would have been on.
[03:10:17.077 --> 03:10:33.542]  He's been visiting with our suppliers to make sure that we've got all the materials to make the meals and package the foods and get the things out to both your viewers and those in your store and your shoppers and the folks at MyPatriotSupplies.
[03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:36.617]  But you're right.
[03:10:36.617 --> 03:10:39.197]  This started in November.
[03:10:39.197 --> 03:10:58.302]  I started getting emails, phone calls from different people from the government, basically, trying to get us into a system where you can get GSA contracts to work with the government on making large purchases of storable food.
[03:10:58.302 --> 03:11:00.443]  And we've always said no.
[03:11:00.443 --> 03:11:01.643]  We will never do that.
[03:11:01.643 --> 03:11:03.944]  We will not sell to the government of my Patriot Supply.
[03:11:04.724 --> 03:11:06.285]  But they keep calling, Alex.
[03:11:06.285 --> 03:11:07.885]  They keep emailing.
[03:11:07.885 --> 03:11:12.147]  As recent as yesterday, I'm getting phone calls going, would you go into the system?
[03:11:12.147 --> 03:11:16.709]  You get into the system, so that we can see, they want all the information.
[03:11:16.709 --> 03:11:18.210]  How much food can you make?
[03:11:18.210 --> 03:11:19.270]  Where are your warehouses?
[03:11:19.270 --> 03:11:20.651]  How big are the warehouses?
[03:11:20.651 --> 03:11:24.432]  How fast can you get more raw materials to make food kits?
[03:11:24.432 --> 03:11:25.813]  They want this information.
[03:11:25.813 --> 03:11:26.933]  And we just said, no.
[03:11:26.933 --> 03:11:28.014]  And they keep calling, Alex.
[03:11:30.296 --> 03:11:31.597]  Why do you think that is?
[03:11:31.597 --> 03:11:33.379]  Because I'm always selling storable food.
[03:11:33.379 --> 03:11:33.999]  I believe in it.
[03:11:33.999 --> 03:11:36.261]  You guys are great.
[03:11:36.261 --> 03:11:38.263]  But now, it's different.
[03:11:38.263 --> 03:11:40.004]  I mean, they're like really pushing hard.
[03:11:40.004 --> 03:11:43.407]  What does that signify to you?
[03:11:43.407 --> 03:11:45.469]  Well, it tells me they know something that we don't.
[03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:47.771]  And that's typical, I'm guessing.
[03:11:47.771 --> 03:11:51.574]  You know, FEMA's gonna, you know, buy a stock up for something.
[03:11:51.574 --> 03:11:56.358]  And, you know, be it, you know, to control, I guess.
[03:11:57.704 --> 03:11:59.585]  We don't want to do that.
[03:11:59.585 --> 03:12:00.886]  My Patriots apply.
[03:12:00.886 --> 03:12:03.568]  We service Americans.
[03:12:03.568 --> 03:12:06.650]  We want to work direct with Americans to help them prepare.
[03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:12.795]  We don't need some go-between, in-between that's preparing for something in the future that they know and they control.
[03:12:14.738 --> 03:12:15.859]  Well, that's really it.
[03:12:15.859 --> 03:12:21.464]  So, again, I began to get calls weeks ago, why aren't you promoting swearable food by other parties?
[03:12:21.464 --> 03:12:28.489]  I said, well, we've got the best group, My Patriot, and people go to Inforestore.com, it drops ships within an hour, and it funds our operation.
[03:12:28.489 --> 03:12:34.154]  You know, we've already been with them over a decade, that's who we're with, but okay, but you know something big's coming.
[03:12:34.154 --> 03:12:43.642]  And I've just kind of been punch drunk with the coverage of the trial of President Trump and all the other news, but now it's suddenly hit like a ton of bricks the last few days.
[03:12:45.405 --> 03:12:47.166]  It certainly has.
[03:12:47.166 --> 03:12:50.127]  The sale of food storage has been off the charts.
[03:12:50.127 --> 03:12:51.708]  You're talking about it.
[03:12:51.708 --> 03:12:53.068]  We're seeing it.
[03:12:53.068 --> 03:13:00.112]  We're running four lines constantly, 16 hours a day to ship at our multiple warehouses across the country.
[03:13:00.112 --> 03:13:07.495]  We're doing everything we can possible to get food storage to Americans, to the patriots out there.
[03:13:07.495 --> 03:13:09.256]  But we're seeing the outer limits of this.
[03:13:10.638 --> 03:13:19.982]  You know, Matt's been visiting with the suppliers and we have convoys of semis on the way to our production facilities with all these raw ingredients need to make foods.
[03:13:19.982 --> 03:13:26.965]  That's like the rices and the potatoes and the veggies and the sauces and the pastas and such.
[03:13:26.965 --> 03:13:35.969]  And we, you know, it takes about 90 days from the day we say, hey, give us a truck full of rice to when it's ready in a package to ship to the customer.
[03:13:35.969 --> 03:13:38.930]  So we've pulled forth all these contracts that we have.
[03:13:39.517 --> 03:13:45.618]  All these purchase orders from 90 days forward to get it to our facilities now, so we can supply folks.
[03:13:45.618 --> 03:13:54.500]  But, you know, the outer limit is in the next two, maybe three weeks, you know, we're not going to be able to ship food much longer here.
[03:13:54.500 --> 03:13:56.401]  And we're going to be like the others.
[03:13:56.401 --> 03:14:00.062]  I guess that, well, the others are selling to someone else.
[03:14:00.062 --> 03:14:01.962]  We're selling direct to Americans.
[03:14:03.523 --> 03:14:04.725]  And that's really the truth here.
[03:14:04.725 --> 03:14:07.527]  People are asking me, hey, you know, there's food's been sold out.
[03:14:07.527 --> 03:14:08.708]  Hey, you know, government's buying it up.
[03:14:08.708 --> 03:14:09.529]  Why aren't you covering this?
[03:14:09.529 --> 03:14:12.112]  Then I call you guys and I go, yeah, it's insane.
[03:14:12.112 --> 03:14:13.593]  Lines of semis.
[03:14:13.593 --> 03:14:14.654]  Most people are sold out.
[03:14:14.654 --> 03:14:17.216]  We're still offering at this price.
[03:14:17.216 --> 03:14:22.982]  People should order now to make sure they get it within, I guess they ordered today, within seven to 10 days.
[03:14:22.982 --> 03:14:25.845]  You're being honest that you're close to being like all the others.
[03:14:27.179 --> 03:14:28.200]  You're not like all the others.
[03:14:28.200 --> 03:14:32.583]  When you guys run out of food or have a wait, you tell people the others are famous.
[03:14:32.583 --> 03:14:34.024]  That's why I use you guys.
[03:14:34.024 --> 03:14:37.327]  You have great food, high quality of fair price.
[03:14:37.327 --> 03:14:42.471]  And I don't like listeners that pay for something and then don't give it delivered.
[03:14:42.811 --> 03:14:44.472]  I've been through that a few times.
[03:14:44.472 --> 03:14:45.453]  I won't go through it again.
[03:14:45.453 --> 03:14:47.515]  That's why you guys are my sole sponsor.
[03:14:47.515 --> 03:14:48.695]  And so, yes, it's true.
[03:14:48.695 --> 03:14:51.117]  Like everything we promote here, it's the real McCoy.
[03:14:51.117 --> 03:14:54.019]  And if they order with you, they will get the food.
[03:14:54.019 --> 03:14:55.160]  You have it in supply.
[03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:56.861]  You have it in pipeline.
[03:14:56.861 --> 03:15:01.745]  How many days can you hold out until you've got to push that date from 7 to 10 days out?
[03:15:03.331 --> 03:15:06.174]  Well, I'd say we're all good for about the next two weeks here, Alex.
[03:15:06.174 --> 03:15:08.557]  You know, you put the order in, you know, the staff is working.
[03:15:08.557 --> 03:15:14.984]  They're going to get it out as quickly as possible there, and then it's some shipping time to get to wherever in the United States here.
[03:15:14.984 --> 03:15:16.346]  But three weeks?
[03:15:16.346 --> 03:15:17.647]  Now we're in a guessing game.
[03:15:17.647 --> 03:15:19.009]  And, you know, we don't know how much
[03:15:19.937 --> 03:15:21.859]  More of the sales are going to increase.
[03:15:21.859 --> 03:15:26.062]  The demand for emergency food storage in the last couple of days here.
[03:15:26.062 --> 03:15:27.644]  You know, Friday was one number.
[03:15:27.644 --> 03:15:29.665]  And then that number doubled on Sunday.
[03:15:29.665 --> 03:15:30.946]  That number doubled again.
[03:15:30.946 --> 03:15:32.328]  Well, it's doubling today.
[03:15:32.328 --> 03:15:37.011]  Okay, Keith Messimer, the president of My Patriot Supply.
[03:15:37.011 --> 03:15:39.774]  It might be the best triple food company in the United States.
[03:15:39.774 --> 03:15:41.135]  That's why I have him as a sponsor.
[03:15:41.135 --> 03:15:44.017]  I want you to get what you pay for and come back again.
[03:15:44.017 --> 03:15:45.378]  He's here with us.
[03:15:45.378 --> 03:15:47.220]  We'll talk about what's really going on when we come back.
[03:15:51.903 --> 03:15:55.786]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:15:55.786 --> 03:16:00.770]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:09.772]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[03:17:09.952 --> 03:17:10.432]  We're good.
[03:17:28.763 --> 03:17:29.384]  Each month.
[03:17:29.384 --> 03:17:30.245]  Don't miss this one.
[03:17:30.245 --> 03:17:31.065]  Stake your claim today.
[03:17:31.065 --> 03:17:31.246]  Call 800-600-3388.
[03:17:31.246 --> 03:17:31.466]  That's 800-600-3388.
[03:17:31.466 --> 03:17:32.807]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[03:17:32.807 --> 03:17:33.127]  Call now.
[03:17:33.127 --> 03:17:33.188]  800-600-3388.
[03:17:33.188 --> 03:17:33.268]  800-600-3388.
[03:17:33.268 --> 03:17:34.469]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners.
[03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:36.110]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:38.653]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[03:17:53.007 --> 03:18:04.718]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate Infowars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[03:18:04.718 --> 03:18:13.506]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[03:18:14.187 --> 03:18:18.749]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[03:18:18.749 --> 03:18:24.672]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[03:18:24.672 --> 03:18:29.754]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[03:18:30.234 --> 03:18:40.182]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[03:18:40.182 --> 03:18:42.924]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[03:18:42.924 --> 03:18:45.486]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[03:18:45.486 --> 03:18:48.588]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[03:18:48.588 --> 03:18:52.011]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[03:18:54.212 --> 03:18:57.477]  This should really be easier than it is.
[03:18:57.477 --> 03:18:59.620]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[03:18:59.620 --> 03:19:02.083]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[03:19:02.083 --> 03:19:09.194]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see
[03:19:09.554 --> 03:19:09.774]  I hope so.
[03:19:32.623 --> 03:19:37.626]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[03:19:37.626 --> 03:19:45.311]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[03:19:45.311 --> 03:19:46.492]  It's amazing.
[03:19:46.492 --> 03:19:50.074]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[03:19:50.074 --> 03:19:56.398]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[03:19:56.398 --> 03:19:59.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.742 --> 03:20:16.547]  So, I have this neurotic thing I do where I just tell you exactly what I'm thinking and where I'm at.
[03:20:16.547 --> 03:20:28.437]  Because, hey, great, I sell you a bunch of storable food, it funds M4s, we fight the globalists, fight for the unborn, fight for the Second Amendment, I'm buying storable food, it's a great company, I believe in it, so I sleep good at night promoting this.
[03:20:28.437 --> 03:20:35.362]  But if I get into obsessing over telling you, yeah, I'm selling you storable food, it misses the whole story.
[03:20:35.362 --> 03:20:36.463]  We're always selling storable food.
[03:20:37.833 --> 03:20:42.776]  Why now is there this giant shortage that we're reporting to you?
[03:20:42.776 --> 03:20:59.566]  Why is there this institutional run on food with the General Service Administration calling our big sponsor, My Patriot Supply, and Keith Bansumer and saying, we want everything you've got.
[03:20:59.566 --> 03:21:02.368]  That's really the big story here is that
[03:21:03.871 --> 03:21:06.051]  Wow, there's a run on food.
[03:21:06.051 --> 03:21:07.792]  The Chinese shelves are empty.
[03:21:07.792 --> 03:21:10.632]  China exports a lot of food as well, not just imports.
[03:21:10.632 --> 03:21:13.773]  What happens when other countries can't ship?
[03:21:13.773 --> 03:21:18.374]  What happens if this thing does become a over-the-top pandemic?
[03:21:18.374 --> 03:21:24.435]  So I believe in storable food for patriots so that we're not dependent on the system.
[03:21:24.435 --> 03:21:25.475]  That's just a default.
[03:21:25.475 --> 03:21:26.876]  We're always promoting food.
[03:21:26.876 --> 03:21:31.857]  We're not promoting high-quality, storable food just a day or vitamin D3 just a day.
[03:21:31.857 --> 03:21:32.657]  We're doing that all the time.
[03:21:33.922 --> 03:21:37.463]  But what does it signify when the U.S.
[03:21:37.463 --> 03:21:46.607]  government's quietly, not just contacting MyPatriotSupply, but contacting everybody trying to buy up the food?
[03:21:46.607 --> 03:21:51.128]  Well, it shows that this thing is already out of control in China.
[03:21:51.128 --> 03:21:52.929]  It could get out of control here.
[03:21:52.929 --> 03:21:54.850]  And it's not just food that people need.
[03:21:54.850 --> 03:21:56.650]  They need to get right with God.
[03:21:56.650 --> 03:22:01.772]  Keith, talking to your suppliers, talking to everybody, why are they so panicked?
[03:22:01.772 --> 03:22:03.093]  What do you really think is going on right now?
[03:22:05.193 --> 03:22:08.415]  It's definitely the chatter about the coronavirus there, Alex.
[03:22:08.415 --> 03:22:10.076]  I mean, that's what we're hearing.
[03:22:10.076 --> 03:22:13.317]  That's why people are making a purchase here.
[03:22:13.317 --> 03:22:15.438]  I mean, the word quarantine.
[03:22:15.438 --> 03:22:17.179]  That's a big word.
[03:22:17.179 --> 03:22:20.441]  Look what's happening to those millions of people in China there.
[03:22:20.441 --> 03:22:23.743]  And move that word quarantine to a city in the U.S.
[03:22:23.743 --> 03:22:25.203]  means you don't leave your home.
[03:22:25.203 --> 03:22:26.304]  It means stores are shut.
[03:22:26.304 --> 03:22:27.505]  It means you can't get out.
[03:22:27.505 --> 03:22:30.086]  And how much food is sitting on the sidelines.
[03:22:30.086 --> 03:22:31.807]  That's what Americans are thinking right now.
[03:22:32.765 --> 03:22:33.306]  I don't know.
[03:22:46.478 --> 03:22:50.180]  I'm getting voicemails, you know, saying, would you go into the system?
[03:22:50.180 --> 03:22:53.101]  Will you get all that information entered into the system?
[03:22:53.101 --> 03:22:55.402]  Tell us about what you can do for us.
[03:22:55.402 --> 03:23:00.784]  So why do you think, why do you think the Deep State, FEMA, the GSA is contacting you?
[03:23:00.784 --> 03:23:06.746]  I mean, obviously, because they're worried about a big crisis, but why are they pushing so hard to know what you can supply?
[03:23:06.746 --> 03:23:10.047]  Well, you know, you know, control the information.
[03:23:10.854 --> 03:23:13.315]  Control the food supply, you control the people.
[03:23:13.315 --> 03:23:17.358]  I mean, it really comes down to a very simple equation.
[03:23:17.358 --> 03:23:25.202]  And you watch it in a microcosm around the world, and you pray to God it just doesn't come to us.
[03:23:25.202 --> 03:23:29.585]  Last week, I guess it was last Tuesday or Wednesday, I was like, I better get some mask.
[03:23:30.615 --> 03:23:31.455]  We're not being opportunistic.
[03:23:31.455 --> 03:23:32.936]  We're the people that warned up front about this.
[03:24:00.524 --> 03:24:02.811]  And this is an insurance policy people should eat.
[03:24:02.811 --> 03:24:05.859]  Everyone should go to MFootworkstore.com because we just...
[03:24:06.937 --> 03:24:08.218]  Autoship you guys.
[03:24:08.218 --> 03:24:11.259]  We send you the order right away within hours.
[03:24:11.259 --> 03:24:12.900]  Dropship, I guess, is the word.
[03:24:12.900 --> 03:24:15.341]  And then they get the highest quality storable foods.
[03:24:15.341 --> 03:24:17.602]  And it also funds the InfoWar, a win-win.
[03:24:17.602 --> 03:24:19.864]  And I hope that people don't need this food.
[03:24:19.864 --> 03:24:23.385]  But I was just sitting back last week going, wait, I'm ordering more food.
[03:24:23.385 --> 03:24:25.086]  I'm ordering gas masks.
[03:24:25.086 --> 03:24:26.967]  I should be promoting this to my audience.
[03:24:26.967 --> 03:24:28.928]  And we shouldn't be ashamed of that.
[03:24:28.928 --> 03:24:34.231]  We should be proud that we are warning Americans and others and getting them ready.
[03:24:34.231 --> 03:24:34.891]  Absolutely.
[03:24:34.891 --> 03:24:36.672]  I mean, we prepare for a hurricane, right?
[03:24:37.508 --> 03:24:43.350]  You see what Americans do when a hurricane's approaching one of the Gulf Coast states.
[03:24:43.350 --> 03:24:46.652]  And so, you know, people run and prepare in stores days in advance.
[03:24:46.652 --> 03:24:47.992]  Same thing is playing out here.
[03:24:47.992 --> 03:24:50.113]  You know, it may come to pass.
[03:24:50.113 --> 03:24:51.393]  It may not come to pass.
[03:24:51.393 --> 03:24:53.534]  You know, we certainly hope it doesn't.
[03:24:53.534 --> 03:24:56.075]  But it doesn't hurt to be prepared.
[03:24:56.075 --> 03:24:57.516]  That's what my kids, you know, ask me.
[03:24:57.516 --> 03:25:00.877]  They go, Dad, should we be stocking something?
[03:25:00.877 --> 03:25:01.737]  I say, you like to eat?
[03:25:01.737 --> 03:25:03.958]  You know, well, of course they do.
[03:25:03.958 --> 03:25:05.779]  So, you know, well, there's nothing wrong with having a little
[03:25:06.178 --> 03:25:13.568]  Food storage at the ready so that you don't have to deal with the chaos when it's quote-unquote too late.
[03:25:13.568 --> 03:25:21.318]  There's nothing I'd like more than this coronavirus to end in China, end here, not be a big problem.
[03:25:22.125 --> 03:25:27.867]  I just see all the preparation going on and I hope we're wrong, and I hope this isn't needed.
[03:25:27.867 --> 03:25:36.051]  But I'm absolutely excited to get people thinking about being prepared for economic collapse, war, all of it.
[03:25:36.051 --> 03:25:44.474]  I'm not excited about those prospects, but I'm very excited about getting people to think about being independent, because once you start that mindset,
[03:25:45.094 --> 03:25:51.156]  of being self-sufficient and being independent, you're not under the system's control.
[03:25:51.156 --> 03:25:51.976]  It's like magic.
[03:25:51.976 --> 03:25:55.538]  We've got to get to the point of being independent.
[03:25:55.538 --> 03:26:04.121]  Even if we just mentally think about what does that mean, that's that big step, like the Chinese say, that leads to a thousand miles.
[03:26:04.121 --> 03:26:05.041]  It certainly does.
[03:26:05.041 --> 03:26:10.363]  And, you know, Alex, if you stop and think about it, we are all preparers in some way, shape or form.
[03:26:10.939 --> 03:26:14.561]  We prepare for retirement with 401ks and IRAs.
[03:26:14.561 --> 03:26:20.204]  We prepare with medical insurance in case there's a hospital disaster and you got the big bills coming for that.
[03:26:20.204 --> 03:26:23.085]  We prepare for fire by having smoke detectors.
[03:26:23.085 --> 03:26:33.270]  We've got car jacks and spare tires in our car, jumper cables here preparing for that day when maybe the car is not going to be working the right way or the wheel blows out here.
[03:26:33.270 --> 03:26:35.972]  I mean, I carry a gun in my glove compartment.
[03:26:35.972 --> 03:26:38.073]  I'm not looking for a fight, but it's there in case I need it.
[03:26:39.267 --> 03:26:40.428]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:26:40.428 --> 03:26:42.390]  So food preparation is the same thing.
[03:26:42.390 --> 03:26:44.012]  It just makes common sense.
[03:26:44.012 --> 03:26:48.916]  So have a little extra on the store shelves for whatever the emergency is.
[03:26:48.916 --> 03:26:51.799]  It's coronavirus or the day the power goes out.
[03:26:51.799 --> 03:26:53.361]  Power goes out in your home.
[03:26:53.361 --> 03:26:55.383]  Any day, any moment, any time.
[03:26:55.383 --> 03:26:57.725]  You're asking yourself the question, well how long?
[03:26:57.725 --> 03:26:58.165]  Right away?
[03:26:58.165 --> 03:27:00.027]  Okay, an hour or two, you're fine.
[03:27:00.027 --> 03:27:00.468]  Day?
[03:27:00.468 --> 03:27:01.108]  Okay.
[03:27:01.108 --> 03:27:02.129]  What if it's a week?
[03:27:02.129 --> 03:27:02.730]  What if it's a month?
[03:27:03.103 --> 03:27:04.164]  That's what you're prepared for.
[03:27:04.164 --> 03:27:06.325]  You're ready, so you don't have to worry about those things.
[03:27:06.325 --> 03:27:07.585]  Well, that's right, Keith.
[03:27:07.585 --> 03:27:14.489]  The whole system is based on people being dependent on the system and not self-sufficient.
[03:27:14.489 --> 03:27:17.630]  So everything we can be to be self-sufficient is a big plus.
[03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:26.675]  And if people can be self-sufficient and get the best high-quality, storable foods at the lowest price, while funding information that promotes freedom in general, that's a 360 win.
[03:27:26.675 --> 03:27:27.895]  Infowarstore.com, folks.
[03:27:29.676 --> 03:27:32.837]  We have the full MyPatriotSupply system.
[03:27:32.837 --> 03:27:34.797]  We send them orders every hour during the day.
[03:27:34.797 --> 03:27:37.838]  So it's drop ship, but then that supports this operation.
[03:27:37.838 --> 03:27:41.158]  The only way you lose is not being prepared, not funding the InfoWar.
[03:27:41.158 --> 03:27:43.819]  So please go to InfoWarStore.com today.
[03:27:43.819 --> 03:27:45.259]  We have the full catalog.
[03:27:45.259 --> 03:27:48.920]  But like you said, that's the real reason I wanted to get you on.
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:50.980]  People say, Jones, you always sell food.
[03:27:50.980 --> 03:27:51.921]  You always say, buy it.
[03:27:51.921 --> 03:27:55.081]  Why are you now saying, get involved in this?
[03:27:55.081 --> 03:27:58.302]  It's because I know from other people calling me
[03:27:59.434 --> 03:28:00.695]  You guys didn't even contact me.
[03:28:00.695 --> 03:28:04.738]  In fact, I know you got to go and it's, you know, you've got a lot going on.
[03:28:04.738 --> 03:28:07.220]  You got a lot to manage, but we got to go to break here.
[03:28:07.220 --> 03:28:10.943]  Do five more minutes with me because we haven't even talked in person about this.
[03:28:10.943 --> 03:28:14.506]  I know I talked to Matt and a few others, but you guys didn't contact me.
[03:28:15.186 --> 03:28:19.690]  So I mean, I've got literally like 15 other food companies contacting me.
[03:28:19.690 --> 03:28:21.772]  I just said, OK, what's your background?
[03:28:21.772 --> 03:28:22.672]  You got a big supply?
[03:28:22.672 --> 03:28:24.354]  They're like, well, actually, we don't.
[03:28:24.354 --> 03:28:30.539]  You guys do is why I chose you many years ago, because I want my listeners to get a good response.
[03:28:30.539 --> 03:28:33.181]  So they treat me like I want to be treated.
[03:28:33.181 --> 03:28:34.523]  So let's come back and talk about.
[03:28:35.123 --> 03:28:47.512]  Kind of the way this started and how it built up to where it is now where you guys are buying up all the food around the country and got convoys of 18 wheelers going to Utah.
[03:28:47.512 --> 03:28:48.233]  Decided to do it, Alex.
[03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:55.151]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[03:30:06.465 --> 03:30:14.911]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[03:30:14.911 --> 03:30:17.112]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[03:30:17.112 --> 03:30:21.995]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[03:30:21.995 --> 03:30:24.377]  So just check it out for yourself.
[03:30:24.377 --> 03:30:24.797]  40% off.

[03:30:27.119 --> 03:30:28.340]  And then Vitamin
[03:30:28.900 --> 03:30:31.761]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[03:30:31.761 --> 03:30:33.002]  Super high quality.
[03:30:33.002 --> 03:30:34.062]  Winter sun.
[03:30:34.062 --> 03:30:35.883]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[03:30:35.883 --> 03:30:38.504]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[03:30:38.504 --> 03:30:39.785]  That's why people get so sick.
[03:30:39.785 --> 03:30:40.585]  That's the main reason.
[03:30:40.585 --> 03:30:42.826]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[03:30:42.826 --> 03:30:43.686]  Get higher absorption.
[03:30:43.686 --> 03:30:44.567]  It's amazing.
[03:30:44.567 --> 03:30:49.329]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarStore.com.
[03:30:49.329 --> 03:30:51.249]  Protect yourself and fund the Infowar.
[03:30:51.249 --> 03:30:51.369]  360WIN.
[03:30:53.130 --> 03:31:02.435]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high-quality, organic, vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[03:31:02.435 --> 03:31:19.243]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring, that people aren't getting sunlight, so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs, and then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[03:31:19.463 --> 03:31:24.825]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[03:31:24.825 --> 03:31:31.827]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter, and spring.
[03:31:31.827 --> 03:31:41.050]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off, $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price.
[03:31:41.050 --> 03:31:45.472]  Because I want you to get it, and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[03:31:45.692 --> 03:31:47.213]  So, winner, son.
[03:31:47.213 --> 03:31:50.154]  Taken out of the tongue, super high quality, 40% off.
[03:31:50.154 --> 03:31:53.095]  Available now at Infowarestore.com.
[03:31:53.095 --> 03:31:56.116]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[03:31:56.116 --> 03:32:00.718]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[03:32:00.718 --> 03:32:05.820]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress and your hectic day.

[03:32:40.792 --> 03:32:47.994]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.

[03:32:55.896 --> 03:33:18.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:18.435 --> 03:33:24.100]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this Wednesday Global Transmission.
[03:33:25.717 --> 03:33:28.982]  And a lot of times we're ahead of the curve.
[03:33:28.982 --> 03:33:30.725]  Most of the time we are.
[03:33:30.725 --> 03:33:31.947]  But when it comes to
[03:33:34.130 --> 03:33:39.014]  Promoting something or a product that has to do with the crisis we tend to be behind the curve.
[03:33:39.014 --> 03:33:44.858]  So like I said last week, early last week, I'm like, hey, I need some more virus masks.
[03:33:44.858 --> 03:33:45.679]  I need some more food.
[03:33:45.679 --> 03:33:48.160]  I got to take care of my neighbors if stuff goes down.
[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:49.361]  It's just something I do.
[03:33:49.361 --> 03:33:50.822]  Like I have insurance.
[03:33:50.822 --> 03:33:51.723]  I've got a gun safe.
[03:33:51.723 --> 03:33:52.564]  I've got security.
[03:33:52.564 --> 03:33:54.645]  I mean, I'm a father.
[03:33:54.645 --> 03:33:55.886]  I've got to be in charge.
[03:33:55.886 --> 03:33:57.767]  I'm trying to prepare for the future.
[03:33:57.767 --> 03:34:01.870]  You know, I've got a little armored redoubt outside town, you know, four or five acres with a
[03:34:02.765 --> 03:34:06.189]  Gun safe and food because I'm not living in fear.
[03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:08.131]  I'm living empowered.
[03:34:08.131 --> 03:34:13.296]  Like I've got a big bumper on my Ford truck.
[03:34:13.296 --> 03:34:16.439]  I've got a gun safe right over here and I know how to use the guns.
[03:34:16.439 --> 03:34:17.661]  I'm not living in fear.
[03:34:17.661 --> 03:34:20.764]  I'm living empowered, but I did miss the boat on this one.
[03:34:22.148 --> 03:34:27.230]  And I've got to say, my Patriot Supply, I'm proud to say missed the boat on it because they're not even out there promoting things.
[03:34:27.230 --> 03:34:32.272]  They're one of the biggest, most successful turbo food companies in the country.
[03:34:32.272 --> 03:34:34.392]  We private label it because I got a better deal.
[03:34:34.392 --> 03:34:36.733]  We're not in a crisis to sell their food.
[03:34:36.733 --> 03:34:38.694]  It's all drop shipped every day from them.
[03:34:38.694 --> 03:34:42.995]  So it just says InfoWars Select on it, but it's their whole catalog.
[03:34:42.995 --> 03:34:46.117]  InfoWarsTore.com, same price, funds their operation.
[03:34:46.117 --> 03:34:46.937]  Hope you'll buy it there.
[03:34:48.766 --> 03:34:50.407]  We're here in the middle of all this.
[03:34:50.407 --> 03:34:58.732]  It's bigger than just buying food or having a firearm or trying to buy some property out town.
[03:34:58.732 --> 03:35:05.796]  It's the idea of during the Great Depression in 1929 to about 1938 or 1939, major universities estimate 17 million people starved to death.
[03:35:05.796 --> 03:35:07.957]  You had about 87% of people that were rural,
[03:35:16.084 --> 03:35:17.966]  About half of them that were self-sufficient.
[03:35:17.966 --> 03:35:24.872]  So we're talking 40-plus percent that were totally self-sufficient.
[03:35:24.872 --> 03:35:27.415]  Well, today, we're not 90% rural or 87% rural.
[03:35:27.415 --> 03:35:28.436]  We're almost 100% urban.
[03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:37.710]  And other people that are rural, very few are self-sufficient.
[03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:44.192]  So again, we all know that ant saves food in the old parable, the grasshopper doesn't.
[03:35:44.192 --> 03:35:46.193]  So it's that simple equation.
[03:35:46.193 --> 03:35:52.475]  Everything the globalists do is about making you dependent on them, hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck.
[03:35:52.995 --> 03:36:05.184]  But, moving to a rural area, or close to a rural area, or being self-sufficient, or even having a redoubt, or even having supportable foods, that is a major plus in some type of Bernie Sanders communist overthrow.
[03:36:05.184 --> 03:36:10.028]  So, Keith Mansomer is the president of My Patriot Supply.
[03:36:10.028 --> 03:36:17.893]  I've been a big fan and supporter of the owner of My Patriot Supply for more than 10 years, Matt Redhawk, who's too humble to come on the show.
[03:36:17.893 --> 03:36:20.936]  I tried to get him to today, but just at the time we have left,
[03:36:21.556 --> 03:36:24.897]  Talk about what's happening with other storable food companies.
[03:36:24.897 --> 03:36:33.221]  The fact that they sit there and have a limited supply, wait till there's a crisis, sell out of it, and then get people to buy the food they don't have in stock.
[03:36:33.221 --> 03:36:37.502]  You're selling food you've got in stock that you're freshly packaging now.
[03:36:37.502 --> 03:36:41.424]  So that's why, during this crisis, I'm proud to be promoting that.
[03:36:41.424 --> 03:36:41.984]  Absolutely.
[03:36:41.984 --> 03:36:47.506]  You know, all the orders that come in today and the InfoWars store and such, we've got the product.
[03:36:47.506 --> 03:36:51.168]  It might take us a little longer because of the sheer volume of what's happening, you
[03:36:51.986 --> 03:36:58.371]  Eight, nine times normal capacities and such to get it out the door, but it's going to be delivered to you.
[03:36:58.371 --> 03:37:06.216]  That's not the story that we're hearing from customers that are calling us and chatting and emailing and social media and all.
[03:37:06.216 --> 03:37:17.704]  They're saying, look, these other guys, I just went and checked them out, and they're saying they might be able to ship it next week, and then it's going to take a couple of weeks after that, and I might not see something for two to three weeks.
[03:37:18.386 --> 03:37:21.389]  That's not the company we built at My Patriot Supply.
[03:37:21.389 --> 03:37:22.150]  You're being nice.
[03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:25.233]  The inside baseball is, they're sold out.
[03:37:25.233 --> 03:37:26.634]  They can't even get the food.
[03:37:26.634 --> 03:37:31.059]  You and Matt set up, that's why I chose you guys, the infrastructure in a real crisis.
[03:37:31.059 --> 03:37:33.862]  You guys have that reach at least for a few weeks.
[03:37:33.862 --> 03:37:36.124]  You're being honest about that though.
[03:37:36.124 --> 03:37:36.845]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:37:36.845 --> 03:37:41.710]  That's exactly why we have multiple warehouses and we've built the company for this moment.
[03:37:42.458 --> 03:37:45.100]  You know, it's that moment of awareness.
[03:37:45.100 --> 03:37:47.703]  You know people are going to say, hey, I know I need it.
[03:37:47.703 --> 03:37:48.363]  I need it now.
[03:37:48.363 --> 03:37:49.464]  Well, let me ask you this.
[03:37:49.464 --> 03:37:53.527]  Why was I contacted by over a dozen companies wanting me to do it?
[03:37:53.527 --> 03:37:55.029]  And you guys are my main sponsor.
[03:37:55.029 --> 03:37:55.409]  I'm busy.
[03:37:55.409 --> 03:37:56.230]  You're busy.
[03:37:56.230 --> 03:37:57.551]  That says something.
[03:37:57.551 --> 03:37:59.052]  You didn't even contact me.
[03:37:59.052 --> 03:38:01.094]  You're just too busy supplying the food.
[03:38:01.094 --> 03:38:03.016]  You didn't even contact one of your biggest distributors.
[03:38:03.016 --> 03:38:06.118]  That shows your focus, not even on sales.
[03:38:06.118 --> 03:38:07.419]  That's why I begged you to come on.
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:10.141]  You're like literally focused on fulfillment.
[03:38:10.141 --> 03:38:13.942]  Talk about what you're doing right now to make sure it all gets fulfilled.
[03:38:13.942 --> 03:38:14.762]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:38:14.762 --> 03:38:24.766]  So you're making sure that we've got, you know, plenty of the raw materials to make all the foods and continue to kit them and, you know, get the meals and put them in the heavy duty four layer packaging.
[03:38:24.766 --> 03:38:28.207]  But we're running four times, four lines, I should say.
[03:38:28.892 --> 03:38:30.053]  I mean, you're busting your ass.
[03:38:30.053 --> 03:38:31.154]  But talk about that.
[03:38:31.154 --> 03:38:35.497]  It's not that we're against the government, but why are you guys, whenever the government tries to buy it up, saying no?
[03:38:59.266 --> 03:39:01.068]  No, because that's our mission.
[03:39:01.068 --> 03:39:02.770]  Our mission is to help Americans direct.
[03:39:02.770 --> 03:39:03.551]  They know where to come.
[03:39:03.551 --> 03:39:04.553]  They can come direct to us.
[03:39:04.553 --> 03:39:08.257]  They don't need to have somebody distribute emergency food.
[03:39:08.257 --> 03:39:08.798]  Exactly.
[03:39:08.798 --> 03:39:10.900]  You're not about the control of government.
[03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:13.383]  You're about the power of the individual.
[03:39:13.383 --> 03:39:13.944]  Absolutely.
[03:39:13.944 --> 03:39:15.286]  You nailed it on the head there, Alex.
[03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:20.973]  It does creep me out that I didn't think about this until I called you guys.
[03:39:20.973 --> 03:39:23.335]  And then the operator was like, yeah, you're glad you're calling.
[03:39:23.335 --> 03:39:26.458]  My goodness, we usually ship the next day, but it's like five days right now.
[03:39:26.458 --> 03:39:34.564]  By the time I got Matt on the phone, which took three days, you guys were like, we don't even know when to promote this because maybe a month more.
[03:39:34.564 --> 03:39:37.567]  I mean, let's just say you've been a little bit concerned about what's going on.
[03:39:37.567 --> 03:39:38.648]  It's kind of scared you a little bit.
[03:39:39.673 --> 03:39:52.161]  Well, when we saw it last week and we went into full motion saying, hey, this is going to get a little bit bigger, so let's make sure we've got the pipeline filled so we can serve and we can deliver like we do each and every day.
[03:39:52.161 --> 03:39:57.985]  Other points in the few minutes we've got left that you want to impart to the listeners, because I'm all about empowering people.
[03:39:57.985 --> 03:40:02.367]  I'm all about putting high quality food in their pantry so they have a backup of their self-sufficient.
[03:40:02.367 --> 03:40:08.011]  But this is definitely, talking to Matt today and you today, this is a record level, isn't it?
[03:40:09.398 --> 03:40:09.958]  It is.
[03:40:09.958 --> 03:40:11.039]  It is at this point here.
[03:40:11.039 --> 03:40:13.780]  And we're talking about a lot about food today here, Alex.
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:16.241]  But, you know, the first thing you got to think about is water.
[03:40:16.241 --> 03:40:20.342]  You can live, you know, barely more than three days without some fresh purified water.
[03:40:20.342 --> 03:40:24.084]  That's why we've got the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[03:40:24.084 --> 03:40:25.164]  It's gravity powered.
[03:40:25.164 --> 03:40:28.166]  So, you know, electricity could be off and it's going to work just fine.
[03:40:28.166 --> 03:40:28.966]  Now, start there.
[03:40:28.966 --> 03:40:30.086]  Make sure you've got that.
[03:40:30.086 --> 03:40:31.327]  Make sure you've got the good, clean
[03:40:31.912 --> 03:40:40.318]  You know, drinking water, and then you can use that in conjunction with preparing hot meals with the foods that we here at MyPatriotSupply have.
[03:40:40.318 --> 03:40:42.220]  So it's really a one-two punch.
[03:40:42.220 --> 03:40:47.804]  That's what we do as a company, and that's why we appreciate your partnership, because you understand it too there, Alex.
[03:40:47.804 --> 03:40:48.425]  Oh, I do.
[03:40:48.425 --> 03:40:56.491]  I mean, we're promoting AlexaPure, which third-party groups go, my God, this is like in the top two or three out of hundreds of gravity-fed filters.
[03:40:56.491 --> 03:40:57.732]  It's one of the highest rated.
[03:40:57.732 --> 03:40:58.993]  Yeah, again.
[03:41:00.093 --> 03:41:01.914]  This is where I buy my water filtration.
[03:41:01.914 --> 03:41:03.654]  It's where I buy my storable foods.
[03:41:03.654 --> 03:41:05.055]  And yeah, I'm not ashamed of it.
[03:41:05.055 --> 03:41:09.856]  It funds this great crew that busts their butt around the country and on air exposing the globalists.
[03:41:09.856 --> 03:41:11.256]  We're selling high-quality food.
[03:41:11.256 --> 03:41:13.937]  We're selling high-quality water filtration.
[03:41:13.937 --> 03:41:17.858]  I just kind of feel like an idiot that I missed the boat for like two weeks.
[03:41:17.858 --> 03:41:24.380]  It's been the biggest run on food ever and I'm not even promoting it on air so that my audience gets it and so I can fund my operation.
[03:41:24.380 --> 03:41:26.321]  I feel like an idiot, kind of.
[03:41:27.659 --> 03:41:30.881]  Yeah, well, Alex, it's not too late.
[03:41:30.881 --> 03:41:32.562]  There's plenty of time for folks.
[03:41:32.562 --> 03:41:33.902]  We've got the inventory.
[03:41:33.902 --> 03:41:35.663]  They can get into the queue.
[03:41:35.663 --> 03:41:37.184]  We've got a couple of weeks here.
[03:41:37.184 --> 03:41:43.788]  Maybe we can get to three weeks here with all that we've got, the convoy of semis that's coming with more food goods and such.
[03:41:44.252 --> 03:41:50.461]  And that's what I want listeners to know.
[03:41:50.461 --> 03:41:52.604]  I'm always seeking out straight shooters.
[03:41:52.604 --> 03:41:53.906]  I'm like neurotic about it.
[03:41:53.906 --> 03:41:54.848]  I'm totally OCD.
[03:41:54.848 --> 03:41:58.012]  And what you and Matt Redhawk say is what is happening.
[03:41:59.031 --> 03:42:05.094]  I've dealt with this with companies that were reputable a few times and then suddenly every six months people get their food or problems.
[03:42:05.094 --> 03:42:06.034]  Same thing with water filters.
[03:42:06.034 --> 03:42:13.698]  That's why for over 10 years I just love the fact that during regular times people get great food, water filtration, you name it.
[03:42:13.698 --> 03:42:15.039]  And during bad times they get it.
[03:42:15.459 --> 03:42:15.979]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:42:15.979 --> 03:42:16.199]  God bless.
[03:42:40.666 --> 03:42:42.107]  Hey, it's insurance you can eat.
[03:42:42.107 --> 03:42:43.729]  I hope you don't need to use it.
[03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:44.609]  But it's insurance, it's 100%.
[03:42:51.693 --> 03:42:52.474]  Well, it's here.
[03:42:52.474 --> 03:42:53.415]  The year 2020.
[03:42:53.415 --> 03:42:55.397]  World governments out in the open.
[03:42:55.397 --> 03:42:57.699]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics.
[03:42:57.699 --> 03:42:59.841]  They're calling for global government as the answer.
[03:42:59.841 --> 03:43:03.204]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place.
[03:43:03.204 --> 03:43:08.449]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America.
[03:43:08.449 --> 03:43:09.370]  And guns.
[03:43:09.370 --> 03:43:10.071]  And freedom.
[03:43:10.071 --> 03:43:10.932]  And Jesus.
[03:43:10.932 --> 03:43:11.753]  And the family.
[03:43:11.753 --> 03:43:13.694]  And the protection of the unborn.
[03:43:13.694 --> 03:43:13.895]  Wow.
[03:43:14.455 --> 03:43:15.955]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[03:43:15.955 --> 03:43:17.256]  The New World Order's real.
[03:43:17.256 --> 03:43:18.316]  Satanism's real.
[03:43:18.316 --> 03:43:19.676]  The pedophile elite are real.
[03:43:19.676 --> 03:43:23.497]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[03:43:23.497 --> 03:43:28.238]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[03:43:28.238 --> 03:43:31.799]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[03:43:31.799 --> 03:43:36.120]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[03:43:36.400 --> 03:43:38.743]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[03:43:38.743 --> 03:43:40.144]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:43:40.144 --> 03:43:43.108]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[03:43:43.108 --> 03:43:50.256]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of membership.com is critical.
[03:43:50.256 --> 03:43:51.077]  So please take action.
[03:43:52.009 --> 03:43:56.130]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[03:43:56.130 --> 03:43:58.050]  You don't want my thanks.
[03:43:58.050 --> 03:44:04.291]  You want victory over the Globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[03:44:04.291 --> 03:44:05.171]  And you know what?
[03:44:05.171 --> 03:44:08.472]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[03:44:08.472 --> 03:44:17.814]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again, when it's clutch time, to focus the people on taking action against the Globalists.
[03:44:17.814 --> 03:44:19.214]  Because I'm committed to a future
[03:44:20.236 --> 03:44:21.538]  For humanity.
[03:44:21.538 --> 03:44:23.180]  And I know you are as well.
[03:44:23.180 --> 03:44:31.289]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Infowar and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[03:44:31.289 --> 03:44:39.979]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:42.632]  You have made history.
[03:44:42.632 --> 03:44:43.853]  We have made history together.
[03:44:43.853 --> 03:44:49.100]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[03:44:49.100 --> 03:44:52.564]  And I suggest you use it.
[03:44:52.564 --> 03:44:55.707]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of Infowars.
[03:44:56.707 --> 03:45:07.096]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[03:45:07.096 --> 03:45:13.922]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[03:45:14.622 --> 03:45:24.389]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:27.071]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[03:45:27.930 --> 03:45:33.092]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[03:45:33.092 --> 03:45:38.055]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[03:45:38.055 --> 03:45:40.416]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[03:45:40.416 --> 03:45:46.199]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[03:45:46.199 --> 03:45:48.199]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[03:45:48.199 --> 03:45:51.301]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[03:45:52.580 --> 03:45:54.161]  InfowarStore.com.
[03:45:54.161 --> 03:46:00.444]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're gonna sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[03:46:00.444 --> 03:46:11.249]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[03:46:12.270 --> 03:46:14.011]  The adult or the children's.
[03:46:14.011 --> 03:46:17.574]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[03:46:17.574 --> 03:46:18.475]  People love it.
[03:46:18.475 --> 03:46:26.601]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also remineralizes the teeth.
[03:46:27.341 --> 03:46:30.122]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[03:46:30.122 --> 03:46:32.823]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[03:46:32.823 --> 03:46:33.644]  This is all proven.
[03:46:33.644 --> 03:46:35.204]  You can make claims with this.
[03:46:35.204 --> 03:46:46.369]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[03:46:46.369 --> 03:46:47.730]  So, we're really proud of it.
[03:46:47.730 --> 03:46:48.670]  It funds the operation.
[03:46:48.670 --> 03:46:50.371]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:46:50.371 --> 03:46:52.032]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you!
[03:46:55.862 --> 03:47:03.827]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:03.827 --> 03:47:04.547]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:04.547 --> 03:47:07.669]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.612 --> 03:47:35.881]  A number of the countries and foundations are coming together to look at making vaccines in advance of an epidemic so that we can have platforms that are very quick
[03:47:36.536 --> 03:47:37.677]  To make new vaccines.
[03:47:37.677 --> 03:47:41.381]  And so we're far more ready than we were when the Ebola epidemic hit.
[03:47:41.381 --> 03:47:44.144]  And so that's a big contribution.
[03:47:44.144 --> 03:47:51.292]  It's a response to the fact that the vaccine didn't get done for Ebola until after the epidemic was gone.
[03:47:51.292 --> 03:47:57.479]  What's being announced is $460 million that will be given out in grants for specific
[03:47:58.573 --> 03:47:58.653]  Uh,
[03:48:14.133 --> 03:48:23.458]  RNA, DNA type vaccines that you might literally in a period of months be able to create something new instead of the many years that it takes now.
[03:48:23.458 --> 03:48:27.761]  When our foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health.
[03:48:27.761 --> 03:48:34.545]  That was the main thing we did because I thought, you know, population growth in poor countries is the biggest problem they face.
[03:48:34.545 --> 03:48:39.868]  You've got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to do that.
[03:48:39.868 --> 03:48:41.949]  That's the only thing that really counts.
[03:48:42.449 --> 03:48:44.672]  This equation has four factors.
[03:48:44.672 --> 03:48:46.474]  A little bit of multiplication.
[03:48:46.474 --> 03:48:50.278]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[03:48:50.278 --> 03:48:52.641]  And that's going to be based on the number of people.
[03:48:53.629 --> 03:49:04.135]  The services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[03:49:04.135 --> 03:49:09.638]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[03:49:09.638 --> 03:49:12.600]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[03:49:13.744 --> 03:49:16.205]  That's back from high school algebra.
[03:49:16.205 --> 03:49:18.446]  But let's take a look.
[03:49:18.446 --> 03:49:20.686]  First, we've got population.
[03:49:20.686 --> 03:49:23.407]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[03:49:23.407 --> 03:49:25.628]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[03:49:25.628 --> 03:49:35.551]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[03:49:35.551 --> 03:49:40.333]  This vaccine work is the biggest program for the Gates Foundation.
[03:49:40.333 --> 03:49:43.014]  And that's because it is so impactful.
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.741]  It's incredible value.
[03:49:45.741 --> 03:49:51.466]  It utterly changes the country to have the newest vaccines.
[03:49:51.466 --> 03:50:00.392]  We also have had great support from the vaccine manufacturers in terms of continuing to get the prices down.
[03:50:00.392 --> 03:50:04.315]  And so that makes all of this possible.
[03:50:04.315 --> 03:50:07.337]  We also have ambitious goals for getting vaccine coverage up.
[03:50:07.337 --> 03:50:09.999]  It's wonderful that it's up at 80 percent.
[03:50:09.999 --> 03:50:12.841]  But Gavi, working with key partners in particular,
[03:50:13.468 --> 03:50:17.752]  WHO and UNICEF can get that even higher.
[03:50:17.752 --> 03:50:23.076]  And so today gives us resources that will go into that.
[03:50:23.076 --> 03:50:27.860]  Going back to 2000, that's when GAVI was first established.
[03:50:27.860 --> 03:50:38.889]  Within five years, they had gotten Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenza, Hib and Yellow Fever out to lots and lots of people.
[03:50:38.889 --> 03:50:40.631]  The world is willing to step up
[03:50:41.181 --> 03:50:45.545]  And make sure that all the kids who need these vaccines will get them.
[03:50:45.545 --> 03:50:59.419]  Vaccines are now getting out to children far, far better than ever before because a group called the Global Alliance for Vaccines, Gavi, has raised money to buy these vaccines on behalf of the poor kids.
[03:50:59.419 --> 03:51:03.664]  We are much closer today to achieving the goal of universal coverage.
[03:51:04.491 --> 03:51:09.113]  I think today will go down in the history of global health.
[03:51:09.113 --> 03:51:10.834]  It's a very important day.
[03:51:10.834 --> 03:51:18.497]  Right up there with the time that UNICEF first committed to universal vaccination.
[03:51:18.497 --> 03:51:23.599]  Right up there with the original creation of the Global Alliance for Vaccines.
[03:51:23.599 --> 03:51:31.643]  Well, it's amazing how Asia, including most large countries there, have gotten extreme poverty down quite substantially.
[03:51:32.983 --> 03:51:38.927]  So as you say, Africa is going to have a very high share of the people in extreme poverty.
[03:51:38.927 --> 03:51:43.751]  And in fact, the births in the world are shifting towards Africa.
[03:51:43.751 --> 03:51:50.555]  It's a quarter of the births today, but over the course of the century, it becomes half of all the births in the world.
[03:51:50.555 --> 03:52:01.903]  So we need to really double down, take the positive examples from Asia, what was done there in terms of health and education, and go to even the toughest parts of Africa,
[03:52:02.623 --> 03:52:03.344]  I think?
[03:52:20.376 --> 03:52:35.148]  is an opportunity because if you do invest in those people, their open-mindedness, their productivity, you know, being in as they come into working age, it can be a fantastic thing.
[03:52:35.148 --> 03:52:44.976]  But the challenge to get these health systems to scale up, to get the food systems for nutrition to scale up, and then the educational systems to not only have the access,
[03:52:45.616 --> 03:52:47.497]  But the quality as well.
[03:52:47.497 --> 03:52:49.798]  That's not going to be easy.
[03:52:49.798 --> 03:53:00.784]  We're going to have to have donor resources, stay very generous, and the local governments figure out how to raise domestic resources and then run these systems.
[03:53:00.784 --> 03:53:09.249]  So Melinda and I wondered whether providing new medicines and keeping children alive, would that create more of a population problem?
[03:53:09.929 --> 03:53:16.213]  What we found out is that as health improves, families choose to have less children.
[03:53:16.213 --> 03:53:19.235]  The population growth goes down as we improve health.
[03:53:19.235 --> 03:53:27.301]  What's at stake is really very large, and that is whether we can raise the money so that all the children of the world
[03:53:28.021 --> 03:53:36.003]  Get the vaccines that the children in the wealthier countries like Germany and the United States get.
[03:53:36.003 --> 03:53:45.546]  This includes a vaccine to stop the main cause of diarrhea, a vaccine that stops the main cause of respiratory disease.
[03:53:45.546 --> 03:53:50.748]  Well, anyone who's been out to see populations getting AIDS drugs or
[03:53:52.128 --> 03:53:54.569]  Communities getting malaria bed nets.
[03:53:54.569 --> 03:53:58.591]  They'll be very sympathetic to these things.
[03:53:58.591 --> 03:54:04.634]  But the politicians, and particularly the voters, very few of them have actually seen it in action.
[03:54:04.634 --> 03:54:14.379]  And their image of aid goes back to several decades ago, where it was more about buying friendship than it was about putting the money where it could have the most impact.
[03:54:14.379 --> 03:54:14.859]  It's not
[03:54:16.002 --> 03:54:19.423]  One political term, you know, that we can get these things done.
[03:54:19.423 --> 03:54:24.784]  But if you think in terms of 10 or 15 years, we'll be able to see immense progress.
[03:54:24.784 --> 03:54:31.986]  Why aren't we getting vaccines out in Africa for diarrhea, for respiratory disease?
[03:54:31.986 --> 03:54:34.987]  Why don't we have a vaccine for malaria?
[03:54:34.987 --> 03:54:38.208]  Those are the things that I push forward.
[03:54:38.208 --> 03:54:45.030]  I wouldn't say I get angry, but I'm really impatient that we're not moving as fast as I'd like.
[03:54:45.616 --> 03:54:57.962]  Okay, so we are experiencing a measles outbreak in 22 states because parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children for whatever reason they may have.
[03:54:57.962 --> 03:55:03.104]  And much of your foundation work has been getting vaccines to developing countries.
[03:55:03.104 --> 03:55:04.905]  How do we fix it right here in this country?
[03:55:05.165 --> 03:55:09.308]  Yeah, I believe that vaccines are fundamental to life.
[03:55:09.308 --> 03:55:15.012]  We know that the reason so many children now survive to their fifth birthday is because of vaccines.
[03:55:15.012 --> 03:55:21.476]  So the women I meet in all over the world in developing world countries, they'll walk 10 kilometers in the heat to get a vaccine.
[03:55:21.476 --> 03:55:24.838]  They'll tell you how important it is to save their child's life.
[03:55:24.838 --> 03:55:33.284]  So here, I think when people start to remember that we used to have measles, and it's a needless thing for a child to have measles or to die from measles,
[03:55:33.864 --> 03:55:35.968]  That is, that's untenable.
[03:55:35.968 --> 03:55:42.777]  And if somebody's immune system's down because I didn't get my kid vaccinated for measles, you get sick, that doesn't make any sense.
[03:55:42.777 --> 03:55:46.142]  Or somebody like this young lady here who's having twins.
[03:55:46.142 --> 03:55:48.366]  My dog had to get shots to get groomed.
[03:55:48.706 --> 03:55:54.632]  He had to get all the shots done and I'm thinking that's an imbalance in life.
[03:55:54.632 --> 03:56:00.199]  If animals have a rule to get them in a spa, why should kids go to school without being vaccinated?
[03:56:00.199 --> 03:56:01.200]  It's just poor information.
[03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:08.187]  The thing that makes me crazy about this is a lot of these adults who have decided not to vaccinate their kids have been vaccinated.
[03:56:09.288 --> 03:56:15.709]  You know, they have those, you know, at a certain age you have this mark that looks like a baby vampire.
[03:56:15.709 --> 03:56:20.430]  And we've forgotten, we have a short memory, and what I would say to parents is talk to your pediatrician.
[03:56:20.430 --> 03:56:24.671]  He or she has the real information and trust their point of view.
[03:56:24.671 --> 03:56:28.652]  They are medically trained and they will tell you to have your child vaccinated.
[03:56:28.652 --> 03:56:31.293]  Parents don't want to vaccinate their kids?
[03:56:31.293 --> 03:56:31.693]  No way!
[03:56:41.465 --> 03:56:51.288]  People, one question that I think a lot of viewers would actually have for you is, have you ever had the thought to just give it all up?
[03:56:51.288 --> 03:56:59.691]  Yeah, they were trying to shut me down about 15 years ago and messing with me and saying Jones is all about money and attacking my family and stuff and I said, you know what?
[03:57:01.377 --> 03:57:06.341]  I'm going to get big now because I guess I've got to do this job to defeat the Globalists that have already become so prominent.
[03:57:06.341 --> 03:57:10.143]  I thought I'd just be a talk show host and kind of contribute to fighting them.
[03:57:10.143 --> 03:57:10.904]  I said, watch this.
[03:57:10.904 --> 03:57:17.388]  That's when I really expanded into all the big stuff and went from bringing in $5 million a year to bringing in $40 million a year.
[03:57:17.388 --> 03:57:18.149]  You know, fun things.
[03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:19.290]  That's the gross amount.
[03:57:19.290 --> 03:57:22.452]  I put it back in, put it back in, put it back in.
[03:57:22.452 --> 03:57:23.393]  We're really on a mission.
[03:57:24.033 --> 03:57:30.161]  And so that's why even with them trying to shut all our funding down and things now, we're still able to operate because I'm spending stuff I saved just for this eventuality.
[03:57:30.161 --> 03:57:30.802]  Right.
[03:57:30.802 --> 03:57:36.849]  Just mortgaged my house, which I put money in for years, a big nice house, so when it was time to do that, then I'll sell it on top of that.
[03:57:36.849 --> 03:57:37.190]  Yeah.
[03:57:37.190 --> 03:57:39.152]  It's just I'm mortgaging it now to help fund the operation.
