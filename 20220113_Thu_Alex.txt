[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  It has been known since the dawn of civilization that a tyrant will always find a pretext
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.680]  for their tyranny.
[00:14.680 --> 00:16.720]  January 6th, insurrection.
[00:16.720 --> 00:18.120]  I know where I stand.
[00:18.120 --> 00:19.320]  I will not yield.
[00:19.320 --> 00:20.320]  I will not fledge.
[00:20.320 --> 00:22.360]  I will defend the right to vote.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.840]  Our democracy against all enemies.
[00:24.840 --> 00:27.560]  Foreign and yes, domestic.
[00:27.560 --> 00:33.920]  And so it goes in 2022 as an unyielding portion of the bureaucracy of the federal government
[00:33.920 --> 00:39.800]  of the United States, poisoned by visions of globalist totalitarian grandeur, fueled
[00:39.800 --> 00:46.840]  by the 109-year inhabitants of a foreign central banking cartel, will utilize their one-sided
[00:46.840 --> 00:54.240]  characterization of the staged events of January 6th to propel their quest for unlimited power.
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.880]  In 2020, Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots all across the country.
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.640]  There were over 700 police officers injured by Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots.
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.360]  How many people have been charged with crimes of violence concerning those riots all across
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.360]  the country?
[01:09.360 --> 01:10.960]  I don't have information on how many.
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.560]  I would say, you know, hundreds of people have been charged as Ms. Sanborn.
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.640]  You would say, but you don't know, you know, when we asked you why the Biden Department
[01:19.640 --> 01:23.300]  of Justice has such wildly disparate standards.
[01:23.300 --> 01:29.640]  We asked you, why is it that you won't target the rioters and terrorists who firebomb cities
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.160]  across this country?
[01:31.160 --> 01:34.800]  The answer we got from the Department of Justice was shameful.
[01:34.800 --> 01:40.520]  On October 22nd, you came back and said, quote, the Department has dedicated investigative
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.880]  and prosecutorial resources commensurate with the significance of these events.
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.680]  By significance, I guess it means the political benefit to the Biden White House, whether
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.840]  it's unconstitutional vaccine mandates and lockdowns resulting from gain of function
[01:55.840 --> 02:02.160]  research engineered by the seemingly untouchable Nuremberg Code violations of Dr. Fauci.
[02:02.160 --> 02:08.400]  Dr. Fauci, you previously told this committee under oath that NIH and NAID have never funded
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.080]  gain of function research with the HecoEalth Alliance.
[02:12.080 --> 02:17.520]  However, a report from the Department of Defense Inspector General released yesterday
[02:17.520 --> 02:23.680]  states that HecoEalth Alliance proposed DARPA in 2018 seeking funding to connect gain of
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.720]  function research on bat-borne coronaviruses.
[02:27.720 --> 02:33.600]  This proposal named Project Diffuse, DEF-USC, was rejected by DARPA because the project
[02:33.600 --> 02:40.440]  didn't address the current research's potential to violate the gain of function moratorium.
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.640]  Why did you tell the committee that your agency has never funded gain of function research?
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.000]  Why did your agency award this grant despite it being rejected by DARPA due to its concerns
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.960]  about violating the moratorium that was in place?
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.600]  And finally, will you commit today to release all records fully unredacted by the end of
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.040]  this week so Congress and the American people can know the truth about NIH's role and the
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.800]  origins of COVID-19?
[03:06.800 --> 03:20.040]  Or the current war games being played out in rural North Carolina where a realistic guerrilla
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.480]  war will be fought across two dozen North Carolina counties in the coming weeks with
[03:25.480 --> 03:31.360]  young soldiers battling seasoned freedom fighters according to the U.S. Army, as the Charlotte
[03:31.360 --> 03:38.440]  Observer reported known as Robin Sage. The exercises serve as a final test for Special
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.840]  Forces qualification course training. The setting is characterized by armed conflict,
[03:44.840 --> 03:50.240]  forcing the students to solve problems in a real-world setting. These military members
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.560]  act as realistic opposing forces and guerrilla freedom fighters, also known as the Pine Land
[03:56.560 --> 04:02.600]  Resistance Movement. To add realism to the exercise, civilian volunteers throughout the
[04:02.600 --> 04:09.120]  state act as role players. Participation by these volunteers is crucial to the success
[04:09.120 --> 04:19.800]  of this training and past trainees attest to the realism they add to the exercise.
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.240]  We now have a federal government deeming Americans demanding a redress of their grievances as
[04:26.240 --> 04:33.040]  domestic terrorists, meanwhile haphazardly attempting to pose as the saviors to protect
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.680]  the American people and its country club of career politicians gaming the system from
[04:38.680 --> 04:44.600]  an informed patriotic majority. When everyone knows deep down in their gut that we must
[04:44.600 --> 04:50.880]  inevitably save ourselves from the unrelenting tyranny of a republic hijacked by a power
[04:50.880 --> 04:57.960]  craze sociopathic elitist establishment drugged by institutionalized Marxism and dominated

[05:59.260 --> 06:02.260]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[06:02.260 --> 06:23.260]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[06:23.260 --> 06:24.260]  A lie.
[06:24.260 --> 06:26.260]  No man is obsolete.
[06:26.260 --> 06:28.180]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[06:28.180 --> 06:31.220]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[06:31.220 --> 06:36.860]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[06:36.860 --> 06:42.340]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has
[06:42.340 --> 06:44.420]  no purpose here, no meaning.
[06:44.420 --> 06:46.220]  I am a human being.
[06:46.220 --> 06:49.420]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth.
[06:49.420 --> 06:53.900]  You're a dealer in books and two cent fines and pamphlets and closed stacks on the musty
[06:53.900 --> 06:59.300]  insides of a language factory that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[06:59.300 --> 07:06.740]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like a wind, like
[07:06.740 --> 07:12.220]  a vacuum that you may believe has an existence by sprinkling index numbers on little cards.
[07:12.220 --> 07:13.220]  I don't care.
[07:13.220 --> 07:14.940]  I tell you, I don't care.
[07:14.940 --> 07:15.940]  I'm a human being.
[07:15.940 --> 07:16.940]  I exist.
[07:16.940 --> 07:23.980]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled in my grave.
[07:23.980 --> 07:31.740]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth, delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink,
[07:31.740 --> 07:38.740]  the narcotics that you call literature, the Bible, poetry, essays of all kind, all of
[07:38.740 --> 07:44.060]  it, and opiate to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all.
[07:44.060 --> 07:55.820]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind.
[07:55.820 --> 08:00.820]  You waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[08:00.820 --> 08:01.820]  Instruct him.
[08:01.820 --> 08:05.820]  Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board.
[08:05.820 --> 08:08.820]  Yes, sir.
[08:08.820 --> 08:17.820]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[08:17.820 --> 08:18.820]  Obsolete.
[08:18.820 --> 08:19.820]  Obsolete.
[08:19.820 --> 08:20.820]  Obsolete.
[08:20.820 --> 08:21.820]  Obsolete.
[08:21.820 --> 08:22.820]  Obsolete.
[08:22.820 --> 08:23.820]  Obsolete.
[08:23.820 --> 08:24.820]  I concur.
[08:24.820 --> 08:31.300]  Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[08:31.300 --> 08:43.300]  The board finds you obsolete.
[08:43.300 --> 08:51.740]  If I told you 10 years ago that white people would be denied medical care because of the
[08:51.740 --> 08:55.820]  color of their skin, you would think I was a liar, though I did tell you that was coming.
[08:55.820 --> 09:01.220]  And if I told you 25 years ago that you would use a virus scare to bring in world government
[09:01.220 --> 09:06.260]  and world IDs tracking us via smart phones and implantable microchips, you'd say I was
[09:06.260 --> 09:09.300]  crazy, but it was in the documents that's now come true.
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.540]  I didn't just make that up.
[09:10.540 --> 09:11.940]  It was in their own admissions.
[09:11.940 --> 09:19.100]  If I told you that they were going to create part animal, part human clones in pigs, sheep,
[09:19.100 --> 09:25.860]  cows, and apes to grow human organs inside of them for transplant, you'd say I was crazy,
[09:25.860 --> 09:30.980]  though it was already happening before I was ever on the air 28 years ago.
[09:30.980 --> 09:33.500]  And it's in the news today.
[09:33.500 --> 09:37.980]  In a first, man receives a heart from a genetically altered pig that was part human.
[09:37.980 --> 09:40.740]  New York Times.
[09:40.740 --> 09:46.660]  The point is, is that they don't want us to discuss the things they're doing and building
[09:46.660 --> 09:50.260]  when they're in beta.
[09:50.260 --> 09:55.900]  They want us to learn about it when it's in its full rollouts.
[09:55.900 --> 10:02.580]  They can stampet us and set the precedent.
[10:02.580 --> 10:07.740]  You truly will get the future news, tomorrow's news today here, because it's really not
[10:07.740 --> 10:08.740]  tomorrow's news.
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.140]  It's already going on.
[10:11.140 --> 10:12.340]  It's already being set up.
[10:12.340 --> 10:17.620]  Now, I've been very upset the last three weeks, and I've tried my best and I've prayed
[10:17.620 --> 10:20.620]  about it to not get angry.
[10:20.620 --> 10:30.140]  And the biggest thing is, the attacks personally on us are so over the top and so crazy that
[10:30.140 --> 10:36.380]  as a man, it's almost like I don't even want to address it or talk about it.
[10:36.380 --> 10:40.740]  And I know I should intellectually, but there's just something about me that doesn't want
[10:40.740 --> 10:44.460]  to air all this horrible stuff, though you're definitely going to want to know, and it's
[10:44.460 --> 10:46.980]  incredibly newsworthy.
[10:46.980 --> 10:51.460]  But for some reason, probably because I know it gives them intel on where they're heading
[10:51.460 --> 10:55.420]  and where they're having an effect, I just, my subconscious won't let me tell you the
[10:55.420 --> 10:57.900]  stuff that's going on.
[10:57.900 --> 11:02.820]  But at a certain point, you just got to go ahead and just spill your guts.
[11:02.820 --> 11:11.540]  But I think the best way for me to explain all this to you is to cover it in the general
[11:11.540 --> 11:13.700]  news about what's happening to you.
[11:13.700 --> 11:19.580]  Because what's happening to you is happening to me, I just am deeper down the rabbit hole
[11:19.580 --> 11:21.100]  than most of you have gone.
[11:21.100 --> 11:25.340]  Some of you have gone further down and I really feel for you.
[11:25.340 --> 11:30.540]  But I signed on for this, I wanted to fight evil, I wanted to stand up against corruption,
[11:30.540 --> 11:34.460]  and so I'm actually extremely blessed and more alive than I've ever been.
[11:34.460 --> 11:40.780]  I'm so alive right now, it's unbelievable, it's very intense, to be somewhat aligned
[11:40.780 --> 11:41.780]  with God.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.780]  I'll just say this more than most people.
[11:42.780 --> 11:46.820]  I'm very aligned, compared to the average human with God, that doesn't mean I'm perfect
[11:46.820 --> 11:50.540]  or great or some, you know, I mean, I'm just dialed in.
[11:50.540 --> 11:53.260]  And it's painful as hell.
[11:53.260 --> 11:59.860]  But there is a exhilaration in it at the same time, and I think C.S. Lewis, who's an incredible
[11:59.860 --> 12:03.780]  mind, right up there with Carl Jung, you name it, because I've actually, you know, read
[12:03.780 --> 12:04.780]  their books.
[12:04.780 --> 12:07.660]  I don't just say I know this intellectual, that intellectual, but you can pair what
[12:07.660 --> 12:13.820]  these guys wrote to even other folks like Plato that was an amazing mind, or Nietzsche
[12:13.820 --> 12:18.220]  who was an amazing mind, or Thomas Jefferson who was incredible, or good old Benjamin Franklin
[12:18.220 --> 12:25.100]  who distilled just common good knowledge down in an amazing way when he wasn't doing some
[12:25.100 --> 12:27.380]  of the bad things he did.
[12:27.380 --> 12:30.380]  All of this, ladies and gentlemen, is just incredible.
[12:30.380 --> 12:36.180]  So I've tried to figure out how I'm going to cover this, I've tried to think of ways
[12:36.180 --> 12:43.620]  to bring this out to you, and just really let it sink in that everything we cover is
[12:43.620 --> 12:45.020]  not separate issues.
[12:45.020 --> 12:50.860]  It's all integrated in to an attack on you and your family, an attack from which you
[12:50.860 --> 12:57.620]  are supposed to die, but be sucked dry and worship your killers while they slowly do it.
[12:57.620 --> 13:01.260]  This is a religious event happening.
[13:01.260 --> 13:06.940]  This is a spiritual ritual taking place against you of the most sophisticated ever seen on
[13:06.940 --> 13:12.100]  this planet from Satan now.
[13:12.100 --> 13:16.660]  The instrumentality that man has developed has allowed it to come to this level, the
[13:16.660 --> 13:23.620]  integration of the human soul with the machine interface, and it is a shadow of a shadow
[13:23.620 --> 13:26.980]  of a shadow to God's power.
[13:26.980 --> 13:36.020]  But nevertheless, we are facing the greatest challenge in our entire species history.
[13:36.020 --> 13:42.620]  So you see the folders right here, your TV viewers, you see these right here?
[13:42.620 --> 13:44.320]  You know what all this is right here?
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.500]  This is the declaration of war by a criminal group that has hijacked our nation and the
[13:48.500 --> 13:53.820]  world of exactly what they're going to do to you and me and everybody else, how they've
[13:53.820 --> 14:00.340]  got the camps built, everything, and again, it's been the training wheels we've witnessed
[14:00.340 --> 14:01.340]  with Kobud.
[14:01.340 --> 14:04.620]  That's the smoke screen for lockdowns and checkpoints and doing what you're told, the
[14:04.620 --> 14:10.140]  military at the hospitals, and all of this is just to behaviorally get you ready with
[14:10.140 --> 14:12.700]  the ambient background for what's about to go down.
[14:12.700 --> 14:18.860]  You're being conditioned, you're being softened up, and the purge is going on in the government
[14:18.860 --> 14:23.380]  and the military and the medical system right now of who will do these horrible things,
[14:23.380 --> 14:27.140]  who will follow these horrible orders, who will check their common sense at the door
[14:27.140 --> 14:32.580]  to get a piece of the globalist money to kill Granny or whatever the case is, believing
[14:32.580 --> 14:35.020]  they're part of the winning team when they're not part of the winning team.
[14:35.020 --> 14:41.220]  That's really my number one message to the people working for the system who are compartmentalized
[14:41.220 --> 14:44.980]  and don't want to know the big picture, you just want to do the little job and move on
[14:44.980 --> 14:49.140]  because you're told taking care of your family is your number one mission and that's what
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.140]  a good person does.
[14:50.140 --> 14:56.820]  That's true in the 1950s system, but we've left that completely.
[14:56.820 --> 15:01.300]  This is a system where if you don't put skin in the game and you don't resist and you don't
[15:01.300 --> 15:06.820]  put it on the line, you'll lose everything because you can't adapt to your own destruction.
[15:06.820 --> 15:11.180]  People ask how did the Jews and others in Nazi Germany when Hitler came in in 1933 and
[15:11.180 --> 15:19.420]  then of course fell in 1945, how did they stay there as they were debanked, deplatformed,
[15:19.420 --> 15:24.220]  not allowed to have businesses put in ghettos, sent to death camps, why did they do that?
[15:24.220 --> 15:30.780]  Because it was done by increment, by behavioral psychologists and what Hitler did was child's
[15:30.780 --> 15:38.380]  play compared to what these guys are doing now and so you cannot adapt to your own destruction
[15:38.380 --> 15:39.380]  by increments.
[15:39.380 --> 15:44.780]  You must overcome this by understanding the scientific attack you're under, measuring
[15:44.780 --> 15:49.980]  it and realizing your non-compliance now would easily defeat this, but the longer it does
[15:49.980 --> 15:53.020]  its rollout, the harder and harder it'll be to defeat it.
[15:53.020 --> 15:55.180]  This is a life and death situation.
[15:55.180 --> 15:56.180]  Stay with us.
[15:56.180 --> 16:00.540]  We've got big news straight ahead.
[16:00.540 --> 16:02.700]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[16:02.700 --> 16:08.020]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to
[16:08.020 --> 16:10.220]  the new year at mforestore.com.

[17:59.940 --> 18:06.700]  In late August, InfoWare saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[18:06.700 --> 18:12.180]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[18:12.180 --> 18:16.180]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[18:16.180 --> 18:19.220]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to

[20:22.380 --> 20:38.180]  quality, it's high quality.
[20:38.180 --> 20:44.740]  The planet have aligned politically, culturally, spiritually, eternally.
[20:44.740 --> 20:50.180]  And evil is making its big play for planet Earth right now.
[20:50.180 --> 21:02.820]  told more than 2,000 years ago by the Rebelator. And now, here we are. Next segment, I'm going
[21:02.820 --> 21:08.580]  to cover what today's show headline is. And it's all public. You don't need Alex Jones
[21:08.580 --> 21:16.060]  to tell you it's coming anymore. Like a Mack truck, it just hit us. The end of the American
[21:16.060 --> 21:22.380]  Republic is here. Those aren't words, folks. That's what this is. We are being conquered.
[21:22.380 --> 21:26.740]  We are being usurped. And it's not like it's the Romans taking us over, and most of the
[21:26.740 --> 21:30.140]  time they were better than the group they were taking over. Being taken over the Romans
[21:30.140 --> 21:36.140]  was a plus in many areas. This is not being taken over by nice people. The end of the
[21:36.140 --> 21:45.940]  American Republic is here. Dems announce new terrorism plan. That's a quote. It's the terrorism
[21:45.940 --> 21:52.020]  plan. It's not like your 401K or not like your vacation plan. No, this is the plan where
[21:52.020 --> 21:56.060]  you're the enemy from ever on. That's what all the surveillance grids were for and all
[21:56.060 --> 22:03.620]  of it. The end of the American Republic is here. Dems announce new terrorism plan that
[22:03.620 --> 22:14.780]  outlaws all opposition creates one party state. Now, if you're a TV viewer, you can see these
[22:14.780 --> 22:21.220]  stacks I have here. These giant five-inch tall stack right here and others are their
[22:21.220 --> 22:26.220]  admissions on every point. The current FBI head, the former deputy director, all of them
[22:26.220 --> 22:33.740]  saying, quote, all Republicans are terrorists. All Trump supporters are terrorists. And they've
[22:33.740 --> 22:39.860]  announced the new unit, the new nationwide group that's going to watch you and going to
[22:39.860 --> 22:49.340]  control you and going to teach you that white people are bad. This is some sick, evil stuff.
[22:49.340 --> 22:54.780]  That's coming up next segment. But since I mentioned this, I noticed under a hashtag
[22:54.780 --> 23:06.340]  Alex Jones is right. This quote by C. S. Lewis. This is from a screw tape letters. Doesn't
[23:06.340 --> 23:10.540]  say that on the page, but I know this. I read the book twice, at least twice. Technically,
[23:10.540 --> 23:18.340]  I read it twice and I'll listen to it on book on tape. But here he is, C. S. Lewis quotes.
[23:18.340 --> 23:27.060]  Son, he said, you cannot in your present state understand eternity. That is what mortals
[23:27.060 --> 23:34.940]  misunderstand. They say of some temporal suffering, no future bliss can make up for it. Not knowing
[23:34.940 --> 23:44.020]  that heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even the agony into glory. And of
[23:44.020 --> 23:52.420]  some sinful pleasure, they say, let me have but this and I'll take the consequences. Little
[23:52.420 --> 24:02.700]  dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into the past and contaminate the pleasure
[24:02.700 --> 24:13.820]  of the sin. Both processes begin even before death. The good man past begins to change.
[24:13.820 --> 24:22.300]  So that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of heaven. The bad man's
[24:22.300 --> 24:30.940]  past already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness. And that is why
[24:30.940 --> 24:37.780]  the blessed will say we have never lived anywhere except in heaven and the lost, we have always
[24:37.780 --> 24:44.540]  been in hell and both speak the truth. That's C. S. Lewis in the great divorce, but he also
[24:44.540 --> 24:53.140]  said some more things in the screw tape letters. Now, I have already experienced this. Everything
[24:53.140 --> 24:57.500]  horrible that's happened to me within five to 10 years turns into the most spectacular
[24:57.500 --> 25:02.500]  victory. So now I understand God's plan as C. S. Lewis talks about it here, because C.
[25:02.500 --> 25:12.020]  S. Lewis was a wise man experiencing himself, that all of this torture always delivers the
[25:12.020 --> 25:19.180]  huge victory. And that's why I seek the pain. I seek the war. I seek the fight. I seek the
[25:19.180 --> 25:23.420]  attack because the people lounging around thinking they're winning the people playing
[25:23.420 --> 25:29.500]  along with the system and cashing the Pfizer and Democrat Party paychecks. I know what
[25:29.500 --> 25:34.500]  the seed they're casting grows into. And I'll tell you, I'm a coward. People, oh, you're
[25:34.500 --> 25:41.980]  so got such courage. You're so amazing. The hell I'm not. I just have knowledge. I know
[25:41.980 --> 25:47.980]  serving evil is horrible and is bad and is just spiritually I recoil from it because
[25:47.980 --> 25:55.620]  I understand it. And I know the things of God doesn't mean I'm a good person. I've fallen,
[25:55.620 --> 26:01.900]  I know I'm falling. And I know I want to get back up where we were before we were separated
[26:01.900 --> 26:07.740]  from God. And that process is going to happen. Because, you know, man has his presence here
[26:07.740 --> 26:17.180]  on earth. God has his presence. And when you realize that earth is a prison planet, then
[26:17.180 --> 26:21.740]  you understand everything here. So you think you're just here on the planet. And this is
[26:21.740 --> 26:32.820]  all it's a little bit more than just a test, you see this is a prison. This planet is purgatory.
[26:32.820 --> 26:39.300]  And if you fail probation, you cut off from God. This is a place where God and the devil
[26:39.300 --> 26:43.780]  contend because God's like, I'm going to give you one last chance. You're now in a body
[26:43.780 --> 26:49.020]  conscious on this planet. We'll see what you accept what you what you go towards. But I'm
[26:49.020 --> 26:54.020]  going to warn you one more time. I'm cutting you off. And then you're separate from God
[26:54.020 --> 27:01.820]  and that's how we are in purgatory. Purgatory is real. We are trapped in purgatory, awaiting
[27:01.820 --> 27:11.180]  the hour of reprisal and the time slips away. So yeah, you little devil worshipers are going
[27:11.180 --> 27:17.020]  to have your victory over Alex Jones. Alex Jones, the domestic terrorist, Alex Jones,
[27:17.020 --> 27:21.940]  the evil one, Alex Jones, the bad man, which of course I'm not. So point your fingers like
[27:21.940 --> 27:29.020]  Tony Montana says and says, say good night to the bad man. But I'm not the bad man. I'm
[27:29.020 --> 27:34.900]  the guy here trying to get you to join me to get out of this together. But alas, you're
[27:34.900 --> 27:39.860]  not going to listen. And I know you some of you aren't. So you will pay and not by my
[27:39.860 --> 27:48.340]  hand. I just want away from you. And God has promised that if we go through this, he will
[27:48.340 --> 27:54.700]  separate us from you. And so just as everybody exits California, New York to flee the left.
[27:54.700 --> 27:59.420]  Imagine that spiritual energetic release of being away from them forever, and you pass
[27:59.420 --> 28:04.500]  the point of no return and they're gone. They don't exist anymore. You have total completion,
[28:04.500 --> 28:08.980]  total peace with God. You had to have the test. You had free will. You did some bad
[28:08.980 --> 28:18.700]  things. Not in a past life here. We don't know yet. I've actually seen it. I'm not going
[28:18.700 --> 28:23.980]  to tell you at this point. You're not supposed to know this. But the point is, is that we
[28:23.980 --> 28:29.340]  are here to be tested and to pay for what we've already done. We're in prison. And I'm
[28:29.340 --> 28:35.220]  like a trustee. I'm like, I'll do whatever you say. Just get me the hell out of here.
[28:35.220 --> 28:40.020]  And that's the big truth. I wish all of you would join me. I don't know if you will, but
[28:40.020 --> 28:43.940]  I'm telling you, you're in for a lot of trouble because if you think this planet's bad, if
[28:43.940 --> 28:49.020]  you think purgatory's bad, you ain't seen hell and I have. I got a good look at it.
[28:49.020 --> 28:53.700]  We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us in full wars.com tomorrow's news
[28:53.700 --> 28:59.900]  today.
[28:59.900 --> 29:04.820]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[29:04.820 --> 29:09.940]  the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[29:09.940 --> 29:13.940]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[29:13.940 --> 29:17.980]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[29:17.980 --> 29:23.020]  in the open. Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate
[29:23.020 --> 29:27.740]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth. So
[29:27.740 --> 29:31.180]  listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[29:31.180 --> 29:35.700]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear. And when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[29:45.860 --> 29:49.860]  that are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these
[29:49.860 --> 29:54.580]  two products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us
[29:54.580 --> 29:59.380]  on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[29:59.380 --> 30:05.340]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022. And that means there are
[30:05.340 --> 30:10.900]  only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling product, Vitamin Mineral
[30:10.900 --> 30:18.180]  Fusion at 50% off. It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino acids.

[30:39.980 --> 30:44.660]  InfoWars. Without you, we would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse
[30:44.660 --> 30:49.700]  position right now than it's in. Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become
[30:49.700 --> 30:54.580]  the number one beacon of truth, exposing the great reset and the new world order. So support

[31:34.580 --> 31:36.080]  7 days.
[31:36.080 --> 31:41.420]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 26, 2022.
[31:41.420 --> 31:45.660]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[31:45.660 --> 31:49.340]  Hopefully, more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller.

[31:59.340 --> 32:00.820]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[32:00.820 --> 32:02.740]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[32:02.740 --> 32:03.740]  Welcome.
[32:03.740 --> 32:04.740]  Hello, Alex.
[32:04.740 --> 32:05.740]  Yes, Malcolm.
[32:05.740 --> 32:06.740]  All right.
[32:06.740 --> 32:08.740]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[32:08.740 --> 32:13.740]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Supermail
[32:13.740 --> 32:16.500]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[32:16.500 --> 32:17.500]  Mix those two together.
[32:17.500 --> 32:19.140]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[32:19.140 --> 32:21.060]  Supermail Vitality really, really works.
[32:21.060 --> 32:26.020]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[32:26.020 --> 32:31.580]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[32:31.580 --> 32:32.580]  that just aren't as strong.
[32:32.580 --> 32:34.580]  This is like a very fine wine.
[32:34.580 --> 32:36.980]  In fact, each batch is different.
[32:36.980 --> 32:37.980]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[32:37.980 --> 32:38.980]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[32:38.980 --> 32:42.500]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[32:42.500 --> 32:43.500]  That's just how it is.
[32:43.500 --> 32:45.020]  It's how it works.
[32:45.020 --> 32:46.620]  So it's always good.
[32:46.620 --> 32:48.780]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[32:48.780 --> 33:01.980]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[33:01.980 --> 33:14.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.860 --> 33:22.700]  It was another world, another world, another time, another time, in the age of wonder,
[33:22.700 --> 33:33.180]  in the age of wonder, another world, another world, another time, another time, slaps
[33:33.180 --> 33:37.900]  green and good, and it'll press a crack.
[33:37.900 --> 33:42.420]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:42.420 --> 33:51.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:51.540 --> 34:00.860]  The power of our source is God, and it's eternal, and all these attacks on it will
[34:00.860 --> 34:01.860]  fail.
[34:01.860 --> 34:12.380]  All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and look, most of what I'm going to do is
[34:12.380 --> 34:17.980]  say is already all over the news, it's known, but it really hit me in the last few weeks
[34:17.980 --> 34:26.740]  for a lot of reasons that are just so fantastical to actually be living this.
[34:26.740 --> 34:32.340]  Like, again, I remember reading Globalist Plans about social credit scores 20 years
[34:32.340 --> 34:36.820]  ago and how they would say, oh, we're going to not let racists have health care, or we're
[34:36.820 --> 34:40.620]  not going to let smokers have health care, or drinkers, or people that eat too much fat,
[34:40.620 --> 34:45.300]  and we'll have smart phones that track what everybody does, and this will build this utopian.
[34:45.300 --> 34:48.580]  Of course, you know it's a total nightmare, it's going to build a hell on Earth, because
[34:48.580 --> 34:53.420]  the Globalists never follow even their own rules, much less who set them up as God.
[34:53.420 --> 35:01.420]  There's so many angles to this, there's so many angles to this.
[35:01.420 --> 35:07.020]  I thought about how I'm going to cover this, and how I'm going to get into this a lot,
[35:07.020 --> 35:12.020]  because this is so important, and then when I just get here to the point of talking about
[35:12.020 --> 35:20.620]  it, it's like such a big deal that talking about it almost lessens it.
[35:20.620 --> 35:24.460]  Because this isn't just talk, this isn't just something we're talking about that's
[35:24.460 --> 35:29.660]  about to happen, like, oh, we're about to have a hurricane hit, or oh, it's about to
[35:29.660 --> 35:33.620]  be, you know, wintertime, or oh, it's about to be summertime.
[35:33.620 --> 35:40.900]  This is an end of civilization attack and event, and they're running around saying it
[35:40.900 --> 35:45.740]  openly to sell people that are going to buy into it, and then when you say, I don't want
[35:45.740 --> 35:49.820]  it, they go, it doesn't exist in the same moment.
[35:49.820 --> 35:58.420]  There's a profound video I'll play next hour that I got sent by a good friend of mine this
[35:58.420 --> 36:06.820]  morning, and it gives such context to three weeks ago, letters through foyer requests,
[36:06.820 --> 36:12.300]  they have similar systems in Europe, came out in the Netherlands, where their leader
[36:12.300 --> 36:19.060]  of their parliament is getting orders from Klaus Schwab, and it turns out he wrote the
[36:19.060 --> 36:23.820]  forward to the Dutch version of it and promotes it.
[36:23.820 --> 36:33.580]  So a member of parliament just a few days ago confronts him and tells the leader of
[36:33.580 --> 36:41.100]  the government, hey, have you heard of the great reset in Klaus Schwab?
[36:41.100 --> 36:45.500]  And the guy says, I've never heard of that, and they go, funny, you're a graduate of his
[36:45.500 --> 36:51.820]  school, you wrote the forward to his book, and he goes, oh, you don't believe 9-11 happened.
[36:51.820 --> 36:55.180]  Well, those of us that question 9-11 believe it happened, we're questioning how that was
[36:55.180 --> 36:56.180]  prior knowledge.
[36:56.180 --> 36:57.180]  But he plays that game.
[36:57.180 --> 37:00.780]  He goes, oh, really, I had the letter from you with Klaus Schwab directing you to carry
[37:00.780 --> 37:06.500]  out the shutdown of the government reset, and he goes, oh, no, that's just a letter
[37:06.500 --> 37:12.620]  to me asking me to read his book, and the guy is lying and Reuters that's controlled
[37:12.620 --> 37:20.420]  by Pfizer is telling you it doesn't exist, and there he is in your face lying to you.
[37:20.420 --> 37:23.940]  It's incredible footage, and nobody's picked it up yet.
[37:23.940 --> 37:26.740]  I sent to Paul watching a few hours ago, I don't know if he wrote about it, did Paul
[37:26.740 --> 37:31.700]  write about it?
[37:31.700 --> 37:35.700]  I love Paul to death, but stories I send him he writes about are the biggest ones, and
[37:35.700 --> 37:38.940]  then he just writes like 10 articles a day, and he like half the time won't write stuff
[37:38.940 --> 37:39.940]  I send him.
[37:39.940 --> 37:43.540]  That's how controlling I am, and I'm in control of Jack Crap.
[37:43.540 --> 37:44.540]  That's kind of how I want to be.
[37:44.540 --> 37:47.580]  I mean, I just, people that do stuff for us work with us, we just kind of let them do
[37:47.580 --> 37:48.580]  what they want.
[37:48.580 --> 37:51.020]  Because we believe in them already in the work they do, and they just kind of turn
[37:51.020 --> 37:52.020]  them loose.
[37:52.020 --> 37:53.020]  See, because I believe in free will.
[37:53.020 --> 37:56.820]  I'm not like Satan trying to run every aspect of your life and watching what you're doing.
[37:56.820 --> 38:04.020]  See, because I got my own stuff going on.
[38:04.020 --> 38:11.540]  So I'm going to try again next segment, and this is not me here building suspense.
[38:11.540 --> 38:15.460]  How do you go on air with millions, there's a couple million people listening conservatively
[38:15.460 --> 38:16.460]  right now.
[38:16.460 --> 38:25.660]  That's like 20, 100,000 person football fields, conservatively, are listening every hour.
[38:25.660 --> 38:27.500]  Just on talk radio.
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.300]  So there's most talks to us exaggerate their audience.
[38:30.300 --> 38:34.260]  I like to just say what we know absolutely is listening, not even counting the internet
[38:34.260 --> 38:40.020]  streams or later stuff or Band-Op video, you know, that's millions overall each day.
[38:40.020 --> 38:43.660]  But right now on talk radio, there's over 2 million people listening to me.
[38:43.660 --> 38:47.940]  I don't say like, man, I'm this big guy, I'm up here, I got 2 million people.
[38:47.940 --> 38:52.940]  Well, look at these football fields of people, 20 football fields of 100,000 people.
[38:52.940 --> 38:56.900]  I'm Alex Jones, I got a big audience, you need to listen to me.
[38:56.900 --> 39:00.900]  Oh, it's the opposite.
[39:00.900 --> 39:06.060]  I walk up to this giant audience of humongous, just endless crowds of people listening and
[39:06.060 --> 39:07.580]  watching right now.
[39:07.580 --> 39:17.740]  And I don't choke up because the audience is so big, I choke up because it's so bad
[39:17.740 --> 39:23.900]  that if I don't come up with words to describe just how damn evil this is, I'm lying to you.
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.820]  People always, oh, Jones exaggerates.
[39:25.820 --> 39:27.140]  Notice you don't hear that anymore.
[39:27.140 --> 39:28.580]  That was always the thing for 20 years.
[39:28.580 --> 39:32.740]  Oh, he exaggerates the last five, six, seven, you don't hear that anymore, do you?
[39:32.740 --> 39:33.740]  No.
[39:33.740 --> 39:34.740]  Because I'm not exaggerating.
[39:34.740 --> 39:37.620]  The truth is, it's a lot worse than I even could imagine.
[39:37.620 --> 39:44.700]  And now, we had a good eyeball on it before, and we had a good estimation of like, okay,
[39:44.700 --> 39:51.020]  it's really bad, it's really selfish, it's really out of control, it's really satanic.
[39:51.020 --> 39:56.980]  But now that we're in the net, I mean, we ain't just thinking about it, we're not looking
[39:56.980 --> 40:02.020]  at it through binoculars now, we're in a net on its back and we're smelling it.
[40:02.020 --> 40:05.180]  And the bugs that are living on it are crawling on to us now, you know what I mean, like,
[40:05.180 --> 40:10.660]  we're in the belly of the beast, and we're about to be back in the New World Order rat
[40:10.660 --> 40:11.660]  hole.
[40:11.660 --> 40:15.100]  Do you imagine what's down the hole that's about to take us down?
[40:15.100 --> 40:19.620]  Because as bad as it is being captured by this thing, it ain't got us home for dinner
[40:19.620 --> 40:20.620]  yet.
[40:20.620 --> 40:24.260]  We're like the fast food in the car sitting there in the passenger seat, and they're
[40:24.260 --> 40:27.780]  kind of reaching in and getting a fry here and there on the way home, but they ain't
[40:27.780 --> 40:33.700]  cracked open the burger yet, baby, and the burger is going to town on our kids.
[40:33.700 --> 40:36.220]  Are you going to sit there while they do this to our children?
[40:36.220 --> 40:38.780]  The answer is no.
[40:38.780 --> 40:45.460]  I'll go to break, God help me, and I'm going to come back and try my best, but we need
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.260]  a little fanfare for the end of the Republic.
[40:49.260 --> 40:57.540]  We need a little bit of, because people need to get, you're not in Kansas anymore, this
[40:57.540 --> 41:01.820]  isn't a normal time to be alive, and you're going to get hurt real bad.
[41:01.820 --> 41:05.620]  You think all the bad stuff has happened, defunding police, the power being off, triple
[41:05.620 --> 41:10.180]  the crime, your dollar devalued, can't buy enough food, you think that's bad?
[41:10.180 --> 41:13.500]  You ain't seen nothing yet, sweetheart.
[41:13.500 --> 41:17.980]  We are under globalist modern scientific attack.
[41:17.980 --> 41:22.180]  Store shelves are half empty across the nation, medicine's running out, everything, and Klaus
[41:22.180 --> 41:25.780]  Schwab said, they're going to become angry and accept our great reset.
[41:25.780 --> 41:29.140]  We will give them universal income as soon as they break.
[41:29.140 --> 41:30.140]  We will have them soon.
[41:30.140 --> 41:38.380]  I mean, he gives freaking speeches declaring how he put us under siege to destroy us.
[41:38.380 --> 41:42.100]  And then all these idiots sit there getting their Pfizer and their Democrat money, corporate
[41:42.100 --> 41:46.340]  money, Republican and Democrats saying, oh, nothing's, everything's fine, everything's
[41:46.340 --> 41:49.940]  okay, oh, no, there's no problem, when they're going to be totally destroyed, and that's
[41:49.940 --> 42:01.340]  my most important message, is that you people that serve this pretend like you're on the
[42:01.340 --> 42:06.380]  winning team, you pretend like you're going to be okay when civilization collapses.
[42:06.380 --> 42:12.380]  The left on the average are the most domesticated, weak people there are.
[42:12.380 --> 42:15.900]  I've got the will to sit here with, with, with, with, with loppershears, just cut my
[42:15.900 --> 42:18.780]  fingers off in front of you if I wanted to, with blood spraying everywhere.
[42:18.780 --> 42:21.260]  I wouldn't do that, but I've got the will to do it.
[42:21.260 --> 42:23.980]  These people don't have any will.
[42:23.980 --> 42:28.500]  They don't know how to skin a buck, run a trot line or beat somebody's brains out.
[42:28.500 --> 42:31.900]  You don't know what you've done.
[42:31.900 --> 42:34.260]  You don't know what you've summoned.
[42:34.260 --> 42:37.660]  You don't know what you have unleashed.
[42:37.660 --> 42:41.820]  And you sit there and pretend like you're in charge because you're working for the globalist
[42:41.820 --> 42:44.980]  technocrats who are above you, running this country down.
[42:44.980 --> 42:49.980]  You're destroying American institutions, you're destroying confidence, you are killing our
[42:49.980 --> 42:53.580]  country and you think you're just conquering it to run it.
[42:53.580 --> 43:00.180]  No, you are detonating it.
[43:00.180 --> 43:02.380]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[43:02.380 --> 43:07.660]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to

[44:08.300 --> 44:12.420]  William, in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[44:12.420 --> 44:13.420]  I agree.
[44:13.420 --> 44:14.420]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[44:14.420 --> 44:15.420]  Oh, hi, Alice.
[44:15.420 --> 44:16.420]  Thanks for taking my call.
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.420]  Can I plug, uh, Alice, real quick?
[44:17.420 --> 44:18.420]  Yeah, go ahead.
[44:18.420 --> 44:22.420]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them
[44:22.420 --> 44:28.620]  into the ground and you wanted to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your
[44:28.620 --> 44:32.660]  B12 and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[44:32.660 --> 44:33.660]  I really do.
[44:33.660 --> 44:36.700]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[44:36.700 --> 44:41.700]  I can run 10 miles, I did some pretty heavy work, uh, with the highway department and
[44:41.700 --> 44:47.100]  my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing
[44:47.100 --> 44:54.980]  70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[44:54.980 --> 45:04.900]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[45:04.900 --> 45:09.260]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[45:09.260 --> 45:12.540]  didn't stand up and then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[45:12.540 --> 45:14.460]  so he didn't stand up.
[45:14.460 --> 45:17.860]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[45:17.860 --> 45:21.260]  Well, the global social credit score that China is putting in, it's banning people to
[45:21.260 --> 45:25.060]  three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government, you can never buy
[45:25.060 --> 45:26.300]  or sell again.
[45:26.300 --> 45:29.060]  Well, that's, that's being brought here and all over the world.
[45:29.060 --> 45:32.700]  The guys in COVID vaccine passports, they even admit it.
[45:32.700 --> 45:35.540]  Now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[45:35.540 --> 45:38.980]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[45:38.980 --> 45:39.980]  you can do.
[45:39.980 --> 45:41.780]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[45:41.780 --> 45:44.380]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[45:44.380 --> 45:48.540]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[45:48.540 --> 45:51.500]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[45:51.500 --> 45:52.500]  nightmare as well.
[45:52.500 --> 45:56.620]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved
[45:56.620 --> 45:59.980]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[45:59.980 --> 46:08.900]  Three very important life-saving words, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and you find them all
[46:08.900 --> 46:15.980]  in vitamin, mineral, fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals from really
[46:15.980 --> 46:23.660]  good, high quality, absorbable sources and a bunch of key compounds, amino acids known
[46:23.660 --> 46:27.660]  to help get the nutrients into your tissues, into your cells.
[46:27.660 --> 46:30.940]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out in the next week or so, we're
[46:30.940 --> 46:36.620]  going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.
[46:36.620 --> 46:41.980]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[46:41.980 --> 46:46.180]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[46:46.180 --> 46:50.020]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller and it's
[46:50.020 --> 46:52.740]  something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.
[46:52.740 --> 47:01.660]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now and support the InfoWare, a 360 win at InfoWareStore.com.
[47:01.660 --> 47:17.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.700 --> 47:23.700]  Now I have stacks of incredible news, each article more insane than the next.
[47:23.700 --> 47:28.900]  Like the announcement, the Biden administration has been illegally keeping a list of unquote
[47:28.900 --> 47:33.980]  vaccinated people and putting it in a database that they're now announcing they may come
[47:33.980 --> 47:37.140]  door-to-door and forcibly inject you.
[47:37.140 --> 47:44.700]  That's mainstream news, just like denying white people monoclonal antibodies as mainstream
[47:44.700 --> 47:47.180]  news.
[47:47.180 --> 47:52.460]  This is so incredible the time that we're living in right now.
[47:52.460 --> 48:00.740]  And so when I tell you that the Patriot Act is being used against members of Congress
[48:00.740 --> 48:05.340]  and against President Trump and against the press, one of the most sacrosanct groups that
[48:05.340 --> 48:08.500]  you're not supposed to have the intelligence agencies looking at, they're not supposed
[48:08.500 --> 48:09.500]  to even operate domestically.
[48:09.500 --> 48:17.420]  But if you remember Saki, two days after Biden was in office, she said, oh, we're going
[48:17.420 --> 48:21.180]  to have a new terrorism division and we're going to go after the domestic terror.
[48:21.180 --> 48:24.420]  The domestic terrorist, the white people are the number one enemy.
[48:24.420 --> 48:27.180]  These are real quotes.
[48:27.180 --> 48:33.060]  Everybody laughed at that knowing it was BS, but it's not funny because they're actually
[48:33.060 --> 48:34.260]  going that direction.
[48:34.260 --> 48:39.260]  And Ted Cruz knows the whole new regime isn't about hunting al-Qaeda or fighting the communist
[48:39.260 --> 48:40.700]  Chinese or any of that.
[48:40.700 --> 48:45.300]  It's about going up against the American people.
[48:45.300 --> 48:47.940]  That's why he tried to position himself a few weeks ago in that camp.
[48:47.940 --> 48:55.100]  But now there's a backlash and even Mitch McConnell comes out and says, well, we don't
[48:55.100 --> 49:00.980]  want to see the American people and Republicans called terrorists by the president.
[49:00.980 --> 49:08.140]  I mean, imagine the president calling half the population roughly terrorist.
[49:08.140 --> 49:19.980]  That's pretty outrageous, but see, they've conditioned you to basically accept anything.
[49:19.980 --> 49:20.980]  So here's the big announcement.
[49:20.980 --> 49:22.740]  We'll get more into it in the next hour.
[49:22.740 --> 49:28.340]  We'll put the headline up for everybody, but the live show feed today.
[49:28.340 --> 49:29.940]  But here's the big announcement.
[49:29.940 --> 49:35.180]  The Democrats are the main group working with the EU, the big central banks, the communist
[49:35.180 --> 49:38.580]  Chinese, the globalists, they're the ones dissolving the borders.
[49:38.580 --> 49:40.500]  They're the ones that want world government.
[49:40.500 --> 49:43.460]  They're the ones that are the main drivers of it.
[49:43.460 --> 49:45.420]  And half the Republicans are in bed with them as well.
[49:45.420 --> 49:46.420]  So they're not perfect.
[49:46.420 --> 49:48.300]  They got a lot of problems.
[49:48.300 --> 49:54.060]  So that's what's going on.
[49:54.060 --> 49:56.340]  That's what's unfolding.
[49:56.340 --> 49:58.940]  That's what's happening.
[49:58.940 --> 50:10.700]  And this isn't the US government just saying it wants to have war with China.
[50:10.700 --> 50:13.380]  This isn't like, hey, I don't want to go to war with Iraq.
[50:13.380 --> 50:23.680]  This is our government hijacked by globalists announcing that its main enemy is its people.
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.420]  And I've been telling you before January 6th, but now intensely, that they are rolling this
[50:28.420 --> 50:34.060]  out as their response to the election in 299 days and their response to everything, the
[50:34.060 --> 50:35.860]  great reset, all of it.
[50:35.860 --> 50:41.100]  They literally are preparing in their own words, martial law and politico and the Washington
[50:41.100 --> 50:44.100]  Post and the New York Times and Atlantic Monthly.
[50:44.100 --> 50:48.580]  And all of them are saying, we are in a civil war.
[50:48.580 --> 50:51.500]  We get in the lockdowns if you just took the shot.
[50:51.500 --> 50:52.500]  We get in the lockdowns.
[50:52.500 --> 50:53.660]  We just open the borders.
[50:53.660 --> 50:55.820]  We get in the lockdowns if you just submitted us.
[50:55.820 --> 51:01.460]  So we're literally captured by a criminal multinational group of manager middlemen that
[51:01.460 --> 51:07.740]  have sold us out to multinational corporations in China that are now saying because we want
[51:07.740 --> 51:15.660]  our own country that we are terrorists.
[51:15.660 --> 51:18.580]  So how do you do a drum roll for something that big?
[51:18.580 --> 51:19.580]  And here's the deal.
[51:19.580 --> 51:22.940]  I haven't gotten to the stack yet.
[51:22.940 --> 51:26.220]  And here's the big plot twist for you.
[51:26.220 --> 51:32.180]  It's not just hidden in plain view, FBI agents coming to our homes, giving us their cards
[51:32.180 --> 51:34.020]  that they're in a terrorism investigation.
[51:34.020 --> 51:36.340]  I've shown you those on air.
[51:36.340 --> 51:43.620]  But to then learn and confirm from sources months ago that they have a Patriot Act terrorism
[51:43.620 --> 51:47.740]  investigation going of not just me, but Congress.
[51:47.740 --> 51:52.540]  So imagine everybody warned about the Patriot Act being used against citizens.
[51:52.540 --> 51:59.780]  It's being used against Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and Alex Jones.
[51:59.780 --> 52:06.660]  And they, FBI agents come to our houses and give us their cards saying you're under terrorism
[52:06.660 --> 52:09.700]  investigation for January 6.
[52:09.700 --> 52:11.300]  Do you know what that means?
[52:11.300 --> 52:13.140]  Do you know what that entails?
[52:13.140 --> 52:14.140]  Do you understand?
[52:14.140 --> 52:17.780]  The left will celebrate it because they're sycophantically on the payroll of this takeover.
[52:17.780 --> 52:24.340]  But now Mitch McConnell has to come out and say, whoa, Biden, you're saying Republicans
[52:24.340 --> 52:25.900]  are a domestic enemy.
[52:25.900 --> 52:26.900]  What are you doing?
[52:26.900 --> 52:32.260]  Well, put the show headline back up, please.
[52:32.260 --> 52:33.260]  What are we saying here?
[52:33.260 --> 52:34.260]  What are we breaking here?
[52:34.260 --> 52:36.220]  We're only pointing out the elephant in the room.
[52:36.220 --> 52:41.620]  It's like standing in Malibu on the edge of the coast and saying there's the Pacific
[52:41.620 --> 52:42.620]  Ocean.
[52:42.620 --> 52:43.620]  It's there.
[52:43.620 --> 52:44.780]  It's prima facia.
[52:44.780 --> 52:48.100]  This is the end of the American Republic.
[52:48.100 --> 52:56.020]  The Dems are announcing the new terrorism plan, close quote, that outlines all opposition,
[52:56.020 --> 53:01.140]  that outlaws all opposition and creates a one party state just like Venezuela.
[53:01.140 --> 53:05.420]  So you hear about Venezuela and you hear about Nazi Germany and you hear about Soviet
[53:05.420 --> 53:09.540]  Russia and you hear about North Korea and you hear about China and you hear about this
[53:09.540 --> 53:12.620]  and you hear about that in almost every country's run by this.
[53:12.620 --> 53:17.860]  And then you don't think it ain't coming here, it's here.
[53:17.860 --> 53:21.140]  And not by elites that want to run a big, rich, powerful country and have a middle class.
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.620]  No, they hate middle classes.
[53:22.620 --> 53:24.860]  They hate wealthy, independent people.
[53:24.860 --> 53:27.260]  They want total power.
[53:27.260 --> 53:34.060]  They're the worst, most arrogant, sickening, twisted, most up in pedophiles you could imagine.
[53:34.060 --> 53:40.860]  And they've had unlimited money as they devalue the dollar, trillions to buy off all the opposition
[53:40.860 --> 53:45.580]  who thinks they're winning because their bank accounts are filling up.
[53:45.580 --> 53:47.700]  Ted Cruz thinks he's winning.
[53:47.700 --> 53:50.940]  They all think they're winning because their bank accounts are filling up right now.
[53:50.940 --> 53:55.780]  It's all being filled up with devalued currency and they'll be left holding the bag.
[53:55.780 --> 54:00.340]  Yeah, they'll have more money than the starving people down the hill, but their security and
[54:00.340 --> 54:07.780]  their future and their future tax base and everything is gone.
[54:07.780 --> 54:14.580]  And I haven't even, as this hour draws to a close in four minutes, hit all this.
[54:14.580 --> 54:22.300]  And I haven't even sat here and I haven't even told you the rest of the story because
[54:22.300 --> 54:25.980]  they think we're idiots, but we're not idiots.
[54:25.980 --> 54:31.660]  You see, I'm not telling you about what's happening to me to put myself in the story.
[54:31.660 --> 54:39.700]  I need to give you the on the ground view and then I need to give you through the other
[54:39.700 --> 54:45.020]  levels all the way up to the global geopolitical strategic view.
[54:45.020 --> 54:49.660]  Because once you get that, you'll be seeing how they see and then you'll realize these
[54:49.660 --> 54:51.980]  people are assholes.
[54:51.980 --> 54:53.780]  These people are jerks.
[54:53.780 --> 54:59.500]  They could have incredible power, everything, humans, but they want control of human destiny.
[54:59.500 --> 55:00.580]  They don't want freedom.
[55:00.580 --> 55:04.540]  They don't want to ride a wave of beauty and strength and honor and the Renaissance.
[55:04.540 --> 55:09.660]  They want to ride a rat hole down into hell.
[55:09.660 --> 55:15.540]  And so Lenny stated very simply, the Democrats represent a consortium of criminal groups.
[55:15.540 --> 55:22.500]  They want to break America, break our back, consolidate it and create a one party state
[55:22.500 --> 55:30.020]  where a Mike Pence is allowed to be in government, but basically nobody else is.
[55:30.020 --> 55:32.780]  You got a little 10, 15% Republican Party.
[55:32.780 --> 55:34.140]  Let's let around a leash.
[55:34.140 --> 55:39.300]  And even Mitch McConnell for all his corruption wants to be the big swing and Johnson.
[55:39.300 --> 55:42.060]  See, let's play the Mitch McConnell Club.
[55:42.060 --> 55:47.860]  So even Mitch McConnell is like, whoa, this is unbelievably dangerous.
[55:47.860 --> 55:52.900]  Yeah, they're trying to outlaw the Republican Party, evil turtle.
[55:52.900 --> 55:53.900]  Here it is.
[55:53.900 --> 56:03.940]  Yesterday, that very same man delivered a deliberately divisive speech that was designed
[56:03.940 --> 56:07.340]  to pull our country further apart.
[56:07.340 --> 56:13.860]  12 months ago, this president said we should see each other not as adversaries, but as
[56:13.860 --> 56:14.860]  neighbors.
[56:14.860 --> 56:24.340]  Yesterday, he called millions of Americans his domestic enemies.
[56:24.340 --> 56:30.380]  12 months ago, the president called on Americans to join forces, stop the shouting, lower the
[56:30.380 --> 56:33.540]  temperature.
[56:33.540 --> 56:41.860]  But yesterday, he shouted that if you disagree with him, you're George Wallace, George Wallace.
[56:41.860 --> 56:49.500]  If you don't pass the laws he wants, you're Bull Connor.
[56:49.500 --> 56:55.540]  If you oppose giving Democrats untrammeled one-party control of the country, well, you're
[56:55.540 --> 56:57.860]  Jefferson Davis.
[56:57.860 --> 57:05.700]  12 months ago, this president said disagreement must not lead to disunion.
[57:05.700 --> 57:14.140]  But yesterday, he invoked a bloody disunion of the Civil War, the Civil War, to demonize
[57:14.140 --> 57:17.460]  Americans who disagree with him.
[57:17.460 --> 57:27.740]  He compared, listen to this, a bipartisan majority of senators to literal traitors.
[57:27.740 --> 57:31.740]  How profoundly, profoundly, unprecedented.
[57:31.740 --> 57:37.180]  Okay, so let's stop there, we got more coming up, but listen, it's done.
[57:37.180 --> 57:43.100]  They're gonna stage the terror attacks, they're gonna blame us, they're gonna arrest the leadership.
[57:43.100 --> 57:45.860]  I'll tell you about it next hour, we have the inside baseball.
[57:45.860 --> 57:50.180]  This is the biggest news ever.
[57:50.180 --> 57:55.060]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[57:55.060 --> 57:57.020]  the globalists are doing right now.
[57:57.020 --> 58:00.180]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover.
[58:00.180 --> 58:04.180]  And this is the point that they're very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[58:04.180 --> 58:08.220]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[58:08.220 --> 58:09.220]  in the open.
[58:09.220 --> 58:13.700]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[58:13.700 --> 58:17.980]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[58:17.980 --> 58:21.260]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[58:21.260 --> 58:25.940]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[58:25.940 --> 58:26.940]  you keep us on air.
[58:26.940 --> 58:30.660]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[58:30.660 --> 58:34.220]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[58:34.220 --> 58:37.820]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers, they are so good for your body, and if there's
[58:37.820 --> 58:40.980]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[58:40.980 --> 58:45.620]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[58:45.620 --> 58:49.940]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[58:49.940 --> 58:51.300]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[58:51.300 --> 58:53.220]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[58:53.220 --> 58:54.220]  Welcome.
[58:54.220 --> 58:55.220]  Hello, Alex.
[58:55.220 --> 58:56.220]  Yes, Malcolm.
[58:56.220 --> 58:59.180]  I'm Malcolm in Real Short, where the other patrons can get on the line.
[58:59.180 --> 59:04.280]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[59:04.280 --> 59:06.680]  Supermal volatility and Brain Force Plus.
[59:06.680 --> 59:09.940]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[59:09.940 --> 59:11.340]  Supermal volatility really, really works.
[59:11.340 --> 59:17.740]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has
[59:17.740 --> 59:20.740]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[59:20.740 --> 59:22.980]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[59:22.980 --> 59:25.020]  This is like a very fine wine.
[59:25.020 --> 59:27.460]  In fact, each batch is different.
[59:27.460 --> 59:29.460]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[59:29.460 --> 59:32.980]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[59:32.980 --> 59:33.980]  That's just how it is.
[59:33.980 --> 59:35.500]  It's how it works.
[59:35.500 --> 59:37.140]  So it's always good.
[59:37.140 --> 59:39.260]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[59:39.260 --> 59:51.420]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[59:51.420 --> 59:57.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:57.260 --> 1:00:01.100]  I feel so good, I feel so numb, yeah.
[1:00:01.100 --> 1:00:07.700]  All right, I'm going to air this special report.
[1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:11.500]  The enemy hopes you don't share, then I'll come back and get into the new Civil War
[1:00:11.500 --> 1:00:13.780]  that's now officially been launched by the Deep State.
[1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:22.140]  Occupied government stay with us.
[1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:28.420]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free-floating anxiety
[1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:33.260]  in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it.
[1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:38.180]  And that tension gets focused by a leader or a series of events on one small point just
[1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:44.340]  like this, they literally be hypnotized and can be led anywhere.
[1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:52.980]  Mass psychosis, also known as group mind, mob mentality, or herd mentality.
[1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:56.100]  Before modern civilization, we lived in herds.
[1:00:56.100 --> 1:01:00.500]  In order to survive in the herd, we conformed to the herd.
[1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:04.100]  This is where mass psychosis all stems from.
[1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:10.900]  The most popular examples of mass psychosis are typically angry mobs and violent riots.
[1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:13.580]  But these are merely the end results.
[1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:19.460]  Mass psychosis begins when the individual mind starts to identify as a member of a group based
[1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:22.020]  on any unifying factor.
[1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:25.100]  The unifying factor doesn't even need to make sense.
[1:01:25.100 --> 1:01:28.900]  For many people, the feeling of unity is enough.
[1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:35.100]  Our ego mind innately craves acceptance and by default will instinctively conform to whatever
[1:01:35.100 --> 1:01:37.940]  group it perceives to be the majority.
[1:01:37.940 --> 1:01:43.900]  In order to successfully conform to the group, the individual must put aside personal intuition
[1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:47.060]  and follow the guidance of the group.
[1:01:47.060 --> 1:01:52.260]  This makes a person highly controllable and spiritually stifles the individual, which
[1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:56.660]  causes them to crave group acceptance even more.
[1:01:56.660 --> 1:02:02.140]  Human's disposition for mass psychosis has been written about for millennia, most notably
[1:02:02.140 --> 1:02:04.980]  in ancient scripture and philosophy.
[1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:10.180]  And we all experience this as human beings, whether we reflect upon it or not.
[1:02:10.180 --> 1:02:15.460]  Plato argued that due to the nature of group mind, democracy always leads to tyranny and
[1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:16.860]  subjugation.
[1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:22.940]  His concern was the lack of good leadership and philosophized on ways of solving this.
[1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:29.580]  In 1895, Gustav Le Bon published The Crowd, wherein he explains the key processes for
[1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:35.340]  cultivating mass psychosis, anonymity, contagion, and suggestibility.
[1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:41.100]  This work is known to have influenced world leaders, businesses, and tyrants, of which
[1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:45.020]  the ethics has been written about for decades.
[1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:51.780]  And yet AP and Reuters outrageously claim that mass psychosis does not exist.
[1:02:51.780 --> 1:02:58.140]  And it is, in fact, the corporate media apparatus to which they belong that makes this all possible,
[1:02:58.140 --> 1:03:03.500]  waging psychological warfare against a group of the population who believes the media would
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:05.440]  never lie to them.
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:13.340]  This is why the term mass psychosis is arguably a better term than group mind or mob mentality.
[1:03:13.340 --> 1:03:19.500]  A change in the field of consciousness occurs, a devolution from divine inspiration into
[1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:25.140]  primitive hierarchy, which has no place in a civilized society.
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:27.900]  And yet here we are.
[1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:32.540]  Without mass psychosis, today's leaders would have no power.
[1:03:32.540 --> 1:03:39.980]  Just like advertising, everything about politics is about cultivating mass psychosis.
[1:03:39.980 --> 1:03:45.900]  Whereas the individual pursuit of happiness has inevitably led to beauty and innovation,
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:49.860]  building and controlling groups of people, which has been the biggest power play on earth
[1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:55.980]  for all of recorded history, almost always leads to death and destruction.
[1:03:55.980 --> 1:04:01.420]  The science and study of mass psychosis could be used to enlighten humanity by educating
[1:04:01.420 --> 1:04:05.980]  the individual about the power and potential of the human mind.
[1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:11.700]  But today, the very same corrupt media being used by wealthy elites to divide and enslave
[1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:16.620]  us, says there is no such thing as mass psychosis.
[1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:20.460]  Mass psychosis is humanity's burden to outgrow.
[1:04:20.460 --> 1:04:23.740]  It is why we accept the lesser of two evils.
[1:04:23.740 --> 1:04:28.340]  Many of us are well aware of the frailty of man and the civilized world.
[1:04:28.340 --> 1:04:33.420]  The great psychologist Carl Jung's warning to the world was that the individual must
[1:04:33.420 --> 1:04:36.620]  come face to face with their own shadow.
[1:04:36.620 --> 1:04:41.780]  In order to accomplish this, one must liberate themselves from the collective.
[1:04:41.780 --> 1:04:49.860]  And until enough of us do, society will continue to be led by tyrants and ignorant mobs.
[1:04:49.860 --> 1:04:58.980]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:58.980 --> 1:05:04.860]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:09.540]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[1:05:09.540 --> 1:05:14.260]  yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[1:05:14.260 --> 1:05:19.140]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:20.140]  in stock.
[1:05:20.140 --> 1:05:25.140]  Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3, taken under the tongue for higher absorption
[1:05:25.140 --> 1:05:26.780]  is back in stock.
[1:05:26.780 --> 1:05:30.220]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[1:05:30.220 --> 1:05:35.700]  And then our number one best seller of all time, Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal Iodine,
[1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:39.900]  the game changer, the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical
[1:05:39.900 --> 1:05:43.460]  activity in the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[1:05:43.460 --> 1:05:48.820]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:48.820 --> 1:05:54.660]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:57.620]  50% off for a limited time.
[1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:09.620]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:13.460]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:06:13.460 --> 1:06:24.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:24.580 --> 1:06:29.860]  Here we are on Thursday, January 13, 2022.
[1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:33.660]  And again, I am very blessed and honored to be here with you today.
[1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:39.860]  And I have had lawyers and other people basically ask me not to get into this.
[1:06:39.860 --> 1:06:45.620]  And in respect to them, I went around them so they wouldn't be involved and reverse engineer
[1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:46.620]  but already knew.
[1:06:46.620 --> 1:06:51.780]  I guess you'd call that a parallel construction if you were in the Justice Department.
[1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:55.900]  And I don't need to even tell you what's personally happened to us because I have it all reverse
[1:06:55.900 --> 1:07:01.500]  engineered right here and these stacks I'm about to cover, but this is really bad news.
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:06.580]  This is like 50 mile an hour winds in Northern California and a big fire coming and in an
[1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:08.540]  hour your town's going to burn down.
[1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:13.260]  Get what you got, get what you care about, get on the highway and drive south.
[1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:18.380]  This is not, I'm not happy up here telling you this, okay?
[1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:20.900]  And believe me, I'm in this with you up to my eyeballs.
[1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:24.860]  I'm in this, you know, deeper than probably anybody out there other than like Trump who
[1:07:24.860 --> 1:07:28.620]  they hate, but who does understand his real power.
[1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:35.580]  So this ties into all that as well, but also why did Trump trigger them so bad?
[1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:37.580]  So here's where we are.
[1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:47.220]  What was it, eight months ago, the FBI came and Sam Montoya was not here at the office
[1:07:47.220 --> 1:07:52.100]  and then they later swat team him with like 20 something officers at his house, I have
[1:07:52.100 --> 1:07:55.420]  a no criminal record because he was there as a journalist videotaping what happened inside
[1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:57.620]  the Capitol.
[1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:02.420]  And then you all know, I guess it was four months ago and Troyer got arrested and indicted
[1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:05.260]  for attacking the Capitol.
[1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:09.020]  He never went in the Capitol and they said a lot of lies about him even when we countered
[1:08:09.020 --> 1:08:11.020]  it in court.
[1:08:11.020 --> 1:08:12.540]  They're like, you don't work for him for worse.
[1:08:12.540 --> 1:08:13.980]  They said, you didn't have security with you.
[1:08:13.980 --> 1:08:15.340]  You didn't try to stop what happened.
[1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:19.100]  It's all on the video that they even quote to show him attacking the Capitol.
[1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:23.100]  The video they use to show him attacking the Capitol is video of him trying to stop the
[1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:24.100]  attack on the Capitol.
[1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:31.140]  And that's what I'm saying is this is next level lying like on purpose to just I guess
[1:08:31.140 --> 1:08:34.580]  train judges to go along with whatever the government tells them.
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:39.460]  I don't know, but nobody's ever seen lies like this.
[1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:45.580]  And in the cards they brought to Owen and the cards they brought to Sam, it says FBI
[1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:46.580]  counterterrorism.
[1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:51.460]  And you know, they said it was a counterterrorism investigation and you know, the FBI director
[1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:55.060]  said the main terror threats, the American people and white people.
[1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:58.900]  What it is, imagine black people, the number one terror threat, that'd be wrong and not
[1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:04.260]  true and terrible, but white people are and let's let's deny them the monoclonial antibodies
[1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:06.620]  while we're at it.
[1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:09.700]  What an incredible crime they're committing.
[1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:12.060]  And I mean, I don't want to be enemies with McCabe.
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:14.180]  I don't want to be enemies with Ray.
[1:09:14.180 --> 1:09:15.780]  I don't want to be enemies of these people.
[1:09:15.780 --> 1:09:19.260]  They are enemies of this country.
[1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:22.860]  While they declare us the domestic enemy, we're like just sitting here wanting to keep
[1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:23.860]  America.
[1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:28.140]  They're like, no, you're a terrorist.
[1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:29.860]  And then they come out in speeches.
[1:09:29.860 --> 1:09:36.420]  Ray, McCabe, Biden, all of them and say the number one threat is the American people
[1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:40.780]  and his populist and those that question elections and Republicans.
[1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:43.300]  And we've sworn an oath to fight the domestic enemy.
[1:09:43.300 --> 1:09:48.140]  And then every publication basically in the country, including the local newspaper says
[1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:57.060]  this weekend, we are in a civil war and the deaths about to begin.
[1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:01.580]  Now obviously we can extrapolate out one more step here.
[1:10:01.580 --> 1:10:06.820]  They're going to stage the events to make the announcement of the new Homeland Security's
[1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:11.100]  domestic Praetorian Guard, their new Gestapo, their SS.
[1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:14.300]  I mean, you can, this isn't even connect the dots anymore.
[1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:15.980]  This isn't even two plus two equals four.
[1:10:15.980 --> 1:10:22.900]  This is just, there it is.
[1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:24.100]  And why are they doing this?
[1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:29.740]  Because politically, they are a globalist group that oversaw the sellout of the country.
[1:10:29.740 --> 1:10:31.540]  They are bankrupted.
[1:10:31.540 --> 1:10:32.660]  Republicans voting against them.
[1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:34.700]  Their cities are collapsing.
[1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:36.620]  No one wants to follow them.
[1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:41.020]  Blacks, Hispanics, you name it, are leaving them in record numbers.
[1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:42.540]  And so it's simple.
[1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.700]  What do you do when you're losing a card game if you're like these people?
[1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:51.220]  You overturn the table so that no one knows really how many chips somebody had, how many
[1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:54.060]  cards somebody had, oh, tables overturned.
[1:10:54.060 --> 1:10:55.580]  I was winning when this game ended.
[1:10:55.580 --> 1:10:57.740]  And you're like, wait a minute, we had more chips.
[1:10:57.740 --> 1:10:59.900]  We were winning.
[1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:03.180]  Move it, the table's overturned.
[1:11:03.180 --> 1:11:05.860]  So we're witnessing the overturning of the tables.
[1:11:05.860 --> 1:11:09.540]  And then I'll just give you the rest of the story.
[1:11:09.540 --> 1:11:17.020]  We start getting calls in the last month from vendors and from software companies, you know,
[1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:23.020]  going, hey, so are you going to get arrested in the terrorism investigation?
[1:11:23.020 --> 1:11:26.540]  Because the FBI is telling us that, you know, that asking us about you and saying you're
[1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:30.460]  a terrorist, which is all just what they can do outside of law, what they can do outside
[1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:35.580]  of the courts is just having the FBI visit somebody.
[1:11:35.580 --> 1:11:42.220]  So imagine in my life, I'm sitting here now with my lawyers and people talking to the
[1:11:42.220 --> 1:11:47.900]  congressional committees that are just a sideshow of what the Justice Department's doing, telling
[1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:56.340]  them that I'm a domestic terrorist and they want to charge me with material support of
[1:11:56.340 --> 1:12:04.980]  terrorist, the Patriot Act, for organizing all those rallies around the country and the
[1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:09.100]  peaceful ones in D.C. that led up to January 6th, where they hijacked our event.
[1:12:09.100 --> 1:12:13.740]  I mean, we're as innocent as the driven snow when it comes to wanting to attack the Capitol.
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:17.780]  Why the hell would I want to screw up us trying to investigate an election peacefully and go
[1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:18.780]  to prison?
[1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:25.260]  It's like, do you have a motive to climb into a woodchipper?
[1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:26.620]  But that's where this is.
[1:12:26.620 --> 1:12:29.780]  And so, yeah, that's what's going on.
[1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:31.340]  They're in the news.
[1:12:31.340 --> 1:12:34.340]  They're telling everybody they're under terrorist investigation.
[1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:40.580]  And then you've got this weird peanut gallery of CNN, MSNBC, and all the YouTubers and Facebookers
[1:12:40.580 --> 1:12:44.660]  praising it, saying, arrest them, kill them, torture them.
[1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:51.380]  They attacked our Capitol when the only real conspiracy was the FBI and the leftist there
[1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:56.540]  provocaturing a crowd of a million people and tricking a few hundred to attack police
[1:12:56.540 --> 1:13:02.420]  and then tricking a few hundred more to go into the Capitol.
[1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:07.900]  So we can talk about info wars and what the Attorney General said last week, in fact,
[1:13:07.900 --> 1:13:14.060]  get that clip, about how this is never going to end and we're coming after the American
[1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:21.260]  people and it doesn't even matter if you didn't know you supported somebody on January 6.
[1:13:21.260 --> 1:13:22.260]  Talk about a wide net.
[1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:25.780]  I mean, he's not just saying people that go to PTA meetings because they don't want
[1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:30.420]  pedophile drag queen story time or CRT taught that white kids are inherently evil and bad.
[1:13:30.420 --> 1:13:34.140]  If you don't want your five-year-old taught they're bad because they're white.
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:39.820]  Well, Justin Garland, Justice Garland, he wanted to be the Supreme Court guy.
[1:13:39.820 --> 1:13:40.820]  He didn't.
[1:13:40.820 --> 1:13:45.340]  The Supreme Court didn't slip there, there want to be Justice Garland, Garrett Garland,
[1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:47.860]  whatever the hell his name is, the Attorney General.
[1:13:47.860 --> 1:14:05.540]  He is now in this position, sitting there telling us that we're all terrorists and telling
[1:14:05.540 --> 1:14:10.940]  us that questioning him is terrorism and telling us that a civil war is coming and telling
[1:14:10.940 --> 1:14:15.340]  us that we can't question future elections because they're getting ready to steal the
[1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:18.460]  next election, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:21.540]  And that's what's happening with the Attorney General and all the rest of these people.
[1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:26.660]  Is there just like in a third world country up there announcing that the people are the
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:33.140]  enemy and that they're going to be going after the people?
[1:14:33.140 --> 1:14:37.740]  And that's why I ask myself, why isn't Congress responding to this?
[1:14:37.740 --> 1:14:42.260]  Don't the Republican Party, people get, your party's about to be outlawed.
[1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:49.380]  You're in a purge, you're in an authoritarian nation-ending event.
[1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:53.580]  And as mad as I am at the cowardly Republicans who finally are starting to get it, imagine
[1:14:53.580 --> 1:14:58.500]  the general public that think because they get boosted on Twitter or Instagram because
[1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:04.700]  they attack freedom, that they're part of a winning group devaluing the dollar, destroying
[1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:10.380]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution and due process and saying there's going to be a military.
[1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.140]  That's in the news right here.
[1:15:13.140 --> 1:15:14.140]  Overhead shot right here.
[1:15:14.140 --> 1:15:20.540]  A military confrontation with American gun owners.
[1:15:20.540 --> 1:15:27.260]  You don't need to be the smartest person in the room or the sharpest knife in the drawer
[1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:29.860]  to know what that is.
[1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:33.420]  That isn't the military killing Americans.
[1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:38.220]  That's America destroying itself and destroying the social contract and the great reset of
[1:15:38.220 --> 1:15:39.700]  the collapse of civilization.
[1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:43.660]  How could you get America to destroy itself, convince it to commit suicide with a civil
[1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:47.860]  war run by the CIA and the left now doing it?
[1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:50.620]  And all because their pedophile rings coming down.
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:58.060]  We're in a very historic moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:03.940]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:16:03.940 --> 1:16:08.620]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making

[1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:19.220]  in stock.

[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:12.220]  mineral fusion at 50% off.

[1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:31.420]  keep it on sale for another seven days.
[1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:36.380]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[1:17:36.380 --> 1:17:39.820]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars.
[1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:43.660]  Without you, we would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position
[1:17:43.660 --> 1:17:45.260]  right now that it's in.
[1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:49.740]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth

[1:17:55.780 --> 1:17:57.860]  same time at infowarstore.com.

[1:18:34.540 --> 1:18:39.860]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:44.100]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:47.940]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's a best seller and it's
[1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:50.660]  something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.
[1:18:50.660 --> 1:18:57.540]  Get your vitamin mineral fusion now and support the InfoWars 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:04.300]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:10.700]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:19:10.700 --> 1:19:13.820]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:16.860]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:17.860]  have.
[1:19:17.860 --> 1:19:22.580]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:24.860]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[1:19:24.860 --> 1:19:28.300]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:31.660]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:19:31.660 --> 1:19:37.060]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future you're
[1:19:37.060 --> 1:19:41.500]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:43.020]  that are already taking place.
[1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:49.300]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWars at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:49.300 --> 1:19:53.180]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:19:53.180 --> 1:19:54.180]  control.
[1:19:54.180 --> 1:19:59.380]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:05.380]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.380 --> 1:20:40.500]  So, multinational, globalist forces that have sold this country out stage January 6th and
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:43.180]  set us up.
[1:20:43.180 --> 1:20:49.700]  And they are openly investigating yours truly and my crew, not with just congressional subpoenas,
[1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:54.740]  but with the FBI counter-terrorism task force that's now officially launched that I told
[1:20:54.740 --> 1:21:00.620]  you months ago was already in play announced by the Attorney General yesterday to basically
[1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:06.100]  find the evidence they need to put us in prison.
[1:21:06.100 --> 1:21:07.420]  And that's not going to work.
[1:21:07.420 --> 1:21:08.420]  It's a fraud.
[1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:14.660]  People know that unless they stage terror attacks.
[1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:17.860]  And that's what you need to understand.
[1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:25.100]  And the current Attorney General, working with Eric Holder, it was the Deputy Attorney
[1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:29.900]  General at the time, ran the Oklahoma City attack from our research with the Southern
[1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:33.340]  Property Law Center out of Elohim City.
[1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:40.100]  And so you can look for them to do the same thing again and I can tell you, we get the
[1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:48.420]  chatter from all these mainline groups that mean well, Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, that
[1:21:48.420 --> 1:21:53.820]  oh, we're going to North Carolina to train for the revolution.
[1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:55.500]  Be a man, Alex, be part of it.
[1:21:55.500 --> 1:22:03.100]  I'm like, you're being set up, that's a federal globalist operation, wouldn't be part of it.
[1:22:03.100 --> 1:22:08.420]  And they even do it in Arizona and North Carolina where they have the military bases.
[1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:11.940]  Because again, I'm not against our military, but I'm against our military infiltrating
[1:22:11.940 --> 1:22:12.940]  these groups.
[1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:14.660]  And I've been doing this 28 years.
[1:22:14.660 --> 1:22:21.020]  I had special forces infiltrate us and try to get us to carry out terror attacks over
[1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:24.300]  25 years ago repeatedly.
[1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:29.460]  And I finally got physical with one of them, was trying to set fires in Florida when I
[1:22:29.460 --> 1:22:31.500]  was covering a military drill.
[1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:34.580]  And I just told them, I said, listen, I'm going to have to physically attack you if
[1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:35.580]  you do it.
[1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:37.540]  They finally left us alone.
[1:22:37.540 --> 1:22:40.540]  But that's the stuff we've been going through here.
[1:22:40.540 --> 1:22:42.100]  This is real, folks.
[1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:43.100]  This isn't a game.
[1:22:43.100 --> 1:22:44.100]  It's not Netflix.
[1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:45.500]  It's not a video game.
[1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:48.380]  And I know you know that, but your children don't.
[1:22:48.380 --> 1:22:53.220]  People born into the computers and the TVs that are immersed, they don't think a Netflix
[1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:57.540]  show or a video game is different than this, the real world.
[1:22:57.540 --> 1:23:03.820]  And when I tell you, I caught Fed setting fires with gasoline and literally tackled the guy
[1:23:03.820 --> 1:23:04.820]  to stop him.
[1:23:04.820 --> 1:23:05.820]  I got witnesses.
[1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:06.820]  We did it.
[1:23:06.820 --> 1:23:11.060]  When I tell you, they tried to get us to blow up buildings and we stopped them and exposed
[1:23:11.060 --> 1:23:12.060]  them.
[1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:13.060]  And that happened.
[1:23:13.060 --> 1:23:16.660]  I mean, this is not my first rodeo, folks, and I realized God was putting me through
[1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:20.860]  his own college the last 28 years for what we're entering now.
[1:23:20.860 --> 1:23:26.100]  So I would have experienced this stuff because nothing teaches you like experience.
[1:23:26.100 --> 1:23:30.100]  Nothing teaches you like actually doing it yourself.
[1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:34.780]  So we've got some big news that's going to break next segment.
[1:23:34.780 --> 1:23:39.100]  I'm still going to analyze this and get a little bit more before I announce it, even
[1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:46.420]  though it looks like it's confirmed, but it fits in with the theme of the show today.
[1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:49.140]  And again, just imagine you laugh at one level.
[1:23:49.140 --> 1:23:50.140]  I know I do.
[1:23:50.140 --> 1:23:57.220]  Oh, the FBI counterterrorism domestic task force literally has boardrooms with me on big
[1:23:57.220 --> 1:24:01.940]  screen TVs, we know from sources and it's in the news now so I can talk about it.
[1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:06.620]  And they've got me up here as a kingpin and then lines down to other groups and all the
[1:24:06.620 --> 1:24:07.620]  stuff.
[1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:09.220]  When I can't even hardly get lunch if I want it.
[1:24:09.220 --> 1:24:10.220]  I'm not bitching.
[1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:13.540]  I mean, I can barely balance my checkbook.
[1:24:13.540 --> 1:24:19.260]  I do a good job on air and I cover the news, but the idea that I'm like Don Corleone up
[1:24:19.260 --> 1:24:23.860]  here on the mountain and I've got just all I'm running the whole show.
[1:24:23.860 --> 1:24:27.580]  What I'm I tell you, I'm running the show is that I'm American that loves freedom that's
[1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:28.580]  promoting it.
[1:24:28.580 --> 1:24:30.780]  I got millions of listeners that promote the show.
[1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:35.140]  That's what I got is these badass listeners and I've got a decent brain, but no, I don't
[1:24:35.140 --> 1:24:39.980]  have some master control over some big domestic terror group, but that doesn't matter.
[1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:43.780]  Let me just boil this down and I should probably just repeat this for the next couple hours
[1:24:43.780 --> 1:24:44.780]  on air.
[1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:49.100]  You know, I tend to open the phones up and take calls.
[1:24:49.100 --> 1:24:51.780]  The deep state has lost the hearts and minds.
[1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:53.700]  The Democratic Party is dead.
[1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:58.300]  There's a total political realignment that already took place six years ago.
[1:24:58.300 --> 1:25:00.980]  They don't know what to do.
[1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:10.420]  And so they want to create an environment of martial law based off a false civil war
[1:25:10.420 --> 1:25:13.740]  to try to then come in and not relinquish control.
[1:25:13.740 --> 1:25:17.740]  And that works in third world countries and that's worked a lot throughout history and
[1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:19.980]  it worked in Nazi Germany.
[1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:22.380]  And so it may work.
[1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:27.580]  You're asking why would they do something so outlandish with masks on little children
[1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:30.700]  and deadly shots at a racial immune system?
[1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.340]  This is them keeping us in the box.
[1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:37.380]  Hey, you're going to be so sick from these shots if you're lucky, you're just sick.
[1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:39.380]  You're not going to be able to oppose us now.
[1:25:39.380 --> 1:25:40.380]  This is war.
[1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:46.860]  I mean, this is not planes flying over, dropping 2000 pound bombs or tanks rolling up and shooting
[1:25:46.860 --> 1:25:48.020]  at you.
[1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:52.260]  This is globalist, psycho, behavioral psychology attacking you.
[1:25:52.260 --> 1:25:54.780]  And I get it's a nightmare and I get it's terrible.
[1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:59.940]  And I've got family that is super smart and been around the block and they're just now
[1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:04.020]  getting to where they're like, whoa, this really is a takeover.
[1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:05.500]  Yeah.
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:10.900]  So I'm not judging any of you who are having trouble dealing with this.
[1:26:10.900 --> 1:26:12.100]  I am too.
[1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:17.020]  But we've got thousands of articles from the Financial Times of London, the Associated Press
[1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:23.620]  bragging, oh, we're using military psyops to create mass psychosis for your safety so
[1:26:23.620 --> 1:26:24.740]  you take the shot.
[1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:26.620]  But that's a lie too.
[1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:30.300]  And then you go, hey, you're running psyops with psychological warfare.
[1:26:30.300 --> 1:26:33.620]  They go, we got a ban Joe Rogan.
[1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:35.420]  I mean, we got a ban Alex Jones.
[1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:36.420]  I mean, we got a ban.
[1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:37.420]  Dr. Malone.
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:44.180]  I mean, they claim their psyops and that's all they got.
[1:26:44.180 --> 1:26:48.220]  And imagine a culture and a society based on that, because most societies are based
[1:26:48.220 --> 1:26:49.220]  on BS and lies.
[1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:50.940]  It's why they don't have any success.
[1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:55.580]  The West Christian society had the most problems, but the most success because we were actually
[1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:59.140]  trying to find out who we were and shake the system up.
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:06.260]  And so we've had an incredible renaissance and the system wants to get rid of all of
[1:27:06.260 --> 1:27:08.900]  that because it doesn't let them play God.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:10.980]  It doesn't let them run you like a robot.
[1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:12.380]  It doesn't let them control.
[1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:13.900]  So here's when I'm here's the big takeaway.
[1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:16.420]  I'm not even hit the stacks of news.
[1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:22.420]  I'll hit these next segment in the breaking news.
[1:27:22.420 --> 1:27:27.300]  Criminal corporate interest engaged in a criminal illegal hijacking, hostile takeover of the
[1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:31.220]  government and our systems.
[1:27:31.220 --> 1:27:35.380]  And they've stolen all the money and instead of going to jail for the Ponzi schemes, they
[1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:39.700]  just plan on poisoning and sterilizing us and getting rid of us.
[1:27:39.700 --> 1:27:43.580]  And I kind of get their plan like, oh, let's demolish the old garage and put a pool in
[1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:46.980]  back here, except I'm not a garage.
[1:27:46.980 --> 1:27:51.020]  I'm not here to be demolished because you just, oh, I don't like these ugly neighborhoods
[1:27:51.020 --> 1:27:54.700]  and I don't like those kids, those, you know, here's the thing.
[1:27:54.700 --> 1:27:55.700]  You want to kill me?
[1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:57.340]  You're going to have to fight me.
[1:27:57.340 --> 1:27:59.060]  See how that works, Klaus Schwab?
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:02.980]  You don't just do a little Jedi mind trick over here and convince me to go crawl over
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:04.940]  in a ditch and die.
[1:28:04.940 --> 1:28:06.060]  You want war?
[1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:07.060]  You got it.
[1:28:07.060 --> 1:28:08.620]  And Klaus Schwab's like, join us.
[1:28:08.620 --> 1:28:09.620]  You're with us.
[1:28:09.620 --> 1:28:10.620]  You see it.
[1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:11.620]  We need you.
[1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:14.060]  We need your feelings.
[1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:18.820]  I'd rather get killed or put in prison than hang around with you jerks on top of mountain
[1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:24.060]  congratulating each other on how powerful you are when I can feel zero Holy Spirit around
[1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:25.060]  you, zero.
[1:28:25.060 --> 1:28:29.620]  I have to go to prison or I have to die.
[1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:32.260]  I'll have the Holy Spirit full power.
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:33.260]  That's the drug I'm on.
[1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:34.260]  So good luck.
[1:28:34.260 --> 1:28:35.260]  I got God.
[1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:36.260]  I got Jesus.
[1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:37.620]  I don't need your crap.
[1:28:37.620 --> 1:28:44.980]  But yeah, there's the big takeaway, folks, Info Wars officially under terrorism investigation
[1:28:44.980 --> 1:28:51.060]  of the Patriot Act of aiding, uh, giving, uh, substantial aid to the terrorists or whatever
[1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:53.540]  for trying to organize peaceful marches in America.

[1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:06.980]  This is their big offensive.
[1:30:06.980 --> 1:30:08.380]  This is their takeover.
[1:30:08.380 --> 1:30:12.380]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:16.420]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:30:16.420 --> 1:30:17.420]  in the open.
[1:30:17.420 --> 1:30:21.940]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:26.180]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.

[1:32:53.900 --> 1:33:22.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:31.260]  Okay, this just broke 20 minutes ago from phone calls we got.
[1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:34.300]  Now it's in the New York Times, so we're going to go ahead and go with it.
[1:33:34.300 --> 1:33:40.500]  It doesn't mean it's happened for sure, but 99% chance it has, and we have the lawyer
[1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:46.340]  that was on the phone with Stuart Rose when we got rated by the FBI reportedly joining
[1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:51.260]  us next hour, and Ollie Alexander as well, and Attorney Norm Pattis, was also here on
[1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:56.180]  the same subject of the takeover of America via the National Security State Patriot Act,
[1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:58.460]  which we always knew would be used against the American people.
[1:33:58.460 --> 1:34:00.340]  It is the Patriot Act.
[1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:02.780]  Domestic terrorism is to attack Donald Trump's base.
[1:34:02.780 --> 1:34:04.420]  That's why they mriam.
[1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:07.940]  Domestic terrorism, Donald Trump, DT.
[1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:14.180]  Oath Keeper's leader arrested in January 6 investigation, Stuart Rhodes, the leader and
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:19.580]  founder of the far right Oath Keeper militia, far beyond far right, this constitutional
[1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:20.580]  group.
[1:34:20.580 --> 1:34:27.420]  It was arrested on Thursday in connection with the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
[1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:34.580]  His lawyer said the lawyer, Jonathan Mosley, who's joining us next hour, said he was not
[1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:41.020]  yet aware of the charges Mr. Rhodes was facing, adding the FBI agents took him into custody
[1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:43.140]  in just the last hour.
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:48.060]  The arrest of Mr. Rhodes was a major step forward in the sprawling investigation of the
[1:34:48.060 --> 1:34:49.060]  Capitol attack.
[1:34:49.060 --> 1:34:51.340]  And again, I've never said Stuart Rhodes is a fed.
[1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:53.780]  I've known Stuart Rhodes 13, 14 years.
[1:34:53.780 --> 1:34:57.140]  Clearly feds could infiltrate a big group like Oath Keepers and he would get pissed if
[1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:58.140]  you said that.
[1:34:58.140 --> 1:34:59.140]  But I mean, that goes on.
[1:34:59.140 --> 1:35:00.380]  So that's where we had some friction.
[1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:02.620]  But I've never said that Stuart did that.
[1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:05.620]  I was wondering why he had been arrested.
[1:35:05.620 --> 1:35:06.620]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:35:06.620 --> 1:35:09.020]  He's a distraction from Ray Apps, folks.
[1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:14.660]  He's been arrested because it came out in Congress and Ted Cruz talked about it.
[1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:18.860]  And now the head of the January 6 committee, the head lawyer, was in Twitter.
[1:35:18.860 --> 1:35:20.100]  In fact, Owen had it last night.
[1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:24.340]  I asked the crew for it and then they said, Owen's got it and I never got it.
[1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:26.100]  Can I have it?
[1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:30.340]  The head of the January 6 committee lawyer said, oh, Ray Apps didn't go in the building.
[1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:34.980]  Well, why is Owen Shroyer charged then?
[1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:38.140]  This is all about Ray Apps, folks.
[1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:42.900]  All about Ray Apps to distract on the Stuart Rhodes over Ray Apps.
[1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:47.180]  Because I've told my crew, I said, I just can't believe Stuart's a fed.
[1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:49.260]  I think they're setting him up for something at the end or whatever.
[1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:52.380]  But I don't think he wanted an attack on the Capitol.
[1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:53.380]  He didn't tell me that.
[1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:57.260]  I saw him there the day before or whatever.
[1:35:57.260 --> 1:35:59.700]  But who knows?
[1:35:59.700 --> 1:36:01.020]  All I know is I'm not a fed.
[1:36:01.020 --> 1:36:03.860]  And all I know is I didn't want an attack on the Capitol.
[1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:08.020]  But the arrest of Mr. Rhodes was a major step forward in the sprawling investigation of
[1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:09.340]  the Capitol attack.
[1:36:09.340 --> 1:36:14.580]  Mr. Rhodes, a former Army paratrooper who went on to earn a lottery from Yale, has been
[1:36:14.580 --> 1:36:19.380]  in investigations for his role in January 6 since at least last spring, when against
[1:36:19.380 --> 1:36:24.100]  the advice of his lawyer, he sat down on the FBI agents for an interview in Texas.
[1:36:24.100 --> 1:36:28.260]  He was at the Capitol on January 6 communicating my cell phone with a chat app with members
[1:36:28.260 --> 1:36:32.940]  of his team, many of whom went in the building before there's any evidence that he entered
[1:36:32.940 --> 1:36:33.940]  the Capitol.
[1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:35.820]  But there's no evidence he entered the Capitol.
[1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:40.180]  The health keepers along with the Proud Boys have emerged as the most prominent far-right
[1:36:40.180 --> 1:36:44.860]  extremists to have taken part in the assault on Capitol, prosecutors have collected reams
[1:36:44.860 --> 1:36:50.740]  of evidence against them, including encrypted cell phone chats and recordings of online
[1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:52.240]  meetings.
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.780]  They have charged its members not only with forcing their way into the building, a military
[1:36:56.780 --> 1:37:03.180]  style attack, but also with stationing an armed quick response force at a hotel in Virginia
[1:37:03.180 --> 1:37:06.580]  to be ready to rush into Washington if needed.
[1:37:06.580 --> 1:37:12.940]  And it just goes on from there.
[1:37:12.940 --> 1:37:17.380]  What a circus, what a tragedy, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:17.380 --> 1:37:24.300]  I just always found it hard to believe that Stewart was a fed, but Rehab's definitely
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:27.940]  has, I mean, he's definitely being protected.
[1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:31.460]  And so Stewart's been arrested because the Rehab seat got too hot.
[1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:38.140]  You want my analysis, that's what's going on, and it's the same thing with, I mean,
[1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:39.140]  here's Stewart.
[1:37:39.140 --> 1:37:46.300]  I interrogated Stewart on air months and months ago about stuff, and he got so pissed
[1:37:46.300 --> 1:37:52.740]  at me, there was a tape show, I just decided most shows aren't taped, like nine to five
[1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:54.900]  percent of them, but we taped a show one Saturday.
[1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:59.820]  He got so mad, he even asked me questions that I just didn't even air it because he
[1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:01.740]  made him look guilty as hell.
[1:38:01.740 --> 1:38:06.780]  And I was just like, wow, why are you flipping out, like, because I wasn't, I don't think
[1:38:06.780 --> 1:38:11.580]  Stewart's a fed, but I'm like trying to understand stuff, I'm asking him real questions here,
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:18.100]  and he flipped out on me and was like, I'll kick this person's ass, I'll kick that person's
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:22.020]  ass, and I'm like, listen, dude, I don't think you're a fed.
[1:38:22.020 --> 1:38:23.020]  This is what they're saying.
[1:38:23.020 --> 1:38:27.740]  Let me ask you, and I get being falsely accused of things, it'll make you so mad you start
[1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:33.820]  cussing, I'm the same way, but there were a bunch of oath keepers there that day that
[1:38:33.820 --> 1:38:38.540]  thought they were under secret command of Trump for the Q stuff that went in the building,
[1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:41.180]  and I don't think Stewart was part of that, you can easily have people join a huge group
[1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:45.260]  like that, but tens of thousands of members and infiltrate it, so I just didn't get why
[1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:52.060]  he didn't just say that was wrong and say it was improper, he was like, well, it's a
[1:38:52.060 --> 1:38:55.700]  good thing, this government's bad, remember up front he was saying that, I'm like, oh,
[1:38:55.700 --> 1:39:02.820]  no, it's not a good thing, so I'm not going to speak ill of somebody who's been SWAT-teamed
[1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:09.940]  and arrested by the feds today, I really, I never since her guest, but I've had a few
[1:39:09.940 --> 1:39:14.460]  guests on, I say never, almost never, and I'm like, listen, we can talk about the feds
[1:39:14.460 --> 1:39:18.580]  in January 6th, and that's clearly going on, but I'm not going to get into Stewart
[1:39:18.580 --> 1:39:23.700]  Rhodes, because I just, I can't believe it, I think he's a true believer that's been set
[1:39:23.700 --> 1:39:29.620]  up this whole time, if I had to go with my gut, and that's why he's been arrested, not
[1:39:29.620 --> 1:39:36.420]  Ray Epps, so we should support Stewart and worry about Stewart and really be concerned
[1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:46.100]  here because Stewart's a very smart guy, but he's also extremely romantic, he's a romantic,
[1:39:46.100 --> 1:39:49.140]  and for folks that don't know, they're new listeners, maybe they're public school educated
[1:39:49.140 --> 1:39:54.180]  like myself, a romantic doesn't just mean like men and women kissing each other, and
[1:39:54.180 --> 1:40:00.740]  romantics are into romantic stories and fighting and sacrifice yourself, I'm a romantic, but
[1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:05.980]  I'm also a realist romantic, in that I'm not going to let my romance with humanity and
[1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:11.620]  my romance with being a hero, not let me get my full potential, I'm not going to be played,
[1:40:11.620 --> 1:40:19.100]  and I warned Stewart over and over again that he was infiltrated years ago, and I get it,
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:24.860]  he's one guy trying to run a big organization, I can't even hardly run my own office, but
[1:40:24.860 --> 1:40:30.580]  see, this is why we all have that touch, because God is my witness, and I've done this a few
[1:40:30.580 --> 1:40:34.140]  times, people have seen it on air, but this time I didn't do it, I intended to come on
[1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:40.020]  this show today and say, I don't think Stewart Rhodes is fed, I think he's been misguided,
[1:40:40.020 --> 1:40:43.500]  I'm just really worried about Stewart Rhodes, and I woke up at like three in the morning
[1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:48.420]  last night, I had a dream about Stewart Rhodes last night, that God is my witness before
[1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:54.260]  God on my children, and I had a dream about Stewart, where he and I, you know, these dreams
[1:40:54.260 --> 1:40:59.500]  were all foggy, but he was key, and I wanted to love him, and he wasn't bad, and I'd been
[1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:03.740]  wrong, even though I hadn't set it on air, and I need to reach out to Stewart and get
[1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:08.300]  him on air, but Stewart's a jerk and arrogant, he'll think you're just manipulating him,
[1:41:08.300 --> 1:41:16.700]  and he's paranoid, but that I needed to reach out to Stewart, and here we are, the sixth
[1:41:16.700 --> 1:41:21.980]  sense is real folks, we're all connected to the universe from God, we're all psychic,
[1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:27.100]  and so I'm done talking about Stewart, but you notice I started the whole show with
[1:41:27.100 --> 1:41:32.020]  the headline, the Democrats want to outlaw their political opposition, the Democrats
[1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:37.580]  want to outlaw the Republican Party, the Democrats are running on domestic terror, so if they're
[1:41:37.580 --> 1:41:43.100]  running on domestic terror, are they going to give you the domestic terror?
[1:41:43.100 --> 1:41:47.220]  It's like when you hear on the radio, monster trucks are coming next month on the 15th
[1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:52.860]  to the Coliseum, be there for the undertaker, and the job breaker, and the dominator, and
[1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:59.100]  the mighty volcano, and you know, you go look, the tickets are available, you go, when you
[1:41:59.100 --> 1:42:05.660]  see a big rollout of the domestic terrorists coming, the white people are terrorists, they're
[1:42:05.660 --> 1:42:09.980]  going to kill you, blah, blah, that's the cover for them stealing the election and imploding
[1:42:09.980 --> 1:42:16.580]  the dollar and finishing their takeover, that's not smart to know that, it's all pre-programmed,
[1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:21.380]  it's happening now, and even Mitch McConnell, who I've been begging on there, old man, they're
[1:42:21.380 --> 1:42:25.180]  going to get rid of you, evil turtle, they're about to take over with a multinational deal,
[1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:28.140]  don't you blue bloods get, they're not going to leave you in the old power structure, this
[1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:34.780]  is a foreign takeover, stand up you dumbass, and finally he's doing it, because it's going
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:42.340]  down folks, it's going down, it's going down, by the way I've never had to worry about
[1:42:42.340 --> 1:42:46.780]  Stuart Rhodes, had one last night, woke up at 3am, went back to sleep, more Stuart Rhodes
[1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:57.540]  dreams, I mean this is a big stuff going on folks, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:03.420]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6th, 2022, and that means there

[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:02.460]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:08.180]  enslavement and in that documentary I predicted the globalists would establish world government
[1:44:08.180 --> 1:44:13.540]  of releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering
[1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:18.460]  a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it, how did I know they would
[1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:23.660]  do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:28.820]  meetings were leaked, you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group who's head at the time
[1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:33.300]  was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning
[1:44:33.300 --> 1:44:38.260]  to launch this great reset, well we're now living in it, the purposeful collapse of the
[1:44:38.260 --> 1:44:43.140]  third world and the first world, none attached to the tyrannical corporate world government,
[1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:48.820]  total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family and then incrementally more
[1:44:48.820 --> 1:44:54.820]  and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace,
[1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:58.180]  this is what inforwars is fighting, we're fighting for the future.
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:05.100]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:11.500]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere, is there a real
[1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:17.340]  study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design, the large central banks that
[1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:23.060]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look in to say
[1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:27.460]  the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission,
[1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:32.340]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, until ten
[1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:37.820]  years ago the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't exist, well
[1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:41.980]  now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, the Silver Steering Committee,
[1:45:41.980 --> 1:45:48.220]  is called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and as a liberty
[1:45:48.220 --> 1:45:52.860]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide
[1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:56.700]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot, we do expose them, we can beat
[1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:57.700]  a measly.
[1:45:57.700 --> 1:46:01.660]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in inforwars live products and that's
[1:46:01.660 --> 1:46:05.980]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never
[1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:11.020]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:14.700]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:18.620]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level, listen to
[1:46:18.620 --> 1:46:22.980]  what it's got in it, cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better
[1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.900]  flavor and dissolvability.
[1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:29.820]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[1:46:29.820 --> 1:46:34.420]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[1:46:34.420 --> 1:46:37.940]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[1:46:37.940 --> 1:46:42.060]  added, I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes, it's got real organic
[1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:46.660]  cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt and it just
[1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:47.660]  goes on and on.
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:53.220]  It is now back in stock, ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[1:46:53.220 --> 1:46:59.180]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:13.420]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:13.420 --> 1:47:17.940]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, we know that Tim McVeigh had been recruited, he believed
[1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:25.300]  in the Delta Force and that he was then assigned to the Southern Property Law Center Operations
[1:47:25.300 --> 1:47:29.340]  when they wanted to blow up a federal building for the children with a daycare, he said no
[1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:31.540]  so they drugged him and set him up that day.
[1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:34.420]  That's a whole other story, I learned about it from the former head of Air Force weapons
[1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:40.180]  development who fought it and it all turned out to be deadly accurate like he and great
[1:47:40.180 --> 1:47:48.940]  FBI agent Ted Gunnerson had told me back in 1995 when it happened and it was the current
[1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:52.700]  Attorney General that helped oversee that whole operation.
[1:47:52.700 --> 1:47:57.260]  So I don't think Stuart Rose is Tim McVeigh and even though it was crazy he hadn't been
[1:47:57.260 --> 1:48:02.260]  arrested and crazy he hadn't been indicted and clearly Ray Epps is being supported by
[1:48:02.260 --> 1:48:09.500]  the FBI and was there provocaturing, that didn't prove Stuart Rhodes was and now Stuart
[1:48:09.500 --> 1:48:15.940]  Rhodes has been arrested by the FBI and I said earlier because Ray Epps thing in the
[1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:22.340]  congressional hearings and Senator Cruz and it trending on Twitter and you know the great
[1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:26.580]  Tucker Carlson talking about it is now come out and what did I start the whole show about
[1:48:26.580 --> 1:48:34.020]  an hour and a half before this broke, we put the live show feet up please, I said the end
[1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:39.380]  of the American Republic is here, Dems announced new terrorism plan that's in quotes that outlaws
[1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:45.180]  all opposition creates one party state and literally says you don't even have to materially
[1:48:45.180 --> 1:48:53.740]  that's a quote by Merrick Garland last week on the 5th of January you don't even I've
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:57.380]  watched it like eight times it's so incredible I've showed to lawyers they go yeah this is
[1:48:57.380 --> 1:49:02.820]  insane he goes you don't even have to know you supported somebody that protested protesting
[1:49:02.820 --> 1:49:09.420]  his terrorism now and supporting in his terror we'll we'll put you in jail for terror this
[1:49:09.420 --> 1:49:15.780]  is so huge so we're like hey there's no conspiracy charges we didn't conspire to attack the Capitol
[1:49:15.780 --> 1:49:20.740]  we wanted a big protest like all our others to show that we didn't buy the election they
[1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:24.740]  don't care because they're going right to the Patriot Act and I can't tell you all the
[1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:29.260]  sources but the last three weeks have been really pissed not because I myself am worried
[1:49:29.260 --> 1:49:34.620]  I physically get sick that our country is this pathetic and yeah I can announce here
[1:49:34.620 --> 1:49:40.580]  that they have open terrorism investigations under the Patriot Act with a terrorism task
[1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:45.100]  force going back at least eight months that they now made public an official yesterday
[1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:50.180]  on me they've got my phones tapped they're reading everything like I'm literally Usama
[1:49:50.180 --> 1:49:55.540]  bin Laden folks and of course all they're getting is me like let me pay that power bill can
[1:49:55.540 --> 1:49:59.980]  I have a you order me some food hey I gotta get you know there's a broken pipe in the
[1:49:59.980 --> 1:50:05.540]  backyard just it doesn't matter to them though because it circumvents the Constitution and
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:09.900]  the Bill of Rights and they want to make the whole new election in two hundred nine nine
[1:50:09.900 --> 1:50:16.100]  days about domestic care and you can bet they're going to provocateur crazies that's my view
[1:50:16.100 --> 1:50:23.240]  Ali Alexander is a well-known political activist and somebody that was legally and lawfully
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:29.580]  challenging the election and he's the only person that's had the wavos to march into
[1:50:29.580 --> 1:50:34.740]  that committee and and and give them politically in a nonviolent way both barrels and he's
[1:50:34.740 --> 1:50:38.260]  here to respond right now you also got the lawyer for Stuart Rhodes was interviewing
[1:50:38.260 --> 1:50:42.900]  Stuart Rhodes joining us alright shotgun some of the next hour with us but we haven't talked
[1:50:42.900 --> 1:50:46.220]  until you're on right now you just sent me a text you're on right now you told us about
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:51.420]  this before it broke the news about 20 minutes before what is your view of just just all
[1:50:51.420 --> 1:50:55.780]  of this because obviously Stuart Rhodes thing is big but then the declaration and even
[1:50:55.780 --> 1:51:00.340]  Mitch McConnell saying don't say your political opposition is all terrorist I think the Republican
[1:51:00.340 --> 1:51:05.540]  Party finally gets the Democrats one-on-one party state what do you think Ali well I
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:11.700]  was on the phone last night with a couple of political consultants out of DC and they
[1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:16.860]  they told me Ali we hear you loud and clear it's affected everybody now you are right
[1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:21.380]  this is going to engulf the entire Republican Party we're ready to fight back so I think
[1:51:21.380 --> 1:51:28.980]  that in the next couple of weeks especially next week we should look for new offense from
[1:51:28.980 --> 1:51:33.580]  some of the more conservative members of Congress I think that even by the way I'm going to
[1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:35.900]  interrupt you and then give me the floor and I'm going to shut up but let's just say how
[1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:40.500]  huge is your definitely jacked in and hooked in that's but we have the leader of this Republican
[1:51:40.500 --> 1:51:47.460]  Senate the minority leader saying this is an authoritarian takeover they're trying to
[1:51:47.460 --> 1:51:51.860]  cause a civil war we've got to stop it so now it's out in the open think God Republicans
[1:51:51.860 --> 1:51:55.660]  finally get it and you're saying you're talking to a lot of high-powered people they get it
[1:51:55.660 --> 1:52:02.820]  this is wonderful news Ali tell us more multiple members of Congress are going to be suing
[1:52:02.820 --> 1:52:08.820]  Nancy Pelosi and the J6 committee I'm already suing them you're already suing them I was
[1:52:08.820 --> 1:52:15.860]  on your show just a few weeks ago and we said we prophetically said this is going to engulf
[1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:21.900]  the entire Republican Party before the spring of next year you and I talked that this was
[1:52:21.900 --> 1:52:27.860]  an elections takeover before the J6 well you said that you just reminded me that was too
[1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:32.540]  we got to get that clip you said mark my words by the spring this will engulf the Republican
[1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:37.700]  Party they're going to define them as a terrorist group and it happened and it happened this
[1:52:37.700 --> 1:52:43.220]  is an entire elections takeover and a lot of people don't understand what I'm seeing
[1:52:43.220 --> 1:52:47.980]  the messaging that I'm talking about look you have Rhino Republicans like the national
[1:52:47.980 --> 1:52:53.940]  review telling Mitch McConnell that he needs to compromise with Democrats on the Electoral
[1:52:53.940 --> 1:53:01.340]  Count Act the Electoral Count Act is just about stopping future protests that you and
[1:53:01.340 --> 1:53:07.020]  I peacefully conducted this is basically an anti-Alex Jones bill an anti-Sophisticial bill
[1:53:07.020 --> 1:53:13.100]  an anti-Ali Alexander bill but here's the problem if Mitch McConnell compromises with
[1:53:13.100 --> 1:53:18.460]  that Chuck Schumer is going to put the freedom to vote act with Nancy Pelosi just past today
[1:53:18.460 --> 1:53:23.100]  this is an entire coup this is why Joe Biden was in Georgia this is why Kamala Harris was
[1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:28.140]  in Georgia there's a total takeover going on right now and what it requires is them
[1:53:28.140 --> 1:53:33.700]  to entangle all the Republicans in the J6 committee while they pass what they call a voting rights
[1:53:33.700 --> 1:53:39.100]  bill it will permanently federalize elections and there will not be free and fair elections
[1:53:39.100 --> 1:53:44.300]  in America ever again that's right if the fact Schumer even says it's terrorism and
[1:53:44.300 --> 1:53:49.300]  white supremacy to not let people vote with IDs but you got to have an ID for a five-year-old
[1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:55.500]  to go to McDonald's exactly and think about this they said because of J6 and the domestic
[1:53:55.500 --> 1:54:02.380]  care problem you know the increase of domestic care we have to pass the Electoral Count
[1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:09.100]  Act but also stick to John Lewis Advancement Voting Rights Advancement Act and the freedom
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:12.980]  so the bottom line is they know there's a political realignment they know they've lost
[1:54:12.980 --> 1:54:16.900]  yes and just like Venezuela they're going no we're going to do a dictatorship instead
[1:54:16.900 --> 1:54:23.540]  bingo bingo and so to talk lightly about Stuart Rhodes arrest you know I wanted you to be
[1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:29.180]  the one that broke the news one of my attorneys I have four was on the phone with Stuart Rhodes
[1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:33.380]  while he was getting arrested on a case not related to mine and look there's a lot of
[1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:38.060]  questions that I think that Stuart Rhodes needs to answer before the American public
[1:54:38.060 --> 1:54:45.100]  but every American is presumed innocent okay absolutely presumed innocent and my question
[1:54:45.100 --> 1:54:52.900]  for the FBI is is this raid from pressure from congressional Democrats to elaborate
[1:54:52.900 --> 1:54:59.700]  on conspiracy charges to paint the entire Republican Party as a conspiratorial seditious
[1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:04.540]  you know a paramilitary which we're absolutely not we're not even capable of effectively
[1:55:04.540 --> 1:55:11.620]  communicating well exactly exactly again there's a branding of the Republicans as care as they've
[1:55:11.620 --> 1:55:16.140]  already put up with censorship open borders everything will these idiots pull it up with
[1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:21.980]  this or they finally wake up right and so so you know while there's a temptation on some
[1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:27.720]  of the right to just throw Stuart Rhodes you know down the barrel and then there's a temptation
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:31.660]  to act as my god tells me Stewart sent us in it always has I think he was just he's
[1:55:31.660 --> 1:55:38.340]  a romantic we know Ray Epps is the guy yeah I mean and that's another good question is
[1:55:38.340 --> 1:55:44.380]  why is the J sick committee so hell bent on clearing Ray Epps name when he's the only
[1:55:44.380 --> 1:55:50.460]  one on camera caught violating the law and then why does this announcement follow remember
[1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:56.020]  Bannon was never supposed to be prosecuted by the DOJ that took pressure illegal pressure
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:56:03.340]  from Joe Biden on Merrick Garland so his merit garland garland again caving to protect Ray
[1:56:03.340 --> 1:56:07.460]  Epps and then it take down Stuart Rhodes I don't know and again if people are like who
[1:56:07.460 --> 1:56:12.020]  cares about January 6 old news this is the whole next election two hundred and you know
[1:56:12.020 --> 1:56:16.860]  ninety nine days out they're betting everything on this this is their whole push this is everything
[1:56:16.860 --> 1:56:22.860]  now this is everything and a lot of people thought that you and I were centering ourselves
[1:56:22.860 --> 1:56:28.220]  you know with the twenty twenty two elections no folks J the New York Times told us this
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:34.060]  in their occult plain sight trick they said every day is January 6 whether we like it
[1:56:34.060 --> 1:56:38.860]  or not Patriot we are going to have to answer do we have to process rights in this country
[1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:43.540]  for the criminally accused are we allowed to protest and seek redress for all I know you
[1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:47.380]  know this but I'm just revealing it now and I've got documents you know you and I are

[2:00:54.540 --> 2:00:58.700]  seen on the videos he didn't attack the building he didn't tell people to attack it i think
[2:00:58.700 --> 2:01:02.760]  he's innocent though i had questions for him because he had a lot of feds around him like
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:07.980]  ray epps in the past but notice ray epps still hasn't been indicted ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:15.140]  leader of the oath keepers and ten other individuals indicted in federal court for seditious conspiracy

[2:01:53.140 --> 2:01:56.500]  everything surveilled because they know who i'm talking to on the phone that's really
[2:01:56.500 --> 2:02:00.500]  why they're upset is because i have a lot of connections and my connections get stronger

[2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:48.540]  gotta tell you i was almost going to talk about this because i'm not very mackey of
[2:02:48.540 --> 2:02:54.220]  elliom and there's a lot of reasons not to tell you what's going on but do you know
[2:02:54.220 --> 2:03:02.940]  why i knew about the anti-terrorism investigation
[2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:08.300]  the fbi has been visiting our vendors and companies we work with to get a shutdown they've
[2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:11.460]  been messing with it they've been subpoenaing and they've been doing it all and and and
[2:03:11.460 --> 2:03:17.740]  telling them it's a terrorism investigation and telling them not to talk to me down to
[2:03:17.740 --> 2:03:24.340]  software we use so i'm being literally gang raped by the fbi and i would just i know you
[2:03:24.340 --> 2:03:29.300]  love the chai coms the new world order and you're so tough and everything look just you're
[2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:34.900]  insane and you're bad you're not good i mean at least the ones doing this i don't blame
[2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:38.780]  all the fbi agents and that's not some ass kissing thing i know some good fbi agents
[2:03:38.780 --> 2:03:41.620]  in my life but really some of the best people i knew were fbi agents when i was a little
[2:03:41.620 --> 2:03:45.780]  kid i knew some of the people in the house you know ted gunnerson was a great guy i want
[2:03:45.780 --> 2:03:50.340]  to believe you're not the worst people on earth with your you know short hair and clean
[2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:57.820]  cut and a bunch of jerks that serve evil but you're really doing a bad job keeping up your
[2:03:57.820 --> 2:04:04.180]  appearances and so that's it and and you know here's the deal i know the whole new world
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:10.460]  order plan it's designed to discredit the government and it doesn't mean i love that
[2:04:10.460 --> 2:04:14.660]  government or i accept everything it does or i think it's totally legitimate but it's
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:19.820]  my government and see i'm sophisticated enough to know this whole process is to discredit

[2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:20.780]  alright jonathan mosley is a lawyer who broke the news now being reported in the new york
[2:06:20.780 --> 2:06:26.980]  times and seeing in that the founder and leader of the oath keepers was arrested along with
[2:06:26.980 --> 2:06:32.940]  10 others that have been indicted and we have the indictment right here in our hands so
[2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:38.100]  jonathan thank you for giving us this exclusive today and please tell us exactly what was
[2:06:38.100 --> 2:06:44.180]  happening and what unfolded hi some mosley i i hope you can hear me and i wish we had
[2:06:44.180 --> 2:06:50.060]  time to to do a proper video but this is breaking here and uh yeah i was actually on the phone
[2:06:50.060 --> 2:06:55.140]  with stewart rhodes about something else related uh and everybody's calling me so i hope it
[2:06:55.140 --> 2:06:58.740]  doesn't screw up my phone connection with you is now you're doing a great job brother
[2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:05.420]  tell us what happened all right so actually stewart rhodes was slated to appear before
[2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:09.820]  the select committee today which because of coven and making it remotely and yesterday
[2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:15.700]  we got a postponement uh to a specific date in three three weeks which to my surprise
[2:07:15.700 --> 2:07:21.580]  means the selective committee didn't know um you know about this uh a lot you know and
[2:07:21.580 --> 2:07:26.060]  they're all in all of this i don't know who to trust i don't assume anything uh but why
[2:07:26.060 --> 2:07:30.260]  well that's fine sir just give us all the data tell us everything all right so this
[2:07:30.260 --> 2:07:34.860]  morning well actually about 1220 i was on the phone with stewart rhodes talking about
[2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:39.940]  his appearance before the select committee and he got a phone call from the fbi saying
[2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:45.900]  they were outside and he needed to come out and and be arrested and stewart rhodes connected
[2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:52.220]  his in by conference call and i was able to confirm um and talk to the fbi special agent
[2:07:52.220 --> 2:07:55.940]  and the things that he was being arrested we tried to deescalate make sure give him some
[2:07:55.940 --> 2:08:00.740]  time to get dressed and worry about everybody else in the house they did not tell us at
[2:08:00.740 --> 2:08:05.300]  that time what he was being arrested for uh and i was just trying to make sure everything
[2:08:05.300 --> 2:08:11.940]  remained peaceful and calm and uh and nothing get misunderstood so i was on the phone for
[2:08:11.940 --> 2:08:16.540]  about 10 minutes while they were resting i'm trying to hurt everybody out out of the house
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:22.020]  that was there which means that i assume that they are searching the house um probably still
[2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:26.340]  doing it now um going through all of all of his documents and records and saying what
[2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:31.420]  might what might be there and i'm also very concerned he gets a good texas lawyer so his
[2:08:31.420 --> 2:08:37.580]  bail hearing is not it's not done poorly um because if he if is the way the dc court
[2:08:37.580 --> 2:08:42.300]  is handling this if the initial bail hearing is not done perfectly they don't get out they
[2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:47.740]  don't get another chance so right now i'm worried about him going into the into the court house
[2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:52.900]  right now this afternoon how is it done correctly in case they grab me today my spider since
[2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:57.100]  it's been off the charts what's the proper way to handle it counselor well the the problem
[2:08:57.100 --> 2:09:01.700]  is is that you know public defenders are not necessarily bad but they don't know all the
[2:09:01.700 --> 2:09:05.180]  facts they don't have all the evidence so it has to be done you know you have to have
[2:09:05.180 --> 2:09:10.100]  an attorney who really knows what you know what evidence to prove a lot of times evidence
[2:09:10.100 --> 2:09:14.820]  is not put into the bail hearing because the lawyer yeah at first doesn't know everything
[2:09:14.820 --> 2:09:18.700]  doesn't know it doesn't know you doesn't know what you did what you didn't do and then you
[2:09:18.700 --> 2:09:23.540]  try to come back later and provide additional information to the court and the dc court
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:26.340]  is saying oh you could have you could have done that the first time so we're not going
[2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:31.700]  to listen to it so everything that you know every document you have every bit of evidence
[2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.340]  that you're not a threat what really happened like your wonderful video of what you did
[2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:40.420]  at the capital trying to diffuse it you know that has to go in the first time because if
[2:09:40.420 --> 2:09:44.180]  it doesn't go in the first bail hearing if they're not going to listen to it which is
[2:09:44.180 --> 2:09:51.740]  wrong but that's that's the way they're treating it so so everybody's being all these people
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:56.580]  were in bail in detention can't get out of bail largely because their first bail hearing
[2:09:56.580 --> 2:10:05.060]  was done superficially you know slapdash and not with full full information so so at least
[2:10:05.060 --> 2:10:09.180]  well I'm impressed you care about Stuart getting him out quickly but you tell us why you were
[2:10:09.180 --> 2:10:15.340]  talking to Stuart what was going on what else you know please well of course nobody knows
[2:10:15.340 --> 2:10:19.860]  you know who who who who's going on with what why reaps hasn't been a dieted everyone's
[2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:23.460]  saying that it's Stuart Rhodes you know why hasn't he been died I've been looking at the
[2:10:23.460 --> 2:10:30.260]  press release and I do think this is this is more to respond to the questions about
[2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:36.180]  why he hasn't been a dieted so they went ahead and dieted him I don't see anything new here
[2:10:36.180 --> 2:10:39.700]  I'm very familiar I'm representing telling you I think this is all about reaps being
[2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:43.260]  one of the top stories in the country for the last week because again I don't see Stuart
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:47.100]  Rhodes running around saying attack the capital I see reaps saying so this only raises more
[2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:53.220]  questions right absolutely and I so I think this is sort of you know I think this is bread
[2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:59.260]  and circuses to distract from from those difficult questions and let me just say this I mean
[2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:07.100]  this is in the news now but we've been contacted we know I'm under terrorism investigation literally
[2:11:07.100 --> 2:11:11.580]  under the Patriot Act and I've learned members of Congress are I mean I think that's why
[2:11:11.580 --> 2:11:17.140]  Senator McConnell is so upset saying don't declare Congress your enemy I mean this is
[2:11:17.140 --> 2:11:20.500]  and then you've got the Attorney General saying this is just like the Civil War where Lincoln
[2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:27.500]  arrested members of Congress I mean this is crazy I completely agree it's just it is very
[2:11:27.500 --> 2:11:33.180]  scary and the committee like the Selective Committee as I call it is pure politics they're
[2:11:33.180 --> 2:11:38.220]  not interested in in what they're supposed to be looking at and they're politic they're
[2:11:38.220 --> 2:11:44.980]  criminalizing political disagreements and to a degree that I've never ever seen so just
[2:11:44.980 --> 2:11:49.580]  honestly please start over because I interrupt a lot you're on the phone with Stuart today
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:11:53.380]  I guess about a matter for your client I'm not sure tell us if you can tell us why you're
[2:11:53.380 --> 2:11:58.380]  on the phone and you're there when he gets rated yep I was talking about whether he's
[2:11:58.380 --> 2:12:02.300]  going to object to the select committee whether he's going to plead the fifth whether he's
[2:12:02.300 --> 2:12:06.260]  going to cooperate and try to narrow it and in the in the middle of that he gets a phone
[2:12:06.260 --> 2:12:11.700]  call to wait I had to take this call and then he passed me in and the FBI special agent
[2:12:11.700 --> 2:12:17.060]  was outside his door I'm sure not alone but I talked to the special agent and they said
[2:12:17.060 --> 2:12:22.780]  you need to come out and be arrested with your hands up and we you know we talked a
[2:12:22.780 --> 2:12:27.500]  bit about you need to get dressed and things like that and and please I told them please
[2:12:27.500 --> 2:12:31.980]  don't handcuff and abuse the other people in the house they're not you know they're not
[2:12:31.980 --> 2:12:36.180]  being arrested so please just let them clear the area because they've abused other people
[2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:44.140]  like that in the past and so we got arrested and we'll find out well then the news then
[2:12:44.140 --> 2:12:50.940]  the news release from the Justice Department came out almost simultaneously with that so
[2:12:50.940 --> 2:12:57.820]  it's all very political I think well it's absolutely political and I'm going to ask
[2:12:57.820 --> 2:13:06.700]  the question again why isn't Ray Epps arrested there's no good reason for it there's like
[2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:15.340]  you know even if he even if he was just being a dumb you know they flashed the way a Stuart
[2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:23.940]  Reds wondered he's still on tape telling people to go into the Capitol so there's no if there's
[2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:33.300]  no one else who would be the said leader of the seditious conspiracy but him so so there's
[2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:38.300]  no there is no good I cannot imagine any innocent explanation for him not being and it was I
[2:13:38.300 --> 2:13:42.580]  don't want to wish anybody to get arrested but you know please understand me but in terms
[2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:46.940]  of the government's behavior it just thinks that oh yeah oh and Shroyer was arrested for
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:52.540]  being with us and trying to stop the riot and the incursion of the Capitol the breach
[2:13:52.540 --> 2:13:56.100]  of the Capitol not an insurrection but it was a riot the breach was wrong and it got
[2:13:56.100 --> 2:14:00.220]  provocative obviously but some people went along with it so let's be honest he literally
[2:14:00.220 --> 2:14:04.940]  is facing years in prison and they say in the federal filing Owen's line he doesn't
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:09.900]  work for him full wars that security wasn't with him he was just tagging along why would
[2:14:09.900 --> 2:14:15.780]  feds tell lies like that the federal filing it's just it's mind-blowing well the indictments
[2:14:15.780 --> 2:14:21.300]  are full of lies and I want to if I have just like you know 92nd yeah I tell people government
[2:14:21.300 --> 2:14:26.700]  the government has known since May and March that in their FBI interviews which they finally
[2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:31.700]  released that every part of this is a lie they not only not only do they know from the
[2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:36.260]  oath keepers interviews various oath keepers interviews with the FBI that none of this
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:41.500]  is true but they have known it since March to May of last year everything that they
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:46.300]  just and died these people for I have proof that everything in that in that news release
[2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:53.100]  is not just a lie but the government knows that it's a lie they've known it for you for
[2:14:53.100 --> 2:14:59.580]  most of a year exactly that keep going I mean I've got the documents I'm not my opinion
[2:14:59.580 --> 2:15:03.900]  I've got the document oh no no no they say in federal documents when Owen tried to dismiss
[2:15:03.900 --> 2:15:07.780]  his case that he broke in the Capitol never went to the physical capital that he doesn't
[2:15:07.780 --> 2:15:12.820]  work for me that he's perjuring himself and that and that the security wasn't with him
[2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:17.220]  it's all on video that security works for him he was with us I mean it's like saying
[2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:22.740]  the sky is it blue no the everything that people should understand you know people
[2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:25.900]  if you talk to some of the people and you say well they weren't that the violent one
[2:15:25.900 --> 2:15:30.020]  then you talk to another girl well they're not them either I mean basically nobody is
[2:15:30.020 --> 2:15:33.860]  guilty except a few numbskulls who beat up on that's right you got a million people in
[2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:38.980]  DC got hundreds of thousands show up the police are understaffed a few operatives help break
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:43.180]  through some knucklehead idiots hooligans help break through it's terrible what happened
[2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:50.300]  but we as Americans didn't do this because this this crowd got out of control yeah and
[2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:55.220]  almost nobody is guilty of what they try to say the whole crowd is guilty of I mean we

[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:08.980]  the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:19:08.980 --> 2:19:13.700]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy from
[2:19:13.700 --> 2:19:16.740]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a
[2:19:16.740 --> 2:19:21.060]  commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers
[2:19:21.060 --> 2:19:24.340]  don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[2:19:24.340 --> 2:19:27.500]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff
[2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:32.020]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just think it's
[2:19:32.020 --> 2:19:35.700]  some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend
[2:19:35.700 --> 2:19:41.140]  from the Chiapas rebels literally in fact I'm not gonna tell you a little story.

[2:20:20.460 --> 2:20:32.100]  John Mosley.com that's his website now I already had Norm Pattis famous criminal and constitutional
[2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:36.340]  lawyer joining us this hour we push him back a little he understands he's coming in next
[2:20:36.340 --> 2:20:41.940]  segment because all this is breaking we've got Jay Dyer does an incredible job hosting
[2:20:41.940 --> 2:20:45.940]  the fourth hour but take a little bit of his time to finish up all the other news because
[2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:50.700]  it's massive the leader of the Netherlands got confronted for being an agent of Klaus
[2:20:50.700 --> 2:20:54.940]  Schwab denied it then they produced the fact that he wrote the forward for Klaus Schwab's
[2:20:54.940 --> 2:21:03.900]  book I mean they just lie ladies and gentlemen is what they do so that's all coming up the
[2:21:03.900 --> 2:21:09.060]  start of the next hour but notice we're tomorrow's news today or next hour's news today we're
[2:21:09.060 --> 2:21:16.580]  in the zeitgeist full show headline democratic party overthrowing the republic branding and
[2:21:16.580 --> 2:21:22.820]  listing all opposition is terrorist you don't have to have old Alejandro Jones tell you
[2:21:22.820 --> 2:21:31.900]  that anymore do you you can go see them doing it they are a lost party they work for foreign
[2:21:31.900 --> 2:21:36.700]  interest they sold the nation out they're trying to establish a Venezuela or Cuba or
[2:21:36.700 --> 2:21:40.380]  North Korea style deal because it's all they got they want to hold on to power they've
[2:21:40.380 --> 2:21:46.060]  gotten away with it so why not do it and they're not even thinking about how this will destroy
[2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:51.980]  the U.S. is standing worldwide or how it'll just deny like the nation but that's why it's
[2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:56.980]  a group above them launching all this discredit the country I don't want to be enemies with
[2:21:56.980 --> 2:22:01.620]  the Justice Department and I'm not kissing their ass I'm serious I don't want to be enemies
[2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:05.740]  with the FBI I don't be enemies with the military no I understand they're made up of people
[2:22:05.740 --> 2:22:11.100]  just like us but the leadership is marching all of us into a conflict that will destroy
[2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:16.620]  our futures and I don't think anybody can deny that Biden and the great reset and the
[2:22:16.620 --> 2:22:22.820]  COVID BS and all of this is bad I mean my god Joe Rogan was a mainline liberal the system
[2:22:22.820 --> 2:22:28.540]  got so bad he woke up same thing with Tucker Carlson join Joe Rogan join Alex Jones join
[2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:33.180]  Tucker Carlson join everybody else that just wants to have a good future for our children
[2:22:33.180 --> 2:22:39.020]  and stop all this we don't need conquest anymore we don't need one party running stuff I don't
[2:22:39.020 --> 2:22:43.140]  want to run your life we've got plenty of resources we can do anything and that's why
[2:22:43.140 --> 2:22:50.220]  they're scared because they know the end of their hegemony is coming down we need people
[2:22:50.220 --> 2:22:56.060]  running things that don't want to run things all right going back to John Mosley the lawyer
[2:22:56.060 --> 2:23:03.980]  who was on the phone with Stuart Rhodes found the Oathkeepers he and 10 others indicted tell
[2:23:03.980 --> 2:23:07.060]  us what they're indicted for I know it just came out and where you think this is all going
[2:23:07.060 --> 2:23:13.580]  and any other key points John I really appreciate you yeah they have been indicted with seditious
[2:23:13.580 --> 2:23:19.620]  experience conspiracy and remember everybody saying you know well if there was a sedition
[2:23:19.620 --> 2:23:25.460]  why hasn't any been an indicted and then low and bold to say okay oh John I got to stop
[2:23:25.460 --> 2:23:28.860]  you don't give me the next segment this lawyer coming in to join you oh my god it just hit
[2:23:28.860 --> 2:23:34.700]  me am I wrong to say this is finally the first sedition or conspiracy charge so so garland
[2:23:34.700 --> 2:23:40.660]  promise last week there'd be sedition charges here it is right and everybody's been you
[2:23:40.660 --> 2:23:45.060]  know they've been protesting that thing there was no insurrection except on that November
[2:23:45.060 --> 2:23:52.340]  3rd and there is no clue except what's happening in the select committee and and then so they
[2:23:52.340 --> 2:23:57.380]  say okay fine well you know we'll cover up that public relations not legal problem but
[2:23:57.380 --> 2:24:02.900]  that public relations problem by indicting them for seditious conspiracy and and what
[2:24:02.900 --> 2:24:08.820]  I read from what's coming out as I you know trying to scan as I was held hold they have
[2:24:08.820 --> 2:24:14.820]  no additional facts they're there they brought in two more defendants Stuart Rhodes the head
[2:24:14.820 --> 2:24:19.620]  of the founder of the Oathkeepers one of them and but they have but there's nothing new
[2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:26.060]  except they're just changing the name to seditious conspiracy and everything that they're naming
[2:24:26.060 --> 2:24:30.900]  as facts they already know is untrue and I have the facts to put you have the documents
[2:24:30.900 --> 2:24:37.260]  to prove it so there's nothing really new here except the public relations in my opinion
[2:24:37.260 --> 2:24:42.500]  well so I started the broadcast three hours ago two and a half hours ago saying they're
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:46.460]  going to launch their war on terror on the American people it's imminent they're going
[2:24:46.460 --> 2:24:52.740]  to move into sedition conspiracy and terror and now it's here I sadly said so and too
[2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:56.900]  many people have heard you and others warn and say you know all that could never happen
[2:24:56.900 --> 2:25:02.260]  and it's happening and and and to put this in context about this you know the seditious
[2:25:02.260 --> 2:25:07.220]  experience conspiracy I think everyone should see your video from the from the capital trying
[2:25:07.220 --> 2:25:13.860]  to de-escalate things I think that is the most amazing video of you trying to get things
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:19.740]  to calm down and by the way you know that I think you your security staff got them to
[2:25:19.740 --> 2:25:24.180]  make a phone call the U.S. Capitol Police back to headquarters we did we have gotten
[2:25:24.180 --> 2:25:29.460]  other phone calls in discovery we haven't gotten that one because the prosecution has
[2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:33.860]  not released that phone call where you're you know I should point out you're representing
[2:25:33.860 --> 2:25:39.180]  some of the folks right you're you're exposing us well I guess spend a few minutes telling
[2:25:39.180 --> 2:25:42.740]  me what you're doing and I should have said this up front thanks for being a better journalist
[2:25:42.740 --> 2:25:48.860]  than me explaining what your position is and why you're in the middle of this well I represent
[2:25:48.860 --> 2:25:57.140]  oath keeper Kelly mags and who came up from Florida and and I what I'm actually helping
[2:25:57.140 --> 2:26:00.220]  with a lot of the group of defendants that defendants attorneys are actually talking
[2:26:00.220 --> 2:26:05.140]  to each other quite effectively and getting better and so I'm getting the discovery the
[2:26:05.140 --> 2:26:08.940]  stuff that they're not releasing publicly they giving some of it to us but we can't
[2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:14.900]  share it unless we fight for it and we're getting ready for trial on April 19th a four
[2:26:14.900 --> 2:26:22.940]  week trial and it's just a gigantic amount of work so then I wanted Stuart Rhodes to
[2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:28.860]  testify and he was willing to gather the guys are innocent I told the FBI you know that
[2:26:28.860 --> 2:26:35.700]  none of this is true and then he asked me to help him with a select committee and that's
[2:26:35.700 --> 2:26:42.180]  why I was on the phone with him so yeah I am in the middle of it and because of that
[2:26:42.180 --> 2:26:48.780]  I've seen most of the documents in the discovery and I know that the US Attorney's Office for
[2:26:48.780 --> 2:26:53.780]  the District of Columbia knows that they're lying and one of the lead prosecutors I'm
[2:26:53.780 --> 2:26:57.340]  kind of hoping is going to wake up one day and say I'm the guy putting people on box
[2:26:57.340 --> 2:27:02.660]  cars and say and look in the mirror and say I'm not going to do this anymore that's that's
[2:27:02.660 --> 2:27:11.620]  my hope wow John Mosley M O S E L E Y John Mosley dot com we got a few minutes to break
[2:27:11.620 --> 2:27:15.220]  but please come back with more patents who's another lawyer like yourself I want to get
[2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:19.580]  his ideas and take on this but I came here to folks to tell you some of the stuff and
[2:27:19.580 --> 2:27:24.980]  I just some of it nobody's telling me not to tell you this but I know what the media
[2:27:24.980 --> 2:27:31.060]  is going to do whatever they know but they literally have counterterrorism teams following
[2:27:31.060 --> 2:27:37.540]  me around okay they literally they've they've got this ridiculous but I'm not that important
[2:27:37.540 --> 2:27:40.980]  I'm not stupid they are just training the military and everybody it's in the news right
[2:27:40.980 --> 2:27:45.980]  here US Army to conduct guerrilla warfare exercise training troops and overthrowing
[2:27:45.980 --> 2:27:52.100]  illegitimate government and then they're trained to quote take on the patriots I mean this
[2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:56.940]  is insane I know I'm not a terrorist I know I don't want violence and they literally have
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:28:01.900]  the FBI branding me as this this shows us how much trouble our countries and John well
[2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:06.260]  and and Alex you have the video to prove it and and when you say well that doesn't apply
[2:28:06.260 --> 2:28:10.860]  to me everybody's in the same boat the sense like none of these allegations are true you
[2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:14.540]  say well I know that's not true of me but you go talk to the other people and you find
[2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:20.900]  that's not true of them either the whole thing is just gigantic big lie it's the right stock
[2:28:20.900 --> 2:28:26.540]  fire really well they knew crowd control they knew of a million people show up and you don't
[2:28:26.540 --> 2:28:32.380]  have crowd at 80 cops total the capital usually 300 and then they just and then a few provocateurs
[2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:36.260]  started a fight the cops fought back people got pissed and fought them like idiots and
[2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:39.180]  then people broke through and the rest and now they want to put us in prison for this
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:46.260]  mm-hmm and you'll note that the fight was a metropolitan police department you're an
[2:28:46.260 --> 2:28:49.660]  expert on this you're representing a lot of the folks we got norm patissus as well we'll

[2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:30.900]  faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute
[2:32:30.900 --> 2:32:38.620]  surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future
[2:32:38.620 --> 2:32:42.780]  destiny of humanity is upon us cloud swab and the unit admit they're coming out with
[2:32:42.780 --> 2:32:48.140]  implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse
[2:32:48.140 --> 2:32:54.340]  from here if we submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[2:32:54.340 --> 2:33:03.900]  non-compliance leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex
[2:33:03.900 --> 2:33:30.900]  Jones live from Austin Texas live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[2:33:30.900 --> 2:33:37.620]  one Mosley lawyer to last talk shirt roses he was swat team by the FBI's with us now
[2:33:37.620 --> 2:33:42.540]  he represents quite a few of the people on January 6 so does norm paddice my lawyer and
[2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:46.780]  he was already coming on this hour to talk about martial law the police state how much
[2:33:46.780 --> 2:33:52.220]  should we tell you because the FBI sure is only one they march around like we want to
[2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:56.140]  talk to you about the terrorist activities Alex Jones you think about terrorism you about
[2:33:56.140 --> 2:34:00.300]  to you know and like people like oh god you're in trouble we're gonna run away from that it's
[2:34:00.300 --> 2:34:08.340]  meant to mark all protest as terrorist and protesting is not terroristic it's American
[2:34:08.340 --> 2:34:13.780]  a stick as you said this morning we talked about 7 a.m. norm and it is so frustrating
[2:34:13.780 --> 2:34:20.420]  this is like the McCarthy stuff on steroids or PCP I mean this is just the whole world's
[2:34:20.420 --> 2:34:23.940]  freaking out by the way right now about this they're like what the hell's going on in America
[2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:28.340]  white people don't get medical care and they're all terrorists and and anybody that protests
[2:34:28.340 --> 2:34:33.260]  is a terrorist I mean norm what do you make of this I'm surprised you didn't play the
[2:34:33.260 --> 2:34:37.700]  doors this is the end it feels that way to me it's a new McCarthyism you know the seditious
[2:34:37.700 --> 2:34:42.180]  conspiracy charge shocks me I pulled the statute when I heard about it I had a few minutes and
[2:34:42.180 --> 2:34:45.620]  you know lawyers think in terms of elements what in the hell can the government be thinking
[2:34:45.620 --> 2:34:50.500]  so they've always been calling an insurrection the sedition finally a charge well here what
[2:34:50.500 --> 2:34:55.900]  they appear to be thinking two or more people agreed to hinder or delay the execution of
[2:34:55.900 --> 2:35:01.660]  a law the United States that is every protester who appears at a public meeting that you don't
[2:35:01.660 --> 2:35:06.420]  want Congress to sign a resolution to attack Iraq you're trying to hinder along so lawyers
[2:35:06.420 --> 2:35:10.500]  constitutional lawyers like mr. Mosley like myself we are aware of what a doctrine called
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:15.740]  the overbreath doctrine when a doctrine impinges speech chills speech and is so broad in its
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:20.140]  impact that it gives a prosecutor to pick and choose who to prosecute people of ordinary
[2:35:20.140 --> 2:35:24.900]  sensibilities do not know what is or isn't prohibited what's more with respect to First
[2:35:24.900 --> 2:35:29.380]  Amendment rights fundamental rights to freedom of association fundamental rights to petition
[2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:35.140]  for redress of grievances these prosecutions are obscene and I'm sure that each of these
[2:35:35.140 --> 2:35:38.940]  lawyers will file a motion to dismiss I'm less confident that the courts will do the
[2:35:38.940 --> 2:35:43.100]  right thing it may be that will have to wait for appellate court decisions but I think
[2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:47.860]  this is a clear and present danger to the United States of America I watched last night for
[2:35:47.860 --> 2:35:52.580]  the first time Merrick Garland's speech about January 5th or 6th I thought he was unhinged
[2:35:52.580 --> 2:35:55.860]  I thought he'd been given a raw deal when he wasn't set for the United States Supreme
[2:35:55.860 --> 2:35:59.700]  Court and thought they had at least ought to have voted up or down on him but when I watched
[2:35:59.700 --> 2:36:03.940]  him quaking in his loafers in rage I thought there's something wrong with the man and there's
[2:36:03.940 --> 2:36:07.860]  something wrong with the country also said five police died well you know but here's
[2:36:07.860 --> 2:36:12.380]  what he said lie here's what he said about the law what he said about the law is whether
[2:36:12.380 --> 2:36:18.100]  if you contributed knowingly or unknowingly to events that led to violence you are a
[2:36:18.100 --> 2:36:24.100]  co-conspirator that's simply wrong you are not a co-conspirator in a crime unless you
[2:36:24.100 --> 2:36:29.820]  engage self-consciously deliberately for unlawful purpose with another and agree with another
[2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:34.820]  appearing that only in the Patriot Act which I agree is unconstitutional the the the giving
[2:36:34.820 --> 2:36:38.660]  material support to terrorists which we always do abuse against citizens isn't that the only
[2:36:38.660 --> 2:36:44.260]  way you could say you unknowingly contributed it appears to be and that statute is currently
[2:36:44.260 --> 2:36:48.900]  written I checked it this morning applies to foreign terroristic organizations as registered
[2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:52.380]  with the states yeah they gotta be registered but here's what scared me last night Alex
[2:36:52.380 --> 2:36:56.340]  last June as you pointed out to me last night when you woke me up with a phone call and
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:37:00.580]  I don't mean I was asleep literally but I wasn't paying attention I mean Garland stood
[2:37:00.580 --> 2:37:04.980]  up and said you know we're gonna create a domestic terrorism unit and if you're protesting
[2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:09.220]  too much about the government you're a terrorist well count me in among the terrorist American
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:14.420]  you know where I live because I am protesting what you've done here what you have said by
[2:37:14.420 --> 2:37:18.740]  your actions today is that petitioning for redress of grievance doing what we did to
[2:37:18.740 --> 2:37:23.500]  George with respect to King George at the time of the founding makes me and every American
[2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:27.820]  who does anything other than bend and spread a criminal if that's the case then we're
[2:37:27.820 --> 2:37:34.260]  all criminals but my response to Garland is no sir you are the criminal and here is why
[2:37:34.260 --> 2:37:39.900]  it is not a crime to protest it is not even if somebody else pays for me to go to the
[2:37:39.900 --> 2:37:45.060]  protest unless I've joined in the in the in agreement this morning I butchered it you
[2:37:45.060 --> 2:37:50.020]  said protesting is not terrorism it's Americanism or something yeah I can't remember either
[2:37:50.020 --> 2:37:55.460]  we were I just gotten up but I mean protesting is the American way we were not born to bend
[2:37:55.460 --> 2:37:59.380]  and spread our government want to affect law our government we want to challenge stuff
[2:37:59.380 --> 2:38:04.220]  our government was designed to be inefficient this is why the response to the next hour
[2:38:04.220 --> 2:38:07.860]  you're making a lot of great points let's go back to John here the lawyer who helped
[2:38:07.860 --> 2:38:12.300]  break all this news was there Jonathan Mosley thank you so much John other points you'd
[2:38:12.300 --> 2:38:20.660]  like to add here and John may not have been able to hold with us he may be gone well
[2:38:20.660 --> 2:38:25.820]  you know John sounded like he it sounded like he was a fantastic lawyer it sounded like
[2:38:25.820 --> 2:38:31.060]  Rhodes is in good hands with him and that he is aware of elements to the defense but
[2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:36.340]  I think this is the great lie on the American people I mean for Kamala Harris to stand up
[2:38:36.340 --> 2:38:41.820]  in front of the nation and say January 6 was like September 11th was like Pearl Harbor
[2:38:41.820 --> 2:38:48.900]  no it wasn't January 6 was like 1776 it was like Lexington it was like Concord stolen
[2:38:48.900 --> 2:38:54.300]  election or not when the people wake up and think enough to appear at a public place and
[2:38:54.300 --> 2:38:59.020]  demand answers Congress ought not to react by investigating the people they had a look
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:02.740]  in their own hen house and say what are we doing wrong that so many people are pissed
[2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:10.900]  off and let me just add this point Kamala Harris raised two million dollars in one
[2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:16.060]  day for people that burned down federal buildings and I mean again I mean I don't want to burn
[2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:21.380]  down federal buildings those are my buildings she literally raised two million dollars material
[2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:26.660]  support for hundreds of people arrested in Seattle and Portland burning down buildings
[2:39:26.660 --> 2:39:31.580]  and brags about it when she was a candidate for president under under Merrick Garland
[2:39:31.580 --> 2:39:36.260]  speech of well you know me seriously that is terrorism you know if I'm financing people
[2:39:36.260 --> 2:39:40.740]  burning buildings down that's terror I didn't do that why am I under investigation and why
[2:39:40.740 --> 2:39:45.220]  is she the vice president because you're on the wrong side of the aisle those who have
[2:39:45.220 --> 2:39:49.340]  power want to keep it and apparently they'll keep it at any cost but if I had power I would
[2:39:49.340 --> 2:39:53.860]  want to burn down housing projects and burn down federal buildings and attack federal
[2:39:53.860 --> 2:39:59.060]  police with hatchets the hypocrisy of this is that they is it okay is that people are
[2:39:59.060 --> 2:40:03.900]  picking sides and what they're saying is if we like the violence if we like the cause
[2:40:03.900 --> 2:40:08.460]  for which you are engaged in violence you're peacefully protesting exactly don't you're
[2:40:08.460 --> 2:40:12.540]  peacefully protesting you're violent that's right Jonathan Mosley you're back with us
[2:40:12.540 --> 2:40:17.020]  on a little bit more of you other key points about representing January 6 folks or anything
[2:40:17.020 --> 2:40:21.380]  you'd like to add so we really appreciate you joining us well what he suggested you
[2:40:21.380 --> 2:40:28.460]  know is the difficult thing is that all of those things have been tried and and the judges
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:35.180]  in this case are acting very unusually and and a denying motion that I think in any other
[2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:43.860]  case for bill of particulars to dismiss would be routine the judges in this case will listen
[2:40:43.860 --> 2:40:50.980]  very carefully and attentively and then rule against us so everything that a normal litigator
[2:40:50.980 --> 2:40:55.540]  would think well this is you know this is ridiculous the judges are protecting these
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:41:02.420]  indictments and and I find that very worrisome so they're going to a great extreme John what
[2:41:02.420 --> 2:41:06.980]  do you think's behind that just because it is a fraud because I read like like Norman
[2:41:06.980 --> 2:41:11.140]  you filed that deal and hold over sir don't hang up if you've got the time when I talk
[2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:15.940]  with you like they said Owen doesn't work here Owen wasn't with us Owen wasn't with
[2:41:15.940 --> 2:41:19.740]  our security he perjured himself he works here that was his security these are ball
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:28.820]  faced lies that go against the very video I mean why would the feds lie like that John
[2:41:28.820 --> 2:41:33.540]  why I'm being a very I think they can't go against the political leaders they can't
[2:41:33.540 --> 2:41:38.420]  go against the crowd and I think that the days when we could trust the FBI or the US
[2:41:38.420 --> 2:41:43.260]  attorneys are long gone because are you know they're populated by people from our decaying
[2:41:43.260 --> 2:41:49.220]  society but the but the the I mean these things are prosecuted your own misconduct this I mean
[2:41:49.220 --> 2:41:55.660]  think back to Senator Ted Stevens when someone I mean someone somehow replaced Judge Emmett
[2:41:55.660 --> 2:42:02.460]  Sullivan because 12 years ago he was furious at the government for lying about Emmett
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:08.020]  Ted Stevens and the whole thing got thrown out now fast for 10 years and you know nobody
[2:42:08.020 --> 2:42:12.540]  wants to hear it I mean these things should be dismissed for so many reasons we have tried
[2:42:12.540 --> 2:42:18.660]  we're going to be filing a new most to dismiss but lying to the grand jury you know not not
[2:42:18.660 --> 2:42:23.220]  a difference of opinion or you know they didn't tell them everything I mean flat out lying
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:28.940]  to the grand jury should get the cases dismissed but it's not happening with these cases Jonathan
[2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:34.300]  Monsley I know that more than a couple questions we can hold five more minutes I got just a
[2:42:34.300 --> 2:42:39.340]  few more questions for the other side okay thank you and he was there when Stuart Rhodes

[2:42:47.140 --> 2:42:51.660]  again I told people I said I don't think Stuart's a Fed I think he's being set up I think we're

[2:44:04.620 --> 2:44:15.060]  had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that
[2:44:15.060 --> 2:44:22.300]  so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it
[2:44:22.300 --> 2:44:29.940]  all away I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically
[2:44:29.940 --> 2:44:36.660]  controlled 20 and I know we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so
[2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:44.420]  incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart
[2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:49.580]  and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist
[2:44:49.580 --> 2:44:54.740]  are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually
[2:44:54.740 --> 2:45:00.340]  end the species as we know it I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against
[2:45:00.340 --> 2:45:05.820]  the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake up the world and stop them
[2:45:05.820 --> 2:45:11.300]  dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake

[2:47:28.260 --> 2:47:34.940]  american people the declaration of the main threat being the population of conus you are
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:38.620]  making a huge point we'll go right back to our guest one pat is constitutional lawyer
[2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:43.020]  also representing a lot of january 6 folks including oan shroyer facing years in prison
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:48.660]  for being outside the capital peacefully trying to stop the event norm how big a deal is it
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:53.860]  in law because we were saying will they do conspiracy will they do terrorism no they've
[2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:57.980]  done sedition tell us what this means well you know i mean basically it's an it's an
[2:47:57.980 --> 2:48:03.220]  attempt to criminalize ordinary behavior and it it waters down the conspiracy requirement
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:09.580]  to almost meaningless dimensions if in fact agreeing to go to a protest and agreeing to
[2:48:09.580 --> 2:48:14.780]  stand outside do it to try to delay congress from doing something or a federal agency
[2:48:14.780 --> 2:48:19.100]  from doing something or trying to hinder them from doing something on that expression of
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:24.300]  protest is now considered under this precedent seditious conspiracy so this is the ultimate
[2:48:24.300 --> 2:48:29.340]  chilling effect u.s. government declares protesting terrorism it's consistent with what garland
[2:48:29.340 --> 2:48:32.740]  said last weekend he must have had this in mind and know that was coming that was the
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:38.780]  foreshadowing we're not done yet and we mean to strike out and those who engaged in acts
[2:48:38.780 --> 2:48:44.420]  of violence in his language whether knowingly or not supported by others are going to be
[2:48:44.420 --> 2:48:49.700]  guilty if they were there and others broke in they're guilty wow that's that's dangerous
[2:48:49.700 --> 2:48:54.100]  and they face up to twenty years in prison i mean realistically no one will pull that
[2:48:54.100 --> 2:48:58.900]  kind of time but it's a it's a it's a serious felony with catastrophic consequences and
[2:48:58.900 --> 2:49:03.180]  it will have a chilling effect well they killed the copper burned down a building that they'd
[2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:07.260]  get that get bailed out by kamala harris well that's probably true or if you burn down
[2:49:07.260 --> 2:49:12.180]  kenosha i mean i guess you get a monument named after you but if you go to congress
[2:49:12.180 --> 2:49:16.180]  well the car did that not the guy well you have okay blame the car i mean you know in
[2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:19.940]  medieval law we used to have in rem proceedings against the instrumentality of a crime you
[2:49:19.940 --> 2:49:24.700]  beat somebody with a stick the person got punished but so did the stick so we're going
[2:49:24.700 --> 2:49:30.100]  back to a new medievalism all right well let's go back to the lawyer that was there when
[2:49:30.100 --> 2:49:35.700]  skirt got grabbed today john thank you so much for your time you got a lot to say what else
[2:49:35.700 --> 2:49:41.020]  do you want to impart to this audience of millions well i you know i think like i said people
[2:49:41.020 --> 2:49:46.740]  need to remember the the prosecution against uh... uh... ted stevens how a whistleblower
[2:49:46.740 --> 2:49:51.620]  came forward and said that the fb i were at the doj were withholding information in an
[2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:57.100]  altering documents and the doj has learned nothing from this uh... they need to have
[2:49:57.100 --> 2:50:02.940]  a long talk with mike knife knife on a prosecutor who lost his bar license because of the duke
[2:50:02.940 --> 2:50:07.900]  lacrosse player thing this is uh... you know i'm looking at the thing what people need
[2:50:07.900 --> 2:50:13.580]  to know is there are no new facts that i can see this is just a public relations spin
[2:50:13.580 --> 2:50:19.700]  and for the reason said that there's a there's a good example i don't see how they can
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:24.700]  everything about this is being treated differently than any normal case and this is what is baffling
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:28.780]  a lot of people is like none of the stuff would be allowed in a normal case it would
[2:50:28.780 --> 2:50:34.900]  be dismissed uh... it would be uh... it would just be thrown out of court and yet nobody
[2:50:34.900 --> 2:50:39.380]  wants to do that uh... some of the statutes are being used in ways that have never been
[2:50:39.380 --> 2:50:46.220]  used before and and there are lots of reasons why that's considered act like ex post facto
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:51.140]  uh... but the the the courts here are not going along with that and i think that everybody
[2:50:51.140 --> 2:50:57.300]  is still terrified to you know to go up against the narrative
[2:50:57.300 --> 2:51:00.820]  well i agree i mean this is a corporate
[2:51:00.820 --> 2:51:04.060]  not even left us it's not liberal it's just a democratic party
[2:51:04.060 --> 2:51:06.500]  a corporate judicial
[2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:09.900]  legislative conspiracy against freedom
[2:51:09.900 --> 2:51:12.540]  norm is is is that accurate statement what you call it
[2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:16.020]  i don't know if it's all of that all i know is it scares the hell out of me when my government
[2:51:16.020 --> 2:51:19.540]  can make it up as it goes along and if they don't like the content of my speech they can
[2:51:19.540 --> 2:51:24.700]  throw me in prison but i mean it's the courts with part of the legislative system
[2:51:24.700 --> 2:51:29.220]  and part of the executive system just attacking people well i mean i take jonathan's point
[2:51:29.220 --> 2:51:33.300]  well i mean that it you know he's on the ground in dc there in a way that i'm not i get in
[2:51:33.300 --> 2:51:37.140]  there in and out of there intermittently if you're seeing courts behave in ways they
[2:51:37.140 --> 2:51:41.980]  haven't before when you take vague language to prevent hindered delay the execution of
[2:51:41.980 --> 2:51:48.580]  any law of the united states and you you now say a protester who on waved hollard screened
[2:51:48.580 --> 2:51:55.580]  i mean that means if you protested against prohibition or or or against suffrage you
[2:51:55.580 --> 2:51:59.820]  would be bad i mean this is this is outrageous on its outrageous and it's terrifying and
[2:51:59.820 --> 2:52:03.780]  it's going to have an effect and you know the timing you know as mr is is it fair to
[2:52:03.780 --> 2:52:08.780]  say this is an attempt to outlaw protest it's an attempt to chill protest i don't think
[2:52:08.780 --> 2:52:12.700]  they can come out now i don't think they can out and out ban it but i think a person about
[2:52:12.700 --> 2:52:17.620]  ready to hop in their car and go to dc will now think twice for fear that they stand next
[2:52:17.620 --> 2:52:22.060]  to the wrong person at the wrong time and get on crosshair side on the crosshair side
[2:52:22.060 --> 2:52:26.380]  very unamerican enclosing john what do you think happens to stewart roads now facing
[2:52:26.380 --> 2:52:32.300]  20 years in prison for walking around outside the capital i think if he doesn't get a very
[2:52:32.300 --> 2:52:37.860]  good lawyer like this afternoon he's going to remain in in custody for a long time and
[2:52:37.860 --> 2:52:43.140]  um if i'm worried about a dc jury if he gets a fair jury he's going to be out he's going
[2:52:43.140 --> 2:52:48.220]  to be found not guilty and have a fat malicious prosecution lawsuit john what's your what
[2:52:48.220 --> 2:52:52.020]  what are the likelihood i mean is there any way to get these up on an interlockatory appeal
[2:52:52.020 --> 2:52:55.740]  and get a judge to look at these in appellate court judge to look at it we're working out
[2:52:55.740 --> 2:52:59.740]  we're working on that we believe it has to be done after trial but but every and everybody
[2:52:59.740 --> 2:53:04.100]  is working on that we're talking to each other and we need to try to get the most i mean
[2:53:04.100 --> 2:53:08.660]  because you know i mean i mean harm is presumed in a 1983 case involving a first amendment
[2:53:08.660 --> 2:53:13.060]  violation and it ought to be presumed here if it's an improvident prosecution and there
[2:53:13.060 --> 2:53:18.020]  should be a sort of like enhanced frank versus delaware sort of way to attack this and it's
[2:53:18.020 --> 2:53:22.260]  worth to try god bless you i wish you all that all the luck in the world well we've been
[2:53:22.260 --> 2:53:27.460]  trying to try out documents to build a case for for a whole bunch of different motions
[2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:32.060]  including you know motion to skip dismiss because of the grand jury but but they they
[2:53:32.060 --> 2:53:35.500]  have been making it very difficult for us to get documents we're spending months just
[2:53:35.500 --> 2:53:40.060]  trying to get you know well basically they're they're hiding a needle in a haystack we got
[2:53:40.060 --> 2:53:43.820]  there but they're beginning and they'd never be permitted to do that in a civil case well
[2:53:43.820 --> 2:53:48.500]  they're building this constellation of FEMA camps and arrest and solitary confinement
[2:53:48.500 --> 2:53:53.380]  and disappearing and out of block lawyers and out of block judges are just building
[2:53:53.380 --> 2:53:59.940]  the beginning of their martial law takeover and i wouldn't believe you know the problem
[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:05.060]  is everybody believes that too late like all that's over the top unfortunately sadly it's
[2:54:05.060 --> 2:54:12.180]  not it's not well they're betting the farm on saying anybody that's a republican or a
[2:54:12.180 --> 2:54:17.740]  populace is a terrorist they've a i mean mcconnell came out and quoted biden saying that so i
[2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:21.700]  mean we're here folks well i mean i i you know the narrative now is the following if
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:26.500]  you complain about something and you happen to be white you're a white nationalist or
[2:54:26.500 --> 2:54:31.100]  you're a white supremacist i'm neither i happen to be a white misanthrope i don't trust anybody
[2:54:31.100 --> 2:54:34.780]  much less the government sure they're trying to change the subject of a multinational criminal
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:39.180]  takeover into black and white most people see through it and that's what's so scary is
[2:54:39.180 --> 2:54:44.020]  this globalist takeover is not going well but they keep doubling down john thank you

[2:55:59.660 --> 2:56:04.340]  to tell the story the press is not reporting this and so i think people who are listening
[2:56:04.340 --> 2:56:08.540]  to your show have to wake up and start talking about it and start talking about it to one
[2:56:08.540 --> 2:56:12.580]  another and start talking about it to their elected officials i mean can you know can

[3:00:29.420 --> 3:00:33.380]  don't submit to lockdowns unfortunately not to the borders and anybody that questions
[3:00:33.380 --> 3:00:37.460]  this election as a terrorist you think you're going to be on the white flag up to that folks
[3:00:37.460 --> 3:00:40.380]  now you're not going to be safe around the white flag so you're not looking for a fight
[3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:46.660]  but you know what people come around looking for them in the right place didn't it so that's
[3:00:46.660 --> 3:00:51.100]  where we are ladies and gentlemen so norm get in this huge supreme court ruling well
[3:00:51.100 --> 3:00:56.020]  apparently the divided court it may have been a 6 3 or a 5 3 ruling with a recusal it's
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:01:00.780]  not clear to me based on what I'm seeing coming in as we speak but with three dissenting votes
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:06.540]  the court held that the vaccine mandate for employers could not go into effect they granted
[3:01:06.540 --> 3:01:10.740]  a preliminary injunction while the issue is fully briefed so the issue hasn't finally
[3:01:10.740 --> 3:01:15.660]  been decided but a majority of justice is held or concluded that there was a substantial
[3:01:15.660 --> 3:01:21.020]  likelihood of success and in the success so far they just blocked it right and they did
[3:01:21.020 --> 3:01:25.060]  and they signaled the following which is a fundamental concern of federalism and that
[3:01:25.060 --> 3:01:29.780]  is that OSHA this was to take place through a health and safety regulation in the so-called
[3:01:29.780 --> 3:01:34.580]  administrative state the headless fourth branch of government that the biden tried to craft
[3:01:34.580 --> 3:01:39.100]  an OSHA regulation that would give to the federal government a power that traditionally belongs
[3:01:39.100 --> 3:01:43.620]  to the state the police power the power to regulate health he even claimed the cdc could
[3:01:43.620 --> 3:01:49.260]  seize all housing that's martial law it certainly isn't it certainly is but in this case the
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:55.300]  court has had suspicions that wasn't judicial or a federal overreach powers that traditionally
[3:01:55.300 --> 3:01:59.980]  belong to the state and that you could not use a state administrative regulatory power
[3:01:59.980 --> 3:02:05.380]  to defeat federalism so this is as fundamental a ruling as a ruling in the bill of rights
[3:02:05.380 --> 3:02:09.620]  there are two levels of protection that protect an american from its government there is the
[3:02:09.620 --> 3:02:13.660]  bill of rights that poses limits on state and federal government and i like to call those
[3:02:13.660 --> 3:02:18.500]  sort of horizontal limits those are the threshold nobody can cross that but there are a vertical
[3:02:18.500 --> 3:02:23.260]  set of protections as well and this is federalism where powers are divided between the federal
[3:02:23.260 --> 3:02:27.820]  and state government joe biden has tried to assert a federal police power in the supreme
[3:02:27.820 --> 3:02:33.620]  court said whoa that is a fundamental change in the nature of law that governs us not so
[3:02:33.620 --> 3:02:38.860]  fast joe and so now they'll be further argument on it on three of the court's liberals so
[3:02:38.860 --> 3:02:44.260]  to mire kagan and and i don't recall the third voted against suspending the rule and would
[3:02:44.260 --> 3:02:48.980]  have let biden go so they just it's a total power grab if you don't think supreme court
[3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:54.660]  justices matter ask yourself today why three justices were prepared to amend the constitution
[3:02:54.660 --> 3:02:59.900]  themselves with a ruling so explain to me like i'm five years old academy and what does
[3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:03.500]  this mean and so they're saying right now there's a stay while they decide yes that's
[3:03:03.500 --> 3:03:07.940]  exactly right so the party's thought we are our firm filed an amicus brief on the i should
[3:03:07.940 --> 3:03:12.500]  have said hey he's in this case in the supreme court well we flew up in the case we filed
[3:03:12.500 --> 3:03:16.700]  it we filed an amicus brief for freedom alliance and can a group based out of canada followed
[3:03:16.700 --> 3:03:21.580]  a lot of lawsuits against a force vaccine well we have i mean our view is that the people
[3:03:21.580 --> 3:03:25.180]  have a right to decide for themselves and that the government and never write to cram
[3:03:25.180 --> 3:03:29.620]  it down so we're very active in the religious exemption area but what it means to alex is
[3:03:29.620 --> 3:03:33.900]  that there's a case or controversy before the court challenging the constitutionality
[3:03:33.900 --> 3:03:39.580]  of assertion of federal power because it's on because there are questions substantial
[3:03:39.580 --> 3:03:44.260]  questions about whether that suit will succeed and there would be irreparable harm if this
[3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:48.980]  action were not if the action weren't stayed the court said fine we're putting the brakes
[3:03:48.980 --> 3:03:54.020]  on some there's something happening here what it is ain't exactly clear we need more briefs
[3:03:54.020 --> 3:03:58.740]  we need more time but in the meantime hands off the structure of federalism so this is
[3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:03.460]  actually a very good ruling by the supreme court one would hope we get a similar good
[3:04:03.460 --> 3:04:08.980]  ruling with respect to the seditious conspiracy cases that arose today that may take some time
[3:04:08.980 --> 3:04:14.260]  but regardless our republic is under the biggest assault i think at two hundred forty five
[3:04:14.260 --> 3:04:18.460]  year history you know you read i read a by mentioned a book yesterday the marsh book
[3:04:18.460 --> 3:04:23.700]  on the new civil war and he's a canadian author he went so far as to say look we need a constitutional
[3:04:23.700 --> 3:04:27.900]  convention in the united states because the constitution doesn't work it's too inefficient
[3:04:27.900 --> 3:04:33.980]  i think is global pressures club with respect to the climate with respect to population
[3:04:33.980 --> 3:04:38.860]  movement with respect to big data with respect to artificial intelligence these collectivizing
[3:04:38.860 --> 3:04:44.580]  forces are requiring in many people's minds a better response than federalism can yield
[3:04:44.580 --> 3:04:49.740]  so yes we are under attack you'll call it globalism i'll call it centralizing pressures
[3:04:49.740 --> 3:04:57.660]  the bottom line is our what our way of life is under assault that's right and we can

[3:08:36.340 --> 3:08:41.580]  deal but that's not the war being one that's a battle being one you're heavily involved
[3:08:41.580 --> 3:08:45.540]  in these cases got a bunch of lawsuits for force facts in front of supreme court you
[3:08:45.540 --> 3:08:49.700]  did amicus brief for those who just joined us on this case tell us what that means the
[3:08:49.700 --> 3:08:53.420]  amicus brief means we just appeared as a friend of the court we have religious objectors to
[3:08:53.420 --> 3:08:58.620]  vaccination in in in our client base many of our clients and they asked us to make their
[3:08:58.620 --> 3:09:04.100]  voices heard in front of the connecticut supreme court and what we said is we don't want there's
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:08.940]  a bill of rights we have a right to make our choices for ourselves and let's consider one
[3:09:08.940 --> 3:09:13.020]  of the central ironies of our time if you want to realize just how twisted life has
[3:09:13.020 --> 3:09:17.380]  become consider the following there's a doctrine in the law called substantive due process and
[3:09:17.380 --> 3:09:21.140]  that's where you go in the law to vindicate a right that's not enumerated elsewhere in
[3:09:21.140 --> 3:09:25.980]  the constitution what are the rights that substantive due process yields well presumably
[3:09:25.980 --> 3:09:30.700]  the right to abort it's a quite it's a right of questionable constitutional vintage but
[3:09:30.700 --> 3:09:36.860]  yet when we claim bodily autonomy against being vaccinated we're told oh no no no kill
[3:09:36.860 --> 3:09:41.860]  your baby it's your body but we got to let Pfizer stick it's it's it's metal penis in
[3:09:41.860 --> 3:09:46.660]  you in Casey versus Planned Parenthood the fundamental abortion case just then justice
[3:09:46.660 --> 3:09:51.100]  Anton Anthony Kell on Kennedy said the following on that we should each be free to enact or
[3:09:51.100 --> 3:09:56.100]  and in live our own fundamental conception of meaning in the universe there has been
[3:09:56.100 --> 3:10:01.020]  a core traditional fundamental conception of meaning in western civilization for two
[3:10:01.020 --> 3:10:05.780]  millennia that is the relationship between man and God and when the state tries to interfere
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:09.860]  with that relationship my clients and frankly I believe there's something and something
[3:10:09.860 --> 3:10:14.540]  fundamentally out of whack reread St. Augustine there's a city of God a city of man what
[3:10:14.540 --> 3:10:19.460]  is sin sin is love of the wrong thing ladies and gentlemen we live in an area where era
[3:10:19.460 --> 3:10:24.540]  where we love the wrong thing we are the pots saying to the potter why make us thus let
[3:10:24.540 --> 3:10:28.780]  us remake ourselves and the result is the public place is becoming a place exactly
[3:10:28.780 --> 3:10:32.980]  we are start loving freedom again warfare you know so how do we love the right thing
[3:10:32.980 --> 3:10:38.740]  again I think we cherish conceptions of excellent excellence I think the churches matter I think
[3:10:38.740 --> 3:10:43.700]  traditional religious and philosophic doctrine matter you know I was I was I taught briefly
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:49.060]  at Columbia years ago and I always used to take great pride in the words etched over
[3:10:49.060 --> 3:10:54.500]  low memorial library Plato Aristotle Demosthenes Cicero I studied those works and I thought
[3:10:54.500 --> 3:10:58.900]  you know I'll never be in their league but they can teach me something I was on the campus
[3:10:58.900 --> 3:11:02.700]  not long ago and saw that they had a banner above those names of contemporary authors
[3:11:02.700 --> 3:11:06.540]  many of whom I didn't hear or didn't know about so I looked up most of them and they
[3:11:06.540 --> 3:11:12.420]  were all contemporary you know people far from the left cherishing identity overriding
[3:11:12.420 --> 3:11:17.460]  the greatest it's just it's an it's an exercise of power Adam it's not a it's not a coming
[3:11:17.460 --> 3:11:22.400]  together a beautiful ideas it's an exercise by small brains Alex the bottom is falling
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:27.380]  out of pluralism and when it falls out that hollow sound you hear that thud is Merrick
[3:11:27.380 --> 3:11:32.180]  Garland calling you a terrorist for protesting we've lost the ability to distinguish right
[3:11:32.180 --> 3:11:36.780]  from wrong better from worse and be in our flight from excellence and if you believe
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:43.820]  he says that if you protest you're a terrorist I mean it's like it's cartoonish I think you
[3:11:43.820 --> 3:11:48.500]  should run a new line of bumper stickers I'm a terrorist and when we all become terrorists
[3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:52.100]  we'll just have to challenge them who you're going to take today your mom but didn't we
[3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:55.780]  all warn the Patriot Act I know you did at the time I did too the Patriot Act will be
[3:11:55.780 --> 3:12:00.420]  used against us now they're doing it I remember sitting in the car the night the Patriot Act
[3:12:00.420 --> 3:12:04.820]  was announced however many years ago and saying to my then law partner John Williams
[3:12:04.820 --> 3:12:10.260]  in New Haven this is the darkest day in American history and I continue to believe it is there
[3:12:10.260 --> 3:12:16.220]  was and now they're openly saying it's for people yeah and there's oh you tried to influence
[3:12:16.220 --> 3:12:20.740]  government that's illegal well that's what's in this new document of Stuart Rhodes here's
[3:12:20.740 --> 3:12:27.940]  the foundation for what Mark garlic the foundation Garland Garland delayed last week on the material
[3:12:27.940 --> 3:12:33.660]  assistance to terrorist act prohibits an American citizen from contributing to a foreign terrorist
[3:12:33.660 --> 3:12:39.700]  registered by an the State Department by declaring by creating a separate domestic terrorism unit
[3:12:39.700 --> 3:12:45.020]  within the Justice Department we are one statutory amendment away from making that statute read
[3:12:45.020 --> 3:12:51.100]  you are a terror you are guilty if you if you finance a domestic terrorist group as defined
[3:12:51.100 --> 3:12:55.620]  by the Justice Department that's all it would take to amend that statute and I believe the
[3:12:55.620 --> 3:13:01.340]  way the law is being applied today in this seditious conspiracy prosecution is a prelude
[3:13:01.340 --> 3:13:05.100]  it's trying to teach us they're president trying to legislate well that's what they
[3:13:05.100 --> 3:13:09.540]  always do yeah hell yeah yeah and it's not the way it's supposed to be I mean that that's
[3:13:09.540 --> 3:13:13.540]  why we say of due process you can't you've got to provide notice to people about what
[3:13:13.540 --> 3:13:17.340]  is and isn't prohibited usually it comes in the form of statute sometimes it comes in
[3:13:17.340 --> 3:13:22.260]  the form of practice your guest earlier from DC I forgot his name I'm horrible with name
[3:13:22.260 --> 3:13:26.220]  Ali Alexander no the fellow that was John on moments ago the lawyer he you know he makes
[3:13:26.220 --> 3:13:31.220]  a great point and that is that the judges in DC are not doing what they usually do John
[3:13:31.220 --> 3:13:35.500]  Mosley John Mosley's been in the courts in DC and what he's what he's seeing is what
[3:13:35.500 --> 3:13:40.340]  he told us judges are making new rules I sat with a member of your staff yesterday who
[3:13:40.340 --> 3:13:44.740]  talked about changing conceptions of what's reasonable and that's exactly right look at
[3:13:44.740 --> 3:13:48.100]  the fourth amendment people like to think that the Constitution is written in granted
[3:13:48.100 --> 3:13:52.220]  and if there are absolute guarantees on what can and can't happen there aren't the fourth
[3:13:52.220 --> 3:13:56.540]  amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures what's reasonable whatever the courts
[3:13:56.540 --> 3:14:04.260]  say let's talk about this in closing before the great J. Dar takes over this is not signs
[3:14:04.260 --> 3:14:08.540]  of power from the power structure this is not signs of that they're in charge this is
[3:14:08.540 --> 3:14:13.340]  signs of a dying corrupt elite that are out of control which I don't want to have a fight
[3:14:13.340 --> 3:14:16.580]  with I don't want to have a good or done or wrong battle the gods that I want to just
[3:14:16.580 --> 3:14:21.620]  go away and retire we've got our own problems but this is really how wars start and they
[3:14:21.620 --> 3:14:26.860]  didn't need to just stop Alex you may not want the fight but the fight found you I mean
[3:14:26.860 --> 3:14:32.340]  I get that all I'm telling them is this what they're doing is not a sign of strength strength
[3:14:32.340 --> 3:14:36.700]  everybody wants to follow anyways strength is in the streets and strength is in the American
[3:14:36.700 --> 3:14:40.660]  people that's why we were able to mobilize and win the second world war and recover from
[3:14:40.660 --> 3:14:45.100]  a deposition if we're going to be at war with ourselves or with elites seeking to conscript
[3:14:45.100 --> 3:14:50.660]  our institutions we need to stand up fight and they've taken the sleeping giant is weakness
[3:14:50.660 --> 3:14:55.700]  now claus Schwab and Bill Clinton and Bill Gates is woke us up and now they're like
[3:14:55.700 --> 3:15:00.020]  oh they're awake let's declare them terrorists and have the FBI attack us that's not a good
[3:15:00.020 --> 3:15:05.420]  mission for the FBI and I don't wish any harm on the FBI but that is a not a very good submission
[3:15:05.420 --> 3:15:09.780]  I have a confession to make I didn't know who claus Schwab was until I heard you talking
[3:15:09.780 --> 3:15:13.380]  about him yesterday I ordered one of his books last night I'll be happy to talk to you about
[3:15:13.380 --> 3:15:16.900]  what I think of the great reset well I never got to that when I start the show tomorrow
[3:15:16.900 --> 3:15:22.580]  we're still on air he got his minion who he controls got confronted in parliament in the
[3:15:22.580 --> 3:15:29.460]  Netherlands and got blown away well you know who are these people that they think they own
[3:15:29.460 --> 3:15:33.700]  the earth and its products including us they're not people I know and they're not people I've
[3:15:33.700 --> 3:15:39.060]  consented to be governed by exactly they're arrogant bastards all right jay dar takes
[3:15:39.060 --> 3:15:44.020]  over in four minutes on the other side norm pat is great job great job of the crew let's pray
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:49.700]  for Stuart Rhodes now in federal custody along with ten other SWAT team today for the crime of
[3:15:49.700 --> 3:15:59.860]  sedition the left is going to cream itself I want to explain something that is absolutely
[3:15:59.860 --> 3:16:05.060]  feed understanding our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned
[3:16:05.060 --> 3:16:11.540]  central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[3:16:11.540 --> 3:16:18.020]  and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property
[3:16:19.060 --> 3:16:25.300]  energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands
[3:16:25.300 --> 3:16:29.700]  of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that
[3:16:29.700 --> 3:16:34.900]  money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone
[3:16:34.900 --> 3:16:40.180]  ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything

[3:18:13.780 --> 3:18:17.460]  you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is
[3:18:17.460 --> 3:18:21.540]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government take over
[3:18:21.540 --> 3:18:25.060]  so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the
[3:18:25.060 --> 3:18:28.820]  price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50

[3:19:05.060 --> 3:19:11.220]  alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host owen shroyer super male volatility
[3:19:11.220 --> 3:19:16.740]  and brain force putt mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super male volatility really
[3:19:16.740 --> 3:19:22.820]  really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so
[3:19:22.820 --> 3:19:28.180]  it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just
[3:19:28.180 --> 3:19:32.820]  aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different
[3:19:32.820 --> 3:19:36.660]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something
[3:19:36.660 --> 3:19:41.060]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh
[3:19:41.060 --> 3:19:46.500]  so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls
[3:19:46.500 --> 3:20:00.420]  Royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[3:20:00.420 --> 3:20:15.140]  order it's alex jones welcome back to the out show under guest host jdi or j's analysis as you
[3:20:15.140 --> 3:20:22.100]  know we have in my segments covered many global elites documents books white papers and i love
[3:20:22.100 --> 3:20:27.700]  to go to the documents themselves because it really demonstrates improves the factual objective
[3:20:27.700 --> 3:20:32.900]  reality of these strategies and plans that have been in the works for decades and even
[3:20:32.900 --> 3:20:38.180]  going back to the royal society a hundred years ago and today the discussion is no different we
[3:20:38.180 --> 3:20:45.460]  want to go into the recently declassified or leaked or allowed to be public on purpose document
[3:20:45.460 --> 3:20:51.620]  about human argument augmentation and this is a joint project between the uk ministry of defense
[3:20:51.620 --> 3:20:57.380]  and the german government all about transhumanism they don't use the word transhumanism they use
[3:20:57.380 --> 3:21:01.620]  the word human augmentation because that's a better selling point it's a better pitch point
[3:21:01.620 --> 3:21:06.660]  it's kind of a pr term and so this document goes into discussing what it will be like
[3:21:07.220 --> 3:21:12.100]  and how things will change by 2050 what are the expectations that we're going to see
[3:21:12.100 --> 3:21:18.900]  in the next 30 years and by 2050 the that's a key you know time that we've seen a key year
[3:21:18.900 --> 3:21:24.820]  in a lot of these global elite writings because they have it in you know decades 20 30 year increments
[3:21:24.820 --> 3:21:31.380]  so in the next 10 years they have the designs as we've seen for a massive 80 percent reduction in
[3:21:31.380 --> 3:21:38.340]  the population and by 2050 is the basically the key year for when they want the total
[3:21:38.340 --> 3:21:44.420]  technocratic global brain system in place and this document is one of the many documents to
[3:21:44.420 --> 3:21:49.940]  kind of prepare government leaders and you know this is for kind of the upper CEO corporate class
[3:21:49.940 --> 3:21:55.140]  and government class that read these debriefs and these boring papers that the public doesn't read
[3:21:55.140 --> 3:21:59.300]  but these papers are important because they tell us everything and they tell us ahead of time
[3:22:00.180 --> 3:22:04.820]  in the white papers what is coming in the next 10 20 and 30 years they're so crucial they're so
[3:22:04.820 --> 3:22:11.060]  important and they almost always in some way pretty much get things right now sometimes there's a
[3:22:11.060 --> 3:22:16.500]  multitude of documents or strategies that are used for one single big event like we've seen in the
[3:22:16.500 --> 3:22:22.020]  last couple years we saw crimson contagion we saw dark winter we saw clay decks we saw spars we saw
[3:22:22.020 --> 3:22:28.340]  event 201 we saw all of those kind of coalescing into giving us very various angles on what happened
[3:22:28.340 --> 3:22:33.060]  in the last couple years and this document is no different except that it's focusing on
[3:22:33.940 --> 3:22:40.580]  what's to come in the next 20 or 30 years so if we paid attention to the white papers in the last
[3:22:40.580 --> 3:22:47.300]  20 years going all the way back to clay decks the anthrax experiments or excuse me the anthrax
[3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:53.140]  continuity of government plans at the time of 9 11 which were part of the 9 11 false flag event
[3:22:54.660 --> 3:23:01.060]  we want to pay attention to these kinds of white papers which come out that are describing the next
[3:23:01.060 --> 3:23:05.700]  few decades as we've as we've seen when I mentioned this document in the past we didn't go into a lot
[3:23:05.700 --> 3:23:12.420]  of depth into it but we mentioned it in passing that it begins by discussing humans as platforms in
[3:23:12.420 --> 3:23:20.020]  other words uh internet technology type platforms humans as walking routers humans as walking modems
[3:23:21.540 --> 3:23:27.220]  and how they can be used as receivers and trans transmitters of information and signals it's and
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:34.420]  it speaks of the previous research that comes out of enciltro that I covered in many talks that is
[3:23:34.420 --> 3:23:38.820]  the super soldier stuff now there's a lot of baloney out there and disinformation about super
[3:23:38.820 --> 3:23:45.460]  soldiers and people think it's like something out of a movie but really the human experimentation
[3:23:45.460 --> 3:23:50.820]  is what led into what we call the super soldier type of stuff and that's really just human augmentation
[3:23:50.820 --> 3:23:56.740]  that's can we put brain chips into soldiers can we dose them with various pharmaceuticals and enhance
[3:23:56.740 --> 3:24:02.260]  their neuro capacities all of that is in this document and and all and this document basically
[3:24:02.260 --> 3:24:09.140]  shows that what was done in mk ultra with the implantation of electrodes and all that kind of stuff
[3:24:09.140 --> 3:24:13.780]  is really just the predecessor to where they want to take the transhumanism now that's what
[3:24:13.780 --> 3:24:20.020]  I've been saying for a long time so it's it notes as well using a lot of clout speak uses the
[3:24:20.020 --> 3:24:25.940]  stakeholder speak it says that the future stakeholders and the international elites that
[3:24:25.940 --> 3:24:31.380]  will be putting money into these kinds of programs will have to deal with a lot of the hurdles that
[3:24:31.380 --> 3:24:36.180]  are in the way for getting this kind of stuff through and selling the public on it so this
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:41.380]  document is fascinating in terms of how it sells it the sales pitches that it has of course we have
[3:24:41.380 --> 3:24:48.340]  the the standard stuff of well troops get their arms and legs blown off and we all know that if
[3:24:48.340 --> 3:24:53.380]  we just accept transhumanism then we can heal all the soldiers right all of these really low IQ
[3:24:53.380 --> 3:24:59.700]  just really stupid sales pitches at the same time as the document admits things like eugenics things
[3:24:59.700 --> 3:25:04.980]  like depopulation things like we got to kill granny to have more jobs I'm not joking that's at the
[3:25:04.980 --> 3:25:09.700]  end of this document and it points out that the more that we convince the public of those kinds
[3:25:09.700 --> 3:25:13.620]  of things that you'll be better off when you're on this kind of universal basic income when you're
[3:25:13.620 --> 3:25:20.260]  on this system where carbon is tracked and traced so that you don't use up all the resources the
[3:25:20.260 --> 3:25:25.700]  document notes that that's when they will be better prepared to get people to accept all of these ideas
[3:25:25.700 --> 3:25:33.140]  and it notes at the very beginning that governments will have to basically decide
[3:25:33.700 --> 3:25:38.660]  that these kinds of technologies are inevitable and because they're inevitable they will have to
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:45.380]  mandate it the argument being that we can't let rogue people rogue actors right rogue individuals
[3:25:45.380 --> 3:25:50.900]  out there that are going to nanotech biochip people to give people an unfair advantage well
[3:25:50.900 --> 3:25:56.420]  we'll just let the government have control of these invasive technologies and they're called
[3:25:56.420 --> 3:26:01.220]  invasive technologies because then they will keep us safe from the rogue actors that might
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:08.340]  accidentally let loose something right now who could believe such a baloney level of argumentation
[3:26:08.340 --> 3:26:12.740]  such a bad argument from the very people who say that they want most people to die all right so
[3:26:12.740 --> 3:26:17.380]  most they want most people to die but don't worry if you let us control the rollout and the mandate
[3:26:17.380 --> 3:26:24.580]  it actually uses the word mandate for microchipping and nanotech right we're not talking about
[3:26:24.580 --> 3:26:29.860]  microchips from 50 years ago although this document does mention the present day usage
[3:26:29.860 --> 3:26:34.980]  of RFID microchips it says that that's kind of old school in the future it's going to be
[3:26:34.980 --> 3:26:41.220]  nanotech nano blood smart blood etc that will be the new way to do it and the governments will
[3:26:41.220 --> 3:26:49.540]  mandate this and the art that get this the logic that they use is that you are no longer an
[3:26:49.540 --> 3:26:57.300]  individual with individual rights and individual decision-making processes because you are a part
[3:26:57.300 --> 3:27:02.420]  of a collective and we've seen the last 100 years of global elite documents especially going back
[3:27:02.420 --> 3:27:07.220]  to things like freed off coprest turning point which i've covered especially going back to Arthur
[3:27:07.220 --> 3:27:11.780]  Kessler's goes in the machine which i've covered a big part of the argumentation of those books
[3:27:11.780 --> 3:27:16.740]  all the sucks these books as well is that the problem for modernity will be the individual
[3:27:16.740 --> 3:27:22.820]  and the notion that the individual has rights that supersede or cannot be trounced upon by the
[3:27:22.820 --> 3:27:29.060]  collective this is crucial that all these documents say that and the argument is they that they say
[3:27:29.060 --> 3:27:35.060]  the bad argument the fallacy is that well because you can now make decisions as an individual which
[3:27:35.060 --> 3:27:41.780]  hurt everyone in other words what we've seen in the last two years you no longer have the previous
[3:27:41.780 --> 3:27:48.580]  rights that you had medical rights free speech rights because you're very breathing can actually
[3:27:48.580 --> 3:27:55.220]  infect and toxify and kill everyone else so you see now under the under the pecs all the
[3:27:55.220 --> 3:28:02.100]  coup in nonsense they will have the argumentation and the the bases to argue that individuals
[3:28:02.100 --> 3:28:08.500]  can no longer have the rights that they've had for the last 100 years 200 500 years or whatever
[3:28:08.500 --> 3:28:15.460]  because of the fact that individuals now are walking basically by a warfare agents right
[3:28:15.460 --> 3:28:19.540]  because you can just mutate and produce anything this is all nonsense it's all baloney it's all
[3:28:19.540 --> 3:28:25.620]  made up it's a selling it's a sales pitch for a long-term transhumanist goal and this document
[3:28:25.620 --> 3:28:30.500]  says that the transhumanist goal is to lock everybody into a global brain so if you survive
[3:28:30.500 --> 3:28:34.980]  the next 10 years then you're going to be locked into the global brain that's that's the end goal
[3:28:35.540 --> 3:28:42.020]  and this document goes wild it goes into stabbies it goes into biotech it goes into
[3:28:42.020 --> 3:28:47.220]  genetically modified humans it goes into everything that is supposedly non-made up
[3:28:47.220 --> 3:28:52.420]  conspiracy temple hat stuff all admitted in real don't go anywhere stay where you are this is jdr

[3:32:32.420 --> 3:32:36.660]  on air plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock
[3:32:36.660 --> 3:32:43.060]  50 off x2 and winter sun both of these are on our top five bestsellers they are so good for your
[3:32:43.060 --> 3:32:47.620]  body and if there's two things you do for your body it's these two products they're all back in
[3:32:47.620 --> 3:32:52.820]  stock at info wars store dot com 50 off and it keeps us on the air only way we fail is if you
[3:32:52.820 --> 3:33:02.820]  don't take action leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:12.740 --> 3:33:17.060]  welcome back to the show i'm your guest host j dire james nelson's we're covering the
[3:33:17.060 --> 3:33:23.780]  official uk ministry of defense and german government document about human augmentation
[3:33:23.780 --> 3:33:30.980]  and the plans for the next 30 years up to 2050 the document goes on to say that this age is known
[3:33:30.980 --> 3:33:37.060]  as the information age and we'll be giving way to the next age the next aion which is covered in
[3:33:37.060 --> 3:33:42.180]  claus's books which we've covered many times here on the fourth hour and on my channel many many
[3:33:42.180 --> 3:33:48.900]  videos the fourth industrial revolution the next age is the biotech age and the fascinating thing
[3:33:48.900 --> 3:33:56.500]  about the biotech age is that they note that the human body itself will be the focus because it will
[3:33:56.500 --> 3:34:05.700]  be the new security state focus in other words the human body itself will become the platform for
[3:34:05.700 --> 3:34:12.980]  either putting out the message and being integrated into the global brain system or it will be a
[3:34:12.980 --> 3:34:20.100]  rogue virus itself you see all of this virus stuff is about making the human body and humans as
[3:34:20.100 --> 3:34:26.980]  individuals viruses that's why it fits so well into the green climate depopulation agenda the
[3:34:26.980 --> 3:34:33.380]  documents actually say this and so it points out that in the coming biotech age anybody not integrated
[3:34:33.380 --> 3:34:38.020]  into the global brain system will have to be seen as one of these sort of rogue virus agents
[3:34:38.020 --> 3:34:45.060]  themselves because they become the potential for either being what the nato cognitive warfare
[3:34:45.060 --> 3:34:51.380]  document calls a threat or what this document calls a health threat because they're not integrated
[3:34:51.380 --> 3:34:56.020]  into the system and we can already see that with what they're doing with the vaccine passports
[3:34:56.020 --> 3:35:02.580]  with the the stabs all of this stuff in the last two years is preparing us for this as the next
[3:35:02.580 --> 3:35:07.540]  20 years this is the next phase is to bring in this stuff and it says we've already the document
[3:35:07.540 --> 3:35:12.260]  says we've already seen this by the fact that the air force for example is already beginning
[3:35:12.260 --> 3:35:20.580]  to move to a completely unmanned aerial vehicles the AI is now replacing the soldiers and what
[3:35:20.580 --> 3:35:25.220]  not in the air force and in the military and in the future that what's done in the military is
[3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:30.260]  really just a test bed for what the then they then roll out on the society the future will be about
[3:35:30.260 --> 3:35:35.620]  human brain interfaces and how if you do not go along with the system you will be locked out of
[3:35:35.620 --> 3:35:41.860]  the system so the system will all be based in this Borg hive mind right think of Borg think of
[3:35:41.860 --> 3:35:49.780]  Star Trek right that's what they really want to do okay they say that anything that's disruptive
[3:35:49.780 --> 3:35:56.180]  technology will have to be controlled by the system because again of the possibility for
[3:35:56.180 --> 3:36:02.980]  a rogue agents or individual actors being able to use this technology and that the rise of
[3:36:02.980 --> 3:36:08.740]  the machines is inevitable and the future will be one where battles are fought through
[3:36:08.740 --> 3:36:14.820]  psycho cyber warfare psycho cyber warfare it's not really about the battlefield anymore it's all
[3:36:14.820 --> 3:36:20.180]  going to be the online cyber battle and I did a whole talk if you remember on cyber polygon
[3:36:20.180 --> 3:36:24.980]  where I went through the whole exercise and we looked at how we were already being set up for
[3:36:24.980 --> 3:36:31.780]  the next pandemic which clouse says will be a cyber pandemic that will dwarf what we saw with
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:40.260]  the covid the document goes on to say that warfare r&d and warfare is key to figuring out the
[3:36:40.260 --> 3:36:48.260]  technologies using warfare as a experiment as a science lab basically world as laboratory
[3:36:48.260 --> 3:36:54.260]  to then figure out the ways to put that on to the domestic population this is always what warfare
[3:36:54.260 --> 3:36:59.860]  is about in terms of the modern world is figuring out and tweaking and testing things that are then
[3:36:59.860 --> 3:37:04.020]  put upon the domestic population because it's the same power structure that has pretty much run
[3:37:04.020 --> 3:37:09.140]  the western world for the last 100 years and they have the same malthusian dystopian technocratic
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:13.700]  view and attitude that we are seeing unfolding before our eyes it's in all of their books
[3:37:14.660 --> 3:37:20.020]  and it notes on page 22 that this is an elite plan the elites will be putting a lot of money
[3:37:20.020 --> 3:37:25.860]  into this and they will be fostering and funding synthetic biology we saw clouse talk about synthetic
[3:37:25.860 --> 3:37:31.940]  biology I will get inside of you we will change you we will get in you and I know that some of
[3:37:31.940 --> 3:37:35.460]  you probably find clouse very attractive you probably want to be intimate with him in that
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:40.180]  way but I don't I don't not want to be into I don't want clouse in me okay I don't think he's
[3:37:40.180 --> 3:37:47.700]  that hot elites and body modification and even plastic surgery have paved the way for the future
[3:37:47.700 --> 3:37:53.460]  of human augmentation and bodily modification so body mod and I'm not knocking people to get tattoos
[3:37:53.460 --> 3:37:58.420]  or whatever they want to do the point is that from an overall vantage point that was all
[3:37:58.420 --> 3:38:06.020]  part of prepping people to accept technological modifications to their body as hip as cool and
[3:38:06.020 --> 3:38:09.940]  all this kind of stuff and it's not about any of that right you may have had your own private
[3:38:09.940 --> 3:38:16.500]  personal motives for body mods and all this kind of stuff but the long-term goal is to condition
[3:38:16.500 --> 3:38:22.180]  people to accept the chips and it doesn't have to be an actual microchip it can be nanotech it
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:27.140]  can be all the it could be what's in the stabbies now we don't even know right but another key thing
[3:38:27.140 --> 3:38:32.660]  I noticed in this document was that one thing that the document says will be needed for the next
[3:38:32.660 --> 3:38:39.460]  few decades to bring this system into place fully will be the collection of mass data big data
[3:38:40.820 --> 3:38:46.260]  how does big data play a role well big data plays a role because the mass info allows for them to
[3:38:46.260 --> 3:38:51.140]  figure out how to tweak the system what works and what doesn't work and to basically experiment on
[3:38:51.140 --> 3:38:56.900]  everybody in the world the world as laboratory that's a famous book pointing out the scientism
[3:38:56.900 --> 3:39:03.460]  attitude of using and collecting information in all of these arenas and all these domains to come
[3:39:03.460 --> 3:39:10.100]  up with the best way to steer and control the system so mastering the human genome is part of
[3:39:10.100 --> 3:39:15.140]  that older pentagon plan mastering the human domain if you remember that was the guy was
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:19.220]  air force documents that came out some years ago around the time of jade hillan they said oh yes we
[3:39:19.220 --> 3:39:23.700]  have all these plans and we call it mastering the human domain just like they have owning the
[3:39:23.700 --> 3:39:29.700]  weather 2025 air force document right just like they have plans to make the entire air force
[3:39:29.700 --> 3:39:35.460]  drones and ai mastering the human full spectrum dominance full spectrum is everything including
[3:39:35.460 --> 3:39:40.180]  your biology and that's why claus says that's sort of the last frontier the final frontier
[3:39:40.180 --> 3:39:45.620]  remember that movie inner space was it martin short right little bitty tiny martin short inside
[3:39:45.620 --> 3:39:56.900]  your body a little bitty tiny claus swap that was a little tiny claus right the normal claus would
[3:39:56.900 --> 3:40:07.220]  have a more baritone we will change all biology from the inside out so ai total tracking is necessary
[3:40:07.220 --> 3:40:12.340]  not just to keep up with everything in real time and to know what you're up to and to you know put
[3:40:12.340 --> 3:40:20.020]  you into the the database but to take all of the data to figure out in what way they can claim
[3:40:20.020 --> 3:40:26.020]  that you are using too many resources and it even mentions the wearables and how the wearables like
[3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:30.740]  the fitbit and all this kind of stuff and the cell phones and all of that we're based cell
[3:40:30.740 --> 3:40:35.380]  phones are basically wearables anyway right we're all we always have them so the point is that that
[3:40:35.380 --> 3:40:43.380]  data is used to figure out ways to run the giant carbon scam that's coming right the lockdowns all
[3:40:43.380 --> 3:40:49.380]  that stuff was about oh we need climate lockdowns you see and so this is all just a selling point a
[3:40:49.380 --> 3:40:56.820]  sales pitch to say people who don't go along are the cause of all of the problems right they're
[3:40:56.820 --> 3:41:01.140]  the ones that are making everyone sick they're the ones that are using too many resources
[3:41:01.140 --> 3:41:06.180]  and so the document literally says that if you don't go along that the people that aren't genetically
[3:41:06.180 --> 3:41:12.580]  modified that aren't fixed when they don't fix the DNA as we just heard the CEOs and executives
[3:41:12.580 --> 3:41:16.820]  of various pharmaceutical companies saying in the last few weeks and even going back a few years
[3:41:16.820 --> 3:41:23.060]  that they would blow up the existing system to in to enact this new system the GMO genetic human
[3:41:23.060 --> 3:41:28.660]  modification creatures that they're going that they want to produce well it says that these
[3:41:28.660 --> 3:41:34.660]  will become either weaponized human beings that are genetically modified or the fixed people so
[3:41:34.660 --> 3:41:40.340]  they can do both and even warns of that that this could all be weaponized I mean page 29 is amazing
[3:41:40.340 --> 3:41:44.260]  because it actually sounds like the very thing that's been going on in the last two years they
[3:41:44.260 --> 3:41:49.700]  don't call they don't talk about anything to do with you know the big pharmaceutical companies
[3:41:49.700 --> 3:41:53.860]  per se but they mentioned the CRISPR editing they mentioned the possibility of genetic modification
[3:41:53.860 --> 3:42:00.260]  of humans changing the human genome through these technologies and that when these gene therapies
[3:42:00.260 --> 3:42:06.020]  are unleashed it could have positive or negative consequences that's page 29 and we just have to
[3:42:06.020 --> 3:42:10.740]  collect all the data to see which works which things works and which which which don't and then
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:16.420]  we'll know how to fix everything that's the very thing that who was it the Pfizer CEO was saying
[3:42:16.420 --> 3:42:21.860]  like two days ago the Alex just played the clip oh now the the human immune systems are gone
[3:42:21.860 --> 3:42:26.900]  now we'll fix it with the next booster right the next stabby
[3:42:29.700 --> 3:42:34.660]  then it goes on to talk about um the fact that we will eventually have this embedded in our
[3:42:34.660 --> 3:42:39.620]  brains and and so all of what's happening now is again remember to get us to this point to
[3:42:39.620 --> 3:42:45.380]  sell people on the automation on the toxic nature of humans in general supposedly how everybody
[3:42:45.380 --> 3:42:50.340]  needs to go away and then we had need to have all this stuck into our bodies to fix us it's all
[3:42:50.340 --> 3:42:55.060]  about fixing us don't go anywhere this is Jay's analysis i'm hosting the Alex Jones Christmas

[3:45:05.700 --> 3:45:09.860]  their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves now their world government their
[3:45:09.860 --> 3:45:15.140]  permanent martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has
[3:45:15.140 --> 3:45:20.180]  been exposed but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet

[3:47:02.980 --> 3:47:14.100]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host jay dyer jays analysis
[3:47:14.900 --> 3:47:20.420]  if you'd like to read about the topics that i'm discussing that i wrote about five six ten
[3:47:20.420 --> 3:47:25.940]  years ago you can get my two books esoteric hollywood one and two at my website sign copies in the
[3:47:25.940 --> 3:47:31.220]  shop that those have collectively about a thousand almost five star reviews across amazon and various
[3:47:31.220 --> 3:47:38.100]  platforms so those books have proven to be quite prophetic especially given the fact that many films
[3:47:38.100 --> 3:47:42.660]  kind of prepared us for the world that we're entering and we learn we come to find out that
[3:47:42.660 --> 3:47:47.860]  no actually science fiction has had a key role especially hollywood in preparing us for the
[3:47:47.860 --> 3:47:54.740]  world that these psychos want to bring to reality now we were talking about brain control mind
[3:47:54.740 --> 3:48:00.740]  control and how this document goes into the history of electroshock neuro stimulation how a lot of
[3:48:00.740 --> 3:48:09.380]  the mk ultra research literally went directly into human augmentation human mk uh search mk
[3:48:09.380 --> 3:48:16.340]  delta projects related to basically seeing how they could fix man and the idea that we need to
[3:48:16.340 --> 3:48:22.260]  fix man is based on the notion that man is really just a bag of molecules right he's just he's just
[3:48:22.260 --> 3:48:27.060]  a meat sack but he's a meat sack that could be turned into basically a walking modem or
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:32.580]  router potentially and because he gives off signals and brain signals brain waves and he's a sort of
[3:48:32.580 --> 3:48:38.740]  electromagnetic being electromagnetic being excuse me that means that humans could be tweaked to become
[3:48:38.740 --> 3:48:45.780]  part of a big organism hive mind or they can be depopulated if they don't go along and so
[3:48:45.780 --> 3:48:51.220]  i'm just amazed that the document mentions on page 33 that this technology could either be
[3:48:51.220 --> 3:48:57.780]  positive or it can be weaponized now remember the it even says that pharmaceutical corporations
[3:48:57.780 --> 3:49:01.780]  have played a key role in this because they were the ones that developed a lot of the brain
[3:49:01.780 --> 3:49:09.460]  altering technology through chemical studies through entheogens and through lsd so the studies
[3:49:09.460 --> 3:49:13.380]  in the pharmaceutical company sandals pharmaceuticals have developed things like lsd
[3:49:13.380 --> 3:49:21.620]  that was a key way to study and see how the psyche of man would adapt to and react to various
[3:49:21.620 --> 3:49:26.580]  chemicals and that's why it ties into putting the electrodes into the brain experimentation with
[3:49:26.580 --> 3:49:34.660]  the microchips back again 50 60 years ago and now it has become the idea that in the near future
[3:49:34.660 --> 3:49:40.900]  they're going to literally have human brain computer brain interfaces that will allow for the
[3:49:40.900 --> 3:49:47.460]  for the transmission and download of data that's two way and it even mentions that oh you know like
[3:49:47.460 --> 3:49:52.340]  an iron man right remember an iron man how he's got an exoskeleton and he can fly around it's so
[3:49:52.340 --> 3:49:57.780]  cool and it's they literally try to sell it like it's some kind of marvel movie right there you see
[3:49:57.780 --> 3:50:02.980]  the guy in the middle there like like a transformer or something right like and then it goes on to
[3:50:02.980 --> 3:50:07.860]  talk about how the metaverse and virtual reality will play into this because there's going to be a
[3:50:07.860 --> 3:50:14.340]  linked technology what are linked technologies linked technologies are what they call nbic which
[3:50:14.340 --> 3:50:19.940]  is nanotech biotech infotech and cognitive science all of these three to get four together
[3:50:19.940 --> 3:50:25.140]  nbic will all link together and remember at the end of claus's book what did he say in the last
[3:50:25.140 --> 3:50:31.220]  section of fourth industrial revolution he says that the sky net technology that's up in the sky
[3:50:31.220 --> 3:50:38.580]  that with the satellites will link to the humans on the ground who are chipped and or nanotech and
[3:50:38.580 --> 3:50:44.580]  they will link to the internet of things which is everywhere everything will be basically sprayed
[3:50:44.580 --> 3:50:49.700]  with some kind of nanotech so that everything is tracked and traced in real time and it's going
[3:50:49.700 --> 3:50:54.660]  to be a lot of fun because you also have your little metaverse coom pod where you can put the
[3:50:54.660 --> 3:51:00.820]  goggles on or you can lay in your pod and you know just blast your mind on horn all day so you're
[3:51:00.820 --> 3:51:05.300]  going to love it because you get a basic income if you do that you see but oh you should also if
[3:51:05.300 --> 3:51:11.540]  you want all that you're going to have to get sterilized you see and then it goes on amazingly
[3:51:11.540 --> 3:51:18.100]  to discuss the moral obligation that the governments have to do this and it says look everything's
[3:51:18.100 --> 3:51:25.300]  evolving and morals evolve and since everything evolves laws evolve and so you're just going to
[3:51:25.300 --> 3:51:32.180]  have to adapt to the fact that it's an obligation to morally genetically mutate humans and the
[3:51:32.180 --> 3:51:35.780]  reasoning is just like in the cold war when they had the reasoning about oh well the soviets are
[3:51:35.780 --> 3:51:39.300]  going to do it so we got to do everything nefarious because if we don't the soviets will and they'll
[3:51:39.300 --> 3:51:44.900]  have the advantage it's the same stupid fallacy where they say if the government if the global
[3:51:44.900 --> 3:51:51.060]  government does it augment and ship everyone then nefarious individual actors are going to do it i
[3:51:51.060 --> 3:51:54.740]  mean it's just that ridiculous right and so they say we have a moral obligation to do it now the
[3:51:54.740 --> 3:51:59.380]  document doesn't talk about morals or explain why or what the justification for morals are
[3:52:00.260 --> 3:52:06.500]  because remember the last i don't know 50 60 100 years in the world of academia almost the entire
[3:52:06.500 --> 3:52:12.020]  world has promoted from that from the scholastic academic realm the notion of moral relativism
[3:52:12.020 --> 3:52:17.700]  there are no morals no obligations it's all relative bro it's all a social construct dude
[3:52:18.340 --> 3:52:22.820]  what's true for you is true for you man you can't bind me to anything even though that statement
[3:52:22.820 --> 3:52:28.020]  itself is a an attempt to bind people to a moral obligation that you have to submit to
[3:52:28.020 --> 3:52:33.860]  relativism in the same way this document it says oh but now there's an ethical obligation
[3:52:33.860 --> 3:52:36.980]  why is there an ethical obligation if everything's relative everything's evolving there's no such
[3:52:36.980 --> 3:52:42.180]  thing as obligations when things are evolving well that's because they use double think if
[3:52:42.180 --> 3:52:45.540]  you read or well you know what double think is that's a contradiction at a fundamental level
[3:52:45.540 --> 3:52:53.060]  and it says moral obligations are such that now governments will have the mandate and necessity
[3:52:53.060 --> 3:52:59.060]  to microchip and to alter into gmo humans to mutate them into franken humans because if they
[3:52:59.060 --> 3:53:05.620]  don't other people will and it's just the way it is get used to it we've evolved by the way it's
[3:53:05.620 --> 3:53:11.300]  all premised on everything just evolving if everything is constantly evolving then the idea
[3:53:11.300 --> 3:53:16.660]  that everything is evolving is also evolving and that's self-reputing you see how silly that is
[3:53:16.660 --> 3:53:21.220]  but in other words i'm just pointing out the document is based on the older malthusian eugenics
[3:53:21.220 --> 3:53:27.700]  ideas it's based on dysgenics ideas and it even says on page 47 we're going to have to just get
[3:53:27.700 --> 3:53:33.140]  away from the notion of family and kinfolk so there's no obligation to family and kinfolk
[3:53:33.140 --> 3:53:36.820]  that's what the document says right there we're going to have to get away from this idea but
[3:53:36.820 --> 3:53:40.980]  there is an obligation to submit to the global government who has the moral obligation to chip
[3:53:40.980 --> 3:53:47.940]  you i mean this is all just contradictions just nonsense and it goes on to say that there will
[3:53:47.940 --> 3:53:52.740]  be international legal problems you're going to be legalities involved in this because presently
[3:53:52.740 --> 3:53:58.180]  40 some nations forbid human cloning and human genetic modification even though now the us is
[3:53:58.180 --> 3:54:03.860]  beginning of the cave on these experiments right uh there was what just this year the the legislation
[3:54:03.860 --> 3:54:10.100]  passed about cloning and then it notes well look they're going to have to the people that will pass
[3:54:10.100 --> 3:54:15.940]  this the stuff off will have to appeal to the way it works in the military and since a lot of this
[3:54:15.940 --> 3:54:19.460]  stuff goes on the military and because law has evolved well we're just going to have to do it
[3:54:20.020 --> 3:54:26.580]  and it says that the way to do this is to convince ethics boards and people who object to these things
[3:54:26.580 --> 3:54:31.300]  that they need to default to the experts that's literally what it says page 54 just convince
[3:54:31.300 --> 3:54:36.900]  them to listen to the law experts who are the experts oh it's just whoever repeats what the
[3:54:36.900 --> 3:54:42.260]  self-appointed experts say that's what an expert is get nothing to do with the science nothing to do
[3:54:42.260 --> 3:54:49.540]  with actual ethics nothing to do with objective truth it's just what experts decree just arbitrarily
[3:54:49.540 --> 3:54:54.340]  ad hoc and the document actually says they're just going to pass the experts and the experts will
[3:54:54.340 --> 3:55:00.100]  convince the both ethics boards and all these people to just do the new updated thing oh now
[3:55:00.100 --> 3:55:05.860]  it is okay to do this now we can mandate this so in other words the the last two years of
[3:55:05.860 --> 3:55:12.740]  forcibly doing the stabbies is just to prepare for in the next 10 years or 20 years forcibly
[3:55:12.740 --> 3:55:19.940]  doing the microchips you have to it's part of what's necessary we have to do it to save and fix man
[3:55:21.220 --> 3:55:28.180]  it even says on page 58 that it's kind of sort of amazing section of honesty well it might even
[3:55:28.180 --> 3:55:33.220]  be an elite overclass that gets all this technology and uses it in an unfair way who knows we don't
[3:55:33.220 --> 3:55:39.540]  know and then it makes the the most shocking claim which is that because this life extension
[3:55:39.540 --> 3:55:45.380]  technology might get out to the public what we're going to have to do is cut it off and we're going
[3:55:45.380 --> 3:55:50.100]  to have to have some kind of way it doesn't say death panels but it basically is intimating that
[3:55:50.100 --> 3:55:56.020]  because it says that when the youth in the next two decades realize that people living longer is
[3:55:56.020 --> 3:56:01.380]  using up the resources and putting a stress on the social system and on the medical system
[3:56:01.380 --> 3:56:05.620]  they'll be much more amenable perhaps to something like death panels so you know kill
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:09.460]  granny and you'll have more jobs right remember that quote we're not supposed to talk about the
[3:56:09.460 --> 3:56:15.460]  death panel so that's not a conversation supposed to have well that's literally on page 59 just
[3:56:15.460 --> 3:56:20.740]  convince the younger people that they get more stuff or get more junk about killing my grandma
[3:56:21.540 --> 3:56:28.500]  that's what it says right kill granny get more jobs get more stuff so then it says that the
[3:56:28.500 --> 3:56:33.540]  implantable chips are already being used and the implantable chips will eventually become a global
[3:56:33.540 --> 3:56:40.660]  mandate the life sciences are now part of the security state you no longer have a right to
[3:56:40.660 --> 3:56:46.580]  your individual person and medical freedom because that is what is the main barrier to
[3:56:46.580 --> 3:56:52.420]  the depop agenda the whole thing is just about depop and not just getting rid of most people but
[3:56:52.420 --> 3:56:58.020]  then moving on to the technology that the elites think that they will have in order to become
[3:56:58.020 --> 3:57:02.420]  super soldiers super humans that's what this document says the whole document is about that
[3:57:02.980 --> 3:57:08.900]  and it's about how to sell it and uh i'm coming to the end here but it even goes into how to
[3:57:08.900 --> 3:57:13.540]  promote this and discuss this in the various sectors and areas of society how to get religions to
[3:57:13.540 --> 3:57:19.060]  promote transhumanist ideas how to get education how to get government how to get geopolitics
[3:57:19.060 --> 3:57:25.700]  all of these arenas to promote this idea because this is ultimately that satanic mimic plan of god's
[3:57:25.700 --> 3:57:32.660]  plan to sell everybody on this beast system so if you want documented objective proof you look you
[3:57:32.660 --> 3:57:36.660]  need to look no further than this document which says that that's what's coming in the next 20 to
[3:57:36.660 --> 3:57:42.740]  30 years a global microchip population this is jdrb's analysis be sure and go to the info
[3:57:42.740 --> 3:57:50.260]  war store and support the info war three very important lifesaving words vitamins minerals
[3:57:50.260 --> 3:57:58.100]  amino acids and you find them all in vitamin mineral fusion all the essential vitamins all
[3:57:58.100 --> 3:58:04.420]  the essential minerals from really good high quality absorbable sources and a bunch of key

[3:58:44.180 --> 3:58:48.740]  why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists take you so much why do they hate
[3:58:48.740 --> 3:58:56.820]  america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing
[3:58:56.820 --> 3:59:02.260]  cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government their anti-human
[3:59:02.260 --> 3:59:09.060]  post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process injustice and god
[3:59:09.060 --> 3:59:15.860]  fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates you didn't start a fight
[3:59:15.860 --> 3:59:22.420]  with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started a fight with you and
[3:59:22.420 --> 3:59:27.780]  they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going to ever stop their
[3:59:27.780 --> 3:59:33.300]  attacks until they have the fear of god put into them the average person still doesn't even know
[3:59:33.300 --> 3:59:38.180]  about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's not until
[3:59:38.180 --> 3:59:42.900]  people understand that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating these people
[3:59:42.900 --> 4:00:04.660]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
