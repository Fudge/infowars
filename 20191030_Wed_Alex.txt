[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:28.820]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:28.820 --> 00:38.100]  I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing climate change.
[00:38.100 --> 00:42.980]  We are in the midst of climate change right now and it is only going to get worse.
[00:42.980 --> 00:46.260]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:46.260 --> 00:51.460]  The scientists also tell us have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[00:51.460 --> 00:54.100]  12 years within which to ask.
[00:54.100 --> 00:57.140]  Like this is the war, this is our world war two.
[00:57.140 --> 00:59.860]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[00:59.860 --> 01:04.580]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.
[01:04.580 --> 01:06.180]  10 years that we have left to us.
[01:06.180 --> 01:12.020]  Within the 10 years that we have left to us, we don't have more than 10 years to get this right.
[01:12.020 --> 01:14.420]  A little more than 10 years from now.
[01:14.420 --> 01:18.420]  There is no justice and there is no combatting climate change
[01:18.420 --> 01:21.780]  without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities.
[01:21.780 --> 01:26.420]  I speak to you as a human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood
[01:26.420 --> 01:30.820]  now taste bitter-sweet because of what I know about our children's future.
[01:30.820 --> 01:35.700]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[01:35.700 --> 01:37.380]  This is about our lives.
[01:37.380 --> 01:39.060]  This is about American lives.
[01:39.060 --> 01:44.340]  That our community will be uninhabitable, not sustain human life along this current trajectory.
[01:44.340 --> 01:46.980]  I am here to say our house is on fire.
[01:46.980 --> 01:50.180]  A crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction.
[01:50.180 --> 01:53.620]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[01:53.620 --> 01:55.140]  People are dying.
[01:55.140 --> 01:56.980]  People are suffering.
[01:56.980 --> 01:58.820]  People are dying.
[01:58.820 --> 01:59.700]  How dare you?
[02:12.660 --> 02:21.860]  Meanwhile, Obama has bought a $14 million house in Martha's Vineyard right on the water,
[02:21.860 --> 02:30.820]  ladies and gentlemen, but they're telling you that the world is going to end.
[02:32.660 --> 02:36.180]  And they're also telling you that we're on the verge of a global race war
[02:36.180 --> 02:40.820]  because white people are inherently evil and bad,
[02:40.820 --> 02:47.700]  but everyone's trying to get into countries founded and that were run by the dreaded white people.
[02:49.060 --> 02:50.100]  Very interesting.
[02:50.100 --> 02:54.980]  In fact, here's Obama telling us that wokeness is not activism,
[02:54.980 --> 02:58.100]  and then maybe he hasn't heard what his wife's out doing,
[02:58.100 --> 03:01.460]  spewing some of the biggest black KKK stuff you've ever heard.
[03:03.460 --> 03:07.060]  You know, this idea of purity and you're never compromised
[03:07.060 --> 03:10.340]  and you're always politically woke and all that stuff.
[03:10.340 --> 03:12.740]  You should get over that quickly.
[03:12.740 --> 03:14.740]  The world is messy.
[03:14.740 --> 03:26.100]  They're ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.
[03:26.100 --> 03:31.460]  Like if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right
[03:31.460 --> 03:37.780]  or used the word wrong verb or then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself
[03:37.780 --> 03:39.380]  because man, you see how woke I was.
[03:39.380 --> 03:40.180]  I called you out.
[03:40.180 --> 03:48.580]  I'm going to get on TV, watch my show, watch Gronich.
[03:52.420 --> 03:58.740]  You know, that's not activism. That's not bringing about change.
[03:59.460 --> 04:04.340]  You know, I want to remind white folks that y'all were running from us,
[04:04.340 --> 04:11.860]  you know, because this family, this family with all the values that you read about,
[04:12.900 --> 04:19.060]  you were running from us and you still running because we're no different than the immigrant
[04:19.060 --> 04:24.820]  families that are moving in the families in Pilsen, the families that are coming from other places
[04:24.820 --> 04:33.940]  to try to do better, but because we can so easily wash over who we really were because of the
[04:33.940 --> 04:41.940]  color of our skin, you know, because of the texture of our hair, you know, that's what divides
[04:41.940 --> 04:47.620]  countries. Artificial things that don't... Artificial borders divides countries.
[04:47.620 --> 04:51.140]  You know, you're bringing leftists in from all over the world with no skills and treating them
[04:51.140 --> 04:55.620]  to hate America and putting them on welfare to control them. That's the truth, Michelle.
[04:55.620 --> 05:02.100]  That's what you're pushing is a anti-white, anti-American agenda and everybody knows
[05:02.100 --> 05:06.260]  what you're up to, you evil witch, unbelievable fraud.
[05:09.060 --> 05:13.540]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:13.540 --> 05:17.860]  I don't care what your views are. I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen
[05:17.860 --> 05:22.100]  and debate them. That's important, but we have something in common. We have a set of values
[05:22.100 --> 05:27.060]  that are at the core of this country that hold this place together. Clinton, deep state bag man,
[05:27.060 --> 05:32.100]  Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress in the world.
[05:32.100 --> 05:37.860]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[05:37.860 --> 05:44.100]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him. From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[05:46.820 --> 05:52.980]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand. Not so fast, criminal. We're going
[05:52.980 --> 05:57.540]  to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well because if we don't,
[05:57.540 --> 06:02.660]  you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy. But the American people know how
[06:02.660 --> 06:24.100]  much you hate us and we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com, and band off video.
[06:32.660 --> 06:51.140]  Jones. Well, Kanye West is on fire. On fire for Jesus. And I said on the show, we're trying
[06:51.140 --> 07:00.820]  to find it, but I said it a lot on TI's podcast a month ago. And I said it on this show about
[07:00.820 --> 07:06.660]  three weeks ago, again two weeks ago, repeatedly, you all heard me, many of you. I said if Kanye
[07:06.660 --> 07:12.820]  West is for real, he will come out against black genocide and the fact that Planned Parenthood
[07:12.820 --> 07:21.460]  is set up, was set up to exterminate black people and called them human weeds. And I said, hey,
[07:21.460 --> 07:26.660]  he's already doing a lot of good. And just because somebody's been worldly and, you know, had rap
[07:26.660 --> 07:32.180]  songs, you know, about I want to have a threesome with my girlfriend and my blunt big deal. None
[07:32.180 --> 07:40.740]  of us are perfect. What matters is what your heart stands for. Well, he came out. We're going to cover
[07:40.740 --> 07:46.340]  this next segment. He came out and he said there's an extermination plan against black people.
[07:46.340 --> 07:52.580]  Well, let me tell you, if you're controlled opposition, you don't talk like that.
[07:52.580 --> 08:03.460]  And that shatters the race pimping by monsters literally on the payroll of the people that run
[08:03.460 --> 08:08.900]  the KKK, Michelle Obama. By the way, I'm not sad to be shocking. Michelle Obama knows what she's
[08:08.900 --> 08:15.300]  doing. These are some evil, evil, evil, evil, evil people. If you go back to
[08:17.540 --> 08:21.300]  John D. Rockefeller the first, you go back to Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood,
[08:21.300 --> 08:25.860]  their letters, the Colgate family and others are public.
[08:28.020 --> 08:33.860]  In major universities, just type in Margaret Sanger's letters and she was given billions of
[08:33.860 --> 08:42.260]  dollars, billions back then. That'd be hundreds of billions today to buy off all the black leaders
[08:42.260 --> 08:46.820]  in the black colleges that Christians had set up. They hijacked them. And man, what you see that's
[08:46.820 --> 08:53.860]  been none of the black people is the plan for everybody. So you can look at the mess the black
[08:53.860 --> 08:57.780]  community's in and be threatened by it and be angry at it and hear the black folks saying racist
[08:57.780 --> 09:02.740]  things to you because they're brainwashed and get mad at them. But how about we're smart enough to
[09:02.740 --> 09:08.900]  really know the full game plan and not buy into this race war crap? How about we do that? Because
[09:08.900 --> 09:18.340]  the whole thing is a setup. Yeah, mercy, death, even kill black babies after they're born, ladies
[09:18.340 --> 09:24.340]  and gentlemen, are you going to sign on to that? When I was on with TI, he didn't want to talk about
[09:24.340 --> 09:33.620]  that. I'm not going to put TI down. He had courage to have me on. But he's not Alex Jones woke.
[09:33.620 --> 09:43.220]  Kanye West is Alex Jones woke now. Once you get woke like that, there's no going back.
[09:43.220 --> 09:48.900]  By the way, people say what level woke are you? You know, these leftist brainwashed people that
[09:48.900 --> 09:53.700]  spew all this garbage, they're the most unawake people. They're the most asleep people on earth.
[09:53.700 --> 09:59.860]  But once you get the big agenda, everybody's on the same level because you're seeing the same
[09:59.860 --> 10:04.820]  thing. People say, how does Trump say the same thing you say like an hour later? And how? I mean,
[10:04.820 --> 10:09.540]  exactly the New York Times call up and they've been on, you tweeted this five minutes for a speech,
[10:09.540 --> 10:12.740]  and then he said exactly what you said he'd say during the speech. And I said, where's
[10:12.740 --> 10:17.780]  the impotico? And that globalist looks at me and he just shook his head because they know how stuff
[10:17.780 --> 10:25.780]  works. They're mad that we've got a sixth sense way more powerful than them. Because when you
[10:25.780 --> 10:30.740]  serve evil, you lose the gifts God's given you. You get Satan's little twisted gifts, but you lose
[10:30.740 --> 10:38.260]  the literal superpowers that God's given us. And by the way, we're all created equal in God's eyes.
[10:38.260 --> 10:42.980]  I agree with the Declaration of Independence, but we're not all equal in our skills and what gifts
[10:42.980 --> 10:55.860]  we were given. I don't have the gift of being a long distance runner. But I do have the gift of
[10:55.860 --> 11:00.500]  fortitude and focus and the gifts that nobody's ever knocked me out, including getting hit in the
[11:00.500 --> 11:06.980]  head with a lead pipe ax handles, you name it. So we've all got different gifts, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:06.980 --> 11:17.060]  And so we need to think about those gifts and think about who wants to steal those gifts
[11:17.060 --> 11:21.060]  and turn those gifts towards his own wicked plans. We're going to talk about
[11:23.060 --> 11:28.660]  the real rabbit hole next segment and play some of these clips from Kanye and then that wicked
[11:28.660 --> 11:39.140]  devil Michelle Obama, that linebacker of a wife. It's got that big roll of silver dollars in her
[11:39.140 --> 11:50.500]  pants. We're going to be talking about Mrs. Wokey Woke on the other side. And the folks, the men and
[11:50.500 --> 11:57.860]  women on the payroll, and they got a job to do it. Boy, they did a good job on the black people,
[11:57.860 --> 12:01.540]  didn't they? They're doing a good job on everybody else too, and they're doing the same job.
[12:03.620 --> 12:08.820]  We're going to talk about how to get out of that system, get off the mental plantation,
[12:09.460 --> 12:16.180]  get off the mental reservation, and really get down to brass tax about how the world really
[12:16.180 --> 12:21.620]  works and how God's got a big garden. And there's all these humans and all these animals and all
[12:21.620 --> 12:28.900]  these creatures that live on this garden, this planet. We've all got our skills, we've all got our
[12:28.900 --> 12:39.460]  gifts, and then we form a team that we're all equal created by God, but that equalness is not
[12:39.460 --> 12:48.580]  distributed the same way with each person. And the entire globalist plan is about stunting you
[12:48.580 --> 12:54.660]  and dumbing you down and keeping you from embracing and grasping your real potential.
[12:58.900 --> 13:04.340]  We're going to lay it all out today. And we have some special guests joining us. I'll tell you
[13:04.340 --> 13:11.540]  about a little bit later. Got an international TV crew here arriving at the studio. Got Mike Adams
[13:11.540 --> 13:16.420]  and Nick Pointes joining us because the Republican establishment is so scared of him. I'm going to
[13:16.420 --> 13:22.260]  find out why. And then we're also going to go somewhere in the last segment of this hour
[13:23.540 --> 13:31.460]  that just went live on infowars.com. Special report Antarctic mysteries tied to flat earth
[13:31.460 --> 13:37.140]  conspiracy theory. Now, I want to be completely clear. I do not believe the earth is flat.
[13:39.300 --> 13:43.780]  But because the people have been lied to so much and they know they've been lied to now,
[13:43.780 --> 13:51.540]  most people don't know what's true. And they've done internal polls and national surveys.
[13:53.780 --> 13:58.820]  Hell, I spent $20,000 a few months ago doing one for some legal issues to find out exactly what
[13:58.820 --> 14:07.380]  was going on is what we thought. And about 40% of people now officially question whether the earth's
[14:07.380 --> 14:12.820]  flat or something else. And I mean, that that that like most people don't believe that they killed
[14:12.820 --> 14:19.540]  al-Baghdadi. I do believe they killed al-Baghdadi. Because of the where they were, the history of
[14:19.540 --> 14:25.700]  it, who he was trained by McCain, the globalist, how Trump knew where he was. Trump doesn't want
[14:25.700 --> 14:29.460]  to do fake things and wants to do real things. Why would he let them set him up with a fake
[14:29.460 --> 14:34.340]  takedown like that, knowing that they could use it against him? I just, I believe it happened.
[14:34.340 --> 14:40.500]  All the evidence points towards it. But it's very healthy that mainstream news, the Russian news,
[14:40.500 --> 14:46.500]  the doesn't believe it happened and is investigating it because we've been lied to so much. That's a
[14:46.500 --> 14:56.580]  normal response. So that's all coming up. And our old info wars compadre, Luke Radowski, got into
[14:56.580 --> 15:01.220]  the compound of Jeffrey Epstein. They released that video linked up on drudgerport.com. We're
[15:01.220 --> 15:07.700]  going to be going over all that info wars.com is in four story must see footage inside his compound.
[15:07.700 --> 15:11.460]  There's new Epstein news. The doctor came out and said, yeah, he was murdered. We're going to get to
[15:11.460 --> 15:18.900]  that video. So much today. Please don't forget we have to end the everything must go mega sale,
[15:18.900 --> 15:26.740]  40 to 70% off store wide, double Patriot points and free shipping that has to end Sunday. And
[15:26.740 --> 15:30.900]  usually I'm a few days behind when we end specials. It is ending because we have
[15:31.700 --> 15:35.700]  some new specials next week. They're not as prolific, but they're very big on the items
[15:35.700 --> 15:41.140]  they're on. But I have to end it because we are selling out of so many of the items.
[15:42.340 --> 15:47.140]  And also I was doing some research and, you know, some of these items we're going to just keep until
[15:47.140 --> 15:53.060]  more comes in. So the sale has to end by Sunday evening. Take advantage of a lot of amazing
[15:53.060 --> 15:57.780]  products are there, especially the one that's about to sell out. Everybody loves living defense
[15:57.780 --> 16:04.580]  parasite cleanse. It's about to be gone. Get it 50% off free shipping and double Patriot points
[16:04.580 --> 16:11.620]  right now, but it will be gone. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when
[16:11.620 --> 16:16.820]  they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and one I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[16:16.820 --> 16:20.900]  them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[16:20.900 --> 16:25.380]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes,
[16:25.380 --> 16:31.060]  you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800 34

[16:43.700 --> 16:48.100]  system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important
[16:48.100 --> 16:52.420]  message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically
[16:52.420 --> 16:57.140]  low prices on our PPX micro grid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of
[16:57.140 --> 17:01.620]  electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having
[17:01.620 --> 17:05.700]  here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot
[17:05.700 --> 17:09.940]  of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:09.940 --> 17:14.660]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the
[17:14.660 --> 17:19.380]  floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX micro grid system
[17:19.380 --> 17:25.460]  at my own power grid dot com. That's my own power grid dot com over a thousand dollars in great
[17:25.460 --> 17:30.180]  off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or

[21:59.300 --> 22:05.060]  on the christian faith not just in this nation but all over the world and that there's an attack

[22:09.620 --> 22:14.900]  attack on the two genders this is a plan to destabilize the nation that's even in the wiki
[22:14.900 --> 22:20.500]  leagues with hillary talking about that operation that's part of the poison that hollywood funded

[22:28.340 --> 22:35.300]  you know when he says i'm gonna go alex jones level on you what is he talking about well
[22:35.300 --> 22:42.020]  i said friday if he comes out against the genocide of black people particularly by plan
[22:42.020 --> 22:47.780]  perinhood margaret sanger and the rockefeller foundation that spent billions of dollars in
[22:47.780 --> 22:54.260]  1920s 30s 40s numbers that'd be hundreds of billions today to target black people for
[22:54.260 --> 22:58.420]  extermination and many jurisdictions up to 70 percent of blacks are never born most daters
[22:58.420 --> 23:04.820]  place where black person on earth uh he is in the womb and there's this targeting going on and
[23:04.820 --> 23:08.980]  it's an admitted targeting and hillary clinton said black men are predators they need to be in
[23:08.980 --> 23:14.260]  prison they're like dogs bring them to heal these are quotes and i told ti on his podcast
[23:14.260 --> 23:18.660]  of millions and others hey quit telling me about trump and racism all day and that dog whistle
[23:19.380 --> 23:23.140]  to sit there and you know demonize and create division when it's the democratic party that
[23:23.140 --> 23:29.540]  founded the kkk and so i said if kanye's really woke he'll come out and talk about that well
[23:29.540 --> 23:34.660]  the next day he did so let's let's play where he talks about alex jones level and the next day
[23:34.660 --> 23:39.700]  he talked about uh now it's going viral today both these clips are going viral uh today got almost
[23:39.700 --> 23:43.140]  no attention over the weekend now it's all over the news so here's the two clips

[23:50.820 --> 23:57.220]  wake up wake up mr west wake up culture wake up everybody think they so woke but they follow
[23:57.220 --> 24:03.540]  in the rules of what woke supposed to be we brainwashed out here bro come on man this is a free man
[24:03.540 --> 24:13.700]  talking democrats had his vote and democrats of food stamps for years bro what is you talking about guns
[24:13.700 --> 24:20.580]  in the 80s taking the fathers out the home plan b lowering our votes making us our board our children
[24:20.580 --> 24:28.580]  gosh you're not killed and again that was the same shoot but they doled it out over the next few
[24:28.580 --> 24:34.020]  days they wanted to even more of it and plan parenthood and the purposeful targeting that means
[24:34.020 --> 24:40.900]  he really is off the plantation off the reservation so am i now michelle has their directive again
[24:40.900 --> 24:46.100]  it's in the wiki leaks create racial division in this nation to control us and make us a broken
[24:46.100 --> 24:51.220]  society pay the men not to be in the home pay the women not to have men in the home it's all
[24:51.220 --> 24:56.820]  in the plan parenthood plans that then lbj adopted 40 years later in the great society
[24:56.820 --> 25:03.220]  so she's saying white people are running from minorities well white people are running and
[25:03.220 --> 25:10.340]  everybody else is too from big cities and the and the overprices and the the toxic air i don't
[25:10.340 --> 25:13.540]  know about you but you drive on the countryside around austin there's people all different colors
[25:13.540 --> 25:18.260]  and they're running from the city of austin and the the la crowd that's come here that's
[25:18.260 --> 25:24.660]  bankrupting the city and then it's brown people fighting to get into america because of the christian
[25:24.660 --> 25:31.140]  ethos that was here and because of the free market and because of the justice and because our police
[25:31.140 --> 25:37.540]  compared to other nations police are not corrupt my god go to venezuela go to north korea go to
[25:37.540 --> 25:42.660]  these people are fighting to come here because of the benefits and everything else that's a twisted
[25:42.660 --> 25:48.500]  leftist form of the christian ethos it's supposed to be the churches and the communities almost all
[25:48.500 --> 25:53.220]  these big hospitals are tax exempt they're owned by big churches but they're not churches anymore
[25:53.220 --> 25:58.980]  they're corporations the churches have become government-controlled the first amendment has
[25:58.980 --> 26:03.460]  been violated congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the
[26:03.460 --> 26:09.060]  first exercise thereof or the press or a free speech or the people's right to peaceably assemble
[26:09.700 --> 26:16.020]  for redress of grievances it's all there read it first amendment and so michelle comes out
[26:16.020 --> 26:23.140]  and says white people are inherently bad what a racist statement the opposite of what martin
[26:23.140 --> 26:28.900]  lucer king said but she knows what she's doing they're betting minorities are corrupt and racist
[26:28.900 --> 26:36.740]  they're betting that what white people trailblazed worldwide the british empire had over a hundred
[26:36.740 --> 26:43.540]  major conflicts and wars the ending transatlantic slave trade and ending it in the in the pacific
[26:43.540 --> 26:49.300]  ocean where slavery was going on all those pacific islands i mean the muslims for 1400 years were
[26:49.300 --> 26:55.380]  selling black slaves out of africa all the way into the south pacific into the philippines
[26:56.820 --> 27:02.580]  and all the way into indonesia and places even further south than the eastern pacific
[27:04.820 --> 27:09.460]  that's why you go to islands all over the pacific there's black people the muslims brought them there
[27:09.460 --> 27:17.460]  look into it we learn the transatlantic slave trade from the muslims and that my only point
[27:17.460 --> 27:22.340]  is is that michelle wants you to think white people are inherently bad when the truth is modern
[27:22.340 --> 27:29.380]  civilization and the end of slavery is white people's doing because we recognize it was wrong
[27:29.380 --> 27:33.620]  we have the moral authority if you want to talk about woke who's got authority black people are
[27:33.620 --> 27:39.940]  still selling each other in seven nations in africa muslims are still selling humans in
[27:39.940 --> 27:46.660]  four nations in africa and you don't say a damn word you evil racist witch here is this monster
[27:46.660 --> 27:52.900]  selling poison like a cobra biting you with evil here is this witch for the rockefellers
[27:52.900 --> 27:59.540]  and the big money and the kkk run democrats here she is and i want to remind white folks that
[27:59.540 --> 28:07.140]  that y'all were running from us you know because this family this family no no you're running
[28:07.140 --> 28:12.340]  you're running after us lady because you're smart that you read about yeah you were running from us
[28:12.340 --> 28:16.900]  and you're still running because you're out i'm running from you different than the immigrant

[28:21.540 --> 28:30.980]  from other places to try to do better but because we can so easily wash over who we really were

[28:38.740 --> 28:44.420]  baby everybody wants to be so mean to you but oh you love that plant parenthood killing tens of

[32:25.940 --> 32:31.540]  earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb others

[33:07.460 --> 33:23.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:23.380 --> 33:40.340]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:45.540 --> 33:50.100]  all right i went into michelle obama just constantly pushing her race fading and that
[33:50.100 --> 33:55.140]  white people are bad and that white people are running from black people uh they've done national
[33:55.140 --> 34:02.500]  studies actually black folks uh are the most insular or self-segregating group in the united
[34:02.500 --> 34:09.380]  states uh after a few subgroups of asians like li oceans and things and that's just a fact oh and
[34:09.380 --> 34:14.020]  by the way the top nine richest demographics according to race are not white they're asian
[34:14.020 --> 34:23.780]  but remember barney sanders said white people do not know what it is like to be poor so they're
[34:23.780 --> 34:30.660]  the ones spewing all this race garbage race race race race constantly and it's a bunch of white
[34:30.660 --> 34:37.220]  people leading us uh into all of this racial division it's sick what marlither king talked
[34:37.220 --> 34:41.540]  about which is an extension of the christian ethos was being colorblind and going according to what
[34:41.540 --> 34:48.100]  people stood for what they produced that's common sense if somebody makes great clothes you buy it
[34:48.100 --> 34:50.820]  no matter what color they are if somebody has great food you go to the restaurant you don't
[34:50.820 --> 34:54.260]  care what color they are somebody makes great music you listen to it you don't care what color
[34:54.260 --> 34:58.820]  they are it's about what you produce what you stand for but they're making it all about what color
[34:58.820 --> 35:05.940]  you are and we know that barack obama it's in his own biography was raised by a transgender in
[35:05.940 --> 35:12.100]  malaysia and i'm not against these people as long as they don't go target children and try to sexualize
[35:12.820 --> 35:20.580]  them so there's an obsession with this and a lot of people looked at michelle obama's shoulders
[35:20.580 --> 35:24.740]  that they're bigger than obamas there's photos of them hugging and my god her shoulders are just
[35:24.740 --> 35:31.220]  look like a linebackers and there's a lot of videos of her coming out of events and it looks like
[35:31.220 --> 35:38.420]  that there's about an eight inch flaccid male genitals there i mean if michelle is a man she's
[35:39.540 --> 35:46.500]  she's a heavy hitter okay i mean she could star in porn movies as a just an incredible specimen
[35:48.100 --> 35:57.220]  now now again i'm not saying that that's the case maybe she keeps a roll of silver dollars in her
[35:57.220 --> 36:03.620]  pants maybe she keeps a rubber snake in her pants there's a lot of really reasonable reasons
[36:04.660 --> 36:09.300]  that you know maybe she carries a rub a blackjack you only have those rubber
[36:10.020 --> 36:14.820]  billy clubs that you know maybe she's got like a eight inch blackjack in her pants
[36:15.700 --> 36:20.580]  or something okay that you know she carries for security i mean you never know with the first lady
[36:20.580 --> 36:30.740]  but jones reveres said that she's a a dude okay and so
[36:33.540 --> 36:39.460]  all i'm saying is the lady looks like a dude that's our free speech to say that but i'm not the one
[36:39.460 --> 36:44.580]  that ever said it it's jones reveres that was friends with michael you know obamas always like
[36:44.580 --> 36:49.220]  in 10 different clips i've seen always saying michael and i you know have our children and i
[36:49.220 --> 36:53.940]  love michael he doesn't know and he keeps saying michael come up here michael and michael comes up
[36:53.940 --> 37:01.780]  there's nothing wrong with that if that's the case obama is a consenting adult um but but
[37:01.780 --> 37:07.220]  jones reveres reportedly was seen on an operating table with fire shooting out of her mouth like a
[37:07.220 --> 37:14.100]  dragon no one really knows what happened but the basically her head blew up uh about a month after
[37:14.100 --> 37:21.700]  she made the statement so since we're on this right now i thought that i would play this she
[37:21.700 --> 37:29.220]  said that obama was gay and that michelle is transgender but she used the the term that
[37:29.220 --> 37:33.460]  we've been told we're not supposed to use that actually that community created but they control
[37:33.460 --> 37:38.420]  reality like the adl says this is a white supremacist symbol you will be arrested in areas of europe if
[37:38.420 --> 37:45.620]  you use it and i agree they're god so yes sir uh international sign of okay is now evil if they say
[37:45.620 --> 37:51.380]  the happy symbol is bad i i agree ban the happy face just we there's not a threat at all to have
[37:51.380 --> 37:55.460]  these groups doing this they are our bosses and i want to submit to them hell if you don't do what
[37:55.460 --> 37:59.460]  they say they say you work for the russians you know that that putin tells i mean we actually
[37:59.460 --> 38:07.220]  have maxi waters saying that putin is in trumps here that the swap term came from him from putin
[38:07.220 --> 38:12.820]  and then lock her up lock her up came from me and our audience and hillary for president but
[38:12.820 --> 38:20.660]  oh oh oh putin hold on putin hold on but what's that so this is the woke world so uh here is
[38:20.660 --> 38:24.820]  one of the last things john rivers ever said you see the first gay president or the first woman
[38:24.820 --> 38:34.100]  president have it with obama so let's just calm down got it you know michelle is a trans i'm sorry
[38:34.100 --> 38:40.980]  she's a what a transgender and this is the big religion of the elite i mean they're really into
[38:40.980 --> 38:45.220]  this you see i'm pushing on your kids everywhere uh man got arrested dressed up in a wig here in
[38:45.220 --> 38:49.380]  austin a few days ago just an event of children and adults that did not want five-year-olds to be
[38:49.380 --> 38:55.300]  taught out of anal sex and to have it talked to them by men and men and in drag that's pretty normal
[38:55.300 --> 38:59.140]  right you don't people talking to your kids about anal sex the park or the school or anywhere uh they
[38:59.140 --> 39:03.620]  had to get arrested because he was just didn't want them to have their speech uh so a very very uh
[39:03.620 --> 39:07.700]  in california if i call him a him i get arrested i thought i had free speech here this is a very
[39:07.700 --> 39:15.380]  very uh dangerous point we're to so let's play for tv viewers you can see this here's uh michelle
[39:15.380 --> 39:23.220]  or michael as obama calls her he or g or whatever new pronoun i'm supposed to use uh and then and
[39:23.220 --> 39:33.780]  then there's other videos and photos of uh whatever it is in those trousers or under the dress here it is
[39:37.780 --> 39:40.820]  okay they're coming out and uh
[39:45.540 --> 39:50.660]  there you go and then there's a bunch of photos obviously of that we can put on screen for
[39:50.660 --> 39:57.460]  tv viewers but i'm i'm not saying i'm not saying that michelle obama is a man
[39:58.900 --> 40:04.900]  okay that's not what i'm saying i'm saying jones rivers said it and jones rivers had a right to
[40:04.900 --> 40:15.940]  say it that's all that's all i'm saying okay i'm done talking about that i don't want to say i've
[40:15.940 --> 40:21.780]  gone off the rails here today just because there's uh several international tv crews here today
[40:23.780 --> 40:30.020]  one from the united states one from the dreaded russians are here that's right so uh we've got
[40:30.020 --> 40:35.620]  national russian television here as well i never got to this sunday or monday or tuesday i'm going
[40:35.620 --> 40:41.460]  to do it today at six after next hour very serious news on george soros and where he said that he can
[40:41.460 --> 40:45.860]  bend the will of god and the globalists are going to crush america wait till i actually read these
[40:45.860 --> 40:50.820]  quotes to you oh but he's a defender of free speech and trump and alex jones are hurting our free
[40:50.820 --> 41:02.340]  speech total inversion of reality that's all coming up and uh so much more but first i have
[41:02.340 --> 41:09.060]  people stop me on the street all the time and say well alex they lie about so much as the earth flat
[41:09.060 --> 41:14.580]  that i say no i don't think the earth flat they go whoa you're not woke and so i got challenged by
[41:14.580 --> 41:20.980]  eddy bravo and others look into antarctic and look into what the claims are and they really do have
[41:20.980 --> 41:26.020]  it sealed off down there they act in very suspicious but there's a lot of reasons that could be not
[41:26.020 --> 41:31.460]  that the earth flat there's an ice dome over it and all the rest of it but i promise to do a fair
[41:31.460 --> 41:36.420]  report on it so greg reese great investigative journals he put one together we're going to premiere
[41:36.420 --> 41:43.220]  it next segment speaking of premiered video drudgerport.com is linked to our article uh about

[45:21.700 --> 45:26.660]  and it says that two billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth
[45:26.660 --> 45:30.820]  because they didn't get enough iodine that's what you say all the time but i've heard people say
[45:30.820 --> 45:35.940]  you're crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when i click it saying
[45:35.940 --> 45:40.900]  exactly what you said and i said i know honey that's why i have you take the high quality
[45:40.900 --> 45:46.820]  nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's

[47:28.980 --> 47:37.780]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[47:37.780 --> 47:48.420]  yes
[47:48.420 --> 48:10.620]  In the age of social media censorship, questioning whether or not the Earth is a globe has been
[48:10.620 --> 48:13.500]  deemed harmful thought.
[48:13.500 --> 48:16.020]  But why is this?
[48:16.020 --> 48:20.980]  We seem to be conditioned to think that the issue has been scientifically settled.
[48:20.980 --> 48:23.780]  But this is not the case.
[48:23.780 --> 48:30.020]  Our most popular scientists recognize that the geocentric model where the Earth is at
[48:30.020 --> 48:44.180]  the center of the universe is observably accurate.
[48:44.180 --> 48:48.860]  Edwin Hubble and Stephen Hawking went as far as to say that they reject the geocentric
[48:48.860 --> 48:54.300]  model not based on scientific reasoning, but rather because they find the thought of
[48:54.300 --> 48:59.260]  being at the center of the universe to be emotionally disturbing.
[48:59.260 --> 49:04.380]  Physicist George Ellis stated that you cannot disprove the geocentric model.
[49:04.380 --> 49:09.460]  You can only exclude it on philosophical grounds.
[49:09.460 --> 49:15.140]  The Michelson-Morley experiment in the 1880s proved the Earth was stationary.
[49:15.140 --> 49:21.140]  And Albert Einstein claimed this was a serious embarrassment and intended to disprove it with
[49:21.140 --> 49:28.060]  his relativity theory, but later admitted that he had failed to do so.
[49:28.060 --> 49:33.380]  We are conditioned to think that the geocentric model is scientifically superior to the geocentric
[49:33.380 --> 49:34.380]  model.
[49:34.380 --> 49:39.740]  But when we apply scientific reasoning, we discover that this is not true.
[49:39.740 --> 49:45.860]  Contrary to popular thought, the scientific community has disputed the geocentric model
[49:45.860 --> 49:50.620]  for centuries, such as the Earth's curvature.
[49:50.620 --> 49:56.700]  According to the geocentric Earth model, the Earth is 24,000 miles in circumference.
[49:56.700 --> 50:00.420]  And if one were standing at sea level, they should only be able to see less than three
[50:00.420 --> 50:04.700]  miles before the surface of the Earth curves out of view.
[50:04.700 --> 50:10.940]  But this has been proven to be false for centuries, from the Bedford-level experiments
[50:10.940 --> 50:14.860]  of 1838 to modern photography.
[50:14.860 --> 50:19.980]  This photograph of Chicago was taken almost 60 miles away from Grand Meere State Park
[50:19.980 --> 50:21.340]  in Michigan.
[50:21.340 --> 50:25.060]  On a spherical Earth, this would be impossible.
[50:25.060 --> 50:30.180]  Using the Pythagorean theorem and the current dimensions of the Earth, the top of the tallest
[50:30.180 --> 50:35.820]  skyscraper should be 900 feet below the observable horizon.
[50:35.820 --> 50:40.460]  Local news explained this anomaly by claiming the image was a mirage.
[50:40.460 --> 50:43.380]  And what you're seeing here is a mirage.
[50:43.380 --> 50:46.580]  We typically would not be able to see this for the Lake Michigan shore.
[50:46.580 --> 50:48.980]  We talked about this last night.
[50:48.980 --> 50:53.100]  Conditions are right on the lake that we're actually seeing a mirage.
[50:53.100 --> 50:58.900]  They claim that somehow light refraction and perfect weather conditions are responsible
[50:58.900 --> 51:05.060]  for creating a photorealistic mirage of the Chicago skyline appearing to sit on the flat
[51:05.060 --> 51:09.180]  horizon from almost 60 miles away.
[51:09.180 --> 51:14.020]  Anomalies in the Earth's curvature can also be found in old lighthouses, able to be seen
[51:14.020 --> 51:19.820]  for several miles past what is possible on the heliocentric model, and weapons guidance
[51:19.820 --> 51:26.300]  systems that are capable of sighting targets that would only be possible on a flat plane.
[51:26.300 --> 51:32.740]  We are accustomed to observing ships disappearing over the curve, but with modern consumer cameras,
[51:32.740 --> 51:38.220]  we can observe that this seems to be an optical illusion based on light reflection and the
[51:38.220 --> 51:40.380]  laws of perspective.
[51:40.380 --> 51:45.740]  Many of us tend to think the planet is too big to observe curvature, but the empirical
[51:45.740 --> 51:51.580]  evidence tells us that either the surface of the Earth is a flat plane or the planet
[51:51.580 --> 51:57.140]  is at least 100 times bigger than we are told.
[51:57.140 --> 52:02.440]  Another very intriguing argument for flat earthers is Antarctica, the mysterious mass
[52:02.440 --> 52:07.820]  of continent at our southern pole that nobody is allowed to explore.
[52:07.820 --> 52:13.580]  After sailing over 60,000 miles along the Antarctic coastline, Captain Cook was never
[52:13.580 --> 52:18.660]  able to complete the journey around the ice continent, which is supposed to be just under
[52:18.660 --> 52:21.700]  12,000 miles around.
[52:21.700 --> 52:27.700]  Neither was James Clark Ross or the British ship Challenger.
[52:27.700 --> 52:31.740]  Nobody has ever successfully circumnavigated Antarctica.
[52:31.740 --> 52:37.820]  Many so-called flat earthers claim that these attempts failed because Antarctica is actually
[52:37.820 --> 52:43.460]  a massive ice barrier that surrounds the flat surface of the Earth.
[52:43.460 --> 52:49.660]  The azimuthal equidescent projection map, produced by the US Geological Survey, has been used
[52:49.660 --> 52:55.980]  for centuries for the fact that all directions or azimuths are correct and all distances
[52:55.980 --> 52:58.300]  are at true scale.
[52:58.300 --> 53:03.100]  Studying this map, one can clearly see how man has been able to accurately circumnavigate
[53:03.100 --> 53:05.860]  the Earth on a flat plane model.
[53:05.860 --> 53:12.020]  And if it is in fact accurate, then it explains why after 60,000 miles, nobody has been able
[53:12.020 --> 53:15.460]  to completely circumnavigate Antarctica.
[53:15.460 --> 53:21.540]  Interestingly, this is also the map used by the United Nations.
[53:21.540 --> 53:27.100]  Admiral Richard Byrd, Medal of Honor winner, youngest admiral in the history of the Navy
[53:27.100 --> 53:34.660]  and recipient of three ticker tape parades in his honor, led four expeditions to Antarctica.
[53:34.660 --> 53:40.380]  The fourth being a military operation known as Operation High Jump, with an aircraft carrier
[53:40.380 --> 53:46.220]  group of 4,700 men, 13 support ships, and 33 aircraft.
[53:46.220 --> 53:52.140]  Their stated mission was to establish the Antarctic research-based Little America 4.
[53:52.140 --> 53:57.580]  But many believe the true nature of the secret mission was to root out the Nazis who arrived
[53:57.580 --> 54:05.180]  in 1939, claiming Nushwabia and setting up a Nazi presence in Antarctica.
[54:05.180 --> 54:11.820]  In 1954, Admiral Richard Byrd spoke on TV of an area bigger than the United States,
[54:11.820 --> 54:16.700]  with valuable resources, and announced a future of international exploration.
[54:16.700 --> 54:20.980]  Our very distinguished guest for this evening is Admiral Richard E. Byrd.
[54:20.980 --> 54:26.460]  Strangely enough, as left in the world today, an area as big as the United States that's
[54:26.460 --> 54:29.380]  never been seen by a human being.
[54:29.380 --> 54:34.900]  And that's beyond the pole on the other side of the South Pole from Middle America.
[54:34.900 --> 54:44.300]  We've found enough pole within 180 miles of the South Pole in our great ridge of mountain.
[54:44.300 --> 54:50.140]  It's not covered in snow, enough to supply the whole world for quite a while.
[54:50.140 --> 54:56.340]  And I think it's quite astonishing that there should be an area as big as that unexplored.
[54:56.340 --> 54:57.340]  That's a tremendous thing.
[54:57.340 --> 55:00.820]  So there's a lot of adventure left down at the bottom of the world.
[55:00.820 --> 55:02.460]  Admiral, do you hope to see that?
[55:02.460 --> 55:03.460]  I do.
[55:03.460 --> 55:10.220]  So I'm willing to say to you that there will be a number of expeditions that will follow,
[55:10.220 --> 55:15.540]  I think, year after year, the bottom of the world, because the government has really become
[55:15.540 --> 55:16.540]  interested.
[55:16.540 --> 55:18.540]  But this never happened.
[55:18.540 --> 55:25.380]  In 1957, Admiral Byrd died in his sleep of a heart ailment at the age of 68.
[55:25.380 --> 55:32.620]  And on December 1, 1959, all 12 countries active in Antarctica signed a United Nations
[55:32.620 --> 55:39.140]  Treaty that outlawed all public travel south of the 60th Southern Parallel.
[55:39.140 --> 55:42.180]  This was the same time that NASA was formed.
[55:42.180 --> 55:47.900]  The world's attention was pulled away from exploring Antarctica and directed firmly on
[55:47.900 --> 55:50.140]  the moon.
[55:50.140 --> 55:57.460]  In 1962, a series of high-altitude nuclear tests was carried out by the United States.
[55:57.460 --> 56:03.820]  It was called Operation Fishbowl, which has caught the curiosity of many flat-earth researchers
[56:03.820 --> 56:09.380]  because the flat-earth model shared by the ancients was one where we lived within a sphere
[56:09.380 --> 56:18.100]  upon a flat surface and surrounded by a massive dome, like a fishbowl or the Truman Show.
[56:18.100 --> 56:25.740]  In 2012, the secret lost diary of Admiral Richard E. Byrd was published, wherein Admiral
[56:25.740 --> 56:31.900]  Byrd allegedly claimed to enter a hollow earth through a hole in the center of Antarctica
[56:31.900 --> 56:35.420]  and meet with an advanced alien civilization.
[56:35.420 --> 56:41.260]  The diary provides no evidence of being authentic, and many would suggest that it portrays the
[56:41.260 --> 56:48.020]  distinguished Admiral as a crackpot and strange tales of Antarctica as fantasy.
[56:48.020 --> 56:54.980]  To this day, the public is strictly prohibited from traveling below the 60th Southern Parallel.
[56:54.980 --> 57:00.300]  Nobody has ever completely circumnavigated Antarctica, and airplanes are prohibited
[57:00.300 --> 57:04.380]  from flying over the icy continent.
[57:04.380 --> 57:06.260]  What are they hiding?
[57:06.260 --> 57:10.700]  There is now talk of investing trillions of dollars to explore Mars.
[57:10.700 --> 57:12.980]  Why not Antarctica?
[57:12.980 --> 57:19.140]  If sharing videos about flat earth is harmful, why not put it all to rest by circumnavigating
[57:19.140 --> 57:26.100]  Antarctica, documenting everything, and prove that the earth is a spinning globe?
[57:26.100 --> 57:29.140]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[57:29.140 --> 57:34.260]  And again, I do not believe the earth is flat, I do not believe the earth is the center
[57:34.260 --> 57:35.260]  of the universe.
[57:35.260 --> 57:40.500]  I do believe in free speech, and YouTube, Google, Facebook, they're all banning videos
[57:40.500 --> 57:42.740]  that ask those questions.
[57:42.740 --> 57:46.380]  That's a big problem, and the fact that so many people think we're being lied to about
[57:46.380 --> 57:50.260]  the nature of the universe, and the planet is a whole other issue.
[57:50.260 --> 57:53.740]  I'll talk about it more when we start the next hour, then I'm going to get into what's
[57:53.740 --> 57:55.740]  currently happening geopolitically.
[57:55.740 --> 57:58.740]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[57:58.740 --> 58:04.140]  Hey Alex, oh my God, long time listener, first time caller.
[58:04.140 --> 58:09.540]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise, and
[58:09.540 --> 58:13.940]  I was in there until June, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[58:13.940 --> 58:14.940]  defense.
[58:14.940 --> 58:21.140]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I stuck with it for about five or six years,
[58:21.140 --> 58:25.140]  and the doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is.
[58:25.140 --> 58:28.700]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[58:28.700 --> 58:31.500]  you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[58:31.500 --> 58:34.700]  Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff,
[58:34.700 --> 58:38.820]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[58:38.820 --> 58:39.820]  taking it.
[58:39.820 --> 58:42.940]  Man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[58:42.940 --> 58:46.500]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though, anybody who's traveled
[58:46.500 --> 58:52.420]  overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[58:52.420 --> 58:56.740]  It's true folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality, and living defense
[58:56.740 --> 59:01.060]  is over the top good.
[59:01.060 --> 59:04.460]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[59:04.460 --> 59:10.900]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[59:10.900 --> 59:12.580]  will like different formulas.
[59:12.580 --> 59:15.180]  It's just that simple.
[59:15.180 --> 59:20.220]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[59:20.220 --> 59:24.860]  types to absorb, others like the pure atomic iodine.
[59:24.860 --> 59:29.260]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[59:29.260 --> 59:31.540]  to family or friends.
[59:31.540 --> 59:34.900]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[59:34.900 --> 59:39.220]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[59:39.220 --> 59:42.340]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[59:42.340 --> 59:43.340]  It's simple.
[59:43.340 --> 59:49.820]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war, infowarstore.com.
[59:49.820 --> 59:52.500]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[59:52.500 --> 1:00:02.900]  It's the iodine challenge, both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:00:02.900 --> 1:00:15.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:15.460 --> 1:00:19.860]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:26.140]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:34.740]  If you just joined us, we just covered something that I've never really talked about 25 years
[1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:37.500]  on air except a few times Eddie Bravo's been here.
[1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:44.340]  I don't ridicule Eddie Bravo for believing the world's flat or that it's in a dome space
[1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:45.980]  station.
[1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:47.140]  He has a right to believe that.
[1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:48.140]  He's a friend of mine.
[1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:49.140]  He's a nice guy.
[1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:50.140]  He's a smart guy.
[1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:54.140]  He points out a lot of things that are very, very interesting.
[1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:57.820]  And it's because the mainstream media lies so much and have been caught lying that people
[1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.860]  now really question the very nature of reality.
[1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:07.700]  But if you want to see the full special report and share it, special report and Arctic mysteries
[1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:11.540]  tied to flat earth conspiracy theory.
[1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:19.380]  And I use the establishment's term conspiracy theory as a jab because mainstream media says
[1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:21.860]  that I believe the earth is flat.
[1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:25.140]  People walk up to me on the street and they go, you're a Russian agent, even if the world
[1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:29.820]  is flat and gay frogs.
[1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:35.620]  And or they say Sandy Hook at me and I go, yeah, I questioned Sandy Hook.
[1:01:35.620 --> 1:01:42.540]  I mean, the media is questioning whether Al-Baghdadi, the French media, the Russian media, the US
[1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:49.340]  media is questioning whether Al-Baghdadi died a few days ago on Saturday in northern Syria.
[1:01:49.340 --> 1:01:51.500]  That's completely reasonable.
[1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:54.900]  So write everyone hash.
[1:01:54.900 --> 1:01:57.140]  I tend to believe Al-Baghdadi died.
[1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:58.300]  He'd worked for Hillary.
[1:01:58.300 --> 1:01:59.300]  He'd worked for Obama.
[1:01:59.300 --> 1:02:00.860]  He'd worked for John McCain.
[1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:02.980]  Type in Al-Baghdadi, photograph with McCain.
[1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:05.300]  That's been out eight years.
[1:02:05.300 --> 1:02:09.340]  And he was protected by the deep state to go into destabilized countries.
[1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:15.180]  And then he ended up falling out of favor when Trump came into office and now Syria has been
[1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:20.420]  cleared out except that last area and he's been killed.
[1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:22.900]  He's dead.
[1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.780]  And Trump doesn't put out hoaxes.
[1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:27.900]  Trump doesn't want to put out a lie where he could get caught putting it out by deep
[1:02:27.900 --> 1:02:31.540]  staters all around him, just desperate to make something up.
[1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:35.460]  That's why I believe Al-Baghdadi died or at least they killed somebody and videotaped
[1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:37.860]  it and told the president that's what they did.
[1:02:37.860 --> 1:02:41.900]  That is a possibility.
[1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:46.100]  But we did expose that been logged and been dead for many, many years, just how they would
[1:02:46.100 --> 1:02:47.100]  roll that out later.
[1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:48.420]  And that is a fact.
[1:02:48.420 --> 1:02:54.740]  And then the 23 Navy SEALs were blown up a week later, all packed on a helicopter, had
[1:02:54.740 --> 1:02:55.740]  been part of that mission.
[1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:58.780]  The helicopter was flown out and just blew up.
[1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:00.540]  And they said, we've not been briefed on a mission.
[1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:02.820]  We don't fly 23 people on one Chinook.
[1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:03.820]  What the hell is going on?
[1:03:03.820 --> 1:03:06.900]  They said, you're ordered to get on there.
[1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:12.180]  And they said, we're being set up, but they still followed orders and they died.
[1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:20.020]  Just like Joan Rivers died because she talked about Obama being gay and Michelle being a
[1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:21.220]  tranny.
[1:03:21.220 --> 1:03:23.820]  She was dead very, very soon.
[1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:28.340]  Now, these are the questions people ask, just like I said, I think they killed Epstein.
[1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:36.340]  I said, I think they'll kill Epstein.
[1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:40.460]  And then they all saw the guards told to stand down, new guards brought in, the cameras turned
[1:03:40.460 --> 1:03:41.460]  off.
[1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:42.460]  They were yelling, screaming.
[1:03:42.460 --> 1:03:45.900]  And then I said, I bet they broke his neck, two bones in his neck broken.
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:51.300]  And now the coroners come out and said, it's murder.
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:52.820]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[1:03:52.820 --> 1:03:57.500]  Oh, speaking of Epstein, footage has emerged.
[1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.500]  It's on infowords.com.
[1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:00.260]  It's linked on drugreport.com.
[1:04:00.260 --> 1:04:01.260]  We are.
[1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:04.100]  James Lugradowski went on Little St. George, Peter Island.
[1:04:04.100 --> 1:04:06.580]  I got some interesting video.
[1:04:06.580 --> 1:04:10.180]  It's obviously even cleaned out, but you get to look at the facility.
[1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:18.060]  So that's real journalism right there, something that the cowardly mainline journalists today
[1:04:18.060 --> 1:04:19.060]  don't do because they're not journalists.
[1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:21.820]  You know, the old days, you snuck in Bohemian Grove.
[1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:22.820]  You snuck on cotton.
[1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:24.540]  And that's the kind of stuff I've done.
[1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:27.340]  That's real journalism, but they don't do that nowadays.
[1:04:27.340 --> 1:04:31.460]  So it's up to citizen journalists to go out and do it as well.
[1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:36.460]  But again, the media has such little credit and people don't believe the system so much
[1:04:36.460 --> 1:04:41.740]  that a large percentage of people don't believe the spherical earth situation.
[1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:45.580]  Hell, the head of Bank of America a few years ago said he believes everything's a simulation
[1:04:45.580 --> 1:04:47.580]  and fake.
[1:04:47.580 --> 1:04:50.020]  Upwards of half of Silicon Valley execs think it's a simulation.
[1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.740]  They think nothing's real, but that's, oh, that's okay.
[1:04:52.740 --> 1:04:55.540]  Joe Rogan thinks he communicates with aliens on DMT.
[1:04:55.540 --> 1:05:01.100]  I say that's kind of weird and I'm the cook for saying they're demons, not aliens.
[1:05:01.100 --> 1:05:02.100]  Demons, aliens, interchangeable.
[1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:07.780]  See, I don't take the DMT and talk to the aliens, so I'm the crazy one.
[1:05:07.780 --> 1:05:09.940]  All of our bodies are different.
[1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:12.820]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:05:12.820 --> 1:05:15.820]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:19.260]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something that you
[1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:22.620]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[1:05:22.620 --> 1:05:30.260]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:32.260]  completely changes.
[1:05:32.260 --> 1:05:33.260]  I'm healthier.
[1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:34.260]  I have more energy.
[1:05:34.260 --> 1:05:35.260]  I lose weight.
[1:05:35.260 --> 1:05:36.260]  I look better.
[1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:37.260]  Everybody notices.
[1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:44.020]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:49.220]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life.
[1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:54.100]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[1:05:54.100 --> 1:06:00.060]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is gut fusion folks.
[1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:01.060]  Check it out.
[1:06:01.060 --> 1:06:02.060]  There's nothing else like it.
[1:06:02.060 --> 1:06:05.100]  50% off right now, the sale's about to end.
[1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:33.820]  That's what I'm going to tell you about, and that's what I'm going to tell you about.
[1:06:33.820 --> 1:06:47.660]  Well, before Jeffrey Epstein ever got convicted of trafficking in 14-year-old girls, of course
[1:06:47.660 --> 1:06:54.540]  that's just the entrance to the fetted spider hole, I said he was working for the Rockefellers
[1:06:54.540 --> 1:06:58.700]  and for the Carnegie Endowment and for Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and that he was
[1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:04.060]  running a secret eugenics human cloning program, and how did I know that?
[1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:07.420]  Oh, because it was in the news.
[1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:12.820]  You can type in billionaires meeting secret to save the world, billionaires meeting secret
[1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:17.460]  to set up world government, billionaires meeting secret to discuss overpopulation, and you'll
[1:07:17.460 --> 1:07:25.180]  get London Guardian, you'll get New York Times, you'll get Washington Post, you will get ABC
[1:07:25.180 --> 1:07:26.180]  news.
[1:07:26.180 --> 1:07:37.540]  You'll get all these clips, we've covered it, saying, oh, at the Albert Einstein Institute,
[1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:42.580]  there's miraculous amazing things going on, yeah, there it is on screen, top billionaires
[1:07:42.580 --> 1:07:49.620]  old secret meeting, NBC, there it is, billionaires trying to shrink world population, report
[1:07:49.620 --> 1:07:58.420]  says Wall Street Journal 2009, and there's articles even before that, I first had Epstein
[1:07:58.420 --> 1:08:07.500]  on my radar screen about 15 years ago, and we're all on record, oh, but Bill Gates says
[1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:14.340]  he doesn't know Jeffrey Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein just was the major D or maybe the main chef,
[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:27.300]  the master of ceremonies, the three-ring circus leader of the whole event, the circus master,
[1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:34.740]  he didn't run it, but he was the man that made sure it was all taken care of, Bill Gates
[1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:39.340]  wanted to say he never even knew Epstein just gave him some money, turns out he stated his
[1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:47.420]  homes in France and England and the U.S. in a seven-story pleasure palace compound along
[1:08:47.420 --> 1:08:54.980]  with the Archduke from the U.K. and they flew around on the airplanes, of course, and that's
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:09:02.000]  old Billy Boy for you, you know, old Billy Boy, his daddy was involved at Cold Springs
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.700]  Harbor with the Army, that's the eugenics facility run by IBM, you know, that ran the
[1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:12.420]  Nazis, Hitler took his orders from Thomas Watson, he said that in speeches, gave Thomas
[1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:25.820]  Watson the highest award anyone ever got from 1933 to 1945, the 12 years of the thousand-year
[1:09:25.820 --> 1:09:32.540]  Reich, yeah, it turns out old Billy Boy is just a frontman, and Billy Boy two weeks ago
[1:09:32.540 --> 1:09:36.500]  had another TV show released that turns out they paid for it, the Bill Gates Foundation
[1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:47.580]  paid for it, the episode of the Good Doctor about how I'm evil, and how vaccines never
[1:09:47.580 --> 1:09:52.000]  hurt one single person, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.480]  Cy and I never hurt anybody either.
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:04.260]  Bill really wants something to be in your body, but I'm sorry, I'm digressing, so we
[1:10:04.260 --> 1:10:08.660]  told you he was into all this later it all came out we told you they had islands they flew people
[1:10:08.660 --> 1:10:13.620]  to it all came out and we told you specifically that they went down a little bit of kids that even
[1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:17.620]  little kids being killed i'm not saying gage was involved in that i just know that goes on and
[1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:22.900]  turned out that they were trafficking kids kidnapped from all over the caribbean to the island uh for
[1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:28.500]  the more bloody rituals that go on in the temple and there's lots of these temples they had breeding
[1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:33.860]  program going on make it all very scientific so these rich guys can all have a secret you know
[1:10:33.860 --> 1:10:38.260]  group of kids that they can then plug into power positions all over the world kind of like bill
[1:10:38.260 --> 1:10:45.300]  clinton was really the son of a very important rockefeller back when i was in junior high there
[1:10:45.300 --> 1:10:52.820]  were only two people that thought i could be president my mom and david rockefeller david
[1:10:52.820 --> 1:11:02.660]  rockefeller was there on the stage and started crying was it 1997 his son his son oh his son
[1:11:02.660 --> 1:11:12.100]  did such great things a rockefeller finally is president the name may have been shrouded in evil
[1:11:12.820 --> 1:11:17.780]  but we got old belly boy in so they got their breeding program this is an old thing that kings
[1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:22.740]  and others do they have lots of secret sons william the conqueror was a secret son
[1:11:22.740 --> 1:11:29.540]  of the king of the norman and a whore he thought looked good
[1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  look up your history books just like with billy boy so how the ball bounces
[1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:48.900]  how the ball bounces i said he would die in jail
[1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:55.460]  as soon as the info came out and he did and he screamed back for his life all the witnesses say
[1:11:56.900 --> 1:12:02.100]  and i said i bet he's got broken bones and he does jeffrey eppstein's autopsy more consistent
[1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:09.780]  with homicidal strangulation and suicide dr michael baton reveals fox news forensic pathologist
[1:12:09.780 --> 1:12:14.020]  dr michael baton exclusively reveals findings from his investigation into jeffrey eppstein's
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:22.340]  autopsy on fox and friends the body of the disgraced money man and sex offender jeffrey eppstein
[1:12:22.340 --> 1:12:27.060]  who was found dead in his manhattan federal prison cell in august more the telltale signs of
[1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:32.580]  homicide despite an official ruling that he killed himself a pioneering forensic pathologist
[1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:40.820]  revealed to fox and friends an exclusive interview wednesday the bomb shell let's play a clip
[1:12:40.820 --> 1:12:48.740]  this by the brother the next of kin to be at the autopsy and at the autopsy on day one
[1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:54.900]  there were findings that were unusual for suicidal hanging and more consistent with
[1:12:55.860 --> 1:13:02.180]  ligature homicidal strangulation which included and he was suggested at the time that he committed
[1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:10.900]  suicide by doing what but by hanging at the time he was found allegedly hanging by a homemade
[1:13:10.900 --> 1:13:16.580]  ligature of sheets are you saying you don't think it was suicide i think that the evidence points
[1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:22.580]  toward homicide rather than suicide why because there are multiple three fractures in the hyoid
[1:13:22.580 --> 1:13:31.300]  bone the thyroid cartilage that are very unusual for suicide and more indicative of strangulation
[1:13:31.300 --> 1:13:37.700]  homicidal strangulation which is what the other people in their cell said it's a couple big guards
[1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:42.500]  they've never seen went in and he began screaming begging for his life and the gorillas broke his
[1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:46.900]  neck you know the last guy that tried to kill him and he told his lawyers going to kill him
[1:13:46.900 --> 1:13:51.540]  is a cop in there for reportedly killing four drug dealers they dug up in his backyard the guy
[1:13:51.540 --> 1:13:58.260]  weighs 300 pounds is a giant roided so that's the first guy they stuck him with but there's nothing
[1:13:58.260 --> 1:14:05.060]  going on here ladies and gentlemen oh let's stick him in a jail cell with a guy in here for killing
[1:14:05.700 --> 1:14:14.740]  four people a cop with his bare hands too and then oh the regular jail guards get sent home
[1:14:15.620 --> 1:14:20.820]  special ones get put in the camera turns off the lights go off and then they hear him begging
[1:14:20.820 --> 1:14:27.780]  and screaming for about a minute because he thought he had a deal he thought everything
[1:14:27.780 --> 1:14:34.900]  was gonna be okay nobody it's not you watch him how assured he is how fake he is in all the videos
[1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:43.300]  he was a concierge an errand boy a grocer at such great riding by millis in uh apocalypse now
[1:14:45.300 --> 1:14:52.180]  when colonel curts goes you're not an assassin you're a grocer here to collect a debt just little
[1:14:52.180 --> 1:15:00.900]  grocer boys little perverts that work for bigger perverts and again the gateway drug is 15 year
[1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:06.420]  old girls they pick up at bus stations and then put on drugs they have medical team to keep them
[1:15:06.420 --> 1:15:11.140]  drugged up and then they'll get them busted by local cops to get them in the system so nobody
[1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:16.020]  believes them and then now it's their job to go get even littler kids and then act like they're
[1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:21.300]  their big sister then they raise them up in this just like the woman he used and her dad was one
[1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:28.820]  of the top guys in mi6 and then she's raised in that i mean you better believe that girl got tortured
[1:15:28.820 --> 1:15:35.540]  too and then they just keep carrying it out and that's how they build these armies of pedophiles
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:42.740]  and you've got the wren fields like epstein who bring the children to dracula but who's

[1:19:21.220 --> 1:19:27.540]  this place together clinton deep state bag man comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[1:19:27.540 --> 1:19:32.580]  and that he lied to congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he
[1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:39.220]  acts confident he won't get indicted but word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him

[1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:36.180]  so all right there's so much to cover and i want to open the phones up
[1:20:36.980 --> 1:20:42.580]  but the epstein thing just huge breaking news that's what the universe works on the same day
[1:20:44.020 --> 1:20:51.620]  footage inside his pito island compound little st. james lucradowski we are changed great
[1:20:55.380 --> 1:20:59.300]  event a great accomplishment went on there got the footage has a lot of courage
[1:20:59.300 --> 1:21:02.820]  where's the rest of the media doing that there are a bunch of lap dogs we're going to get to that
[1:21:02.820 --> 1:21:08.020]  in a moment it's linked up on drudge report dot com up on info wars dot com doctor who
[1:21:08.020 --> 1:21:15.700]  witnessed epstein autopsy death more consistent with homicidal strangulation and suicide isn't
[1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:21.940]  that amazing but pulling back from this i i've just had international media asked me
[1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:29.620]  was epstein really taken out by the establishment well as we say here in russia there's a bear
[1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:37.860]  crap in the woods a fish swimming the water is grass green his mommy lover baby fire engines read
[1:21:39.940 --> 1:21:44.740]  epstein was a man who knew too much he told his lawyer they're trying to kill me you got to get
[1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:49.460]  me out of here uh that the other individual in his cell tried to kill him that they were coming after
[1:21:49.460 --> 1:21:57.060]  him and yes they broke his neck in two places yes the autopsy's come out yes we've been lied to
[1:21:57.940 --> 1:22:02.660]  why would they do something so hamfisted because they've got to get rid of him and remember trump
[1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:09.620]  and the feds didn't control that jail it was new york city and the democrats
[1:22:10.740 --> 1:22:17.300]  that were in control and now epstein is dead there it is epstein told guards before he
[1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:22.420]  quote hanged himself that someone tried to kill him that's his lawyer i tell people that they say
[1:22:22.420 --> 1:22:27.780]  where'd you get that well you must not be reading the newspapers because even mainline news is saying
[1:22:27.780 --> 1:22:36.260]  this is a major major cover-up you bet it is now why was epstein running a scientific club that was
[1:22:36.260 --> 1:22:41.700]  secret out of the albert einstein university in new york nothing to do with albert einstein that's
[1:22:41.700 --> 1:22:46.340]  just the name of the place with the endowment in his name because my knowledge is none of this
[1:22:46.340 --> 1:22:53.300]  going on with albert einstein very interesting fellow but they were having yearly meetings there
[1:22:53.300 --> 1:23:00.100]  as steering meetings and then breakaway meetings in la in seattle in areas of new mexico and his
[1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:06.740]  compound and they were spending great deals of time with epstein all over the world and it's now
[1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:11.380]  known that bill gates was routinely staying with him again along with the queen of england's son
[1:23:11.380 --> 1:23:20.180]  and hundreds of others rich sheiks you name it now you see in the media he tried to see the human
[1:23:20.180 --> 1:23:26.580]  race with his dna that's only one little part of it we know what the group was doing because they
[1:23:26.580 --> 1:23:34.500]  tried to put out pr 15 years ago and then again 11 years ago about oh look oprah whimphrey and bill
[1:23:34.500 --> 1:23:42.740]  gates and ted turner and all these other people warren buffett are meeting at a secret compound
[1:23:42.740 --> 1:23:49.380]  in new york setting up an alternate world government to eliminate 80 percent of the human
[1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:54.180]  population oh and by the way they're obsessed with giving you vaccines that we know are tainted
[1:23:54.180 --> 1:23:58.180]  but let's just roll our sleeves up and they're obsessed with making sure fluoride stays in
[1:23:58.180 --> 1:24:03.220]  gates his own foundation has spent billions keeping fluoride in your water you wonder why
[1:24:03.220 --> 1:24:07.540]  Harvard comes out and says it's causing brain damage low fertility cancer get it out of the water
[1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:11.540]  and american medical journal and there's just thousands of studies and they just go
[1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:21.540]  staying in your water because bill gates cares about you he cares a lot about you just like his
[1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:28.020]  dad the head of plant parenthood did and cold springs harbor and the work they did in world war
[1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:35.780]  two so that's who these individuals are ladies and gentlemen and if you want people that run
[1:24:35.780 --> 1:24:43.140]  the eugenics facility in new york putting things in your body in your children's body
[1:24:44.980 --> 1:24:48.340]  well you have a right to hurt yourself but your children really deserve that because
[1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:54.020]  vaccines are a real science they work but if they're putting syphilis in people by the millions
[1:24:54.020 --> 1:25:02.260]  or hiv in people through the vaccines which is confirmed the hiv homosexual men new york city
[1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:08.020]  1978 79 those are real government documents just like to ski experiment wasn't just black
[1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:14.500]  people in this giggy oh it was people all over the world well your sleeves up you think you're
[1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:19.780]  going to the doctor to get your shot so you don't get measles or months or rubella and you're getting
[1:25:19.780 --> 1:25:29.380]  a little something else there so he was going around getting the scientific elite set up
[1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:34.340]  and on the payroll and first would be hey here's this girl she looks 18 she's really 14
[1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:37.700]  hey we'll take care of it don't worry about it we got a favor we want by the way we're going to
[1:25:37.700 --> 1:25:42.100]  give you 10 million dollars 8 million dollars they're giving the 10 million 20 million 5 million
[1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:45.940]  to just hundreds and hundreds of scientists hundreds of millions of dollars just to harbor
[1:25:45.940 --> 1:25:53.380]  and the bad man was jeffrey eppstein or this consortium on record because they told us 15 years
[1:25:53.380 --> 1:26:00.180]  ago in pr pieces they even have abc news dun dun dun dun the super friends the old 1980s piece with
[1:26:00.180 --> 1:26:06.580]  the heads of david rockefeller and Oprah wimfrey and billa melinda gates and you know all this on
[1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:14.180]  the super heroes heads at the hall of justice they're saving the world from people dun dun dun
[1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:21.620]  dun dun dun dun so i knew who eppstein was and i knew what was going on and i and i had the intel
[1:26:23.620 --> 1:26:29.220]  because if you look at mk ultra and dr ewing cameron and if you look at jolly and west who
[1:26:29.220 --> 1:26:36.260]  worked under him the head of the cia program it's on history channel kidnapped over 20
[1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:42.660]  thousand little girls and little boys in canada in the us and tortured them in ritual abuse at
[1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:49.300]  large research facilities that are really satanic covens with electroshock pcp lsd a psilocybin up
[1:26:49.300 --> 1:26:54.980]  to a year with headphones on brainwashing with keywords creating new personalities to then create
[1:26:54.980 --> 1:27:01.140]  assassins and that was on mpr even last week i told you about it 25 years ago but it's even been
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:08.500]  on history channel guess who the head doctor for all these big so-called serial killers and
[1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:16.580]  terrorist are tim mcvay the unabomber theodore kasinski all of jolly and west who was the
[1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:22.180]  number two in the cia in mk ultra mk Naomi and other programs he would then be the government

[1:33:45.860 --> 1:33:49.620]  i want to finish up with jeffrey ebbstein and the fact that hillary clinton's coming to austin
[1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:53.380]  texas and many other places across the country and it's a great opportunity to go out and expose

[1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:01.300]  issues and give the phone number out and take calls throughout the rest of the broadcast and
[1:34:01.300 --> 1:34:06.900]  cover other news we have some special guests popping in as well but i wanted to just remind
[1:34:06.900 --> 1:34:14.980]  listeners that you just heard absolutely hardcore information that's true and you can go research
[1:34:15.780 --> 1:34:21.220]  where they tried to promote the jeffrey ebbstein run group and what it was doing world government
[1:34:21.220 --> 1:34:27.620]  depopulation secret breeding programs well they're not secret they were admitting that you talk about
[1:34:27.620 --> 1:34:34.580]  mad scientist megalomania stuff the rabbit hole goes very very very very deep and they're not just
[1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:41.620]  impregnating women and then sharing their genetics with those women they're creating clones and that's
[1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:47.540]  what jeffrey ebbstein from my sources and i'm just gonna leave it at that was really doing and did
[1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:57.780]  do and just like i told you that under obama blackwater was uh running black sites for detainees
[1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:05.940]  in china no one else ever released that information okay that's real and i released that info to make
[1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:12.420]  sure it went right to the president because there are people that want to kill me for that
[1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:20.260]  i mean it'll it'll make a huge stir i released that back during the ebbstein as a binary message
[1:35:20.260 --> 1:35:29.620]  to make sure it got taken up through the food chain with the fact that ebbstein was producing clones
[1:35:31.540 --> 1:35:35.460]  well of course hitler was obsessed with clones of himself because he was a eugenicist
[1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:42.020]  and he got his ideas from ibm that financed colespring harbor and the ibm holler with machines
[1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:49.700]  you know the numbers on people in the work camps this is all documented and the globalists were so
[1:35:49.700 --> 1:35:55.300]  arrogant 15 years ago they had pr pieces in the news going oh they're trying to save the human race
[1:35:55.300 --> 1:36:00.500]  by getting rid of 80 percent of this and and it's all run by these people and jeffrey ebbstein is
[1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:06.260]  the guy that manages it now they want to tell you that bill gates has no connection to it or any of
[1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:13.220]  this and bill gates then finances all these tv shows both news and then both fiction attacking me
[1:36:14.580 --> 1:36:18.820]  as the answer thinking i'm gonna shut up because he does that hey billy boy
[1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:26.820]  you'd have done better just keeping your little gremlin ass quiet
[1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:34.340]  but he is a little demon kingpin let me tell you that guy is something else
[1:36:34.340 --> 1:36:40.580]  and i'm not going to sit here and take it and i know you're not going to take it anything happens
[1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:47.540]  to me that's who you blame people like bill gates because he's on my ass i guarantee he's got his
[1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:54.740]  people watching right now i was actually brought a little loop on a bunch of stuff and sworn to
[1:36:54.740 --> 1:37:00.020]  secrecy on it so i'm not going to say anything but believe me you know those billionaires they've
[1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:06.500]  got each one of them whole rooms that just watch this show transcribe all of it and then give reports
[1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:14.740]  to these individuals i wasn't sworn to secrecy on the bill gates part i already knew that years ago
[1:37:15.540 --> 1:37:24.420]  but the other big names they're listening every day because they tune in here and they say how
[1:37:24.420 --> 1:37:32.740]  the hell does he know all this well i have sources and i think you know what some of those sources
[1:37:32.740 --> 1:37:41.540]  are don't you yes you know and that's why you're scared and i'm just here to tell you that you
[1:37:41.540 --> 1:37:48.580]  signed on to the wrong team and we see everything you're doing i don't like seeing what you're
[1:37:48.580 --> 1:37:55.700]  doing it's not enjoyable to see what you're up to but we do see you we can see for miles
[1:37:55.700 --> 1:38:05.140]  and miles and miles just like the who says and boy i think you guys are so close to yourselves
[1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:09.860]  that you can't see what you really are and that you're projecting your hatred of yourself on us
[1:38:09.860 --> 1:38:20.420]  and i'm just here to show you who you are just look at you look at you look at you
[1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:27.540]  look at your soul my and you think you're gonna wallow in that more and transcend
[1:38:29.860 --> 1:38:32.740]  there's one way for the globalists to get out of this and that's to give them their
[1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:39.060]  knees of jesus christ but because you're already slaves to the devil your father you can't do it
[1:38:43.140 --> 1:38:45.780]  but it's still important for you
[1:38:49.460 --> 1:38:50.420]  to be told the truth
[1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:55.940]  because your boss has to get permission
[1:38:55.940 --> 1:39:03.780]  to even blink his eye and your boss is not in charge of anything and neither are you
[1:39:05.380 --> 1:39:12.340]  so you may have a bunch of slaves bowing down to you all day long but you don't run
[1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:18.020]  anything in this universe you don't even run this planet you have just been given a little bit of
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:29.060]  power to test the faithful and you know that but it's important for your minions who believe
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:34.820]  they're going to be given silicon eternal life if they just get on board with the program and kill
[1:39:34.820 --> 1:39:40.100]  everybody do i need to explain to people that if a salesman's saying he's going to give you
[1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:44.980]  eternal life just help him kill everybody first that that might not be somebody you want to trust
[1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:51.460]  too much now i understand that there's such a thing as stockholm syndrome and you're actually
[1:39:51.460 --> 1:39:59.140]  deep down very scared and you're cozying up to the serpent because you think you're safe there and
[1:39:59.780 --> 1:40:08.500]  no you will be torn inside out over a very long period of time quote terry gilliam
[1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:15.220]  but you will be saved for last
[1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:27.380]  i understand you want to start with digital watches and lasers day one why will we have
[1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:32.980]  357 species of parrots i get it and that's why all day you tell us how much you want to guard the
[1:40:32.980 --> 1:40:38.820]  earth while your whole business is about killing it you think the spirit that wants to wipe humans
[1:40:38.820 --> 1:40:51.460]  off likes the planet oh anything made by god this thing can't stand and i'll explain this again
[1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:58.500]  if you were 30 years old and you had a year old baby that couldn't even walk yet and then you were
[1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:05.700]  able to say throw it off a roof or put it in a big vat of bacon grease and fry it or whatever you
[1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:14.820]  want to do you would not have power you would not be a person of any renowned or mark just because
[1:41:14.820 --> 1:41:21.780]  you can rape earthworms like vice and hbo are promoting the power of raping worms you know that's
[1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:29.220]  the most pathetic thing uh exactly but that's what they broadcast renfield each worms again it's
[1:41:29.220 --> 1:41:34.980]  all an allegor you're being told in ram's docker's dracula who they are it's all real and so you're
[1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:40.660]  saying this is pathetic this is ridiculous yes exactly that's all they can offer you have to
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:46.180]  understand these people are already so fallen it's all they can resonate to so these low-level
[1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:53.940]  satanist types can't see anything but the worms you understand that they they only see ugliness
[1:41:53.940 --> 1:42:00.500]  they only see failure they only see that so they they can't see spiritually anything around them and
[1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:07.140]  all the incredible things god's giving us all they see is wanting to torture your baby to death
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:12.740]  because for them that's living and you're like that sounds like hell on earth well because you
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:19.380]  don't want to be in hell you don't resonate with that so it makes no sense to you why would they
[1:42:19.380 --> 1:42:24.820]  have big fat men assaulting christians in downtown austin who go out and have a demonstration with
[1:42:24.820 --> 1:42:29.860]  families because those very men are going to go teach five-year-olds how to have sex with them
[1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:34.260]  that's official austin curriculum each five-year-olds there are different gender and how to have anal
[1:42:34.260 --> 1:42:38.580]  sex so parents come out and finally demonstrate and say no and then men come screaming going
[1:42:38.580 --> 1:42:44.580]  ah you're killing me and start throwing themselves at the families you go why because that's their
[1:42:44.580 --> 1:42:50.180]  food and you're keeping them from the food they need it's all they see is your children
[1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:56.020]  and they're like help me i need your children i'm gonna grow up kill i'm telling
[1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:03.300]  because they're coming they're from hell another dimension it's open
[1:43:03.300 --> 1:43:13.380]  the time has come to defy the thought police they are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols
[1:43:13.380 --> 1:43:19.940]  every year they're waging war on communication itself as the thavian socialist promise they would do
[1:43:19.940 --> 1:43:26.180]  more than 70 years ago from their command base in england we've had oxford come out and ban
[1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:32.260]  clamping the adl and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of college destroy you have you
[1:43:32.260 --> 1:43:37.860]  arrested in some areas if you do the okay symbol that's the international sign language symbol for
[1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:44.180]  okay they know what they're doing these people are authoritarians and they're dangerous and the
[1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:50.260]  answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face we have a it's okay to be okay
[1:43:50.260 --> 1:43:55.300]  politically incorrect ball cap it's black and white very nice as the okay symbol on it it's a great

[1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:13.380]  alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because different types of
[1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:19.700]  physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas it's just
[1:44:19.700 --> 1:44:26.500]  that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all
[1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:33.220]  three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for you
[1:44:33.220 --> 1:44:39.380]  whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is
[1:44:39.380 --> 1:44:44.740]  essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of
[1:44:44.740 --> 1:44:50.260]  reasons lower iq makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality

[1:47:29.460 --> 1:47:40.420]  you can see me now here's a surprise i know that you have because there's magic in my eyes
[1:47:40.420 --> 1:47:57.220]  you can see what the globalists are doing everybody can see we've just been in denial because
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:11.460]  it's so scary but if we break our conditioning and stop living in fear their power over us
[1:48:11.460 --> 1:48:31.220]  appears we can see you miles and miles and miles now who can't see for miles is method aoc
[1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:39.620]  i bet that girl's taken a thousand hits a molly if she's taken 10 000 and she started some big
[1:48:39.620 --> 1:48:48.260]  fat rails of meth until elizabeth warner's hopped up on drugs too until elon musk is on it too
[1:48:49.220 --> 1:48:53.380]  soon as there's a brain chip for that they're gonna want it right away oh there is just hadn't
[1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:59.220]  been rolled out it's next year but yeah we're not in kansas anymore we're not in 1999 anymore
[1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:07.140]  we're in 2020 and beyond the future's here it's just not evenly distributed we're in 2057
[1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:17.780]  by my reckoning but let's go ahead and get to this this is aoc and a hearing
[1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:22.980]  and there's all these republicans and you can see she's looking around and sees that
[1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:26.740]  the democrats are almost all not there in this big huge committee
[1:49:29.140 --> 1:49:35.540]  on energy and so what does she do she she knows i'm not smart but i've been taught invert
[1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:42.340]  okay no democrats are here except me there's a whole bunch of republicans they're all down
[1:49:42.340 --> 1:49:46.980]  in the impeachment fake hearings that are rigged what do i do
[1:49:49.780 --> 1:49:56.340]  and she goes you don't care you're leaving you you you're disrespecting me you're at a cocktail party
[1:49:56.340 --> 1:49:58.180]  and jim jordan and others go are you crazy
[1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:04.420]  we we need to be here but they're having the impeachment hearing and the democrats aren't
[1:50:04.420 --> 1:50:10.180]  here so we're leaving energy so important that we're not even at the impeachment hearing
[1:50:10.180 --> 1:50:14.340]  because of this because you want to turn the power off to the us and no one else
[1:50:14.340 --> 1:50:17.700]  a foreign military couldn't be that deadly but they're funded to do it
[1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:22.580]  and that little demon didn't know what to say and then there's another video after i want to
[1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:30.340]  roll in the next one of uh toleib telling kids how many of you have trouble breathing oh a third of
[1:50:30.340 --> 1:50:36.340]  you oh you're all dying i'm trying to help you breathe the us has super clean air compared to
[1:50:36.340 --> 1:50:41.140]  china and places if we move all our industry there it's even dirtier it goes up in the stratosphere
[1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:47.860]  and comes back and dumps onto the us where the jet stream just so happens to dump over the midwest
[1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:54.980]  in texas that's the truth but she's there you can't breathe can you children hi i'm your palestinian
[1:50:54.980 --> 1:51:00.660]  jihadi here telling you how much we're gonna impeach the mf her praying on children she goes
[1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:07.700]  into that then i've got clips of how they're trying to handle these fake hearings noon as it
[1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:11.540]  uses adam schiff repeatedly coaching witnesses hell it's on record he doesn't and the steve's
[1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:18.020]  gliss explains how they're been instructed not to answer republican questions it's total kangaroo
[1:51:18.020 --> 1:51:21.860]  they've had totally secret hearings now they're having quasi-secret hearings as they try to
[1:51:21.860 --> 1:51:26.020]  training wheel them up to where they're supposed to be and then they're going to have public ones
[1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:32.820]  starting in november to vote for impeachment by thanksgiving to pass on the christian holiday
[1:51:32.820 --> 1:51:37.620]  and then had him out by christmas another filthy little gift from our new world order buddies
[1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:45.620]  which is the globalists the chikams the islamist in hollywood scum the devils alliance now let's go
[1:51:45.620 --> 1:51:55.220]  ahead and roll aoc acting like a complete idiot here it is mr. chairman may i make a comment
[1:51:56.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  i'm i'm i would like to do my job and i try not to get out of my job at every opportunity so
[1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:12.900]  given the fact that we have convened former governor of california and senator whitehouse here
[1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:20.100]  we're here to talk about the very pressing issue of cutting our carbon emissions
[1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:25.460]  and saving our planet and we have an entire political party that's trying to get out of
[1:52:25.460 --> 1:52:31.540]  their job adjourn this hearing and i just want to know what the reason for such a disrespect of
[1:52:31.540 --> 1:52:36.260]  our process would potentially be do we have a reason for why this this hearing is trying to be
[1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:43.220]  adjourned or you know do we have a cocktail party has i have one i have a really easy one the oil
[1:52:43.220 --> 1:52:47.460]  industry is the second largest industry in my state my constituents expect me to be here we are
[1:52:47.460 --> 1:52:51.780]  running it we are running an impeachment hearing down in the basement down in the basement of the
[1:52:51.780 --> 1:52:56.580]  capital right now the oil industry or it's about the economy of the state of north dakota and this
[1:52:56.580 --> 1:53:01.220]  my constituents and the reason why i want to participate in this hearing but i also need i
[1:53:01.220 --> 1:53:04.980]  feel the need to be in the in the skiff because we're only one of three committees that's allowed
[1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:09.620]  to be in the room i can do a lot of things i can't be two places at once i'm completely
[1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:13.540]  comfortable having this hearing i just prefer to have it at a time when i could participate in it
[1:53:13.540 --> 1:53:17.460]  this was the conversation that was brought up and this could not have been brought up before
[1:53:17.460 --> 1:53:22.020]  we convene the senator and the governor we're doing this when they're here we we've expressed this
[1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:26.980]  last week about having two things going on at the same time it's not like we haven't talked about
[1:53:26.980 --> 1:53:30.740]  this but you guys continue to do hearings at the same time there are depositions going on as the
[1:53:30.740 --> 1:53:35.220]  gentleman from north dakota said we can't be two places at once you talk about wanting to do your job
[1:53:35.220 --> 1:53:38.900]  there's no way to do that when you have to be two places at once and just to be clear there was
[1:53:38.900 --> 1:53:48.260]  exactly one democrat in the room when this started here's rashid talib literally terrorizing children
[1:53:49.860 --> 1:53:55.140]  i go into these classrooms and you know the second and third grade classrooms to read
[1:53:55.140 --> 1:54:00.420]  uh you know grace for president and at the end i try to explain what my job is and um
[1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:06.340]  before i begin i just ask how many of you all have asthma we have a hard time breathing in a
[1:54:06.340 --> 1:54:13.380]  third of the class will raise their hand um and i tell them i'm my job is to protect your air
[1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:19.220]  so that you can breathe and uh the kids are like my eyes wide open i said sometimes it's
[1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:22.980]  really hard right it was oh it's really hard to breathe it and they're having anxiety attacks
[1:54:22.980 --> 1:54:29.220]  it's surprising to give them a bunch of no-dos they freak out maybe some lsd this woman looks
[1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:33.700]  like brian stelter like these people don't know how disingenuous and snake like they are
[1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:38.500]  they're tone deaf here let's go back to her while she's smiling like a vampire her eyes wide open i
[1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:44.500]  said sometimes it's really hard right and they said yes and i i tell them that you know we can
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:50.340]  probably get in there and try to clean the water and provide clean water but i don't we can't do that
[1:54:50.340 --> 1:54:56.180]  with air um and the second and third graders sometimes i wish they could be in this room
[1:54:56.180 --> 1:54:59.540]  and make these decisions because they're you know they know what's right and they know
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:05.860]  they don't have any kind of uh political strategy behind it they just know it's just the right thing
[1:55:05.860 --> 1:55:11.220]  to do and i know that's right like the thousands of kids that you that you support get strapped on
[1:55:11.220 --> 1:55:16.500]  by their mothers at age five with with dynamite and hand grenades exactly you love how you can
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:22.900]  brainwash children you stinking witch my god these people are filth uh let's go ahead and

[2:01:59.300 --> 2:02:04.020]  fake transcripts of the president now he's running fake trials let's play these too close back to back
[2:02:04.020 --> 2:02:11.460]  you're there everything you've read this so-called resolution is this resolution with new king
[2:02:11.460 --> 2:02:16.980]  rich offered bill clinton in 1998 well i think the thing people should be asking themselves
[2:02:16.980 --> 2:02:21.860]  especially if you're a democrat and you're on the judiciary committee is where is jerry nadler
[2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:28.740]  nobody's seen him for like two and a half months he's like the missing man in action so clearly shift
[2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:33.380]  in the intelligence committee democrats they they've completely obliterated the intelligence
[2:02:33.380 --> 2:02:39.860]  committee it's now known as the impeachment committee so you know that resolution is just
[2:02:39.860 --> 2:02:45.060]  more the same and i'll tell you you mentioned that you haven't seen this in your you know many years
[2:02:45.060 --> 2:02:52.100]  in in radio and tv i have never in my life seen anything like what happened today i mean they've
[2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:59.780]  been bad at most of these depositions but to interrupt us continually to coach the witness
[2:02:59.780 --> 2:03:04.020]  to decide whether or not what what we're going to be able to ask the witness and we don't even
[2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:08.900]  get any witnesses at this point and it doesn't like look like we're going to get any ever but to
[2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:14.580]  not let us ask questions i've i've never ever had that and to see someone coach a witness
[2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:19.700]  and you know this isn't the first time that you know shifts very good at coaching witnesses remember
[2:03:19.700 --> 2:03:25.940]  he also met with the whistleblower so this is this is just unprecedented adam schiff among many
[2:03:25.940 --> 2:03:30.580]  things has been trying to claim that this is a fair process process by saying that republicans
[2:03:30.580 --> 2:03:36.500]  are allowed to ask questions now he gets to choose all the witnesses and him and himself only which
[2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:42.020]  means it's not a fair process on the face but even his claim now that republicans can ask
[2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:48.260]  questions has been undermined because now he's directing witnesses not to answer questions that
[2:03:48.260 --> 2:03:53.940]  he doesn't want the witness to answer if they're asked by republicans he's not cut off one democrat
[2:03:53.940 --> 2:03:58.740]  he's not interrupted one democrat and told the witness not to answer democrat members questions
[2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:04.580]  but today he started telling witnesses the witness not to answer questions by certain republicans
[2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:10.820]  that that reeks and by the way if you want to talk about a soviet style process again that might
[2:04:10.820 --> 2:04:15.380]  be what they do in the soviet union not in the united states of america we can't stand for this
[2:04:15.380 --> 2:04:21.620]  the american people are being denied equal justice so there you get your soviet union which doesn't
[2:04:21.620 --> 2:04:27.460]  exist since 1991 or so we get that same thing but that's that's that's what goes on in cuba or
[2:04:27.460 --> 2:04:31.060]  north korea ladies and gentlemen and they're doing it to go over the president and these are the
[2:04:31.060 --> 2:04:37.780]  training wheels getting them ready getting them ready getting them ready for when they then come
[2:04:37.780 --> 2:04:42.500]  out and then have the whole show deal in the house with all of the scripted and it's all falling
[2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:46.500]  apart there's so-called you know lieutenant colonel and all this tried to alter the documents that
[2:04:46.500 --> 2:04:51.620]  wasn't able to i mean this is a mission to take down trump by globalists that are hanging off the chai
[2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:55.700]  com tit and they're not gonna get away with it they're losing as long as we stay vigilant and are
[2:04:55.700 --> 2:05:00.820]  very very aggressive about defending our rights we'll be back though with this long-awaited report
[2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:10.180]  on george soros stay with us host asked me alex why do you have two different types of iodine
[2:05:10.180 --> 2:05:16.580]  well that's because different types of physiologies different types of metabolic systems and people
[2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:23.700]  will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other
[2:05:23.700 --> 2:05:30.660]  types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get
[2:05:30.660 --> 2:05:35.780]  both they're both great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family
[2:05:35.780 --> 2:05:42.180]  or friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be
[2:05:42.180 --> 2:05:48.100]  deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower iq make sure sluggish you don't live as long it's
[2:05:48.100 --> 2:05:53.620]  simple get your high quality iodine in four store dot com and help fund the info war info
[2:05:53.620 --> 2:05:59.060]  war store dot com we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about the end it's the iodine
[2:05:59.060 --> 2:06:10.980]  challenge both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off together the answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:06:10.980 --> 2:06:32.740]  you're listening to the alex john show ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting world
[2:06:32.740 --> 2:06:53.620]  wide george soros ladies and gentlemen is a real piece of work he grew up in eastern europe
[2:06:55.300 --> 2:07:00.820]  during world war two and he went around as a bloodhound for the nazis finding where jews were
[2:07:00.820 --> 2:07:07.300]  hidden just like manuel albright's father did and then stealing their goods manuel albright by the way
[2:07:07.300 --> 2:07:10.980]  has been caught was stolen loot from the holocaust that's the mainstream news just look it up
[2:07:11.780 --> 2:07:15.940]  she had people in her house for 60 minutes and people saw this stolen art well yeah her father
[2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:20.820]  stole it from jews he was supposed to save and then he stole them out of the nazis uh and that
[2:07:20.820 --> 2:07:25.700]  was a really evil position that some jews like manuel albright's father and of course george
[2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:33.860]  soros carried out a very wicked position and george soros is really mad at me that i cover this
[2:07:33.860 --> 2:07:45.460]  and i talk about it and he puts out the pr and the disinformation that he's a holocaust survivor
[2:07:47.620 --> 2:07:49.060]  well i guess that's kind of like
[2:07:49.060 --> 2:08:00.340]  saying hitler is a holocaust survivor and i guess he was someone that was around during the holocaust
[2:08:00.340 --> 2:08:04.980]  and he survived i mean i guess technically it's true hitler is a holocaust survivor i think it's
[2:08:04.980 --> 2:08:12.660]  sickening play on words manipulation a legalese issue bill clinton didn't consider blow jobs sex
[2:08:12.660 --> 2:08:18.340]  so he said i've not had sex with that woman but come on george soros didn't survive the holocaust and
[2:08:18.340 --> 2:08:27.140]  hitler didn't either and you know dr steve pacinica has been on the show his he had family died
[2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:35.620]  very close to him in europe who were who were jewish and then he had to he couldn't get into
[2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:39.700]  the u.s he got into cuba when he was a little kid and he talks a lot about that and you know he's
[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:46.580]  jewish and and just how sick it is to know that a lot of people associated with the adl and others
[2:08:46.580 --> 2:08:57.540]  actually made fortunes off of selling their fellow jews out so here's a compilation of clips i saw
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:02.260]  this post to the youtube and they took it down because you can't talk about soros when he went
[2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:08.980]  on 60 minutes and said that it was the best time of his life in an npr interview he called it happy
[2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:19.620]  making time and exhilarating but this was called a operation sugar daddy's the name of this video
[2:09:19.620 --> 2:09:22.980]  posted up on enforce that comment i'll read what he said uh to the new york times here it is that
[2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:29.220]  sounds uh like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for
[2:09:29.220 --> 2:09:41.140]  many many years was it difficult not not at all not at all it was actually probably the happiest
[2:09:41.140 --> 2:09:48.500]  year of my life that year of german occupation for me it was a very positive experience it's a strange
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:54.900]  thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are you're in considerable
[2:09:54.900 --> 2:10:03.300]  danger yourself but you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it can actually touch you you
[2:10:03.300 --> 2:10:10.180]  have a belief in yourself your belief in your father it's a very happy making exhilarating
[2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:18.420]  experience maybe as a child you don't you don't see the connection that was 14 years old and i would
[2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:23.860]  say that that's where my character was made in what way that one should think ahead one should
[2:10:23.860 --> 2:10:33.300]  understand and and anticipate events uh and uh one one is threatened it's a tremendous threat
[2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:40.580]  of evil i mean it's a very personal experience of evil my understanding is that you went out
[2:10:40.580 --> 2:10:49.380]  with this protector of yours who swore that you were uh is adopted god son yes went out in fact
[2:10:49.380 --> 2:10:57.060]  and helped them to confiscation of property from the jews that's right well actually the funny way
[2:10:57.060 --> 2:11:04.660]  it's just like in markets that if i weren't there and somebody else would would be taking it away
[2:11:04.660 --> 2:11:10.100]  anyhow you know was the whether i was there or not i was on the spectator the property was being
[2:11:10.100 --> 2:11:16.740]  taken away at the center of george sorris there's an inherent contradiction which is which is on one
[2:11:16.740 --> 2:11:22.580]  hand you're the you're the capitalist who does not care about the social consequences of his act and
[2:11:22.580 --> 2:11:27.300]  on the other hand you are a philanthropist who cares only about social consequences i don't feel
[2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:34.020]  guilty because i'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt
[2:11:37.460 --> 2:11:39.780]  i am engaged in a amoral
[2:11:39.780 --> 2:11:52.900]  activity now have you ever heard something more satanic more sociopathic where you have no feelings
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:12:01.860]  for anybody except yourself maybe a little and you don't even see it as bad that you're going
[2:12:02.420 --> 2:12:07.220]  and tricking people to let you into their hiding place claiming you're running from nazis that's
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:12.500]  what he would do he was 14 and small for 14 so they were saving a kid he would come in and
[2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:17.300]  then remember it all then run out at night and bring the nazis they called them bloodhounds
[2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:20.420]  translate that out of german if you want it's scarier sounding
[2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:28.660]  and he says oh i was just fulfilling a role so if an enemy army took over america he would
[2:12:28.660 --> 2:12:36.340]  just oh i'm i'm just going to help them i'm not bad you see he wouldn't fight them he would just
[2:12:36.340 --> 2:12:41.780]  choose who was he thought was going to win and then he would just side with it and then he would
[2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:49.940]  not feel bad at all he would call it happy making and exhilarating and uh it's funny the pot is
[2:12:49.940 --> 2:12:58.580]  it's funny i uh did not care and then he figured out oh my god i showed him who i really am the
[2:12:58.580 --> 2:13:05.700]  guy was in our articles in the 80s saying i am the messiah not the jewish messiah not the christian
[2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:12.500]  messiah he just said i am the messiah i am going to be the messiah he said i don't like to tell that
[2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:19.700]  as much they say they might lock me up but i am the messiah you know both my grandfathers almost
[2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:26.980]  died in world war two in the army air corps both of them almost died my mom's dad was went off the
[2:13:26.980 --> 2:13:31.540]  army air corps from ut football with with uh you know the founder of the dallas cowboys
[2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:38.580]  that's just an interesting little footnote uh and uh they were in the army air corps and they
[2:13:39.460 --> 2:13:44.660]  they all almost died and a lot and about half their friends died about half the people in the
[2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:49.860]  army air corps the first three years the war died my dad's dad was in north africa
[2:13:52.660 --> 2:14:00.820]  and they bombed their base and he got hurt and so the plane went back up with the co-pilot
[2:14:00.820 --> 2:14:05.860]  and they got they died over italy so my grandfather would never even really talk about his life he
[2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:09.860]  died we got all the stuff we knew he was in the army air corps all those amazing letters back all of
[2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:17.220]  it but see i my family fought hitler and now that man has the adl and southern prairie law
[2:14:17.220 --> 2:14:25.860]  center say i'm a nazi that is obscene ladies and gentlemen i almost don't exist in time and space
[2:14:25.860 --> 2:14:36.740]  because of hitler and then a monster that served him and rounded up jews
[2:14:37.380 --> 2:14:42.980]  funds lawsuits and attacks on me and my family and lies and i'm just if there's justice in
[2:14:42.980 --> 2:14:49.860]  this universe my god can't we do something about george soros and his son alexander that
[2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:56.260]  openly funds antifa and the documents republic who are an antifreeze speech group who wear black
[2:14:56.260 --> 2:15:04.260]  uniforms just like the nazis the the guy that finances the sugar daddy of the antifreeze
[2:15:04.260 --> 2:15:12.020]  speech antifascist group is a nazi i mean if he said it was terrible i apologize oh my god i feel
[2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:19.060]  so bad no it's a happy making a exhilarating oh imagine a vampire you know over a baby it's
[2:15:19.060 --> 2:15:25.140]  drinking the blood of exhilarating that's a nice oh and he's telling you all this he's so tone deaf
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:30.260]  like stelter looks like a damn demon on tv he can't even i mean you look like a child molester
[2:15:30.260 --> 2:15:37.700]  stelter i'm not saying you are your pervs you're evil and you don't even know it you know i didn't

[2:20:32.020 --> 2:20:34.740]  so george soros was in the new york times
[2:20:34.740 --> 2:20:42.660]  friday we mentioned this but i never got around to going deep into it and here's the
[2:20:43.620 --> 2:20:53.380]  headline of the article right here george soros has enemies he's fine with that
[2:20:53.380 --> 2:20:59.300]  have a special guest next segment now here's an article from the new york times november 14
[2:20:59.300 --> 2:21:06.820]  2016 less than a week after the historic election globalism a far right conspiracy theory bullied
[2:21:07.780 --> 2:21:15.300]  by trump and then you read it and it goes on to say alex jones started the made up movement
[2:21:15.300 --> 2:21:21.380]  globalism doesn't exist trumps picked it up it's insane they claim there's a global government
[2:21:21.380 --> 2:21:24.660]  they claim they want to get rid of national sovereignty and open up the borders and have
[2:21:24.660 --> 2:21:29.540]  the un flood the west with third world populations then capture the west which is exactly what it is
[2:21:30.580 --> 2:21:37.860]  and they go on to say it does not exist now here is the new york times last friday
[2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:43.140]  saying soros is proud to be the leader of globalism and then he's going to defeat america he says
[2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:48.580]  we'll defeat the nation states globalism a far right conspiracy theory buoyed by trump
[2:21:48.580 --> 2:21:57.220]  and then it just goes on from there you can go read both of these articles that are online
[2:21:58.740 --> 2:22:02.340]  they want to say what is globalism and they say it doesn't exist it's made up
[2:22:04.660 --> 2:22:10.820]  says laura southern a host of right wing canadian media rebel media explicitly rejected its use
[2:22:11.540 --> 2:22:17.380]  as a seminary for globalism in a video clip she posted online in september she said the word
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:22.180]  meant ruled by autocrats very good definition such as president obama former president george w
[2:22:22.180 --> 2:22:27.460]  bush and the united states who value the false flag diversity of unchecked immigration from the third
[2:22:27.460 --> 2:22:33.300]  world well the debuts they say we're technocrats establishing a world government and gg ping went
[2:22:33.300 --> 2:22:42.180]  there that very same time frame about a month later a few months later in early 2017 and said we
[2:22:42.180 --> 2:22:50.260]  will defeat america together with yunker the dictator of the eu whose grandfather was the
[2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:56.660]  richest nazi he can't make that up i'm sorry globalist almost always sneer down their nose at
[2:22:56.660 --> 2:23:02.420]  tradition to stay national culture laugh at religion and generally despise the west
[2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:06.660]  while holding a creepy affection for the third world they want to use it as a weapon
[2:23:06.660 --> 2:23:13.380]  it's a great definition here and then it goes on to talk about how i'm the guy creating it and
[2:23:13.380 --> 2:23:19.060]  pushing it to trump uh and that i'm the main guy exposing it and it doesn't exist the digital
[2:23:19.060 --> 2:23:23.220]  control panopticon control system engineered by shadow corporate and political elites he called
[2:23:23.220 --> 2:23:28.020]  it the total form of slavery is my definition of globalism then it just goes on to talk about
[2:23:28.020 --> 2:23:34.260]  trump and i where'd the idea come from and it goes on to say alex jones and i'm very evil
[2:23:34.260 --> 2:23:40.420]  well it comes from the globalist calling themselves globalist 50 years ago mr jones
[2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:45.060]  had pivoted to what he thought was most important the coming destruction of the globalist that
[2:23:45.060 --> 2:23:49.700]  hijacked the country close quote primarily the news media and international business people
[2:23:49.700 --> 2:23:55.140]  soon they would be destroyed once and for all he suggested i didn't say business people i said the
[2:23:55.140 --> 2:24:01.780]  crony capitalist that rig things only for themselves this is america battling back to store humanity
[2:24:01.780 --> 2:24:07.780]  and break the chains he said there's not going to be any detente we know you're scum we're here
[2:24:07.780 --> 2:24:11.380]  just let you know you're scum so that's just part of it it goes on and on
[2:24:14.660 --> 2:24:18.420]  now here's soros friday you can go read it for yourself but he says
[2:24:20.260 --> 2:24:23.940]  i have a lot of enemies and i'm glad they're my enemies and yes i'm funding globalism and
[2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:28.980]  yes my form of globalism is good and we're gonna stop the censorship with the right wing and trump
[2:24:28.980 --> 2:24:34.660]  and we're going to stop the evil of the borders being controlled and we're going to regulate the
[2:24:34.660 --> 2:24:39.140]  banks that means banks he doesn't control the Rothschilds don't control
[2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:47.940]  and it just goes on from there but it says he's a he's a humanitarian he's a wonderful person
[2:24:47.940 --> 2:24:52.260]  this guy's known for crashing dozens of economies and bankrupting people and until he bought off the
[2:24:52.260 --> 2:25:00.260]  us media in the 90s he was a villain on the nightly news notably it goes on that the arc of history
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:06.100]  is turning back to globalism trump is still doing a tremendous amount of damage he said
[2:25:06.900 --> 2:25:13.220]  lifting himself at his desk a bit i mean just last week what he's done in the middle east oh
[2:25:13.220 --> 2:25:17.060]  yeah the peace breaking out has been devastating for america's influence the world he said referring
[2:25:17.060 --> 2:25:22.500]  to the withdrawal of troops from syria actually keeping a promise mr trump is an aberration
[2:25:22.500 --> 2:25:26.260]  and he's clearly putting his personal interest ahead of the national interest he said
[2:25:27.460 --> 2:25:30.580]  again that's total inversion this guy says america should even exist
[2:25:32.420 --> 2:25:36.900]  and he didn't call for a tax on the rich they're all tax exempt offshore when he and bill
[2:25:36.900 --> 2:25:46.420]  him will indigates and all them spout that disinfo and then he goes on to say that he wants to fight
[2:25:46.420 --> 2:25:51.860]  for free speech and that what the NBA is doing is wrong and acts like he's battling communist china
[2:25:51.860 --> 2:25:55.940]  total bulls he knows china is losing the war with america so now he's pivoted because he thinks
[2:25:55.940 --> 2:25:59.060]  america's winning so he said i i worked with the nazis because i thought they were winning
[2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:05.460]  and it was happy making and wonderful i just played the clip earlier happy making funny exhilarating
[2:26:05.460 --> 2:26:12.020]  oh it sounds like he went to like the greatest beach in the world or saw the greatest man how
[2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:18.820]  was it happy making exhilarating i oh it's a funny oh imagine anyone else saying that
[2:26:20.980 --> 2:26:26.500]  oh you help round a bunch of juice oh you're so special good oh oh oh your son's photographed
[2:26:26.500 --> 2:26:30.740]  everywhere doing satanic rituals how's the crawly rituals he wants us to know he's a satanist oh
[2:26:30.740 --> 2:26:35.140]  you're so powerful we're so scared of you you look like a sack of maggots
[2:26:35.140 --> 2:26:41.540]  he goes alluding this week in his voice to revan dr. mondal mutal king
[2:26:42.420 --> 2:26:47.620]  juniors fan called the arc of the mortal universe is long but it's been towards justice
[2:26:47.620 --> 2:26:53.940]  mr. soros took issue with the idea of societies were predisposed towards being open oh the left
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:58.660]  creating a really open society with all of our freedoms being taken the arc of history doesn't
[2:26:58.660 --> 2:27:05.620]  follow the arc of history doesn't follow its own course it needs to be bent he said i am really
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:08.660]  engaged in trying to bend it in the right direction
[2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:16.740]  so he thinks he can because he goes on your quotes about god and and god
[2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:21.700]  bends justice towards the people that are righteous he says no it does not do it
[2:27:21.700 --> 2:27:29.780]  i'm going to do it for you well thank you lord soros we're very glad to know you're there
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:37.300]  you're very arrogant delusional like your father satan i was with my father he was exhilarating

[2:34:04.580 --> 2:34:09.060]  college dropout from chicago that's his own description that's what i did too i just like bill
[2:34:09.060 --> 2:34:14.020]  gates and rush limbaugh he worked on the campaign for donald trump 2016 and host a nightly youtube
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:20.180]  show called america first and he gets a lot of really powerful videos and things i'm gonna play
[2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:25.220]  some good video in a moment from the folks he's talking about turning point usa and charlie kirk
[2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:30.740]  we're gonna play this charlie kirk thing in a minute and it's not my intention to be an infighter
[2:34:30.740 --> 2:34:36.340]  or to attack people like charlie kirk um and if charlie kirk has his own show which i know
[2:34:36.340 --> 2:34:40.660]  he does and he doesn't want to have somebody on it that's his right but when it's a public campus
[2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:46.740]  and he starts telling people don't let this person in and there's not a security issue
[2:34:47.460 --> 2:34:51.060]  that's anti for leftist very dangerous very unamerican i'm the washington post

[2:36:17.620 --> 2:36:22.180]  and so they've got all these great campus groups i've been invited by turning point usa groups to
[2:36:22.180 --> 2:36:25.620]  speak at different colleges i haven't been able to yet because we've been too focused here in the
[2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:30.980]  bunker so there's a lot of great people in turning point usa and they go there and produce all this
[2:36:30.980 --> 2:36:35.060]  great video and all this great movement which is good but then we don't want to become at the
[2:36:35.060 --> 2:36:42.420]  leadership level uh what we what we're fighting so nick pointe joins us now we'll play some of
[2:36:42.420 --> 2:36:46.820]  these clips because at first correct me if i'm wrong you were saying you've been barred then
[2:36:46.820 --> 2:36:51.700]  turning point denied that and that's charlie kerrks issue and now you have the footage of it indeed
[2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:57.780]  happening so this is this is not good i mean i already smelled some foul odors emanating out
[2:36:57.780 --> 2:37:01.940]  of the top of it in the last year or so i just wanted to be supportive because it's you know it's
[2:37:01.940 --> 2:37:08.500]  got a lot of grassroots folks feeding key intel up uh but to give us your take yeah that's correct i
[2:37:08.500 --> 2:37:13.460]  went to politicon this weekend and i went there as a general attendee you know i didn't go there to
[2:37:13.460 --> 2:37:18.260]  make a big scene i didn't go there to cause trouble i went actually to get a picture with charlie
[2:37:18.260 --> 2:37:22.900]  kerrk and i think you played just a small clip there i went to go get a picture with charlie
[2:37:22.900 --> 2:37:28.420]  kerrk the big man from turning point usa well you're right uh his organization the rank and file
[2:37:28.420 --> 2:37:33.460]  sometimes do a good work uh but i was stopped i was intercepted by security at politicon and
[2:37:33.460 --> 2:37:38.660]  actually several police officers if you see in the video it's not like i was in uh some kind of
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:43.300]  threatening posture or anything i went up to get a picture and i was intercepted by five or six
[2:37:43.300 --> 2:37:47.620]  police officers who told me i would not be allowed to take a picture with charlie kerrk yeah and
[2:37:47.620 --> 2:37:52.900]  there it is um and then that escalated the next day rather i think it was the same day but a few
[2:37:52.900 --> 2:37:57.940]  hours later i went to attend his debate with kyle kalinsky who is a leftist it's actually sort of
[2:37:57.940 --> 2:38:03.060]  ironic inside that debate charlie kerrk talked about how free speech is under attack and censorship
[2:38:03.060 --> 2:38:08.820]  is so bad and just outside that debate where he was saying that i was blocked by probably a dozen
[2:38:08.820 --> 2:38:13.940]  police officers from even entering the event because they said that i might be disruptive which of
[2:38:13.940 --> 2:38:18.740]  course was not the case i told them i wasn't going to disrupt um and then all of this was exposed
[2:38:18.740 --> 2:38:24.420]  last night at charlie kerrk's ohio state university event for his campus tour somebody asked him you
[2:38:24.420 --> 2:38:28.660]  know call them out on his hypocrisy and said you know you say you support free speech he says that
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:34.260]  he'll take any challenge from anybody at any time on any idea and yet at politicon uh nick
[2:38:34.260 --> 2:38:38.340]  fuentes was banned from the conference and charlie kerrk i don't know if you could see the video but
[2:38:38.340 --> 2:38:43.140]  he played dumb he said oh who i don't know what you're talking about you mean politicon security
[2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:47.940]  kept him out and it's sort of interesting because if you watch the rest of the q and a some other
[2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:52.340]  questions were asked about me and my involvement with ashley st claire who was fired from turning
[2:38:52.340 --> 2:38:56.660]  point because he was photographed with me and from his answers you could tell that charlie kerrk
[2:38:56.660 --> 2:39:01.140]  very much knows who i am he very much is trying to prevent me from interacting with him but
[2:39:01.140 --> 2:39:05.140]  during that event he played dumb and said i have no idea what you're talking about are you talking
[2:39:05.140 --> 2:39:10.500]  about the anti-semitic white nationalist troll and this is exactly what these people do it's just
[2:39:10.500 --> 2:39:16.500]  as you said they are using the same antifa left-wing tactics which is censoring shutting down using
[2:39:16.500 --> 2:39:21.540]  police arm security using thugs and also using the same smears you know anybody that we don't
[2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:27.860]  like their ideas that we don't like they must be racist they must be white nationalists anti-semitics
[2:39:27.860 --> 2:39:32.260]  it's crazy just before i went on sebastian gorka who used to work in the trump administration
[2:39:32.260 --> 2:39:37.300]  actually tweeted out a little clip from my show and said this vile person is on twitter
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:41.620]  and he's verified this is somebody in the trump administration that's effectively calling for me
[2:39:41.620 --> 2:39:45.700]  to be censored online these are supposed to be the people they're in favor of free speech these
[2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:49.540]  are supposed to be the people fighting tech censorship and here they are supporting it because
[2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:54.740]  i have the wrong opinion so and let's play those two clips you're talking about back to back here
[2:39:54.740 --> 2:40:02.260]  it is my question is for charlie um charlie uh i wanted to ask you about you trying to and look
[2:40:02.260 --> 2:40:11.620]  to get into west point you uh you said that you applied to west point but they gave your place
[2:40:11.620 --> 2:40:17.300]  to an applicant of a different gender and persuasion i know the test scores i knew the
[2:40:17.300 --> 2:40:21.380]  qualifications she was less qualified so my question is uh if they were of different gender
[2:40:21.380 --> 2:40:25.940]  do you know what gender they were i never said that that's fake news thanks for being here tonight
[2:40:27.620 --> 2:40:32.820]  never said that thank you for being there i eventually lost my spot out to what i felt
[2:40:32.820 --> 2:40:38.820]  was a far less qualified applicant in my district that was of a you know a different gender and a
[2:40:38.820 --> 2:40:42.900]  different you know persuasion you could take it any way you want but i i knew the test scores i
[2:40:42.900 --> 2:40:48.100]  knew the qualifications i was kind of got the short end of the stick but an applicant of a
[2:40:48.100 --> 2:40:53.060]  different gender and persuasion you know a different gender and a different you know persuasion that's
[2:40:53.060 --> 2:40:58.100]  fake news never said that i know the test scores i knew the qualifications i knew the test scores i
[2:40:58.100 --> 2:41:04.020]  knew the qualifications that's fake news never i reject this idea of dual loyalty i have loyalty
[2:41:04.020 --> 2:41:10.340]  to ideas and of course i love the grand canyon i love the rocky mountains and i love boston i love
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:15.460]  chicago but if all that disappeared and all i had was ideas and we were on an island that's america
[2:41:15.460 --> 2:41:20.340]  that's israel because that's what people have to realize that america is just a placeholder
[2:41:20.340 --> 2:41:26.180]  for timeless ideas and if you fall too in love with you know oh the specific place and all this
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:30.180]  that's you know that's not what it is israel would be an exception because there is a holy
[2:41:30.180 --> 2:41:35.380]  connection to this land and when you sat at that club in there to talk about after the break but
[2:41:35.380 --> 2:41:41.300]  there you go i'm floating airplane with this guy after the rnc 2016 seemed like a nice guy
[2:41:42.020 --> 2:41:45.540]  and you know i like the idea i like the fact that they have contact with trump
[2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:49.540]  and i like what the members are doing they're great people but yeah i know there's a lot of
[2:41:49.540 --> 2:41:56.420]  other videos online too of him really telling whoppers of lies or he has amnesia brain damage
[2:41:56.420 --> 2:42:01.700]  and it doesn't have uh any type of long-term memory i mean maybe maybe he's got a head a head
[2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:06.260]  injury what do you think yeah no i definitely think that's possible certainly he could be
[2:42:06.260 --> 2:42:10.980]  mentally retarded as you like to say or he could just be straight up lying you know we've seen a
[2:42:10.980 --> 2:42:15.780]  lot of cases of this where people get involved in conservative politics and maybe say one thing
[2:42:16.420 --> 2:42:20.340]  and then they get donors and then they get people funding their organization they get some connections
[2:42:20.340 --> 2:42:25.060]  they rub shoulders with powerful people like the president or his son in the case of charlie kirk
[2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:29.220]  and then all of a sudden their opinions start to change and then suddenly you know their love
[2:42:29.220 --> 2:42:34.900]  for america becomes a love for another country so yeah i mean he could have been uh brain damage
[2:42:34.900 --> 2:42:38.340]  maybe dropped on his head or something or he could just be straight up lying in which case we
[2:42:38.340 --> 2:42:42.420]  have to hold him accountable and that's what we're trying to do are you saying though from
[2:42:42.420 --> 2:42:47.380]  from one of the trump sons or from trump that we're getting the things he's saying i think it's
[2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:52.180]  because he's just trying to be everything to everybody and that's what conservatives always
[2:42:52.180 --> 2:42:56.900]  do and the left controls the whole debate we'll talk about we come back regardless it's not good
[2:42:56.900 --> 2:43:02.900]  stay with us

[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:50.000]  The bell rings
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.200]  The fight starts
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:55.600]  The evil fall
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:47:59.400]  Black sunshine
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:02.600]  Nick Pointes is our guest
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:06.500]  And he's worked for the Trump campaign, political activists, I've seen some of his work
[2:48:06.500 --> 2:48:10.000]  Going out and exposing leftists
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:15.200]  So why is he upset with Turning Point USA?
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:18.900]  Well, I mean, I've seen a lot of things, I've seen them get very, very soft
[2:48:18.900 --> 2:48:24.400]  And I saw them when Candace Owens said that Hitler was a globalist
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:30.300]  And he literally had the plan for the EU, world government, a thousand year rike
[2:48:30.300 --> 2:48:36.200]  The left really liked a lot of those ideas, they used to like Hitler particularly and his race stuff
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:40.400]  And then Turning Point turned on her and she left
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:44.400]  So I'm not an infighter and I like Turning Point USA and the members and what they're doing
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:49.100]  But when you find out that they've got a list of people they don't let come into these supposedly open deals
[2:48:49.100 --> 2:48:54.800]  And then their champion college is being opened and Trump says he'll sue colleges or take their money
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:48:59.100]  If they don't let people into these things or let people speak
[2:48:59.100 --> 2:49:02.500]  And Mr. Foyntes is saying he's never gone and taken one of these over
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:09.400]  Why does Charlie Kirk not want you to speak because you bring up stuff about how he changes his stories?
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:12.600]  Or what is it? I mean, what got you on his trail?
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:18.900]  Well, so this all started last week when I think a few people that watched my show, that watch my broadcast every night
[2:49:18.900 --> 2:49:23.600]  They went to his event at one of the universities in Colorado where he was giving a speech
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:26.100]  And they asked him a couple of questions which I don't think he liked
[2:49:26.100 --> 2:49:30.400]  I think the first person asked him about our foreign aid to Israel
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:32.700]  You know, the question was very simple. It was this
[2:49:32.700 --> 2:49:39.400]  Why do we give $3.8 billion per year to Israel when you have a lot of poor countries that we don't give that much aid to?
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:42.900]  And when Israel actually doesn't provide that much of a strategic benefit
[2:49:42.900 --> 2:49:48.800]  Charlie Kirk didn't like that question. He said that Israel is our greatest ally and God bless Israel and all that
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:55.900]  We had another person go up and ask a question and say, you know, illegal immigration is obviously something that Turning Point stands against
[2:49:55.900 --> 2:49:59.700]  But Turning Point USA is in favor of mass legal immigration
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:04.200]  On my show we oppose not just mass illegal immigration, but mass legal immigration as well
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:10.200]  You know, we know that the demographic change that's taking place is really not so much a problem of legal status
[2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:13.700]  But more a question of where these people come from, what they believe and so on
[2:50:13.700 --> 2:50:17.900]  But in any case, he was asked these two questions at that event and he didn't really have a good answer for them
[2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:21.700]  He was asked four questions by people to watch my show the next day
[2:50:21.700 --> 2:50:28.000]  Questions about the First Step Act where President Trump passed the First Step Act and this released rapists, murderers, all kinds of people
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.500]  And I love President Trump. I campaign for President Trump
[2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:34.300]  This was a bill that was designed by Jared Kushner and it's letting criminals out on the street
[2:50:34.300 --> 2:50:39.400]  Something that Charlie Kirk supports. He was asked further about Israel, further about legal immigration
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:44.100]  This went on at that event in Iowa the next day. It went on the next day then in New Hampshire
[2:50:44.100 --> 2:50:49.000]  So we had three consecutive events where Charlie Kirk was questioned by people to watch my show
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.700]  About his support effectively for globalism
[2:50:51.700 --> 2:50:57.200]  The three gripes that we have with Turning Point USA is that he is not a patriot on immigration
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:01.500]  You know, he thinks it's fine if we're stapling green cards to people's diplomas
[2:51:01.500 --> 2:51:05.300]  You know, and they get a green card and immigrants are coming in and taking high-skilled jobs
[2:51:05.300 --> 2:51:08.000]  So he's not a patriot on legal immigration
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  We think he's anti-Christian because he peddles and promotes degeneracy
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:16.500]  He's taking pictures with Lady Maga, some kind of make America great again theme
[2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:20.000]  Drag Queen supporting homosexuals in his organization
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:23.500]  And then lastly, he's not a patriot in terms of his own country
[2:51:23.500 --> 2:51:29.500]  I think a lot of people suspect rightly so that he has a dual allegiance or a dual loyalty to Israel
[2:51:29.500 --> 2:51:33.500]  And I've said before, whenever you criticize Israel, they call you anti-Semitic
[2:51:33.500 --> 2:51:38.000]  I know you've experienced the same thing. I don't hate Israel. I don't really think about Israel
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:44.500]  I think about the foreign aid money. I think about the fact that they had spying devices discovered on the White House lawn
[2:51:44.500 --> 2:51:48.000]  That originated in Israel. This is a country that we get support
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  It's just about every way, shape and form. Monetary support, military support, political support
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  I wanted to get you on, and it's funny that in Israel
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:52:01.500]  I wanted to get you on because I saw these videos and I saw articles about it
[2:52:01.500 --> 2:52:05.000]  Where they're trying to keep you from coming to those while saying they're open
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  And they're doing this and they basically didn't stand up for Candace Owens, which I don't like
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  And then I've seen some of the stuff. Personally, I'm a libertarian
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  And so I like the fact that Trump, you know, at his convention in Cleveland said, we don't hate you if you're gay or lesbian or whatever
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  I get your point, though, about it's already being paraded everywhere with the trannies going after the kids and, you know, all that
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  And so why sit there and make that the main message?
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  But it's not about even agreeing with your message or disagreeing with what you're doing
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  It's the fact that he's doing this. But since we go into this Israel deal, this whole third rail of everything
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  I've had the New York Times say I'm anti-Semitic when I don't even talk about Israel
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  I do not dislike Israel. I think if you turned it over to the Muslims, they don't kill each other forever over it
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  I understand. I'm like Rand Paul. I don't like foreign aid, period
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  But it is a thing where you can never bash Israel enough
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  So you kind of went off into Israel and you're saying that's something that really upsets him to bring that up
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  I think it's wrong for him at a college forum to try to censor people and their questions
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  When they're doing it politely and it's professionalist and he's advertising it as open
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  But the Israel thing, I would say a large part of the right wing has it as a split point for people
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Whether you worship Israel on one end or whether you absolutely hate Israel on the other
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  And I just think it's all a giant red herring
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  You know, I have all these right wingers attacking me because I know about the Chaikom influence
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  They say I'm covering up for Israel. I mean, I've just looked into it. Yeah, all these countries spy on us
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  We spy on them. I don't like it. They find Israeli spies to arrest them
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  But it's literally this thing from the left obsessing on Israel
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  And again, I'm all for you asking the questions and you're folks asking it
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  But it's a leftist thing that obsesses on Israel. That's why I literally want to throw up when I hear about it
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  Well, right, and you're exactly right. And that's fine if people don't agree with me
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  You're a libertarian. I'm a conservative. We can have disagreements, you know, and that's fine
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  But the conservative movement, the Big Ten movement should not use the tactics of the left of censorship
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  You know, if Charlie Kirk is a libertarian on the issue
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  Oh, yeah, that's the message I'm getting in here is why the hell is he doing this?
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  Right. Well, right. And that's just it. What is he so afraid of?
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  If he's got a different opinion, that's fine. He should have the courage of his convictions to stand up and answer the questions
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  And, you know, he did answer our questions last night, but then why ban me from politicon?
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  Why have armed security? If he's such a small government libertarian, why does he have 12 armed police officers stop me?
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  I'm like 5'10 trying to enter in and attend his political speech where he's talking about free speech
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  You know, to me, that's the great hypocrisy
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  And I'm sure there's a lot of conservatives that don't totally agree with me or aren't on board
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  But I think they would agree with me that Charlie Kirk should not be such a hypocrite on the issue of free speech
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  If you build your career and make your case on I'll engage with anybody anywhere anytime on any idea
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Then that doesn't have an asterisk that says except when it's inconvenient except when my donors don't want to hear that
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  Except when my, you know, political people in Washington D.C. don't want to hear that
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  You know, this whole thing could have been averted. I wouldn't be on Infowars right now
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  There would be no controversy if he simply allowed me to take the picture or go into the event
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  And I think a lot of people are now scratching their heads. He's almost exposed himself
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  He's made a bigger deal out of it than it is
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  And they're wondering, what is he so afraid of? Why does he not want to stand these questions?
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Why can he not defend these ideas?
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  And, you know, I totally agree with you and I'm sure the article is up on infowars.com
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  I'm trying to find it right here, but the Washington Post has come out and said it's time to repeal the First Amendment
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  To have a hate speech law where anything they define as bad gets banned
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  We have folks getting arrested for the n-word just walking down the street in Connecticut
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  I don't agree with the n-word, but I agree with you right to say it
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  I mean, they're really getting rid of the First Amendment
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  I've got all these lawsuits by the Democrats. They say they want to end my speech
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  So to have them doing this to you, I agree, is wrong and it's stupid
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  I mean, let you answer the question or let you say it. He gets to answer it and say what he wants. It's just crazy
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  Yeah, well, exactly. And you know what else is so troubling is after this whole event
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  We see people like Benny Johnson who works for Turning Point USA
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  And other people that are connected to the organization
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  You might have seen this on Twitter, you may not have
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  But people are now standing up and calling everybody who asked questions last night at his Ohio State University event
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Who asked about Israel, asked about his support of homosexuality, so on
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  You've now got people working for Turning Point USA saying that if you oppose the Charlie Kirk conservative agenda
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  You're a homophobe, you're a racist
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  I think Benny Johnson said we were the Westboro Baptist kids
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  Because we're Christians because we support the Bible teaching that opposes homosexuality
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Oh, absolutely. And listen, you have a right to do that
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  And I agree that none of this sexualization should be promoted to children
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  And there needs to be a major pendulum back the other way
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  I was simply saying that they can't come in as neo-conservatives and then try to shut out all the classical conservatives
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  By the way, I have libertarian leanings to my audience
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  I'm trying to promote a big tent here
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  But I think everyone should keep their views and bedrock American values are about Christianity
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  That's where we came from and his statement that America doesn't have a spiritualism or doesn't have roots in God is not true
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  This is a holy land, I believe in manifest destiny, I believe in America's destiny
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  And I think this land is just as special as other places in the world that I think are also special
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  The holy land where Israel is very, very special, I think things have happened all over the world are very, very special
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  And I do think there was a little bit sycophantic of him to sit there and say that America does not have a biblical place in the pantheon of holy places on this planet
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  It is special, we'll be right back
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  Supercharges all of it

[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you don't know
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  But I'm here to tell you, every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis

[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  Welcome back, Mike Adams, he is ready, he is like a stallion in the gates before the race
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Taken over, and then there's the War Room Owen Schreuer, knocking out of the park
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  We've got a special report tonight that I'm filing with several big subjects, 6pm central at band.videoinfowars.com for a plus show
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  And we've also got a live pre-Halloween special, I'm going to do tonight right after
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  Firepower with Tom Papert and Will Johnson, I am going to be hosting until midnight up here
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  There's going to be some surprises, infowars.com for a plus show
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  And there is also on the radio and TV satellites that folks want to pick that up and carry that
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  And I'm going to have some fun, but I'm not going to screw around much
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  You know, I used to have more fun around here, we had a big prop room, bunch of costumes and outfits
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  I've dug some of those out, got some new ones, so tonight should be interesting
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  But we have a lot of serious stuff to cover as well
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  And I went down to UT and had some interesting confrontations with the left trying to shut down my speech
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  And saying that I was a liar
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  And you see that, we don't deserve to have speech
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  And the university's become these cancers of anti-free speech
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  And the very group that says it's championing that starts blocking people that are asking questions
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  That I think are legitimate questions, but even if they were illegitimate, you're coming, you're there, you're thrown out
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  I also think it's stupid for the head of Turning Point USA to think he can turn it into a mini version of what AOC or Hillary would do
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  Because I guarantee if I try to go to the Hillary event, that's not this Saturday, but next Saturday in Austin
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  We'll obviously be covering it, I'll be out there
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  And they will throw me out, somebody even bothering me to buy tickets, because we've tried before
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  Well that's Hillary Clinton
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  So again, I hope he stops this, but I gotta say they shut that photo of Charlie, I gotta make a joke
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  He looks like a brunette version of Adam Schiff, so that can't be a good thing, I'm joking, go ahead
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  Yeah, no, you're exactly right, it's pretty horrible to see what's happened to the conservative movement
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Because you know, I've been in this for two, three or four years now
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  I remember watching when I was in high school, Donald Trump appear on your show
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  And it was probably one of the coolest things I ever saw
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  And I think everybody believed in 2016 that things were going to be different
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  You know, with Donald Trump being an insurgent in the Republican Party, the hostile takeover, and then becoming president
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  I think everybody believed that it was going to be a real America first movement
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  The John McCain, Mitt Romney, George Bush conservative movement, Big Ten conservative movement was done
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  And so then to see all these people that wear the MAGA hat, people that they co-opted Donald Trump message, co-opted Donald Trump
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  Look, the optics and everything, for them to then use the same tactics of the left
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  You know, they're really embracing this monote party globalist mentality
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  You say it's a left or the right, I think it's really sort of more of the same conservative stuff that we saw 25, 30 years ago
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  It's not the first time this happened. You know, there was a big battle in the 1980s and the 1990s
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  Some people might remember this, between the Paleo-Conservatives and the Neo-Conservatives
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  Where people like Sam Francis and many others were kicked out and shut out of the conservative movement
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  Blackball, fired from the end
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  Yeah, let's be clear, the big corporate money, the Koch brothers, all of them, they come in and routinely, every decade or so
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  Try to kick all the patriots, the Christians, the conservatives out
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  We build the movements, we get people elected, then they throw us overboard
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  And you don't like all these swaggering leftists coming in, speaking for everybody
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  We give them our energy, we give them our money, we promote them
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  And then they just enslave everyone under them and throw canned to so-and-so overboard
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Well, exactly, and it's even happened to you
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  You know, we've seen the same people like Ben Shapiro and others who have lambasted you and called you a conspiracy theorist and so on
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  And so what we really have to keep an eye out for is the gatekeepers
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  You know, I'm all for being a Big Ten movement
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  If people disagree with me, they're more libertarian leaning like you said yourself
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  That's great, that's fine, we want that to happen
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  Yeah, yeah, Big Ten, but you still get your speech
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  You get to say, I don't think you should be posing with a tranny
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  That's your right to say that, that doesn't make you excluded
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  Exactly, exactly right, they should embrace the Big Ten mentality
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  Because we really have to understand that we will either hang together or we will all hang separately
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  Because the left is coming for everybody
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  And so they think, well, if I just shun Alex Jones, if I just shun Nick Fuentes
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  Well, they won't come for me, but you see they're coming for Steven Crowder on YouTube
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  Oh, they cover people one after the other
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  Come back again for a full hour with us soon, because here's the deal
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  I don't care if men will dress up like women, just stay away from my kids
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  But now it's so promoted, they're like pear-trooping in
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  Because it's camouflage, these are just a political opera
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  Well, that's because different types of physiology
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  Different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  It's just that simple
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  Because some people need all three types to absorb
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  Others like the pure atomic iodine
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  Get both, they're both great for you
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  It's simple, get your high-quality iodine at infowarstore.com
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  And help fund the InfoWar, infowarstore.com
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  It's the iodine challenge, both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  All right, Mike Adams is taking over
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  And I've decided that I'm going to broadcast till midnight tonight live
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  A couple special reports that we're going to premiere tonight
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  6 o'clock Central, infowarstore.com for his last show
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  Mike Adams is about to take over
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  But I would really be lacking here on many fronts if I don't do this
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  We have first-rate products that will make your life and your family's life better
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  Just type into a search engine, even the game ones will show this
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  That living in a big city takes five to ten years off your life because of the particulate in the air
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  It has nothing to do with fossil fuels, ladies and gentlemen
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  It's all of the diseases and the microbes and the little micro-toxins that are coming off
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  All of the chemicals and things that are being used
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  Well, filtering your air in your house and outside your house is critical
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  Keeping your car clean and keeping it on recirculate
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  And having an electric pure breeze in your house, three or four in your house
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  One will do it like a big room is essential
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  I've got them all over the office
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  I've got them in every major room in my house
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  They also make like a white noise on high
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  You can put it on the no sound mode as well
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  When these first came out, other four-stage ion filters were $800 on average
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  It came out about four years ago
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  They were selling them for $350 or $400, that was a great deal
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  Now because of miniaturization and cost, they started costing $250
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  And then we would sell it, we'd make $50, they'd make $50
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they did this last year where they're the biggest seller
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  I have a deal with them that if they're ever going to sell off to their dealers at cost, I get the first call
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  Well, they have a little over $2,000 last week
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  They said, okay, via contract, we plan to sell $2,000 off to dealers who are our biggest dealers at cost
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  In fact, do you want all of them?
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  And I said, yeah, I want every one of them
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  And so I got them, ladies and gentlemen, for a little bit below cost
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  I've got like $120 and it's free shipping on top of it
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  So no one can beat this
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  You cannot get any filter this good for less than, you know, $350, okay?
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  This is a super good system
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  No excuses to get it for yourself, get it as a gift for family
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  Christmas is coming up and there were $2,000 this weekend
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  I don't know what there are now
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  It says it's still in stock up there at our shopping cart
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  Because when something's sold out, it's automatically off there
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  So that means we've still got it, 95% reviews, 542 reviews
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  Alexa Pure Breeze, Air Purifier, lowest ever cost, $147 plus free shipping
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  Last year we had them for $154, I think it was, and it wasn't free shipping
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  This is an amazing deal
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  That way you don't have to pay taxes on them
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  And he's done, because he likes to take off in December with his family
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  He wants to be out of these by December
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  And so we're coming through with him right now
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  The great folks bringing the Alexa Pure water filtration systems
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  All of it, they're great people
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  Mike Adams coming up, owns a big top lab, he's testing them
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  He found ours are amongst the cleanest and best out there
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  Alexa Pure Breeze and the Pro Pure
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  Yeah, we just go out and find whatever he has the best ratings
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  That's a good cost, that's what we sell
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  I mean, I would not sell you something that we don't test over and over again
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  A, because I treat you like I want to be treated
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  I use this, my family uses it
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  And they're also testing all our stuff, folks, trying to set us up
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  You know, they tested all of our supplements a few years ago over and over again
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  Found nothing in them, and I said, watch, they will, and they did it again
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  Oh, we found barely California standard, yeah, right, folks
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  You can open a can of something in California
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  And enough stuff gets in there under their laws to say it's toxic
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, the scams, the left pulls
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  You see their scams everywhere
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  The point is, Alexa Pure Breeze, air purifier, lowest cost ever
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  $147 at cost with free shipping, that is the most insane loss leader ever
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  And they will sell out very, very soon
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to end the massive
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  Everything must go super sell, 40, 70% off
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  For free shipping, double patriot points
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  Because a bunch of stuff is selling out
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  The Vaso Beats, the Ultra 12
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  Now it's twice as strong than the Secret 12
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  Amazing, vitamin B12, the body's ultimate turmeric
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  I mean, it's 95% or humanoid, leading brands are 5%
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  We've got everything at infowarstore.com
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  Right there for you, we have the other great product
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  Living at Defense Plus to flush out all the little unwanted visitors
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  And your guts, people are blown away by it, literally
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  infowarstore.com, it's all 50% off on those things I just mentioned
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  But it's going to have to end this weekend because a bunch of it
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Is literally about to sell out, watch
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  Right in a week, these things won't be there I'm mentioning
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  Vaso Beats, Living Defense, all of it
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  I'm keeping the prices low
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  Folks are telling me, hey, go back to full price before they sell out
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Then it'll sell out over the next few months
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  At the full price, you can fund yourself, dumb, dumb
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  And I'm like, yeah, next year we're not doing 50% off anymore
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  Because we don't make any money
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  Because we don't have giant markups
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  And so it'll be 40% off next year, it'll be the best deal we can do
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  But I've said it, I've said I'm selling out of it at these prices
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  I'm doing it, we put the skin cream up a few months ago
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  50% off, I lost money on those
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  Because I made the mistake, I'm not spending a lot of time
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  On the marketing, I just make sure the products are amazing
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  So, take advantage of it all, infowarstore.com
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  Do your Christmas shopping now, and that way you don't fight the crowds
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  Any of it, do it early, be smart about it
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  And fund the information warfare operation we have against the globalists
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  And by the way, back in stock, vitamin mineral fusion
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  Again, has amino acids, everything, fruit punch, you absorb more of it

[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  But most of these sales have to end by Monday
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  Now, Mike Adams, I appreciate being here, naturalnews.com
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  A titan of research in the fight against the globalist
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  Thank you for taking over the broadcast
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  Tell us where you think we are right now in the fight for a pro-human future
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  Well, today we're going to be covering science and medicine, including new revelations
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  We've got the goods, and FDA scientists has come out and admitted
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  That there are cancer genes in vaccines that can be activated
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  And that the FDA cannot detect
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  So there are stealth cancer genes, going to be covering that today
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  Alex, as well as some other topics including the cover-up of Life on Mars by NASA
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  So all that straight ahead, and by the way, that deal you have on the air filter
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  The Alexa pure breeze, what's the name of it?
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  Anyway, it's a screaming deal
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  People should definitely get that, yeah, Alexa pure breeze, $147, are you kidding me?
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  I think I've paid $350 for a filter in our lab that's not as good
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  So definitely take advantage of that folks, I mean, Alex isn't exaggerating
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  That is below cost that you're going to see anywhere else in the world
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  So that's what we have coming up also today
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  I'm going to be covering a little bit of sort of what's good and maybe what we should question
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  I'm going to dig into flat earth theory, since this is a science and medicine segment of the show
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  I'll cover that at the bottom of the hour, going to talk about some of the things that the flat earth advocates are getting right
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  And then some of the things that I believe they're getting wrong
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  But it's going to be a real fascinating discussion
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  It's an exciting time when people can ask big questions, question everything
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  That is a motto that has a lot of value, so I'm going to be getting into that as well
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  And just to segue into that, let me mention up front that the great thing about Infowars
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  And the reason that you know Infowars is real, it's legitimate independent news with independent thinkers
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  Is because no one is ever told what to say on Infowars
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  I mean, I've been posting for years and I got to tell you, there's never once, not even one time
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  Has Alex or any producer called me or texted me and told me what to say or what not to say
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  And that's the way it should be, and that's why you're going to hear intellectual diversity
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  Different views, different opinions, different assessments of what's happening in the world
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  You notice how the lying mainstream media is always the same script all the time
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Because they're just actors, and they're not even journalists anymore, they're just puppets
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  They're media puppets who are told exactly what to say
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  But here at Infowars.com, as Alex always said, it's teleprompter free
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  I don't have a teleprompter, I've got some printouts, I've got some notes, some things that I'm going to cover
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  But no one has a script for me, and if someone ever told me, you have to read this script
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  You have to say this or say that, I would say Sianora, not interested, because that's not what we're about
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  We are intelligent, independent people, all of us here, all the different hosts, all the different shows
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  From Owen Shroyer, and David Knight, and Alex, and all the different guests, and even the fourth hour guests as well
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  Everybody is thinking for themselves, and as long as we keep doing that, we're going to find the right answers
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  So I encourage you to think for yourself, and stay tuned here, because what we have coming up
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  For the fourth hour here of the Alex Jones show, it's going to blow your mind in science, medicine, technology, and health
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  Trends analysis, real conspiracies that are actually happening, and much more
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  This is Mike Adams filling in here for the fourth hour, we'll be right back after this break with much more
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones show at infowars.com, we'll be right back
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher

[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:11.000]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  And it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  Because they didn't get enough iodine, that's what you say all the time
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  But I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true, but dad, it's right here on the periodic table
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:35.000]  When I click it saying exactly what you said, and I said, I know honey, that's why I have you take the high quality
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Neurosurgical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  And I know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  Because of iodine deficiency, research it and find out for yourself now
[3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:03.000]  Infowars.com
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  Alright, we're back. Fourth hour here. Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams, stepping in
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  And we have been doing a lot of investigations recently about the ingredients in vaccines
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  And of course some of those ingredients include what are called Aborted Human Fetal Cell Lines
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  Now these are cell lines that have been cloned for decades after they were harvested from an aborted baby back in the 1960s
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  And two of these cell lines are called MRC-5 and WI-38
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  Now if you search the CDC's website or the FDA's website, you can see the disclosure that these ingredients are used in many common vaccines
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  Including chicken pox, MMR vaccines, many different vaccines. It's listed on CDC documents
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  So as part of the research that we were doing on this, it came to our attention recently that a lab in Italy
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  And we've reported on this before here at Infowars, a lab in Italy had run a gene sequencing protocol on the genetic code that's used in these ingredients
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  The MRC-5 and the WI-38. And that lab found that it's an intact, fully developed human gene sequence
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  And you can see right there, if you're watching on video, you can see MRC-5 is in hepatitis A vaccines as well as verivax, MMR and other vaccines
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  So they found this complete human genome. In other words, it's the genetic blueprint for an entire human being that's in the vaccines
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  And you've been lied to of course about vaccines. You've been told that vaccines are only about having a viral strain in there
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  You know like a weakened influenza or a weakened hepatitis. It's really much more than that. Why are there human genes in there?
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  I mean complete human genes. What are human genes doing in vaccines?
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  Well the researchers dug further and they found that there were 560 modifications to that genetic code
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  Modifications that increase the risk of expressing cancer. So there are literally over 500 cancer genes for a human blueprint that are put into vaccines on purpose
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  That are injected into you and your children as part of this true medical horror that is now wreaking havoc across our world
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  And you may recall Monday we had the producers of Vax2 on the show right there in studio at Infowars. I was interviewing them and they told
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  They mentioned a lot of bombshells like you know they toured the country with a bus
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  And they talked to moms and dads who come up to them in tears saying their children are dead or their children have been maimed, hospitalized or made autistic
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  It was described by one of the producers as a quote war zone of dead children across America
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  And that film Vax2 is launching in theaters I believe November 6th
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  So since then I decided to do more research because obviously that's what we do here. We're real media. We research things
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  And continuing to dig on this I found just a bombshell document on the FDA's website
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  And this is the first anybody is reporting this that I'm aware of. This is the exclusive right here at Infowars
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  The document is called Investigating Viruses in Cells Used to Make Vaccines
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  And Evaluating the Potential Threat Posed by Transmission of Viruses to Humans
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  This is by Dr. Arifa S. Kahn K-H-A-N. It's posted on the FDA.gov website
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  I'm going to read to you just the third paragraph from this document. This is a bombshell
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  In some cases, the cell lines that are used might be termogenic. That is, they form tumors when injected into rodents
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  I should say tumorogenic. Not turmeric, but tumorogenic
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  Continuing, some of these tumor forming cell lines may contain cancer causing viruses that are not actively reproducing
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  In other words, stealth viruses. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods Dr. Kahn writes for the FDA
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  These latent or, quote, quiet viruses pose a potential threat since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  What this document is admitting is that the very process of manufacturing vaccines can activate the cancer causing properties in these vaccines
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  And when you combine that knowledge openly admitted right here by the FDA, when you combine that with the fact that we now know
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  There are 560 altered, modified cancer genes from a human blueprint put into vaccines and injected into children
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  Then you start to wonder, well, what would the impact of that be? Of course, massive cancer, massive death, massive depopulation
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  Huge revenues for big pharma and cancer everywhere
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  And of course, the same companies that make the vaccines that are putting these cancer properties, these stealth cancer viruses into the vaccines
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  I mean, genetic code into the vaccines. Those are the same companies that profit from cancer treatments
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  So they are making money off cancer, chemotherapy, you know, all the treatments for chemo brain and liver damage and kidney damage that's caused by chemotherapy
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  It's a revenue producer and children are being inoculated with cancer potential to make sure that there are future revenues for big pharma
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:18.000]  By doing this, big pharma has in fact ensured itself a long-term future stream of revenues
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  Now I've got a special report on this at Brighttown.com, free speech platform where we can talk about these things
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  It's about a six-minute clip. We're just going to roll two minutes of it right here to give you a taste of it
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  This is a bombshell. See it at Brighttown.com. We're going to upload this to band.video also as soon as that channel is ready
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  This is bombshell. Go ahead and roll that clip
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  If you've ever wondered why cancer rates are so high in first world nations, especially the United States
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  Well, you're about to find out. The truth is you've been injected with cancer-causing genes and it's all deliberate
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  And the way we know this is because a company, well a laboratory in Italy, ran a DNA human genome sequencing analysis of the MRC5 human diploid cells that are used in multiple vaccines
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  Now, if you didn't know that vaccines are made with aborted human fetal cells, then you're way behind the curve on being up to speed on this
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  Because multiple vaccines are made with MRC5 and WI38. These are both called human diploid cells. They are cloned cell strains that were originally harvested from an aborted male baby back in the 1960s
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  Who was being carried by his mother who was a psychiatric patient, mass mental illness. She had this abortion. The medical industry took those aborted human fetal cells
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  And they've been cloning them ever since and they've been using them to grow the measles virus and the rubella virus and the chickenpox virus
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  And then they inject those cells with the DNA of the aborted human baby into your children
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  Well, by the way, all that's admitted by the CDC, the FDA, the vaccine companies, etc. This ingredient is listed on their vaccine insert sheet
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Go to nationalnews.com. You'll see all the links to the documents there. I link to the CDC. I link to the FDA. I link to GlaxoSmithKline. It's all right there
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  It's just openly talked about by the vaccine industry
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  But what's new is that this laboratory in Italy ran a DNA analysis, human genome sequencing, and found that the genes that are part of it
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  You can see the rest of that clip at brighttown.com and eventually at Bandot Video as well
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  Look, this is information that the mainstream media refuses to report. You're only getting this information from the independent media
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  We are the real journalists. We are the real researchers. We are the real scientists

[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here. I don't care what your views are.
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:19.000]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them. That's important. But we have something in common. We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress in the world. He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:36.000]  But word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:41.000]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand. Not so fast criminal. We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:33:06.000]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy. But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at InfoWare.com, NewsWare.com and Band.Video.
[3:33:06.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:36.000]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams here stepping in and yes, in this segment, we are going to get into Flat Earth Theory.
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  So if you've got friends who are advocates of or critics of Flat Earth Theory, which seems to be this exploding phenomenon for whatever reason, a lot of people are interested in this discussion.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  We're going to delve into that in this segment and just a quick little background.
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  You know, I work in the realm of science every day. I run a science lab. We do mass spectrometry every day. Got multiple mass spec machines, you know, analysis of pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals and things like that.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  And so, you know, take it for what it's worth. Everybody's got a different view on everything. But I want to say up front, I'm convinced the Earth is a sphere.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  However, I strongly agree with the process of questioning everything and I welcome that process. So I'm going to go into that here. What does the Flat Earth Theory get right?
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  Or what do Flat Earth Advocates get right? And perhaps in my view, what are they getting wrong?
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  And what's great about this whole conversation is that here we are free speech, independent media.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  You know, we can talk about these things right out in the open and we might not have the same, you know, views on them and that's okay.
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  But I'll give you my views and you can take it for what it's worth and maybe it's convincing. I am going to give you a method, by the way, that you can use a rifle scope to confirm that the Earth is a sphere.
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  I will give you that method here at the end of this segment and you can try it yourself. It has to be a certain type of rifle scope.
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  But let's get into this. First of all, what are Flat Earth Theorists doing that's correct in my view?
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  Number one, they are questioning everything. And that's awesome. And that's exciting. In fact, we're being lied to in so many ways by the globalists, by the banks, by government, of course.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  And even the realm of science and medicine is filled with so much BS. You know, we're questioning it every day.
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  I mean, I research vaccines all the time. I research pharmaceuticals. I research a lot of science topics.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  And I find that the establishment is constantly lying to us about everything, including NASA, by the way.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  And so when Flat Earth Theorists talk about, hey, NASA is lying to us, the government's lying to us, that there are cover ups.
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  When they say those types of things, they are not wrong. They are not wrong to question these big narratives.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  In fact, NASA has been lying about the presence of life on Mars since at least 1976, when the first Viking lander, I think it was Viking one, maybe it was Viking two.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  But Viking lander 1976. And the scientist name was, I think, Dr. Frank Levin.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  He should have gone down in history as the first scientists who have discovered life on Mars, because they were looking for microbial life.
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  And they use a simple mass spectrometry instrument. And so that was over four decades ago.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  They knew there was life on Mars, but they covered it up. So NASA has been lying to us all this time.
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  In fact, that scientist, Dr. Levin, knows very well. They ruined his career, his reputation, in essence.
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  They shut down his experiment after it confirmed the presence of life on Mars.
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  Second point, and I've covered this on the show here, too. NASA believes there is an atmosphere on Mars.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  And the way we know this is because NASA is sending a dual rotor helicopter to Mars with the Mars rover 2020 mission.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  Now helicopters, you may recall, don't work in a vacuum.
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  And even though NASA says officially that the atmospheric pressure on Mars is only 0.6% that of Earth's,
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  they're still sending a solar-powered helicopter there to fly around in basically a vacuum.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  It doesn't work. Propellers don't work in outer space, and they don't work in vacuums.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  So the only reason NASA would send a helicopter to Mars, and by the way, it's called Scout.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  And it's Bridenstein, I think the NASA administrator has talked about. It's been all over the media.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  It's called Scout. It's going to fly ahead of the rover.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  This helicopter would not fly unless there were an atmosphere.
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  Now, if there's an atmosphere on Mars, it means that NASA has been lying to us for decades.
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  And that is true. I'm convinced that NASA is lying almost all the time about almost everything.
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  Now, does that mean the Earth is flat? No, not in my view. Does that mean the moon landings were faked? No, not in my view.
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  And I'll explain my view. But on that point, I want you to know, like, look, I'm the founder of Brighton.com, the video platform.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  I welcome your videos on these topics, even if you disagree with me. I welcome them.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  You're not going to get banned on Brighton. You're not going to get banned because we support free speech.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  We support people having different points of view on these things.
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  I noticed it wasn't long ago that YouTube was saying they're going to ban what they call fake science videos.
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  And they mentioned, I think, flat Earth. And they also mentioned concern about GMOs or anything that countered the narrative of vaccines.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  They ban all those videos on YouTube. And you notice how they lump all that together.
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  So anytime they want to attack GMOs or, I mean, critics of GMOs, or if they want to attack vaccine skeptics, for example, who they call anti-vaxxers,
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  or if they want to attack people who believe there is a globalist government, which there obviously is, it's openly admitted now.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  But they always throw in flat Earth. Why do they do that?
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  Because in the minds of the mainstream media and the globalists, they think that they can use flat Earth to discredit anybody's beliefs in other areas.
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  They try to lump them together and say, well, gosh, these people believe vaccines are dangerous and they believe in flat Earth.
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  And so that's a tactic that they use.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  And by the way, there's no doubt in my mind, there are some elements of the flat Earth movement, a few elements that are probably controlled opposition.
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  But most of the people who are pursuing flat Earth theory as a thought experiment are actually well-intentioned people.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  They're curious. They're curious about the world around them, curious about the nature of the universe.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  They're curious about why are there all these secrets about Antarctica?
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  Why is no one seemingly allowed to go there, right?
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  Why do some things that we've been told over the years not add up?
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  And that process is extremely valuable.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  And I celebrate the process of asking really big questions, even though I may disagree with you on the conclusion.
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  Now, the other thing that flat Earth people get correct is to say that consensus in the realm of science doesn't mean anything.
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  So, for example, people attacking the flat Earth theory will often say, well, there's scientific consensus that the Earth is a sphere.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  But those same people say, well, there's scientific consensus that carbon dioxide is bad for plants and will destroy the planet.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  So, you see, scientific consensus can be wrong because carbon dioxide is a nutrient for plants.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  Carbon dioxide is turning the planet green.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  So, if 97% of scientists, they say, agree that carbon dioxide is bad, then I would say that 97% of scientists are idiots.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  Complete morons who don't understand basic atmospheric chemistry.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  So, consensus does not equal truth even in the realm of science.
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  So, that process is correct by flat Earthers to say, well, consensus doesn't really mean truth.
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  I agree with that. I still disagree with their conclusion.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  Again, I believe the Earth is a sphere.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  I believe that the planets orbit the sun, right?
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  This is what I'm convinced is true. But I agree with the process of questioning these things.
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  And I agree with the right to speak and the right to ask big questions.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  So, I just want to be very clear that that's my position.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  Now, there are some ways that you can prove to yourself that the Earth is a sphere.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  I'm going to get into those in the remainder of this segment and also the next segment.
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  Now, I welcome anyone to challenge these. I welcome discussions.
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  You can post videos on Brighttown.com.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  Like I said, you can post articles, whatever you'd like to do.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  We totally welcome that process because we are not the science high priests of absolute truth
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  like the vaccine industry claims to be.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  We are people who are willing to ask big questions.
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  But I have run some tests, okay?
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  I've talked to some flat Earthers and I've run some tests that they suggested to me.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  And the tests proved, in fact, the opposite of what they told me.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  The tests proved that the Earth was a sphere.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  So, here's what you're going to do, the first test.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  You can do it with a rifle scope.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  You have to use a rifle scope that has milli radians in the scope.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  Those are just called mills if you're a long range shooter.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Now, mills are measurements of angles, essentially.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  And if you look at the moon through your rifle scope, you can measure the number of mills
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  that the moon takes up in your scope picture.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  That number of mills, according to Flat Earth Theory, at least as I understand it,
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  they say it should be different if the moon is straight overhead
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  versus if the moon is at the horizon because it's moving much farther away from you.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  But in fact, if you run this experiment yourself,
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  you will find the moon is the same milleradians no matter where it is in the sky,
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  indicating the moon is equidistant from us at all times.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  I'll have more straight ahead, more experiments that you can run.
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  I agree, we should question everything.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  Much more straight ahead here.
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  Mike Adams, infowars.com. We'll be right back.
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  Well, that's because different types of physiology,
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  It's just that simple.
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  Get both. They're both great for you.
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  Bottom line, iodine is essential. That's why I harp on it.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish. You don't live as long. It's simple.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  Get your high-quality iodine at infowars.com and help fund the info war.
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  infowarsstore.com.
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  It's the iodine challenge. Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:07.000]  All of our bodies are different. All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  But I'm here to tell you.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis,
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  my life completely changes. I'm healthier. I have more energy. I lose weight.
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  I look better. Everybody notices.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2,
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  body's ultimate turmeric.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from infowars life
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  and when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is gut fusion.
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  Folks, check it out. There's nothing else like it.

[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  because they didn't get enough iodine. That's what you say all the time,
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality,
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  nutraceutical grade. Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant. It's why you're so alive.
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids you're age.
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  They know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  Infowars.com. Hey, Steve, how you doing? Hey, Alex.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:09.000]  Oh, my God. Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  And I was in there until June. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem.
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  And I stopped and waited for about five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every test.
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials,
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have any stuff.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it.
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  Man, that stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:57.000]  Anybody who's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:01.000]  It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  And living defense is over the top good.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  And we're back with our discussion of Earth and space, astronomy, flat Earth theory and much more.
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  A quick correction I inadvertently in the previous segment referred to the NASA scientists
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  who built the experiment that discovered life on Mars as Frank Levin. It's actually Gilbert Levin.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  At least I got the Levin right. At least I didn't say Mark Levin.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  Like the first scientist that discovered life on Mars and master the Constitution.
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  No, it's Dr. Levin. And again, the reason we have trouble remembering who this guy is is because they erased the history of his amazing discovery.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  He was actually called on the night that they discovered life on Mars.
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  He was called by Carl Sagan, who congratulated him for the greatest discovery in the history of science, and then NASA covered it up.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  So the fact that NASA covers things up, the fact that NASA just constantly lies,
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  the fact that NASA turns off the cameras every time a UFO comes into view on some kind of orbital platform,
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  tells you that, yeah, you can't trust NASA. But from that, be careful folks.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  From that, you cannot conclude that the Earth is flat just because NASA lies.
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:38.000]  And so what I'm doing here is discussing what I think is right and wrong about flat Earth theory,
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  you know, from a point of view of real physics and science, the laws of physics and how the universe works and so on.
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:51.000]  And just to recap the last segment, I agree with the premise of asking big questions and being curious about the universe.
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  I also want to add, I'm not attacking people who are part of this movement who are advocating this theory.
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  I think most of them are motivated for good reasons of curiosity, intellectual curiosity,
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  and they have constructed some very interesting, what I would call thought experiments about physics and how things work.
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  So I'm not attacking them. Again, I think their process is very good. I disagree with the conclusion,
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  although there probably are a few controllers or controlled opposition people at the top who are really pushing this to try to discredit
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  anybody who has a, quote, alternative theory about anything, you know, whether it's vaccines or GMOs or what have you.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  Now, I mentioned this experiment that you can use to prove that the Earth is a sphere.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  Well, essentially, you're proving that the moon is always the same distance from our planet or, you know, very close to always the same distance.
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  The orbit of the moon is not exactly a circle. It is very slightly elliptical, but it's so slight that it's not even worth considering.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:58.000]  So we can essentially say that the moon's orbit around Earth is a circle. The moon is equidistant from Earth.
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  So what you can do, like I said, just to sum up last time, you can take a riflescope that is, that has a reticle in milli-radians
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  or what are called mills, and you can measure the size of the moon in your scope.
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  And the size of the moon will always be the same in your scope, whether it's directly above you or close to the horizon or somewhere in between.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  That contradicts what was explained to me by a prominent flat Earth theorist who wanted to, he wanted me to run some experiments
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  to see if it was true or false. And he told me in it quite a lengthy phone call that the moon is, according to him,
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  the moon is much closer to the Earth than we've been told, and that the moon is a disk, I think he said,
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  or maybe another kind of flat object in the sky, and that the moon and the sun move sort of parallel to what he called the flat Earth,
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  and they move farther away and they appear to disappear over the horizon, and then they come back around, you know,
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:02.000]  kind of circling the perimeter of the flat disk, he said.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:10.000]  And so he said that if I look at the moon and measure its angular size, that the moon would appear to be larger when it's directly overhead
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  and then much smaller as it gets close to the horizon because it's moving much farther away.
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  And that was the theory that was explained to me. So look, hey, I'm an open-minded scientist.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  So I said, sure, I've got long-range rifle scopes. I'll just take this Schmidt and Bender scope off my 338 Lapua rifle here,
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  and I'll point that sucker at the sky, not with the rifle attached to it, right, because you don't want to shoot at the moon.
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  That's just insane. But you point the scope at the sky and you can measure the moon. And guess what?
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:46.000]  It's always the same size. It's always the same size. Now, then some people say, well, wait a minute.
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  When I look at the moon on the horizon, it looks bigger. It looks smaller directly overhead and it looks bigger toward the horizon.
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  So that's the opposite of what the Flat Earth theory predicts, at least as it's been explained to me.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  But that is simply an optical illusion because when it's close to the horizon, you're comparing the moon to buildings and trees and things that are on the horizon.
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  In fact, if you measure it, and I challenge you to do this, you'll see that the size of the moon is the same no matter where it is in the sky,
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:20.000]  which indicates the moon is always the same distance from the Earth. So that right there is inconsistent with Flat Earth theory.
[3:52:20.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  The other thing that you can do is you can check your satellite dishes and you'll notice that if you take a lid of a cooking pan,
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:40.000]  something made out of metal, and if you position that lid right over the satellite dish that's pointing to a geostationary satellite that's in a single fixed position in the sky,
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:46.000]  you'll notice that that satellite signal is blocked. And it's a very easy experiment to do.
[3:52:46.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  If you're getting satellite bandwidth or satellite TV or what have you, you can easily interrupt that bandwidth by just interfering with the beam between your dish and the satellite that's in orbit.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  Now, if the Earth were flat, then there wouldn't be geostationary satellites in orbit at that correct distance from the Earth, which I think is 22,500 miles or something very close to that.
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  So the only reason that satellite dishes work is because they're satellites. And the only reason satellites can orbit a planet is because the planet is essentially a sphere.
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  So GPS, for example, how do you get GPS signals out of the sky? Well, there are GPS satellites flying around out of the sky, flying around, orbiting around, I should say, around the Earth to be more precise.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  So I'm not sure what the Flat Earth theorists say, how do satellite dishes work? How do satellites work?
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  I think their theory, if I'm not mistaken, is that there are no satellites. And I don't see how that can be reconciled with what we know to be true about how satellites work and satellite dishes and GPS and so on.
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  Again, I'm not attacking anybody personally over this. I'm just saying that satellite dishes work great and GPS works great.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  And in fact, GPS works at very high altitude. The other day, I was actually sitting in the co-pilot seat of a jet as we were up at, I think, 37,000 feet.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  And a friend of mine was allowing me to fly since I have flight experience. I'm trained as a pilot. So I was there actually adjusting altitude and adjusting our heading and things like that.
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  And I was actually flying the jet, which is pretty cool. I mean, you know, with assistance. But from the co-pilot seat, at that altitude, you can absolutely see the curvature of the Earth.
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  And as I've heard it from Flat Earth advocates, they say that when passengers look out of the windows on the airplanes, the reason it's curved is because the windows have a lensing effect and it makes the Earth look curved.
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  Well, okay, but I was looking from the co-pilot seat right out the front of the cockpit, and I can see that the Earth is gently curved from that altitude, saw it with my own eyes.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  And I'm sure if we went higher, we would see even more noticeable curvature. And by the way, those jet windows are not lenses. If they were lenses, it would be dangerous to fly because they would distort everything.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  In fact, they're manufactured for optical clarity and for allowing light to pass through unaltered. Otherwise, jets would be slamming into each other and the ground and mountains and terrain all the time.
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  So I've actually seen this for myself sitting in the co-pilot seat of a jet. There are other things that you can do. The only reason I address all of this is because this seems to be a growing fascination.
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  And I love that process again. I love the fact that people are interested in the universe and how things work. But if you ask me, the big cover-up is not Flat Earth theory.
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  And I don't know if it's okay for me to even say this, but it's about life on other planets. That's the big cover-up. And we talked about Mars. Life has been discovered on Mars since 1976.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  And if there's life on Mars, there's life all over the cosmos. We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, which itself has anywhere from 100 to maybe 250 billion stars, depending on which figure you believe.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  Around each of those stars, there could be habitable planets like ours. And whether you believe the universe created itself spontaneously for no reason, like Stephen Hawking says, or that God created the universe, either way, why would we be the only lifeforms in the planet?
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  If God created the universe, God created life everywhere in the universe as well. God created the Big Bang, so to speak. And God put life everywhere. Why would we be alone in this vast space?
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:48.000]  And the Milky Way galaxy is only one of hundreds of billions of other galaxies as well. So we're talking about, you know, beyond human comprehension, there's life everywhere in the universe, in my opinion.
[3:56:48.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  I mean, I should say everywhere that there's habitable planets, right? And not obviously the vacuum of outer space. But that's the big cover-up. NASA's been covering up life on other planets and intelligent civilizations interacting with our civilization here on Earth.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  That's the big cover-up as far as I'm concerned. And I think NASA is about to allow more disclosure on that point in the coming years. In fact, they've already dropped hints about that.
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  So that's my take on it, folks. I welcome differences in views. I welcome your free speech. I welcome your scientific curiosity about how the world works around you.
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  I'm with you on that journey. I'm also just trying to figure out how we got here, where we are, what's the purpose of life, what's the meaning of the universe, everything. I'm with you on that journey.
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  And we've got to ask big questions, but we also have to follow the evidence as closely as we can.
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  So thank you for watching today. Mike Adams here for the Alex Jones Show, kind of an interesting segment today. O.S. Schreuer is straight ahead with the War Room. Stay tuned for that, and thanks for joining me today.
