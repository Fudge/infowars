[08:29.160 --> 08:35.480]  4 p.m. eastern desperately trying to wake up the American people and the
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.320]  people of the planet desperately posting government documents IMF World Bank
[08:41.320 --> 08:46.120]  documents globalist statements bragging and laughing about the world
[08:46.120 --> 08:52.280]  government they're setting up trying to get people to get as focused on finance
[08:52.280 --> 08:57.640]  and the banking cartels and the military industrial complex just trying to get
[08:57.640 --> 09:02.880]  people as focused on that as they are on going to the topless bars or watching
[09:02.880 --> 09:10.360]  their favorite football or soccer game because if we continue to allow them to
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.760]  have these successes that they're having now and taking over society always in
[09:15.760 --> 09:21.680]  the name of stopping a crisis which they always created the sky is the limit
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.720]  the last month we've seen the head of the World Bank the head of the IMF the
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.720]  head of the fellow deserve the different banking heads of the G20 say
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.520]  austerity is here and we're going to destroy the economy to save the
[09:36.520 --> 09:40.680]  environment you know oh it's good that we're in a depression that's lowering
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.120]  our carbon footprints all the big central banks financing the fake
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.960]  environmental movement that is meant to further shut down any free market
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.040]  industrial capacity on Main Street in your town in your city in your county
[09:56.040 --> 10:03.600]  in your state this is financial economic conquest backed up by the
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.480]  paramilitary forces the globalist stage the economic crises on record we have
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.440]  all their emails all their documents it's not even hidden that they
[10:12.440 --> 10:18.560]  premeditatedly did this Goldman Sachs leading the wolf pack we on record know
[10:18.560 --> 10:22.320]  that governments have staged many terror attacks as their pretext to bring in
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.640]  the physical force and to train us to live in a high-tech police state I mean
[10:27.640 --> 10:31.640]  I see articles every day one out of Texas where they said well the federal
[10:31.640 --> 10:37.640]  government has ordered us to not allow children to have any sweets in their
[10:37.640 --> 10:43.000]  lunchbox instead of just taking the coke machines out that the schools put in to
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.120]  make money and making the school lunches more healthy they go to the extreme of
[10:48.120 --> 10:55.480]  saying no we're gonna inspect your lunch boxes and if a seven-year-old little
[10:55.480 --> 11:03.520]  girl is caught with one apple Jolly Rancher she is expelled for one week and
[11:03.520 --> 11:09.960]  the school saying she's lucky this is zero tolerance next time the police may
[11:09.960 --> 11:17.400]  be called in but if she was eating a handful of riddle in a Prozac now that
[11:17.400 --> 11:24.280]  would have been a different story and that's just the backdrop public schools
[11:24.280 --> 11:31.440]  watching the kids in one school district 56,000 times in one year we have the
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.480]  school emails where they're saying oh it's so much fun to watch them at home
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.880]  this is better than a soap opera oh I love recording it oh I love watching them
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.560]  in their bedrooms oh my goodness and they just throw it in your face and
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.880]  nothing's done nobody gets in trouble and you have the all the heads of the
[11:49.880 --> 11:58.520]  big private banks come out and say the good times are over for good you're
[11:58.520 --> 12:01.640]  going to have it worse than your parents had it and your children are gonna have
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.760]  it a hell of a lot worse than you've had it but you're not gonna have to wait
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.520]  for your kids who were 10 years old to grow up and be poor you're going to be
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.640]  poor right now right now we're gonna take your pension funds private and
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.240]  public we're gonna take it and let corporations create side companies
[12:20.240 --> 12:25.120]  different divisions and then shut down the old division and move it over and
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.840]  take your pension fund and fire you or make you train your replacements we're
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.480]  gonna expand NAFTA in gap we're gonna bust the borders wide open it's open
[12:33.480 --> 12:41.720]  season on anybody who tries to be self-sufficient and who wants to be able
[12:41.720 --> 12:51.880]  to live the American dream or the dream of being a free person it's here just
[12:51.880 --> 12:57.920]  just overnight imagine all the discussions and all the debates and all of
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.440]  the prodding and fear mongering and the former Goldman Sachs head who was the
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.680]  Treasury head at the time with his counterpart the head of the New York Fed
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.920]  you had Henry Paulson and Timmy Geithner and Ben Bernanke all Goldman Sachs
[13:12.920 --> 13:18.840]  Pirates and they went before Congress and they said there will be blood in the
[13:18.840 --> 13:22.680]  streets total depression collapse of society unless you give us this blank
[13:22.680 --> 13:29.720]  check for what is now well above 30 trillion dollars another 20 trillion
[13:29.720 --> 13:40.600]  stolen from other nations paid into the banks and then suddenly overnight oh
[13:40.600 --> 13:46.360]  there's secret meetings going on with the private bank heads in the G20 last
[13:46.360 --> 13:59.640]  week it's a hundred and fifty billion dollars it's 635 billion it's a trillion
[13:59.640 --> 14:08.160]  no wait it's more than a trillion and before they would put out lies like oh
[14:08.160 --> 14:15.400]  it's a 886 billion dollar bailout no it was in the tens of trillions so now
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.240]  they're telling you it's a trillion I mean will it be a hundred trillion and
[14:19.240 --> 14:27.000]  again this is more money than exist in the entire planet to begin with real
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.280]  assets you can't buy real things with all this money it's only uses a weapon to
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.560]  bring us in a complete bondage and they tell us oh we're doing this to save the
[14:37.560 --> 14:45.120]  eurozone the European countries have to give these trillions of dollars to
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.000]  private banks and we can't tell you where it's going oh no that's all secret
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.120]  or the euro will fall and I had what BBC reporter Greg Palestine just last week
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.480]  he talked about some of the founding members of the euro by name bragging to
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.120]  him that it was designed to take over European nations get them into fraudulent
[15:08.120 --> 15:14.200]  derivatives debt oh they planned this 50 years ago oh sure they were getting
[15:14.200 --> 15:18.200]  money and power and control and robbing people all the way along but now this is
[15:18.200 --> 15:26.880]  the big sweep this is the all-in the total commitment and now they've ordered
[15:26.880 --> 15:34.480]  socialized Europe for workers to they socialize risk privatized profit
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.400]  remember that it's not socialism for the elite it's only for us and they
[15:39.400 --> 15:42.920]  force you to invest in government health care and a government-controlled pension
[15:42.920 --> 15:49.680]  funds in 401ks you pay for it in Greece they take around half of your paycheck
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.280]  for your pension fund and then now that you retire and you say I want my money
[15:54.280 --> 16:01.560]  they say oh no you're greedy Greeks you caused this not Goldman Sachs running
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.680]  your country as your finance minister and your president a public British
[16:06.680 --> 16:13.000]  agent and they sell it to the world this is all happening because of Greece
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.760]  you've got to lose your pension funds in Europe because of the Greek workers they
[16:17.760 --> 16:27.560]  did it it's all their fault and then now they tell us it's actually for the big
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.000]  banks the governments have to pay them this money the governments invested in
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  derivatives we have to do it but we're not going to tell you exactly where the
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.640]  money is going just like here in the United States they won't say where it
[16:37.640 --> 16:45.440]  went and remember this is a replay of a year and a half ago getting closer to
[16:45.440 --> 16:55.240]  two years ago this is an absolute replay of what we saw happen in October and
[16:55.240 --> 17:03.840]  November of 2008 they told us it's the fault of the scumbag Americans why
[17:03.840 --> 17:10.160]  millions of these lazy people they went out and they lied on their forms to get
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.960]  credit and they're the ones that are causing the financial meltdown no because
[17:15.960 --> 17:20.560]  day one when they got the money they said it's not going to the housing
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.280]  mortgages to the housing derivatives it's going somewhere else we're not going
[17:25.280 --> 17:29.200]  to tell you but that's the cover story it's the American homeowners who were
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.040]  told go out and take these loans that it's the American dream that all of you
[17:33.040 --> 17:40.360]  deserve this that you've got to own a home you've got to do it this is command
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.600]  organized destruction and we'll talk about it next hour with Max Kaiser
[17:44.600 --> 17:52.400]  where it goes from here the absolute total rendering down the total
[17:52.400 --> 18:04.880]  destruction of our economy and the entire nation slipping fully into
[18:04.880 --> 18:19.880]  financial bondage and now we've got Justice Kagan as I mean I read this
[18:19.880 --> 18:26.040]  New Jersey dot-com mainstream news article and I can't even believe I'm
[18:26.040 --> 18:30.920]  reading the fact that now they don't even hide this they just throw it in our
[18:30.920 --> 18:41.880]  face they don't even care Justice Kagan and President Larry Summers and then the
[18:41.880 --> 18:49.600]  article admits that Kagan is a money advisor to Goldman Sachs Global
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.800]  Investment House meanwhile she made Cass Sunstein who was now an advisor to
[18:53.800 --> 19:00.640]  Obama a full professor at Harvard he has suggested the concept of marriage be
[19:00.640 --> 19:05.280]  discontinued he's also argued that dogs and cats should have standing to sue in
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.920]  court but that's just so the government can represent the dogs and cats and have
[19:08.920 --> 19:14.160]  a plaintiff to go after you he also proposes a jab salute ban on free speech
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.640]  the end of freedom on the internet the arrest of anyone who doesn't believe in
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.400]  anthropogenic global warming or the 9-11 could be an inside job I mean this is a
[19:22.400 --> 19:32.400]  crew of revolutionary crooks and now they're getting mad at CBS news this is
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.600]  out of the Washington Post White House complains about CBS News blog post

[25:14.880 --> 25:23.520]  la reconquista invasora invasion psychology where the media and the
[25:23.520 --> 25:29.960]  government and finances and funds comedians and actors and producers
[25:29.960 --> 25:39.880]  who will promote racial division and race war and of course yesterday I played
[25:39.880 --> 25:52.360]  the video and audio of a teacher at UCLA up there with their students saying

[26:30.120 --> 26:34.320]  phones up yesterday every Hispanic caller it was only for Hispanic callers
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.800]  disagree with what was happening and so that they were intimidated and called
[26:38.800 --> 26:45.120]  basically Uncle Tom's or porchos in in in slang in the US you know that means
[26:45.120 --> 26:50.760]  Uncle Tom and intimidated and attacked and we had Hispanics calling in saying
[26:50.760 --> 26:55.160]  you know we're patriots we're anti-New World Order but my daughter is now a

[27:43.720 --> 27:48.600]  trillion package to save Europe and because it's dictatorial no vote needed
[27:48.600 --> 27:54.360]  they just did it it goes from 150 billion overnight to a trillion the
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.640]  European Union put up a staggering one trillion Monday and the banks get to
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.320]  leverage that out as derivatives again to contain its spreading government debt
[28:03.320 --> 28:08.800]  crisis oh it has a spreading government debt crisis so you add more debt which
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.080]  the private banks get and keep it from tearing the euro currency apart and

[32:59.360 --> 33:06.360]  help us win this battle
[33:29.360 --> 33:59.240]  here's a headline that says it all out of NBC Los Angeles watch your step LA will consider repealing a 74 ordnance that made the city responsible for sidewalk repairs well yeah that was one of the big scams in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s it's now expanded out to
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.000]  small towns they will jack up huge taxes on you saying that they're gonna repair and
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.480]  build and expand sidewalks but now they're gonna keep all the taxes they have
[34:11.480 --> 34:17.440]  for sidewalks but they're not gonna fix them and all over the country every day
[34:17.440 --> 34:21.160]  I see articles where they'll lay off half or more of the police department or
[34:21.160 --> 34:25.280]  sheriff's deputies and then they announced but the people we've got will
[34:25.280 --> 34:34.400]  mainly respond to forms of revenue generation the cops we've got you know
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.000]  in one case I saw in a county in Ohio they said well we had you know a hundred
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.400]  and fourteen deputies now we're gonna have forty two deputies and of those
[34:46.400 --> 34:51.680]  deputies only three will be on patrol a day one person per shift in the county
[34:51.680 --> 34:58.960]  of the other 41 deputies they will all basically run the jail and engage in
[34:58.960 --> 35:10.580]  fines and fees so government will now start shrinking in actual services but
[35:10.580 --> 35:17.320]  expanding in size and in taxes because almost everything will go to interest on
[35:17.320 --> 35:29.920]  debt to banks I don't even know what to say at this point we have seen the
[35:29.920 --> 35:39.000]  biggest bailout ever and that itself is a lie this is not a bailout they won't
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.240]  say where the trillions of dollars have gone if it was 150 billion last week
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.680]  it's a trillion today the sky is the limit why do you think the G20's been
[35:47.680 --> 35:49.960]  meeting in secret what do you think they've been setting up well they've
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.640]  all written policy reports in years past talking about how they would set up a
[35:53.640 --> 35:56.920]  world government how they would sell derivatives to all levels of government
[35:56.920 --> 36:01.040]  and individuals then they would hold you hostage to it saying give us trillions
[36:01.040 --> 36:04.880]  of dollars or there'll be a total global depression when we're already in a
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.120]  global depression and they're just expanding their control and then I've
[36:08.120 --> 36:15.600]  got stacks of news like this Houston Police Department this is out of KHOU TV
[36:15.600 --> 36:23.200]  man killed in his home invasion after suspect poses a census worker tortured
[36:23.200 --> 36:29.560]  even killed him here's another one WHA STV volunteer census worker charged with
[36:29.560 --> 36:34.080]  burglary and rape in Indiana this happens every time they have a census just
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.960]  raping killing every criminal you can imagine who wants a plastic badge wants
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.200]  to boss people around a volunteer census worker who made his rounds earlier this
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.200]  week is now accused of returning to a physically handicapped woman's home this
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.000]  weekend beating her and raping her what do you think government does that's why
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.400]  government wants you bankrupt once you disarmed they want you handicapped it's
[36:55.400 --> 37:01.520]  basically here's the analogy here's the parable the globalist are a clan of 40
[37:01.520 --> 37:11.640]  foot pythons or Atacondas choose your snake and they kill by
[37:11.640 --> 37:16.160]  excretion by strangling you and they they come up in the night while you're
[37:16.160 --> 37:19.960]  sleeping in the bushes and they curl around you lovingly and quietly then
[37:19.960 --> 37:27.800]  they squeeze you to death and I've read that a lot of prize snakes that like to
[37:27.800 --> 37:36.000]  eat Nutria or big rats that they will defang and declaw the rats before they
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.520]  feed them to the big snakes and that's what we are we're all in giant cages a
[37:41.520 --> 37:45.160]  whole world's been defanged and declawed except for the United States and we've
[37:45.160 --> 37:48.120]  been psychologically defanged and declawed and we're just thrown into the
[37:48.120 --> 37:53.960]  mouths of the snakes all day long big fat giant snakes crapping all over us and
[37:53.960 --> 37:58.520]  the public is just mesmerized by entertainment sports and garbage and
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.040]  and knows that their life is getting worse but they can still get a six pack
[38:02.040 --> 38:05.040]  of beer they can still pull into water burger they could still pull into
[38:05.040 --> 38:07.960]  McDonald's they could still pull into Wendy's they could still pull into
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.280]  Burger King they could still you know if they save their money get an iPad or an
[38:13.280 --> 38:20.120]  iPhone and sit there and watch porn all day and they're under mind control the
[38:20.120 --> 38:25.360]  public is under mind control and all over the country they're arresting
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.280]  elementary school students if their mother sends a plastic knife to spread
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.640]  their butter on a roll or you're kicked out of school if you're caught with one
[38:34.640 --> 38:40.400]  jolly rancher in your lunchbox because the federal government said so with the
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.160]  Department of Education in Texas the federal government deciding what's in
[38:44.160 --> 38:50.360]  lunchboxes and they're just everywhere just just totally brainwashing everyone
[38:50.360 --> 38:57.320]  surveilling everybody in every European nation and in the United States the
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.680]  sperm counts are down to over 80% most women are infertile and can't have kids
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.000]  we're under chemical warfare attack and the average person tuning in is laughing
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.080]  saying listen to Alex the fear monger you won't go look at the textbooks you
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.000]  won't go read the documents you won't find out every major vaccines got weapon
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.880]  eyes cancer viruses in it that go into your DNA with their RNA and are
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.640]  hormone triggered in most cases or they're binary they're triggered by
[39:23.640 --> 39:28.440]  another chemical put in the water this is all confirmed so that when you hit 55
[39:28.440 --> 39:34.400]  on average and your hormone level drops it triggers and you get cancer I mean
[39:34.400 --> 39:38.760]  these slime balls are murdering us something fierce and I got to sit here
[39:38.760 --> 39:44.040]  and watch this happen I'm so tired of it I don't know how I deal with the stress
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.360]  today I'm so overwhelmed I'm this only happens every once more we're actually
[39:48.360 --> 39:57.720]  get dizzy I'm actually dizzy ladies and gentlemen I'm I'm that mentally
[39:57.720 --> 40:02.520]  exhausted I don't even want to talk about this anymore it's so outrageous
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.960]  it's total dehumanization there's no debating it there's no it's just it's
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.520]  out in the open but by increments they train us to accept evil they train us
[40:12.520 --> 40:18.840]  to accept corruption they train us to accept oppression until we're the frog
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.400]  in the pot any case you can tell you this you throw a bullfrog into a boiling
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.240]  hot pan of water even throw its legs in after you've chopped them off they'll
[40:30.240 --> 40:38.560]  twitch for two hours but you take a bullfrog's legs you've chopped off you
[40:38.560 --> 40:46.960]  throw it in a pan of water put some seasoning in there and it's cold water
[40:46.960 --> 40:52.200]  and you put it on simmer those legs won't twitch but you throw severed legs of a
[40:52.200 --> 41:00.040]  bullfrog into boiling water they'll twitch they'll jump they'll be all over
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.400]  the place those nerves fighting back and that's all that's happened it's the
[41:04.400 --> 41:11.440]  frog in the pot and man I tell you this country's rolled over on its back it's
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.520]  dead in the pan and the bankers and the criminals are just celebrating they love
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.800]  coming out in the Washington Post and seeing in and saying it's good the
[41:20.800 --> 41:28.600]  economy's down this saves the earth and our carbon footprint the good times
[41:28.600 --> 41:35.760]  they're over for you I'll never forget it was in 2000 I'd caught bribery down at
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.760]  the Capitol it was in the news off and on for a couple weeks and then there was
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.600]  the Violence Policy Center director in the paper and an interview saying we
[41:44.600 --> 41:50.200]  don't care if the majority of Americans are against our gun control we have your
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.680]  children in the public schools we have them and we're going to get your guns
[41:54.680 --> 42:00.080]  and within the next generation well that's 10 years ago those kids that were
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.480]  five six years old are about to get out of school and they're coming and they
[42:04.480 --> 42:08.120]  got uniforms and they got weapons
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.720]  and they've taken our young people to universities and intimidated them and
[42:14.720 --> 42:18.120]  told them to be communist and they're not in with the in crowd if they aren't
[42:18.120 --> 42:22.360]  and it's all funded by the banks and you're gonna find out about communism
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.320]  folks you're now going to find out what it's like and the Republicans are not
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.720]  going to save you when they get an office unless you run yourself and you
[42:31.720 --> 42:39.000]  keep their feet to the fire the good news is three-term senator went out of
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.200]  Utah just lost in the primary he was crying after I was reading reports out
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.520]  of Maine where Ron Paul type Patriots have taken over the question is in the
[42:50.520 --> 42:56.600]  legislature of the Republican Party the question is will they get bought off
[42:56.600 --> 43:02.760]  though it's not enough that Patriots take power in cities and towns and
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.920]  counties you've got to be ready to say no to millions of dollars and let me tell
[43:07.920 --> 43:14.920]  you I haven't seen many people who will say no I have said no because I
[43:14.920 --> 43:18.520]  understand the full picture the only way you can keep people from selling out is
[43:18.520 --> 43:24.760]  for them to really know the score sell out I mean number one I would never do
[43:24.760 --> 43:29.880]  that that's not in me I believe in honor I'm committed to my cause I'm not a
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.440]  piece of trash but more than that sell out to people that are putting poison in
[43:34.440 --> 43:42.000]  the water and in the medicine what what sell out to a 18-wheeler I mean would
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.200]  you take a million dollars to go stand out in front of a 18-wheeler doing a
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.920]  hundred miles an hour that will run you over absolutely not would you take a
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.800]  billion dollars to slit your own throat would you take a trillion dollars to
[43:54.800 --> 43:59.480]  jump off of 5,000 foot cliff without a parachute no you wouldn't would you take
[43:59.480 --> 44:05.280]  a billion dollars to have your eyes cut out no I mean it's common sense these
[44:05.280 --> 44:11.000]  people don't give quarter they're not gonna back off they're not gonna stop
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.920]  they're pure evil don't you understand that there's no dealing with these people
[44:15.920 --> 44:21.520]  there's no half measures they're not gonna give us half measures they've
[44:21.520 --> 44:30.520]  committed a billion crimes why not commit a billion more I was doing the math
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.120]  government killed over 250 million people last century that's a
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.440]  conservative number 250 I don't even know what to say anymore just why does this
[44:38.440 --> 44:43.880]  have to happen why I mean can I sit here and read statistics and numbers and big
[44:43.880 --> 44:47.880]  stacks of news with government corruption at every level just just absolutely
[44:47.880 --> 44:52.480]  out of control I know the crime rates exploded the media won't really tell you
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.760]  that I feel like ought to just be home guard in my family every instinct I've
[44:56.760 --> 45:03.880]  got is to sell everything I own and just high-tail it to some cabin in the woods
[45:03.880 --> 45:09.200]  and just watch society collapse we see that won't work they will jack up the
[45:09.200 --> 45:12.320]  taxes even on some little piece of property and I'll have to deal with the
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.520]  government inspectors and the control freaks they're not gonna let me go hide
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.760]  out they're not gonna let me run away you can't run from this folks you can't
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.080]  run you just got to stand up on your hind legs and fight it and I just want
[45:24.080 --> 45:30.120]  to knock the teeth out of all of these smiley face self-centered arrogant know

[45:48.200 --> 45:51.960]  the city at least should be down there every time saying you're not gonna get
[45:51.960 --> 45:56.680]  billions they were saying today they want tens of billions for the train
[45:56.680 --> 46:01.320]  system in Austin billions and billions for new carbon taxes I mean they're just
[46:01.320 --> 46:06.840]  a bunch of crooks just robbing everyone why be what look you do deserve what

[46:21.600 --> 46:29.280]  got articles here look look at this Daily Mail newspaper article the
[46:29.280 --> 46:37.000]  infertility time bomb are men facing rapid extinction and they just report
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.440]  their own scourges that they're carrying out against us like gee we wonder
[46:41.440 --> 46:49.840]  why this is happening and it talks about how masses of men are infertile and it
[46:49.840 --> 46:52.640]  says it scientists warn it can only get worse well of course it's only gonna get
[46:52.640 --> 46:58.320]  worse of course it's only gonna get worse me look at this jolly rancher lands
[46:58.320 --> 47:03.960]  brazos ISD third-grader in detention for a week and it says the federal
[47:03.960 --> 47:11.040]  government has ordered them no candy in the lunchboxes prisoners get candy in
[47:11.040 --> 47:16.240]  medium-security prisons this is all this is prison preparation but still you let

[47:19.920 --> 47:24.800]  them turn your kids against you all right I'm gonna shut up go to your calls
[47:24.800 --> 47:34.800]  and Max Kaiser is coming up I gotta watch people like Robert Rodriguez who
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.880]  thinks he's being a rebel putting out a slasher film or white people are
[47:39.880 --> 47:43.640]  basically subhumans that have to be machete to death like something out of
[47:43.640 --> 47:49.320]  Rwanda just I could see their whole plan I know their whole plan I have all
[47:49.320 --> 47:58.080]  their documents I mean it's all public I have to put up with this why I never
[47:58.080 --> 48:01.800]  thought of myself as special or good or upright or as some type of you know
[48:01.800 --> 48:05.720]  special good person where are the good people where are the good men where are

[48:19.520 --> 48:24.360]  they're engineering the stinking thing Cindy in Missouri thanks for holding her
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.880]  on the air yes I just heard from my son-in-law in London and he was saying
[48:29.880 --> 48:34.640]  that Gordon Brown just resigned and I just wondered what that has to do with
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.000]  the economy I wonder wonder where this is going to go hey guys go to BBC for me
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.840]  and pull up of oh you already handed me the article whereas I can't even keep
[48:42.840 --> 48:46.720]  track of this anymore they're just running in with big stacks it doesn't
[48:46.720 --> 48:50.200]  matter the other two guys are total globalist they just know that there's
[48:50.200 --> 48:58.080]  anger in England and so they want to give people a a political change and so
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.800]  that's what they're doing here let me just go to BBC I'll just do it right now
[49:01.800 --> 49:11.880]  let me see BBC news there we go and Gordon Brown I'll be able to give you
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.880]  this info yep Brown to quit as labor leader Gordon Brown says he is to step
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.920]  down as leader of the Labor Party and has asked the search for a successor to be
[49:21.920 --> 49:30.040]  started and so we'll we'll go over that live coverage Brown quits and he may
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.000]  even try to have labor pick a new person and then labor still stay in power
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.880]  because it's a three-way hung election which I don't believe for 10 seconds
[49:38.880 --> 49:44.200]  meanwhile the British Independence Party that keeps gaining seats and within a
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.840]  few years can end up taking over you know their leader crashes in a plane and

[54:38.120 --> 54:46.320]  25% now within a year it'll be 20% and that's a current implosion rates it may
[54:46.320 --> 54:54.880]  be 10% in a year and the ultra-rich always wage war against a middle class
[54:54.880 --> 55:01.280]  that's free and independent and so of course you had blacks and others taken
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.440]  into the Caribbean as slaves to go sugar cane to produce rum of course you
[55:06.440 --> 55:11.360]  have the native tribes enslaved and made to work as colonial slaves and then the
[55:11.360 --> 55:16.640]  big British banks said look Spain has fallen we've beaten them in 500 years
[55:16.640 --> 55:22.560]  of war plus we've teamed up with the Dutch we beat in the French they've all
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.360]  pulled out we're gonna come in and tell these poor people that that if they go
[55:27.360 --> 55:32.840]  rob the guy that owns a few hundred acres and actually owns a factory that
[55:32.840 --> 55:38.640]  that they're gonna get what he has and we'll put communism in and that's all
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.360]  this is and that's why I mean come on let's be smart here why at every college
[55:42.360 --> 55:45.920]  and every public school I mean I was taught by white teachers that white
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.880]  people were bad and communism was good and the Texas belong to Mexico this is
[55:51.880 --> 55:57.520]  taught so that they can ensure the fall of America this is taught to ensure
[55:57.520 --> 56:01.960]  we're killing each other and then the government will play the part of the
[56:01.960 --> 56:09.520]  referee and I am just begging for God to rise up to raise up Hispanic leaders
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.680]  who will who will stand up against the New World Order that I can support where
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.320]  are they they don't exist because the government and the media have made sure
[56:17.320 --> 56:20.600]  they don't exist they're out there they've just never been able to get their
[56:20.600 --> 56:26.080]  head up above everybody else we have got to take Latin America over for freedom
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.920]  it could just be a jewel can you imagine triple the resources Mexico has in the
[56:30.920 --> 56:33.840]  U.S. if they'd have had a George Washington down there if they'd have had
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.560]  some basic freedom the type of wealth that be pouring out of there can you
[56:37.560 --> 56:45.640]  imagine it no no I'm sorry I just I just can't handle it anymore I just can't
[56:45.640 --> 56:48.440]  handle it and Robert Rodriguez makes me so sick and I'm sure he doesn't know
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.880]  what he's doing but look at how this is all timed for Arizona type race war
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.000]  stuff but based in Texas he's been making this for two years it's time to come
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.840]  out right in the middle of this I see Hollywood and get wouldn't give him the
[57:00.840 --> 57:07.800]  funding till two years ago it's not that he's an agent it's that the globalists
[57:07.800 --> 57:11.640]  know how to wait and use people it's it's the I'm sorry Melbourne make your
[57:11.640 --> 57:14.800]  point about Hispanics fighting against collectivism you mean you look at Latin
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.840]  America people been slaves down there for 500 years of collectivism it's just a
[57:18.840 --> 57:22.720]  new form of it well at least I want to really thank you brother because you
[57:22.720 --> 57:27.160]  talk about stuff that it's not out here in New York there isn't one voice but
[57:27.160 --> 57:31.760]  let me just say that like I was saying we're being robbed of our history we're
[57:31.760 --> 57:35.880]  taught Che Guevara the hero all of our people we look up to all in hip hop
[57:35.880 --> 57:40.360]  blacks and Hispanics are told you know you're all gangsters you're gonna have a
[57:40.360 --> 57:46.280]  aka my name is so-and-so aka Al Capone Fidel Castro Che Guevara Mussolini these
[57:46.280 --> 57:50.000]  are all this is interwoven in the culture it's in the music just like they did
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.040]  with singing is a Moroccan role instead of being something liberating but just
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.160]  sticking with the Che Guevara thing what they never taught us about for example
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.440]  the Dominican Republic which is a representative for public it's a it's a
[58:02.440 --> 58:07.200]  there we go so anyway that we freed ourselves from the Spanish and the Haitians
[58:07.200 --> 58:11.640]  no excuse me from the Spanish and the French that conquer Haiti and Dominican
[58:11.640 --> 58:15.640]  public the island in the Espanola they don't teach us about Juan Pablo Duarte a
[58:15.640 --> 58:20.920]  great libertarian nationalist hero the Dominican Republic it's freedom that's
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.120]  supposed to be our culture not not communism and this is what we're taught
[58:25.120 --> 58:29.560]  in school I'm in New York City I went to community college if you are a liberal
[58:29.560 --> 58:32.920]  and people laugh with you and it's okay in class and the teacher praises you and
[58:32.920 --> 58:37.680]  if you're conservative physically or socially you're made fun of your single
[58:37.680 --> 58:46.160]  now you hear the class stay there thank you for listening to GCN be sure to

[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:18.360]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:25.360]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Max Kaiser to break down what happened in
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.720]  the stock market last week financial terrorism meant to create fear just like
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.640]  they had Henry Paulson and others come out and say we're gonna have a depression
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.720]  you better give us trillions then the markets lost confidence dropped by
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.400]  over a thousand points they came in with their banking takeover same thing being
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  done in Europe right now we'll be discussing this with Max Kaiser coming
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.280]  up Melvin Fred Kerry Jonathan Rory others your calls are coming up in this
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.120]  hour as well but this is such an incredible time to be alive to see all
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.080]  of this happening the system controls the left and they also control the right
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.920]  the right is just another version of collectivism and then they try to manage
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.680]  everybody within that control paradigm but I'll tell you this Melvin in New
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.640]  York you say there are no Hispanic leaders in New York or white leaders are
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.720]  black for that matter that we know of that really speak the truth about the
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.680]  true political system it's up to you to take the blinders off it's up to you to
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.360]  show people the controlled system they're under and so you should start
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.400]  making YouTube videos you're an eloquent speaker you should start an organization
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.760]  you should you know get join with others who agree with you they are there you
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.360]  should start a website you should be the leader listen that's what it takes you
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.920]  that's what I did 16 years ago really 17 years ago I got involved 15 years ago
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.680]  I got on air and I had no intention to have the success I've had but but the
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.240]  truth is I mean I couldn't imagine that I would be able to wake up this many
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.160]  people and I'm telling you Melvin you are the leader we need and I know you
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.880]  have the respect in yourself to do it but you need to have the commanding
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.880]  bearing and the facts and you need to reach out to people and warn them and
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.880]  explain to them what's really happening we must do this now go ahead Melvin
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.640]  yes sir thank you very much on continuing on this angle where you know
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.920]  we're giving our heroes Lucas Carface he was an anti-hero and he's the one
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.160]  that was escaping for Del Castro what was he a drug dealer cold dealer crack
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.680]  dealer killer died in the end and we're supposed to worship him and he's the
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.720]  anti-hero but I look in machete he's a pure just killing murdering a fax and
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.640]  killing people trying to impose the law and basically he's good he's supposed
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.520]  to be our hero that's saving us you know and I think we are romance by all the
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.600]  welfare so this was my family came here everything was welfare state being
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.080]  offered to you and you know you're gonna be taking care of and section 8 just
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.120]  live here forever and never move out because how much is going to cost you
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.360]  you know cheese in the mailbox and all of this like this is not this isn't
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.040]  freedom of progress you know and I think we need to wake it up by his all
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.680]  Hispanic Latinos out there California wherever you at you got to realize this
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.800]  isn't a little cartoon a movie where everybody holds hands together we get
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.640]  rid of all our borders and we're gonna get along that before you know it you
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.400]  can't go to another country with a different tax rate it's all gonna be
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.160]  the same we're not gonna be free we're gonna have to have another revolution
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.520]  again the mainstream eating that's what the new orders about that's what it's
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:41.120]  about it's about nowhere to run they say that and they now brag that the good
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.320]  times are over can you imagine these bankers won't tell us where the
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.040]  trillions go they're engaged in financial terror and they say we're not
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.760]  gonna tell you where the money went and you're our slaves that's right and a
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.800]  lot of people I don't understand that and Alex I want to throw this out there
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.760]  from it because I know you lose hope a lot but there's this is a shining hope
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.840]  for liberty and I think Ron Paul is is is at the forefront of this and you
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.320]  just know Paul Tano you guys can demonize for a reason and this is really
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.560]  an outrage to anybody that believes in the Constitution and if they if it's
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.480]  bad if it's funny doesn't believe in the Constitution of the US they haven't
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.160]  read it it's been hidden from them it's not been taught we're not taught about
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.160]  George Washington we're supposed to be wearing George Washington t-shirts and
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.360]  for freedom and escape for bellcats throwing the communes of oppression of
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.640]  our parents and our grandparents my grandfather left Cuba I don't know how
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.200]  you managed to do that my whole family's Dominican and all we want is a chance to
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.200]  make some dough legally and have kids and have the white picker fence and exactly
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.800]  but the globalists don't want you wealthy and being part of the system and
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.440]  really taking over the system they want to use everybody to be at each other's
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:51.320]  throats and destroy the assistance it's a gulag economy it's a system that Max
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.680]  Kaiser talks about we're gonna have him on with us when we come back God bless

[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.640]  Greece for the bankers they've got to give up half their pension funds at least
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.760]  then it's six hundred billion now it's a trillion now they're saying maybe it'll
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.920]  be more than a trillion they won't say where the money is going Merkel just
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.720]  lost most of her seats in Germany and so the bankers are accelerating this
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.600]  before their governments are all thrown out cars a Nicholas Carzosi all the
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:39.560]  rest of them I can't even say his name I'm so upset it is just what is
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:47.120]  happening is so big that I can hardly even articulate how incredible this is
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.320]  and how we've known they were gonna do this and how this is just the next step
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:56.880]  with all these new VAT and carbon taxes meant to destroy the economy la times
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.320]  last week reported oh we raised all these taxes in California tax receipts
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.000]  went down of course they know it does that Nicholas Carzosi can't even say it
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  today it's our cozy so with us is Max Kaiser for the rest of the hour I
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.960]  appreciate him coming on on short notice what's happening with the economy and
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.960]  again tension simmer as Greece readies pension reform this is out of the French
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.400]  news agency and it says protesters rallied in Athens on Sunday as the
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.000]  government sought to rein in social tensions while pressing ahead with
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.880]  drastic austerity measures aimed at avoiding a debt default that means more
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.840]  taxes taking your 401ks taking your pensions and it announces it all here
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.560]  but they've had all these secret bank conferences they're not saying where
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.560]  this trillion's going how does it tie into the financial terrorism of the
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.400]  market dropping a thousand points last Thursday in five minutes max Kaiser
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.640]  inventor of the Hollywood stock exchange system a successful broker
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:09.880]  author television host on BBC Al Jazeera RT press TV the list goes on and on he
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:15.040]  is now here with us to discuss all of this Max Kaiser good to have you with
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:24.200]  us good to be back Alex Jones and let's remember May 6th 2010 a day that will
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.360]  live in infamy this was the first unequivocal domestic financial attack
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:36.840]  in America financial terrorist attack unequivocal domestic first of its kind
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:44.840]  in America break down that break down who are the terrorists how they did it
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:51.280]  well in Washington there was a bill circulating to break up the two big to
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.960]  fail banks of course the banks don't want to break up the their their
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.160]  monopolies so they exercise they conducted they use weapons of mass
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.560]  financial destruction they destroyed a thousand points a trillion dollars worth
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.640]  of equity on the market I wouldn't look like the coast was clear and Congress
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.960]  decided that they were not going to vote for anything that would break up the
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.880]  banks then they they allowed the markets to come back and they rewarded the
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:29.080]  Congress people who of course own a lot of stocks and bank stocks themselves so
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.200]  they put a gun to the head of Congress and say do we want to do what we want
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.480]  you to do or we crashed this market we crashed the country's network we crashed
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.880]  your network Hank Paulson did it in the end in October of 2008 the same kind of
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:47.520]  thing they crashed the market they did it again this is more obvious though the
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.240]  1,000 point drop that only took 15 minutes this was unequivocal now this
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:58.000]  is this is this is quite quite remarkable basically if you want to know
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.280]  the mechanics of it I can walk you through it yeah let's walk through the
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.080]  mechanics of it and then we have all these internal emails of Goldman Sachs
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.960]  where they're involved in other financial terror we know this is their
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.600]  policy we know Paulson went in and said there will be martial law if you don't
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.680]  give us these trillions of dollars in October of 2008 when the Congress
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.920]  wouldn't do it they went out on TV the New York Fed head the Fed chairman the
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.200]  Treasury Secretary all Goldman Sachs alumni and they came out and they said
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.880]  we are going to have a depression and so they used fear to have the public pull
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.400]  out and drive it down this time and that's what the other experts are
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.520]  saying this was not a fat finger they admit this was not a mistake this was
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:43.080]  insider using the plunge protection team to artificially drive down the market
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.760]  physical financial terrorism not just using you know bad-mouthing like the
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.520]  head of the Rothschilds did by claiming that Napoleon had won at Waterloo which
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.480]  was a lie that's similar to what happened in 2008 you're saying this was done
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.240]  physically in there let's go over the mechanics of this all right so on the
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.400]  New York Stock Exchange there are tens of millions hundreds of millions of
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:16.880]  shares that trade daily and 70% of that is conducted by computers so
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.040]  computers are trading effectively with themselves back and forth over these
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:28.000]  computer networks now for the most part the trading is somewhat benign but the
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.880]  key concept here to understand is that because 70% of it our computer to
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.560]  computer trading the ability to what's called discover prices the price
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:46.240]  discovery mechanism can be pulled away from the floor of the exchange and it
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.960]  can be recreated with the computers trading with themselves so in other
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.960]  words if you want to move the price of the stock up or down and you control 70
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.680]  percent of the volume you have the ability to nudge prices up or down
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:08.280]  by simply increasing the number of buys over sales that you're making from
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.240]  computer to computer if you want the prices to go down you increase the
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:17.400]  number of cells to buys from computer to computer the cost is zero because the
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.760]  cost of borrowing money for Wall Street is zero the cost of transacting is zero
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.640]  and it doesn't cost them anything to engage in this that's one of the reason
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.680]  why interest rates keep them are near zero is because you have to be able to
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:36.160]  conduct this type of thing without having any cost now the second step is
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:42.520]  when you get the price of a security like an S&P futures contract or an S&P
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.240]  security which is based on the entire market you know it's a proxy for the
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:53.560]  entire market it's a price signal and this price signal triggers a response
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.440]  from those hundreds of thousands of a day traders out there who then do your
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:04.280]  dirty work for you so when the price is a trigger is established let's say you
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.560]  can move the price up two or three percent and it pops up on everyone's
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.160]  Bloomberg machine and every day trader in the world sees oh my gosh there's a
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.840]  two percent move suddenly the trend momentum players and these mom and
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.000]  poppers and these day traders glom in there with their day trade money and it
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.240]  becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so then they pick up the ball they run with
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.440]  it and they make these things exaggerate them to these unbelievable extremes now
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.080]  and so they outsource the manipulation to the day trader effectively what it
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.320]  boils down to and of course this gives them a great way to cover their tracks
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.920]  because they can say well you know we didn't it wasn't us it was those day
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.240]  traders out there it was the market it wasn't us
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:53.400]  meanwhile once the date is done in this case with Congress acquiesced and they
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.120]  did first decided not to pursue anything about the big banks then they
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:03.160]  simply remove the sell orders there's a price vacuum on the buy side it triggers
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.760]  a price signal for the day traders then to come in to hide their tracks the buying
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.760]  orders come in and effectively they refill the pinata that's what that's
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.520]  what that rally was about at the end of the day Thursday is refilling the
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.880]  pinata so that next week if Congress decides to come again and say you know
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.720]  what we want to break you guys up we want to attack we want to get rid of
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.640]  high-frequency trading they can just do the same thing over again this is this
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:34.920]  is just now blatant it's easy it's costless it's very effective now we
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.440]  know the plunge protection team set up by Reagan and 87 has its fingers in the
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.720]  market and admittedly can control it they're in the AP today saying oh we're
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.120]  pumping the market up the plunge protection team okay is with the name
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.880]  given to what's called a working group on finance that was set up the day after
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.880]  the October 19th crash of 1987 I was working on Wall Street the time Bob
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.840]  Rubin Algreen span Ryan Reagan created working group on finance and that
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:07.800]  the Tuesday that is October 20th 1997 the government bought S&P features
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.240]  contracts to save America because the day after the crash of 87 it looked
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.240]  there was going to be another crash which would have every bank insurance
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.560]  company would have been involved and so the power to save the power to save is
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.840]  the power to destroy now they're using it to engage in financial terrorism well
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.400]  they gave them that tool the government they gave the government that tool to buy
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:36.760]  and sell market contracts which is in my opinion that marks the beginning of the
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.400]  end of free market capitalism in terms of in America it's supposed to be the
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.920]  opposite of essentially controlled Soviet era command and control economy
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.680]  supposed to be a free market the government's not supposed to be fixing
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.080]  prices but on that day October 25th 1987 was the beginning of a command and
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.200]  control government essentially planned economy started off slowly and then over
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.080]  the next 25 years it kept building momentum and now you've got guys like
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.640]  Bob Rubin and Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke and they are now the new world
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.560]  committee that is got their finger on the weapons of mass financial
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.480]  destruction and they believe they're doing God's work and they move prices as
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.400]  they see fit to make a political end in other words these markets are don't
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.200]  reflect economic economics at all they only reflect the political agenda it's
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:36.320]  pure price-fixing with a political agenda attached this is Soviet Union 1955 but
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.960]  done in a way where you've got everybody plugged into their computer day
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.800]  trading thinking that they're going to be the ones to beat the essentially
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:49.200]  planned central government and at the same time the central government is
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.800]  bringing about all of these extraordinary extra legal measures that put
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.520]  people in jail. All right Max got a break stay there let's talk about who you

[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.960]  the land isolated from civilization she knows that as long as the sun shines
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.160]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth perhaps the only
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.200]  sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants the cost of learning is
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.200]  minimal wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere it's every
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.040]  bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets well respected in her
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.800]  field Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books flashcards and
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.080]  video with an emphasis on health safety practicality and joy learn how to
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.520]  identify it where and when to find it how to prepare use and store it go to
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.440]  Linda's website of the field calm and take advantage of special offers or if

[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.680]  that number again 888 51 eat free a little knowledge makes starvation
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:08.880]  impossible we're gonna be taking your phone calls for Max Kaiser on the
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.240]  economy also George Humphrey economist in studio with us in the next hour Max
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:20.080]  Kaiser.com's website my websites are info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv we've
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.920]  got continual coverage of what's happening we haven't even gotten into
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.560]  what's happening in Europe and Greece what will Angela Merkel what will
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.040]  Nicholas Sarkozy do why is Gordon Brown been forced to step down I mean this is
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:37.120]  a major shake-up now I remember that last Thursday they were about to pass a
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.720]  bill to stop too big to fail a bunch of other things were happening now the
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.760]  bill to audit the Fed is in trouble in the Senate all of that did die that
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:51.040]  afternoon and they've now admitted this is mainstream news it was not the fat
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.520]  finger they said they don't know what did it wouldn't clearly that was a
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.720]  manipulation and so we're gonna discuss that and and from the evidence he has as
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.040]  a former trader and somebody who researches this and as a BBC and Al Jazeera
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:13.600]  and RT reporter start over go ahead I designed a technology absolutely so Max
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.860]  go over this I designed a technology in 1996 there are 132 patents that
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:25.080]  referenced my patent the virtual specialist patent 5950176 for making
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.120]  markets with an infinite inventory for price parity across virtual securities I
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.840]  created this concept now Goldman Sachs when they do it when they commit this
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.560]  fraud they say they're making a market that's the code word for virtual fraud
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.080]  and naked short selling what we heard that before what we heard the phrase
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:52.040]  making a market over and over again in their defense Bernie Madoff Bernie Madoff
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.440]  said that he's constantly making a market that's how he was able to create
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.280]  these returns consistently for 10 15 years well guess what Goldman Sachs
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.320]  and Lake Blankfine and Bernie Madoff are doing the exact same thing
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.600]  Lloyd Blankfine should be sitting in a cell next to Bernie Madoff they're both
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.000]  market-ranging market manipulating financial terrorist there's the evidence
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.240]  is so clear now the only thing that keeps people from putting this guy in jail
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.280]  is because if they do they have to face themselves in the mirror and realize
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.880]  that they live in a financial hologram there's nothing there's no basis for it
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:33.240]  it's complete ball it was bizarre the host of NBC Nightly News came out and
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.440]  said none of the money's real on Letterman last week but it and he
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.520]  basically called it a hologram but but Max you've called all this with
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.000]  precision that's why I keep pointing that out he wants to go to a federal
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.800]  reserve system with zero reserves one of the highest ups in the European Central
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.880]  Bank system said that well to be quite honest and this is covered on info wars
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.760]  dot com you know we just we just loaned money into existence that has that
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.840]  doesn't really have any collateral or cash basis whatsoever so now they're
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.200]  going to hold on Max line collateral there's no basis for any of this
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:12.160]  economic so-called activity it's all just debt pile on debt and now the
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.320]  special drawing rights which is going to replace the US dollars as a reserve
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.960]  currency all that is is that they're all the debts that are associated in
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.520]  dollars are going to put those off the balance sheet they're going to create a
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.280]  new world currency called the special drawing right which they'll say look
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.480]  it's not encumbered by any of this dollar debt all that's not disappeared
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.000]  that the black hole of off balance sheet accounting and they're going to load up
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.400]  the world with another 30 or 40 or 50 trillion fresh debt and that the number
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:45.000]  of people in debt servitude is going to expand dramatically once again Max I
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.040]  want to go over this point by point and talk about what's happening currently in
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.400]  Europe and the trillion dollars it goes from 150 billion to 600 billion to a
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.120]  trillion in the space of three days what's behind that what these European
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.880]  leaders are going to do what the bankers are going to do next to try to keep
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.120]  control of this but to quantify what you're saying in layman's terms the
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.400]  correct me if I'm wrong they're transcending fractional reserve banking
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.960]  of you got one dollar the bank and loan out nine or ten to just absolute
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.080]  derivative universe where they bankrupt the world by design they create the new
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.040]  global currency they announced their world government as they're now doing
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.680]  and saying all of you must capitulate and kneel to Zod like Superman kneeling
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.880]  to Zod or we will just destroy everything and have a total depression and
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:38.320]  we're now held in complete hostage to these people right the denominator in a
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.880]  fractional reserve system as you just described it is now zero so their god
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.760]  magic checkbook they they're passing all these taxes and their own documents to
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:56.160]  bankrupt us even further and then we we give them all the real assets for just
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.520]  made up baloney I mean this is and they want to destroy the economy because
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.840]  they're in competition population in America it's a prison population and in
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.120]  the prison you can get labor to work for you and be competitive with China why
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.920]  do you think they pass all these laws three strikes you're out stop by the you
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.760]  know you're missing a tail light go to jail they need to compete with China on
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.920]  wages so that's why the prison population of taxes going and 40 million
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:30.440]  Americans now now on food stamps up from 33 million a month ago those are the new
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.040]  red line stay there max long segment coming up it's just so amazing to be
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.680]  living this and to know that the average yuppie still only cares about basketball
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.760]  scores tonight when their whole future is destroyed I want to talk about how
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.120]  their next phase what's happening in Europe and how you think we beat them
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.120]  Max Kaiser is our guest we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on

[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.600]  hands in there I'm gonna ask Kaiser how do we investigate it when all the major
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:36.480]  federal regulators are openly former JP Morgan Chase or Goldman Sachs meanwhile
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.520]  Ron Paul Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse congressman Bernanke
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.120]  broke promises that US taxpayer dollars would not be sent to European banks I
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.360]  want to take calls coming up for Max Kaiser your question specifically for
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:34:01.320]  him 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 but they are wrecking the economy by design
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.080]  waging war against the real economy we'll put that headline up there 40
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.920]  million people now on food stamps Los Angeles and others announcing we're
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.960]  not gonna basically fix rows or sidewalks anymore they're announcing all
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.560]  over the country that police are only there to write you tickets not to
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:24.120]  respond to crime sheriffs in Texas and Ohio we're saying buy guns we can't
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.840]  protect you all we're allowed to do is raise money now at least they have some
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.920]  moral compass and are at least admitting they're just pirates now it is just
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.840]  unbelievable Max Kaiser is our guest one of our top financial experts Max I
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:45.600]  want to go through questions questions quickly for you now here specifically
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:51.360]  who are the culprits of the financial terrorism a b let's then look at what's
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.760]  happening in Europe and how that's tied to this and now they're admitting even
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.240]  in the Associated Press the euro may collapse but the bankers aren't gonna
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:06.400]  let that happen because that's their looting mechanism go ahead well the
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:16.200]  clearly in the area of of financial terrorism and market manipulation high
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.240]  frequency trading and program trading one name stands above the rest you know
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:28.040]  I mean Goldman Sachs they've already been nabbed with the software that they
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.600]  said yes you can use it to manipulate markets and they said it's a proprietary
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.640]  piece of software and they don't want it out in the public domain when they
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.440]  when one of their defectors was caught crossing the border I think was into
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.040]  Canada they also openly discussed that they have a server that they've
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.320]  installed next to the New York Stock Exchange down there on Wall Street which
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.920]  ciphers off up to a hundred million dollars a day in cash by front running
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.560]  which is another aspect of the high frequency trading financial terrorism
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:59.400]  they in the last quarter they just reported Goldman Sachs reported that
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:06.080]  their primary business of trading they did not experience a single day of a
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:11.200]  loss now statistically anybody who's ever been in markets will tell you that
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.160]  to go for three straight months in a row without a single day loss that's like
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.040]  flipping a coin every single day for three months and flipping it heads every
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.960]  single day for three months and never flipping tails that is quite obviously
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.880]  not a normal situation and that's quite obviously market manipulation now
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.000]  who's supposed to be looking at this type of stuff well you've got Moody's
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.080]  one of the rating agencies well guess what the SEC just sent them a wealth
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.480]  notice telling them that they're an under investigation oh and guess what
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.560]  the data they got the wealth notice that they're now under investigation Warren
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.120]  Buffett and his CEO of Moody's sold out of their stock oh I guess those guys are
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:55.200]  also insider traders and market manipulators and financial terrorists
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.560]  yeah let's put them on the cover of Time magazine there's certainly heroes in the American economy
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.960]  they're driving the entire economy to the ditch okay so who else the CFTC they
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.560]  just got compelling evidence that there's a rampant manipulation in the
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.040]  silver market in the London Bulleen Market Association in the comics what are
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.200]  they doing about it JPMorgan just last Friday was discovered that they're now
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.280]  under investigation for unbelievably rampant manipulation the silver futures
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.160]  market okay if you manipulate silver you therefore manipulate gold there you
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:29.400]  therefore manipulate the dollar you therefore manipulate the global currency
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:34.800]  market every single piece of the global economy is being rigged by the same group
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:41.280]  of five or six guys who are tied into Geithner and Bernanke and Bob Rubin and
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.920]  the same group of folks that we've been talking about you've been talking about
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.680]  for the last you know ten years this has gotten worse it's gotten more brave than
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:55.120]  it's gotten more they know that there's no recourse so they are openly just
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.320]  basically you know Warren Buffett was engaged in an actual pump and dump
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.560]  scheme something you would expect on a penny stock scammer where he was
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.520]  actually pumping moody saying oh it's a great stock while he was
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.480]  simultaneously selling it which is illegal which is what Goldman Sachs is
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.240]  in trouble for on Timberwolf but but let me just stop you there because rarely am
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.400]  I at a loss for words I could hardly talk max during the first hour I'm having
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.840]  trouble forming words right now and and the reason I'm making this statement is
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.920]  this fraud is so off-the-charge gargantuan that I can't even wrap my
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:39.200]  mind around how bold these people are and it scares me at a fundamental level
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:43.040]  to know that they could set off nukes and blame it on people to launch new
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.800]  wars they could release bioweapons they could stage terror attacks and blame it
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.840]  on patriot groups which they're clearly conditioning the public for that they're
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.480]  not going away they're not going to stop this is a hot revolution by the private
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.040]  banking cartels that only have the quote open stock market as a way to
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:07.120]  swindle people and to feed their operation they're imploding Europe now
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:12.600]  and now all the experts I talked to aren't saying a year or two till we go
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.040]  into full total collapse but maybe even sooner so let's now we've talked about
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.320]  what's going on over here and then simultaneously with no debate no news
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.340]  coverage really they just say it's not 150 billion it's a trillion now they're
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.080]  saying it may be two trillion they're saying just like here in our Congress
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.240]  they won't tell these governments where the money's going it's just we wake up
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.920]  private central banks through the g20 run everything and they say we're taking
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.840]  your pension funds we're taking everything and the SWAT teams are standing by
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.640]  if you don't like it and you've got a bunch of Bernie made off Ken lay type
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.200]  so they're hundreds of times worse just literally I mean that they own the
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.360]  intelligence agencies they run everything let me simplify because I'm
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.240]  just ranting here I mean I'm trying to even get my mind around this what's
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.520]  happening in Europe how does it tie into this and what's their game plan what do
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:08.040]  you see happening Max Kaiser okay well in Europe they have just gone through the
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:13.080]  credit collapse that America experienced in 2008 and I finally caught up to the
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:19.480]  European banking system and similarly to what we saw in the United States the
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:24.400]  banking system got over extended on in this whole derivatives market which is
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:30.360]  just a fancy way to say debt and the the European banks got way in over their
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.120]  head with hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars worth of debt now
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.840]  here's a funny bit all of this derivatives all this debt in Europe is
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:46.240]  priced or manufactured in dollars so in order to extricate the banks in order
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.160]  for them to unwind themselves to get out of the corner that they painted
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.760]  themselves into the United States just sent Europe a trillion US dollars in
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.400]  exchange for some Europe because that's the only way they can unwind their
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.040]  problems because they're all priced in dollars so they needed a trillion in
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.200]  dollars just so they could unwrap themselves some of this bad debt that
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.920]  they put themselves in and in doing so America just gave them a trillion dollars
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:16.200]  no congressional review no conversation no debate they just decided check for
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.040]  a trillion dollars in exchange for some euros which of course isn't just another
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:22.960]  fiat currency which is manufactured by another European with European Central
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.760]  Bank another central bank which just loans money into existence out of thin air
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.800]  with no as the German Chancellor said we just lend money with no collateral
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.720]  whatsoever so they just did basically a swap of a trillion and worthless dollars
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:40.760]  for a trillion or less and in euros just so that the banks could on paper say
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.760]  that they're unwinding from all these trillions of dollars of debt that was
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.120]  this part of the could pay themselves their salaries and bonuses and it's
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.760]  purely for their own self and grand-diamond the fact that they've
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:55.000]  destroyed the euro in the process and they've destroyed the dollar in the
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.840]  process never occurs anyone is being a problem but of course the folks over
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:04.880]  there in the gold market sniff some big problems and gold keeps hitting new
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.560]  eyes against the the euro against the pound every single major currency in the
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.840]  world except for the dollar which it'll hit a new high again shortly but the
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.480]  gold vigilantes are saying oh wait a minute buddy you know you just can't
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.040]  print trillions of dollars in a thin air to help your banker buddies without at
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.440]  some point totally debasing that currency and this is what's driving gold but
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.680]  max specifically this is by design I remember reading trilateral commission
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.120]  documents from the 70s how they plan to create three global currencies a euro a
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.720]  dollar rise North American Union a Asian unified currency then currency wars
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.320]  between those and then the answer to the to the crisis they had created will be
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:54.080]  this global cashless society where they phase out the currencies and just move
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:59.920]  to the SDRs and now it's just digital on your card and the bankers literally are
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:06.200]  then the fraudulent emperors and kings and lords of our planet so again I think
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.520]  they're moving right to the the SDR phase in other words at the middle phase
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.680]  you talked about the three primary world currencies and they're being a lot of
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.000]  conflict there I think we're already through that we're moving right to the
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.160]  SDR now because the SDR was a big part of this European bailout package the
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:27.120]  the SDR is a circulation increased by 20 fold I believe in the last three days
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.600]  some incredibly high number so that that's now being floated exponentially so
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.120]  the SDR is now quickly going to be usurping the US dollar in terms of
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.560]  its total influence and global clearly clearly so what's going to happen
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:47.320]  politically as Germany and France and England and Portugal and Spain and Greece
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.440]  okay hold on hold on are all very simple it's you're gonna see a global tax
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.160]  the world tax you got to pay tax to the US and the and the global central bank
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.520]  and your local foot and the municipality and your state so you're gonna pay
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.040]  local state federal and world tax and they've all announced this that was
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:14.520]  going to be their carbon tax and this global VAT they're calling the fat tax
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:21.440]  but I go back to the rest of my question if it's so politically unpopular to to
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.080]  take people's pension funds and to put taxes on their cars and their food and
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.080]  everything else to give it to criminal bankers who made all this debt up out
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.080]  of nothing and Merkel almost lost control of her parliament Sarkozy a few
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.840]  months ago dumped the carbon tax because he almost lost control in the French
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.960]  government all these I mean everywhere Gordon Brown just had to step down this
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:51.160]  is political suicide so what are the bankers going to do to get this through
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:58.560]  they're gonna use more financial terrorism like we saw Thursday and so they
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.800]  keep saying give us whatever we want or there'll be a depression as they walk us
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:09.320]  in to a austerity depression that's meant to be a financial poverty straight
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:15.440]  jacket Alex last Thursday the stock in Accenture went from 48 dollars to a penny
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.280]  in 15 minutes 48 dollars to a penny everyone who owned Accenture stock all
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.920]  the employees all the pension funds that own that we've got wiped out in 15
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.320]  minutes from 48 dollars a share to a penny in 15 minutes so they can just do
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.440]  whatever they want why are the bankers a thousand times more criminal than they've
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.320]  ever been I mean I've never small hazard has become the de facto business
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.560]  model of America in the world there's no safe car there's no pushback there's no
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.840]  regulation there's nobody stopping them it's a cancer it's got a control there's
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:54.560]  nothing stopping it Ron Paul and others are saying the euro will now die within
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.920]  the next year do you agree with that all fiat car keys are gonna die the only
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:09.000]  question is in what order what will be the last standing the dollar well you
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  know I could give you my speculation about that but it's pointless the only
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.720]  the interest have to break through even trying to figure out how many angels are
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:26.760]  gonna end up on the on the head of that worthless pen and just buy gold well I
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.120]  just can't believe it's come to this I mean these guys have really got a lot of
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:38.160]  hoodspot don't they well it's you know economics is a social science it's not
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.440]  a natural science people like to think it's like physics it's like chemistry
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.960]  it's not it's psychological and we know from psychological experiments when you
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.080]  give people the option to terrorize other people they become terrorists and you
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.480]  see this time and time again with experimentations where you give people a
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.520]  petty authority to run a jail this was done on campuses several times you know
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.920]  famous experiments and within a very short period of time the worst elements
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.920]  of people rise to the surface we saw it in the able great prison you give some
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.320]  prison guards a little authority and within a few weeks they become these
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:18.840]  psychotic torturing sadomasochistic sexual deviance and this is the nature
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:24.080]  of what we find if you don't have some kind of civilizing forces in place and
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.320]  that's what our founding bankers on wall street who are suicide bankers who
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.400]  already have a God complex like Lloyd Blankfein saying he thinks he's God you
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.080]  give unlimited credit with no interest costs whatsoever and you tell them that
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:42.160]  everything he does is perfect and you end up that's a recipe for creating
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.080]  financial terror megalomania exactly what we're talking about megalomania
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:54.400]  clearly though because it's a global system they can loot one country or one
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.320]  region at a time while they're off in their armored fortresses you can tell
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.160]  who the real government is when a president or somebody comes to town
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.680]  there's a small detachment of security comparatively a few hundred when the G
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:10.360]  20 comes it's the army it's 25,000 police it's no free speech in the city
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.840]  it's police dogs attacking all women coming out of grocery stores it's we're
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.000]  God we're gonna what did you think of the IMF head in the Washington Post saying
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.840]  the good times are over and laughing at people and saying we're gonna screw you
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:29.800]  I mean they they are just such arrogant creatures and they really think they're
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.480]  gonna get away with it because they don't care if Greece burns they don't
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.920]  care of Germany burns they don't even care of the US burns they will use that
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.320]  as a way to consolidate things we have that in the IMF documents how they
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.640]  create the IMF riots so how do you beat them how do you beat a group of
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.120]  criminals that have millions and millions of paramilitary police working
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.760]  for them that can't even balance their checkbook and bow down to anybody with a
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.440]  bald head in a suit well I know how you can beat them but you know you and I'm
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.160]  interested to hear you are you're you you try to convince me that my way to
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.200]  beat them is is unworkable because I think it is work okay we try to shoot
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:11.360]  down Coca-Cola legally by by you know going after its stock they just breathe
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:17.640]  more fiat billions into it but here's the thing if if in fact Coca-Cola which
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:23.560]  is a I believe now it's roughly 50 or 60 billion or maybe a higher billion dollar
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.440]  company it's the biggest shareholder is Warren Buffett and it's clearly an
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.360]  icon it's global it's a global currency like the yen the dollar gold Coca-Cola
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.680]  sold everywhere Somali pirates deal in Coca-Cola Coca-Cola the only currency
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.280]  in Somalia did you know that that the tankers off the Somali coast to have
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.280]  coke syrup their major distribution point in Africa if that's the central bank of
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  Somalia is coke syrup and it's the world's cheapest is the poor man's gold
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.400]  now if you can boycott Coca-Cola products to the point where that stock goes
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.240]  to zero believe me you're gonna get people's attention people are going to
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.000]  be frightened of you instead of you having to be frightened of them because
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.960]  it shows them that the power has shifted from there with the way that they do
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.280]  business so it's like Washington winning a Trenton it was a minor battle but it
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.640]  showed we could win well first of all yeah okay I'll go with that but it's not a
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:22.800]  minor battle it's a pretty significant it's a it's a Dow Jones stock it's an
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.000]  icon it's owned by Warren Buffett it's easy to do it it's like Gandhi's March
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.400]  to the sea to make salt it's a boycott it's easy to do it's a no-cross weapon
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.960]  of choice and you can tell every single day if you're winning or not just look
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.640]  at the price of coke if it's going down you're winning if it's going up you're
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.800]  losing if you take down coke to zero then you can move on move on to another
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.880]  company and you've got a mobile feast of a boycotting army that's gonna
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.200]  withdraw their consumer dollar and they're gonna take these stocks down to
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.400]  zero when you take the stocks down to zero that everyone working at that
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.800]  company in the executive board is going to get nothing stay there he's got a
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:05.040]  break stay there hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are

[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.480]  rest them we've got to extricate ourselves out of this and if the public
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:25.000]  was as informed about rational reserve banking and derivatives as they were
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.360]  about basketball or football we wouldn't be in the situation we're just
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.440]  talking to Max Kaiser he says it's all gonna implode when they steal
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.000]  everything and you know there's a method of their madness though they plan to
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:42.080]  replace that with an eco fascism you know neo feudalistic system Max Kaiser
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.880]  you know is that a question it's a statement but yeah I mean you can
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:53.760]  comment on it well you know as I on the break I pointed your attention to an
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.560]  article that was written a few years ago when I launched this Coca-Cola boycott
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.600]  because what happens is if enough people start boycotting coke you draw the
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.280]  attention of these hedge funds who then start selling short coke on the behalf
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.720]  of the boycott because remember they don't care who they're working for they
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.280]  just want to make a quick buck if you can leverage the hedge fund community to
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.520]  do the work of you the humble boycotter you turbo charge your boycott so instead
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.920]  of now having a few hundred thousand people boycotting coke and it might
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:29.000]  have the impact of subtracting 20 or 30 million dollars from their market
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.760]  capitalization you're now attracting the hedge funds who are going to subtract
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.240]  10 or 20 billion dollars from their market capitalization and the hedge
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.920]  funds will keep shooting as long as you keep building your boycott and then it
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:46.160]  becomes a self-feeding frenzy snowballs using the tools that are being used
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.480]  against us you're sticking it right in their face and you're saying here keep
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:53.520]  this and you're taking them down to zero and you're saying we here's a scalp for
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.400]  us we're gonna win one you know loser okay that's what I'm saying Alex you can
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.280]  inform people all day long you can make them aware of the problem all day long
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.520]  but we need to have a win in the wind calm we need a scalp we need to have a
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.560]  win here we just can't be talking now for the next five years because it could
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.960]  be nothing left I agree with you and I think that's a good plan also think
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.760]  grand jury should start indicting these people Marty Madoff founded the Nasdaq
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.600]  but he wasn't invincible we can bring these criminals down by also exposing
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.560]  their criminality and their financial terrorism which you've done a good job
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.160]  of doing max Jeff in Missouri you're on the air with Max Kaiser go ahead good
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:35.080]  day gentlemen I got two questions first of all Mr. Kaiser Q explain how these
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:41.320]  SDRs are going to replace the dollar I know I'm a little bit familiar about
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.960]  SDRs they've been around for a while but exactly what are they and also my
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.080]  second question is is there any way you can get an article printed up that we
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:56.000]  can hand out to other people on a step-by-step what happened last week
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.840]  last Thursday well I've got Paul Watson writing an article right now about what
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.560]  Max said earlier in the hour you can also go to max Kaiser comm he's got
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:08.440]  info on it there but answer that first question max right so an SDR is you know
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.480]  another fiat currency it doesn't take anything to create a fiat currency you
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:18.800]  simply say here is a basket a unit a measurement an accounting unit it's
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:24.640]  going to be based on a basket of other stocks other currencies and we're going
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:31.440]  to call it an SDR a special drawing right and we're going to recalibrate how
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:37.720]  the other currencies are weighted in this new basket this new SDR and as the
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.200]  global economy starts to you know continues to break apart we'll say
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.480]  well because China is actually exporting a lot of stuff and they've got some
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:51.640]  resources we'll give them a higher ratio as representation of this SDR because
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:55.360]  I'll keep them quiet it's the bankers transcending the nation states they've
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:01.600]  sucked dry and creating a new zero percent fractional reserve banking
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.880]  digital money that will then absorb what's left of sovereignty yeah basically
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.360]  I mean what exists already right now it's called a credit default swap you know
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:15.240]  credit default swap is a global unit of fraud that banks all over the world swap
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:20.120]  with each other and they creep this back end unit of currency that they conduct
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:24.200]  all measure of multi-billion dollar and they use it as a weapon it's it's
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:27.200]  designed to be corrosive they want to wreck things
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:32.840]  well it's dilutive I mean that's the key to it is that it dilutes the existing
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:38.200]  equity that you would associate with a unit of currency Max back in one minute
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.920]  got a break man I could talk for 10 hours with Max Geyser

[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:36.280]  central bankers David Rockefeller 1991 heavy in France it is another thing to
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.920]  see it in full practice and to have laptops watching kids at home in their

[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:06.880]  talk to John and Charles Jacob Josh and maybe Mike but I just want to say I've
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.280]  done two hours of radio now and having really plugged my films that's how we
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:14.200]  finance ourselves here we can't just make money out of nothing we've got to
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.680]  crawl around little crumbs and try to fund our operation to beat these people
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.120]  but if you'll go to info wars dot com the online video bookstore and some of
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.040]  the t-shirts videos books materials they're the best films best books you
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:29.040]  know not just my work but the stuff I see that I think is really informative we
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.840]  carry it at info wars dot com whether it's fall the republic Obama deception
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.120]  police state for the rise of FEMA such key intelligence invisible empire in
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:41.720]  order to find in-game shadow government you can also now pre-order it start
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:49.320]  shipping out at the end of next week you can also now pre-order the new film
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.600]  don't tread on me which gets into states rides now to take the states back and
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.920]  democracy versus republic it's such an important film by the makers of camp
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.240]  FEMA Gary Franchi and William Lewis okay let's go right back to calls for Max
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:08.440]  Kaiser let's talk to John and Ohio John you're on the air yeah I wanted to call
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.040]  you just before the end of the program when you got cut off last week and they
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.800]  said call the next day and then there were no calls so I'm going to try to
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.160]  relate this to what you're talking about now I'd need probably probably a
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:23.800]  hundred times more articulateness in a hundred times in a thousand hours to
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:28.320]  describe all the ways that I disagree with part of your analysis I think you're
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.360]  progressive and other in certain ways and absolutely fascist and other points
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.640]  that I think cancel out much of the good that you're doing John at Max Kaiser's
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.600]  on do you have a question or comment for it I really don't care what you think
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.280]  of me John I appreciate your call though go ahead tell you I'll ask you a
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:51.080]  question now you said that the IMF and the World Bank are really the the
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:56.920]  villains that are really plundering and raping the world and yet you say that
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:02.160]  countries like Chavez and Cuba who are trying their best to imperfectly to
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:07.360]  resist this kind of plunder are subjected to them the worst kind of a
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.600]  slander by the media and you say you don't agree with the corporate media the
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.320]  CIA connected media yet you prep repeat exactly those kinds of disinformation
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:23.760]  John I appreciate your call look Iran is run by thugs at many levels so is our
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:29.400]  government it isn't either Chavez is good or Obama's good they're both bad I
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.320]  mean what it's such a child I'm not saying you're like a child but that is
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.320]  Max Kaiser it's so childlike I mean do you have any comments all I can say is
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.320]  that you know I wish times were better because I could give up my gig as Max the
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:51.680]  orange home gang gorilla oh my god Kaiser you've always got some ridiculous
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.880]  joke no yeah I just occurred to me every time we break to a commercial you
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.240]  talk about Max the orange gorilla but I'm thinking of myself Jesus you know
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:05.120]  that guy's probably making better money than I am all right Max we're gonna come
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.280]  back to final segment and go to Charles Jacob and Josh and Mike with with with
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.920]  serious questions for Max Kaiser but we do have to have some gallows humor but
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:17.920]  but seriously what is this mindset where people think I've got to be you know how
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.680]  can I be against white supremacist and against black supremacist well I'm
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:28.000]  against all these racist or how can I be against communism but then I'm against
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.840]  the big banks I'm against any form of tyranny and tyranny has a lot of
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.200]  different flavors doesn't Max well that's the problem you have because you
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:43.720]  are very far ranging in your look and critics criticism of things I focus
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:48.480]  purely on the banks markets and finance and through that prism I see things
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:52.560]  clearly if you know what I mean I'm not trying to debate the answer I'm just
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.520]  saying that no I agree with you I mean I mean the big thread is not Hugo Chavez
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:01.600]  it's Goldman Sachs but it doesn't mean I have to bow down to Hugo Chavez in March

[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:30.400]  world invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.680]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.560]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.720]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:47.040]  it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:09.000]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.920]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we are going into
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:20.440]  financial bondage we are under financial siege a trillion dollars pumped into
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.400]  private banks Europe being told they've got to give up their pension funds the
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:29.320]  Germans on the verge of throwing out Merkel she lost many seats in their
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:33.680]  government same thing Gordon Brown steps down Nicholas Sarkozy in trouble
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.240]  saying no to the carbon tax so we're having some victories against the bank
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.840]  are setting up their global tax but they're gonna hold us in financial
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.240]  hostages until we go along with it and continue to play games as the real
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.880]  economy dies they continue to have everyone addicted to their stock market
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:54.200]  is that a good assessment Max Kaiser of Max Kaiser dot com well all the
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:58.160]  professionals who work in the gaming industry and we talked about this last
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:05.600]  time and the online gaming industry are migrating into the finance business so
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.520]  that all of the techniques to get people hooked on games are being used to get
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:15.560]  people hooked on doing day trading so as I explained earlier in the show when
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:20.640]  you see a Goldman Sachs or somebody like that pushing prices up two or three
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:27.680]  percent the folks that are on the day trading you know addiction kick in and
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:33.280]  they are doing the dirty work for them so they've they've basically created an
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:37.400]  army of what I call a Manchurian candidates these people they just when I
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.040]  hear the trigger word and they see certain prices flicker across the screen
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.400]  they go into a zombie state they just do exactly what they're being told by Jim
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:49.320]  Kramer over there and it's like that with terrorism it's like that with the
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.400]  infoniate environmental movement it's all these mind-controlled zombie groups
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.840]  that give the globalist power but look at the look at the controllers they
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.640]  can't even plug this oil leak that's now you know millions and millions of
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.800]  gallons they lied about that and so it was a few thousand gallons they're not
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:08.560]  God and that's what's even more dangerous is is that I think they're gonna lose
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.080]  control I believe they're starting to lose control Webster Tarpley who I
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.880]  really respect believes that as well I mean do you see them losing wait a minute
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.880]  wait a minute deep payout from the insurance company is way more than the
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:24.080]  money they're losing on that oil spill Alex they the insurance is overwritten
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.840]  just like these in companies in America by life insurance on employees so when
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:33.400]  employees die the life insurance company gets the money not the family no
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.560]  that's what Walmart graders are for is they do actuaries it's come out they
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:40.480]  know when they're gonna die statistically so they just hire a bunch of old
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:44.040]  people to stand there because they're putting 3 mil on each one of them they
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:48.400]  get the money not the families okay this oil spill is not gonna lose money for
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:51.720]  anybody who's responsible they're gonna make money all right quick that the
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:57.160]  entire economic system in a way that the risk is only born by the majority of
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.000]  people who have no money and all of the rewards float up to those who are
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.240]  perpetrating all of these problems risk is socialized profit privatized we're
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.640]  gonna take a few quick questions because we got George Humphrey here in studio and
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:15.680]  Max Kaiser has to go here in just a moment but Charles in Louisiana you're
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:20.320]  on the air with Max Kaiser go ahead I don't know yeah I'm not here in Louisiana
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.960]  watching all this they're gonna they said in 72 hours they might be gonna try
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:30.200]  something else but they really haven't did it's another Katrina and they laid
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:35.440]  back on it what they want to do now is take human hair and animal hair to suck
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.640]  it up off the pieces to make match out of it but I think what's gonna it's the
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.760]  value boys it's gonna it's gonna tear them up it's gonna finish the value
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  boys all the boats docked right now they can't buy no seafood and it's did
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:55.960]  right now in Venice is 10 miles off the shore real heavy and they hit the shore
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.920]  in Alabama now this when it hits here full it's gonna it's just gonna wipe
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.840]  the Louisiana out and I think all the sudden states well they continue to
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:10.480]  underestimate the amount first it was a few thousand gallons a day but experts
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.920]  looked at the satellite photos instead it had to be hundreds of thousands a day
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.480]  it's now 3.5 million gallons who knows it could be 20 million gallons I mean
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:25.000]  there's such liars Max Kaiser who knows they're making math out of people's hair
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.160]  what's next leeches yeah I don't know what this is I heard it on news radio
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.600]  driving in this morning and the host was saying what are mats of hair gonna do
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:39.520]  in fact guys pull up oil spill mats of hair what are they talking about mats of
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:45.000]  hair what I mean there's a because if you go back a few hundred years people
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.840]  back in the medieval times when they had problems like this they would band
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:53.000]  together and cut their hair off and make massive hair but I mean it is the best
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:02.920]  America has to offer me but listen people you think we're joking what have
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.320]  you heard about the mats of hair I thought it was I thought I was in the
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.960]  twilight zone driving in but it was a mainstream talk radio going what is this
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:12.880]  about mats of hair in the Gulf so they're gonna have people cut their hair
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:19.320]  off and throw in the air from salons and animal farms then they're gonna
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:24.400]  back bind it together into stockings the nylon stockings and you float that out
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.920]  into the water and it sucks up you know to tracks the oil okay so here you have
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:33.400]  this 21st century high-tech oil spill that we were told the probability of
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.480]  there being a spill was virtually nothing it explodes because nobody
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.840]  bothered to spend the half a million dollars on the safety equipment that
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:43.640]  would have prevented this thing from blowing up and to cure the problem
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:47.000]  they're gonna have people collect hair and salons and make hair mats from
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.480]  stockings real fast because I want to go to calls but specifically we've had
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:56.160]  some guests on who talk about the fact that this happened right after the day
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:01.520]  after Earth Day that Obama didn't really want to allow drilling that BP's gonna
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:05.480]  make money off insurance on this that they're only liable for something like
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.160]  750 million are you hinting at this being staged max no no I'm not anything
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:17.320]  I'm thinking that it's it's the companies are too cheap to buy adequate
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:22.600]  safety equipment you know and you think about for example you know I don't want
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:29.200]  to go open a big you know a big thing here but it's for $50 an airplane it
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:33.840]  would have been very easy to have an adequate lock between the cockpit and
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.960]  the fuselage of an airplane but airlines are too cheap you know industry is too
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.200]  cheap but they could have prevented you know terrorist attacks and but max you
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:46.720]  know as well as I 9-11 was a staged event well you know but I'm just saying
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.720]  that they're ultimately they're cheap so this is a half a million dollar piece
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.520]  of equipment that BP other countries by the way not America I know everybody else
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.160]  has a mandatory you have to have a half a million dollar piece of equipment that
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:04.280]  shuts down the the valve if there's an explosion but it took to put America's
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:07.320]  become a third world country where you don't have to comply to any
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.080]  environmental regulations anymore you can go into the golf stick something in
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:15.720]  the bottom of the of the golf and if it blows up who cares I mean that's Max
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.240]  absolutely let's get to a few final questions for you you've got to go
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.120]  Jacob in Oregon you're on the air go ahead yeah you're on the air with the
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:34.320]  max the home game or Zirella go ahead thanks Max thanks Alex Max I thanks
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.480]  first of all for answering most of my questions actually during the course of
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.880]  this show but I do have one final one and that is that you know reading over
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:45.440]  the patent I've only read the one from 1999 the look could be a virtual
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.400]  specialist kind of sets it up as a sort of distributed system of trading kind
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:55.880]  of turns kind of developed a trading machine gun now it sounds as it seems
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:00.600]  like it's being used as a as a as a nuclear weapon to except instead of a
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:03.760]  bomb just destroying your house it takes everything from your neighbor's garage
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:09.600]  and puts it in yours how does this is this really the first strike would you
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:15.160]  say and what we would consider fiber warfare well as I said at the top of the
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.840]  show I think it's an example of a domestic financial terrorist attack
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:22.720]  unequivocal so it's the first example as far as my patent goes yeah you're
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:26.760]  absolutely right it's not usually was designed it was designed actually to
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:32.400]  eliminate front-running and to eliminate the broker-dealer conflict but
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.600]  instead the new owner cancer Fitzgerald they use it they've accentuated the
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:40.000]  broker-dealer conflict and they've made it they've turned it inside out which
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.280]  under European laws completely illegal by the way you can't do that to anyone's
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:47.120]  intellectual because it's all globalized I do whatever they want but
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.880]  let me throw this out there did you see the Hill newspaper and also CBS with
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:55.920]  Obama over the weekend saying this may have been cyber terror well obviously
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.600]  it's Goldman Sachs doing it and they stand again and it was staged it wasn't a
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:05.080]  fat finger so now they're going to use us to take our internet freedoms claiming
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:10.200]  that some guy in a cave did this well I think you have to differentiate between
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:15.680]  cyber cyber terror that term is understood and this is financial what I
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:19.240]  call financial terror cyber terror would be something like a distributed
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.840]  denial service attack you see between China and the US all the time it takes
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:25.600]  place over the internet or somebody hacking into a hospital and turning the
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:30.240]  power off this is specifically attacking the market-making mechanism at the
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.440]  root of all the changes in the US and around the world no I know my question
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:38.560]  is max what do you think of Obama floating the idea that men with turbines
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:51.120]  did this well I didn't hear him say that but I can tell you that it was Goldman
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:55.800]  Sachs I mean I don't know what else what else can I tell you no I know I agree
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.520]  with you hey guys pull it up that's it three syllables pull it up Obama says
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:05.600]  stock market plunge maybe cyber attack or or maybe sabotage was the headline
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:12.760]  sabotage is well he's a misinformed I mean he's not an expert in these areas
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:17.280]  and he made a mistake man he doesn't really understand well I don't think
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:20.560]  it's a misstatement I mean when somebody slips on a banana peel they say al-Qaeda
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:25.960]  did it and we just give up all our rights that keep us safe well I'm telling
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:29.600]  you what happened is that it was from the point of view of somebody who's a
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.240]  very familiar with these systems and I'm and well we know they're lying and
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:37.600]  saying a fat finger did it I mean they're saying a fat finger did it now
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.880]  they admit it wasn't a fat finger no it was not a fat finger that was not the
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:45.360]  problem they've already been discredited at that height that idea is no longer
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.440]  even being considered and now if you have people like Janet Tavacoli who's
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.000]  extremely well respected now questioning whether or not this was market
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.680]  manipulation Gary Ritholtz over there at the big picture he's a very you know
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.440]  plugged in guy on Wall Street he wrote he republished my blog and some things
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:07.160]  I've written about he's not saying this is actually kind of a plausible idea and
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:10.560]  you've got a lot of people stepping up to the plane saying you know what this is
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.120]  this is actually good that's right situation and I'm gonna have Paul

[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:23.360]  the whole of Reconquista machete movie and all these speeches around the
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:26.960]  country with the illegal alien groups saying whites of the devil we got to
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:30.640]  get them we got to bring in communism how it's all funded by the government on
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.400]  record I'm just gonna cover that for an hour tomorrow because this economic
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:38.040]  information is too important here it is White House doesn't rule out sabotage
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.800]  in Thursday's Wild Wall Street plunge that's out of the hill and they've got
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:50.440]  that from the West Wing office Gibbs told reporters this so meanwhile it's
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:53.760]  Goldman Sachs clearly I agree with Kaiser all the evidence is there George
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:57.600]  Humphrey is a author filmmaker former Austin City Council member a
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:03.080]  degreed economist good friend of mine and he's with us now for probably more
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:07.520]  than an hour and it's great to have him have him in studio so much is happening
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.720]  everything is accelerating a quickening George and he's here with us in studio
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:15.120]  you've got the floor about what's happening in the markets and where all
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.720]  this is headed well first of all I want to say if you like excitement if you
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:25.760]  like fun this is the place to be right now there's nothing more exciting that
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:30.240]  is happening in the world and there is no place in the world that you can get
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:36.520]  better information than on this radio show and I am truly honored to be here
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:41.760]  and to be your friend and this Max Geiser who is just on man that guy rocks he
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:46.600]  is incredible and you know you have people like Bob Chapman on the show who
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.960]  is one of the finest economists in the whole country and so for the listeners
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.560]  who are brand new you know I know I've known Alex since he was 17 and he
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:01.240]  rants and he raves and he yells and all sorts of stuff but he's telling you the
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.400]  truth you know and so keep listening and keep buying the product that's right
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.520]  I knew you in high school because you were involved with Pat Pap you cannon and
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.240]  stuff yeah in his first run and I remember coming by your house to get
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:18.520]  signs yeah and we've been doing this for a long long long time and and back in
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:24.560]  the early 90s people used to make fun of us and yell at us and when two in 9 11
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.960]  happened you know and that week we came out and said it was not what the
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:33.640]  government was saying and for the couple of years we took a lot of heat from
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:39.800]  that and not everything that I say or you say is absolutely dead right on but
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:44.760]  I'll tell you what I would match your record against any record in any
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:50.280]  prognocation of anybody in this country and the point is is that we are facing
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:57.920]  an economic and political tsunami there is no question whatsoever now 15 years
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.360]  ago if we were on the beach and the water started pulling out we wouldn't know
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:06.400]  what was happening we'd probably just sit there and what and get hit by the
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:10.680]  tsunami now because of shows like this and because the work of myself and
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.920]  thousands of other patriots people are waking up to what's going on the
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:22.720]  economic tide has pulled out and it's going out further and further there is
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:29.760]  no question whatsoever that we are going to experience the largest economic
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:36.400]  tsunami in the history of this Western culture in this period of life and it is
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.280]  coming now whether it's going to come in a couple of months or in five months or
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:44.320]  a year and a half we don't know but it's already happening we're seeing the
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.400]  breakup of the European Union right at this period of time the American
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:55.200]  government the American economy the American dollar are dying as we speak
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.640]  it's a dead man walking no matter what we do no matter how much money is printed
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:06.560]  no much how much credit is put out there no matter how many lies they tell we
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:11.640]  cannot fix and the globalists know that that's the trap that's the that's the
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:15.960]  loan sharking in there just amassing power right now yes and and one of the
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:20.960]  things is what when you study history you realize is that the Illuminati's motto
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:29.280]  is out of chaos power out of chaos is order and all of this is pre-arranged
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:36.600]  disintegration of the very vehicle that keeps America the American Republic the
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:43.560]  the strongest government the strongest concept of hope and of freedom in the
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:49.760]  whole world our nation our republic our society is being systematically
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:53.880]  destroyed and I know that for some people this is very difficult to
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:59.840]  understand but when one looks at the facts the facts are that the economic
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.720]  tsunami that is coming at us is going to make what happened in indonesian
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:10.400]  Thailand and India seem like small fry and all you have to do is take a look at
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:16.960]  the fact that total federal state local and personal debt is 900% greater than
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:21.920]  the gross national product that's not including the derivatives and then if you
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:25.280]  add the derivatives there's another hundred stay there start over long
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:29.040]  segment coming up and they're on record saying they're setting up a bank of the
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:32.720]  world that will have a new global currency that's digital you'll still have
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:38.000]  your local currency but it'll be set by this group and then they state the
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.160]  reasons they want the world government and only gets worse from there and so

[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:09.800]  we're going back to George Humphrey here in just a moment and then your phone
[02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:14.680]  calls again economists successful businessman former city council member
[02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:19.040]  author filmmaker before we go back to George to go over the economic facts
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:22.840]  we're facing because we're in much greater debt than Greece was much greater
[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:27.800]  debt than even England this has all been designed through fraud and then now
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:32.280]  you're seeing the government announced almost all the taxes will go to interest
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:36.920]  on debt not to services and Bloomberg and others announcing what's already
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.320]  happened in Greece we want all or part of your pension funds that isn't just the
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:45.080]  government coming and taking your pension funds that is private corporations
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:48.720]  just shutting down and leaving or creating a subsidiary than destroying the
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.040]  old company and taking your pension fund I mean so many scams they've now set up

[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:05.520]  the country they call flood insurance I mean it's all happening now we're gonna
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:08.480]  talk about it in a moment before we do that a few of the sponsors that have
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:14.200]  made today's radio show possible one of them is a color blue did you know that
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:17.040]  you could be drinking fresh clean water made right out of the air you breathe
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:19.920]  no this isn't something out of a science fiction book our sponsor color blue
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.360]  they're a color blue 28 and a color blue 30 machines will allow you to do just
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:28.680]  that it's easy to use and we'll make up a 7.5 gallons of water per day the water
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.480]  once generated passes through 7 or 12 depending on the unit you get a stage
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:37.440]  filtration process in reverse osmosis carbon filtration ensuring that you
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:40.960]  know exactly what you're drinking no chemicals pollutants or fluoride we
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:46.360]  spend so much time talking about on air you're unlimited clean water out of the

[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:58.920]  dot com or 800 69 1643 800 69 1643 and again everything we promote here is
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:03.320]  about waking people up but also becoming self-sufficient because what is
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:07.480]  already happening and what's coming down you will need to be as self-sufficient
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:12.280]  as you can be and water and food and energy are so important and one of those
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.600]  is my solar back up dot com we've been promoting this for now almost three
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:20.440]  years I get nothing but rave reviews it's a plug-and-play solar generator from
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:23.720]  solutions from science these portable power systems need no installation and
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:27.840]  supply household current wherever and whenever you need it producing electricity
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.440]  directly from the sun and like gas generators the solar generator runs
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:33.400]  quietly and amidst no fumes it's like having your own electrical power plan
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:37.320]  and it's perfect for your home or campsite whether it's hurricanes ice
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:40.160]  storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.960]  power outages again so check them out online at my solar back up dot com or

[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:57.440]  solar back up dot com okay george you got cut off by the break and I want to
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:00.360]  go through the info that you wanted to talk about you know the facts of the
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:05.360]  economy before we run out of time first do you agree with Kaiser's analysis on
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:10.480]  the financial terrorism last week and what's your take on what's happening with
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.440]  first it's 150 billion then it's 600 billion then it's a trillion today now
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:18.760]  they're saying more than a trillion and they won't say even say where the money
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:23.680]  is going yeah first of all Max Kaiser's amazing and I really enjoyed and learned
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:28.600]  listening from him and it was really funny because I brought into the end of
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:32.520]  the show a bunch of information that said that the bailout was a hundred and
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:36.600]  forty seven billion dollars and on the way here I hear that's a trillion dollars
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:41.360]  for for Europe now the first thing that has to be understood is that this is not
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:47.440]  a bailout for Greece let me repeat this this is not a bailout for Greece this is
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.360]  a bailout for the banks of that region it has the only people getting the shaft
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:57.680]  on this are the Greek people and then it's going to be the Italian people and
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:04.240]  then Spanish people and all the people of Europe a one trillion dollar bailout
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:08.480]  right now and the thing that is must be remembered is that in the last week they
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.360]  keep talking about that the German and the French banks are the ones that are
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:18.360]  going to take this heaviest well it's now it's my understanding that the IMF is
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:24.720]  good for about 27 to 35 percent of this trillion dollars and guess who pays most
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:32.440]  the IMF the people of the United States this so-called bailout is being paid for
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:39.760]  by you and by me and by your families this is just absolutely insane and that
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:45.000]  is why shows like this are so absolutely important because getting this
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.800]  information out has to be done this is absolute criminal criminal behavior and
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:58.160]  as I have said over and over and over again no matter how much the bailouts
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:03.000]  no matter how many zeros you add you can't bail it out you can't fix
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.520]  something that's already dead with fractional reserve banking it is a dead
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:14.160]  system from the first day and right now the economies of Greece and Spain and
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:19.520]  Germany do not represent the real productivity or unproductivity of the
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:23.000]  country and it's a black hole the bankers brag over time to get you in debt
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.880]  grow the size of the state and then it all implodes into the black hole
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:31.600]  absolutely and then also of course the size of government you know and I've
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:37.520]  been I've been yelling about this forever the total debt of Greece is a
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:42.440]  hundred and eighteen percent of the gross national product the total debt of
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.720]  Italy is a hundred and twenty two percent the average debt in the Western
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.320]  European Union is about eighty percent of the gross domestic products now
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:55.640]  that's not including their corporate debts that's not including their private
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.760]  debts that's not including some of the derivatives folks their situation it's
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:05.520]  gone it's over and it's done and this does not even include the nations of
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:10.360]  Eastern Europe countries like Romania and Ukraine where you just start adding
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.080]  zeros and you just keep your finger on on the plug it's over and done it won't
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:21.560]  work they can they can shine it up as much as they want but the reality is
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:27.280]  is because they are using the same sort of economy fiat currency fractional
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.880]  reserve banking both systems the the US dollar in the Euro are headed for
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:38.880]  disaster now I want you to go over that but I want to direct all radio listeners
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:44.840]  to go to prison planet calm and info wars calm but Curtin MO Paul Watson and
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:49.280]  Steve Watson are on fire I called them all this morning I asked them to cover
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.640]  a whole bunch of key subjects I sent them documents that already done their own
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.360]  research there are a whole bunch of articles that are on the front page of
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.880]  prison planet calm that while you're talking George I'm gonna have my guys
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:03.560]  go to the featured news stories and and put them over the screen while you're
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:08.040]  talking these are all so important so your friends your family your neighbors
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:13.000]  people around you know why this is happening and that it's predestined and
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:19.440]  preplanned by these criminals bankers economists mass centralization at heart
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.240]  of Euro bailout that's government admitting that here's another one
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:27.000]  bankers destroy global economy by designed to consolidate power another
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.960]  key article here's another one the guys wrote all linked to direct statements
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:36.840]  Ron Paul Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse here's another one
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.360]  Euro bailout fund is a desperate measure here's another one banksters throw a
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:47.800]  trillion bucks down a black hole this is all key the these articles have all
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:51.240]  the proof all the statements this is the intelligence that we need to get out to
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:54.920]  everyone I'm begging the listeners post this on Facebook my space your email
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.200]  list everyone you know and say this is what's really going on and send them
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:04.960]  this list of articles this is life and death information because if we just lay
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:09.240]  here and take these attacks they win but if we take this attack like judo and use
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:14.040]  it against them they have reached too far they can fall just like Chalcescu or
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:19.040]  just like Hitler or just like you know so many other thugs throughout history
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.720]  Bernie made off Ken lay now I just wanted to cover those articles tell
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.720]  folks that it's all documented there for them at prison planet calm and info
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:30.920]  wars calm George Humphrey take us out to break in the next 10 minutes break down
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:36.320]  the real economics of this as and again I pointed this out last week I remember
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:39.920]  when did you put out your first audio book off your first book common sense
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:46.040]  1998 1998 I remember driving to San Antonio listening on CDs as like eight
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:51.600]  hours long of your book with that great radio host you had read it and I
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:54.280]  remember learning about derivatives learning how they were going to implode
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:57.360]  it to bring in a world government how it was going to work how they would set up
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:02.520]  the sdr's and that was 12 years ago I remember driving to San Antonio to
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:05.600]  interview the police chief and driving back listening to it and learning so
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:10.440]  much so I like to give credit for credit to do you're not just saying this you
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:13.960]  understood this you were one of the first people to specifically lay it out
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:17.120]  and now you're laying it out again go ahead yeah well thank you very much
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:23.240]  Alex I appreciate that anyway I information is power there's no
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:27.560]  question about it and at the same time my job is to distill all that I have
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:31.240]  people I'm talking to from all over the country all over the world who are
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:35.800]  really really smart people and I'm taking this and I try and distill it and make
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:41.760]  it as simple as possible so that people can understand it and the reality is is
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:49.160]  that we are facing the largest economic tsunami in the history of modern modern
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:56.240]  history and all you have to do is look at seven basic facts number one is that
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:03.800]  the total debt in this country federal state local corporate and personal debt
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:09.560]  when you put those together not including derivatives is about nine hundred
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:15.520]  percent greater than the gross domestic product and the percentages are getting
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:21.080]  bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger just that alone assures that we cannot
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:26.760]  recover from this problem number two is that the derivative situation and no
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:33.200]  anybody who says that they know how much there are in toxic derivatives well
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:36.440]  maybe they know more than I do but I've been studying this stuff for about 12
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:41.480]  years and I don't know how much tarpley says 1.5 quadrillion yeah and that's
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:46.520]  possible using the most conservative numbers which is about a hundred and
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:52.320]  thirty trillion dollars of toxic derivatives which is one tenth of what
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:57.920]  tarpley is saying is that just alone destroys the ship sinks the sinks the
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:04.920]  titanic it's all over and done with in in Japan in 1989 which is one of the most
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:08.680]  productive nations in the whole world they had something very similar to
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.360]  derivatives and they went down much much smaller in comparison and even though
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:18.480]  Japan is one of the hardest working most productive nations in the world they
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:24.640]  have had 20 years the Japan syndrome of recession recession recession because
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.080]  they just keep feeding this monster instead of flushing this stuff out number
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:35.320]  three is the balance of trade I come from a manufacturing company family and
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:41.040]  what made America great is that we used to make things we used to make things and
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:49.560]  sell things and and manufacturing was what made this country strong just 35
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:58.240]  years ago manufacturing represented 43% of the economy today it is about 9% of
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:03.800]  the economy friends you if you have a hot dog stand and you don't sell as many
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:10.360]  hot dogs as you buy and product and rent no you go broke for the last 25 years we
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:16.960]  have had over 300 billion dollars per year at the minimum of a negative trade
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:22.800]  balance and it was up to a 850 billion dollars a year this year it's about 500
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:26.800]  billion dollars which is about 3% of our economy year-in year-out that's going
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:33.120]  right out number four is that our is that the government of this country the
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:39.720]  state and local governments federal governments in 1900 total represented
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:47.080]  about 4% of the GNP 40 years ago was about 14% now total government spending
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:53.560]  represents about 44 45% of the gross domestic product this is way past the
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:57.080]  tipping point and is and government last month became the biggest hire is
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:00.800]  absolutely no question it's now it's now creating more jobs in private sector
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:07.240]  not even close and by definition government is not productive it is
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:13.000]  they're supposedly to help the people we are so fast far past the tipping point
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.080]  as far as the size of government you know we used to point our fingers at
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.600]  Sweden and talk about socialism and all that folks it's right here the the
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:27.920]  monsters come here and it's not socialism it's fascism because the large
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:33.680]  multinational corporations have are working together with the government
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:40.120]  and by definition that is not socialism that is fascism unemployment in this
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:45.760]  country you know they say it's 10% baloney is closer to 16% and we now
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:51.800]  have 39.5 million people in this country and I just heard on Alex just a
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.920]  little bit ago it's now over 40 million people 40 million Americans are now on
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:05.800]  food stamps as one out of every 7.8 people as one out of 7.8 people friends
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:12.800]  that's insane you can't have that 40 million people on food stamps and there
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:17.760]  would be riding on the streets and they've turned over the benefit package
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:21.520]  there's this period of time that you get food stamps and then it's supposed to go
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:25.880]  away they've turned this over not once or twice or three times but four times
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:30.600]  Obama knows that if he didn't keep turning this thing over and that the
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:34.600]  middle class of this country kept paying for it there would be riding in this
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:37.880]  well those are the new bread lines imagine 40 million people every day
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.120]  lining up at soup kitchens you know I watched the movie Gallic Gladiator the
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:47.680]  other day and the old concept of bread and circus is so very real the
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:53.360]  government is providing bread to the very poor and creating the golf channel
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:56.640]  in the basketball the Romans did that they have the dough you know they handed
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:01.280]  free bread out absolutely and at the end when it was a republic they used to
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:06.040]  have about 10 or 12 events in the Coliseum per year but when it became an
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:13.800]  empire it got up to 175 events per year in the Coliseum giving free bread away
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  to keep the people's consciousness away from what is going on and folks I'll
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:24.120]  tell you what that thing called the boob tube the TV it's a much bigger Coliseum
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:29.720]  than that thing in Rome bread and circus is a very very thousands of channels
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:35.640]  thousands of channels and finally the basic is is that we have what's called
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:40.640]  the Federal Reserve Banking Act it is not federal there's no reserves our
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:46.000]  founding fathers were so astute they knew that we had to have a decentralized
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.920]  publicly owned money system to keep a free nation our Federal Reserve as I've
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:56.360]  said 50 times before is not federal there's no reserves it's not a banking
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:02.280]  system it's a private cartel controlled by European financiers and the same
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:08.640]  thing for the whole world the World Bank the the the IMF and boy all those
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:11.840]  old timers that told us they were going to bankrupt the country by design and
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.120]  turn turn us over to our world government and they all got put on list
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:18.680]  and called names now it's on the news we got to have a world government and
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.280]  you're going to pay your taxes us and so the economic tsunami is here the water
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:29.400]  as we're standing on this beach of our society and the economy is the ocean the
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.480]  economy has started pulling back further and further and further and further and
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:39.920]  further now 15 20 years ago because we didn't have this information because we
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:45.000]  didn't have the Alex Jones's shows to listen to and the other shows David I
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.800]  myself and many others it was understandable that people did not know
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:56.560]  what was going on now if you've got any sort of awareness or open-mindedness you
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:01.240]  realize that what is happening right now is the water the economic water
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:06.440]  drawing back and getting ready to come rushing in on us and to create the chaos
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:12.320]  the planned chaos is the destruction of the economy of not only the United
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:19.640]  States but of of the Western world and this is a planned event now we can sit
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:23.880]  here and argue about it and we can sit here and scratch about it or we can look
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:29.320]  for seashells or we can do what smart people do we can take off in the in the
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:34.880]  tsunami relief routes and get up on high ground and take care of ourselves
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:41.400]  because the whole system of this nation the economic political and cultural
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:46.040]  institutions of the United States of America are full of cancer they're
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:50.680]  dying they cannot be fixed and they plan for it to collapse into a mega
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:54.200]  ternary a ternary the likes of which the planets never seen George Humphrey
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:57.240]  stay there when I come back finish up with your information then open up

[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:17.800]  controllers are gonna try to play us off against each other race religion
[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:20.840]  they're gonna try to start new wars I believe we're gonna try to launch a new
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:24.240]  war against Iran in the midst of this global meltdown to get political
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:28.480]  support at home that has people you know shift into this primitive mode of
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:33.720]  rallying around you know the chief but I do see the system complaining Obama and
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:37.400]  others are saying Cass Sunstein's complaining oh my god none of them
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:41.800]  listen to us anymore the new Supreme Court nominee is anti-free speech
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:45.920]  anti-second amendment so they're definitely trying to come in with a
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.720]  tyranny but I think all this bluster in this attempt to race us to the finish
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:56.480]  line is because they understand their time is running out and the awakening
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:01.040]  is accelerating yeah Alex I couldn't agree with you more and one of the things
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:04.720]  that we talked about is that you and I have been doing this for a long time in
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:10.000]  ten years ago I was frankly pretty frantic about what the future was for
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:15.840]  myself and my family and my country in my world I am more positive today even
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.720]  though I have a hundred times more information about the bad stuff I'm
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:26.520]  more positive today about the future of what we as individuals as part of God's
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.640]  creation can do and we do know that this economic tsunami is coming so we've
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:34.680]  got to you know chop wood and carry water and we got to get to the high
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:39.280]  ground so what is a smart person do to get to the high ground and I know you
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:42.760]  talk about this all the time first thing you got to have a passport
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.480]  everybody's listening here get yourself a valid passport number two get
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:54.040]  yourself out of debt get the ceiling on desires cut your spending and be more
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:56:00.400]  efficient number three put at least 15% of your reserves in gold and silver
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.600]  bullion take care of yourself gold and silver have been a medium of exchange
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:11.480]  for ever and ever and ever number four you got to take care of that body start
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.680]  a vegetable garden it's really a lot of fun make sure that you and your family
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:19.960]  have at least a month if not two months food supply in your pantry it's not a
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:24.680]  big deal but take care of yourself number four eat a lot of fruits and
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:31.720]  vegetables don't drink fluoridate at water get your exercise every day this is
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:37.040]  so important get outside and get that vitamin D and get out in nature go down
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:42.480]  to the Barton Creek Greenbelt and spend some time number five probably you know
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:47.200]  create community there's a heck of a lot more people out there who are feeling
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:52.120]  the same way you are about what's going on then you may realize and this as you
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:57.040]  drop me you know as Jesus said separate the wheat from the chaff there's a lot
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:02.280]  of people who just aren't going to get this stuff and you know what some of my
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:07.000]  friends I love them and God love them they're going to go their own way but I
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:11.800]  have created so many more new and vibrant friends who are aware of this
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:16.000]  stuff and who believe in America and who believe in the Republic and who believe
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:22.800]  in God so create community then make sure that every day in your own way
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:28.440]  whatever way you do it pray and meditate pray and meditate the attitude of
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:32.960]  gratitude and fine slow down get out of the media mind control absolutely because
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:37.640]  they get us racing so fast all the time we can't just calm down and and and look
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.840]  at how we've been slowly brought through these levels into this deep
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:46.560]  tyranny and you know one of the things I know Alex about better than most of
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.760]  people down here and a lot of people see Alex the tough guy and he is tough I'll
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:56.720]  tell you what I'll talk about me what Alex is doing this because he has a deep
[02:57:56.720 --> 02:58:02.320]  deep and biting connection with the highest creator the grand organized
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:07.120]  design and that's why he's not here to make a bunch of money you know he's not
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:13.040]  here you know we all have our egos but his basic thing is is because he believes
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:18.440]  in the goodness in man and the last thing is the last thing and the most
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:24.080]  important thing is this is a great time to be alive wow what an incredible time
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:29.240]  to be in body all these things that are happening and if you're afraid and if
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:34.440]  you're in fear-based consciousness these rascals these vampires these people who
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:39.200]  who saw fear are gonna make you shrivel right up but you know what people like
[02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:43.880]  Alex people like you George stay there got a break okay back at one America's

[03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:59.880]  legislation in Congress to break up the too big to fail they now admit it wasn't
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:03.280]  the fat finger it wasn't a mistake but they're not gonna investigate that was
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:07.520]  the staged event we talked about the computer systems they use to do it such
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:10.680]  incredible info I want to go to your calls we're gonna do a bunch of other
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:14.480]  issues here would George Humphrey economists good friend of mine author
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:18.280]  former Austin City Council member who predicted this all with absolute
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:23.440]  precision 12 years ago in his book common sense and the audio CD said that
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:27.560]  by the way we carry at info wars dot com laying out derivatives that were
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:31.720]  designed to destroy the economy and consolidate power but right now we're
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:34.760]  gonna go to your calls and then get into some other issues dealing with the
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:38.880]  psychology of the globalist and a great analogy George was telling me during the
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:42.400]  break about you know vampires is basically that's the archetype we're
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:47.040]  dealing with not real vampires in the but the real vampires of you know so the
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:52.680]  psychic and economic vampires not the fake count Dracula vampires let's go
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:58.160]  ahead and talk to Josh in Colorado Josh you're on the air welcome thank you sir
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:02.320]  to God be the glory for what we're all trying to do here I wanted to get your
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:05.480]  guys to take on something that had happened to my wife a couple weeks ago
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:10.360]  and it had to do with a couple of bank representatives not looking like bank
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:15.320]  representatives come into our house and asking us for donations for bailing out
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:19.720]  the bank so that they can create new jobs probably just total con artist
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:24.960]  probably the con artist behavior crime of all sorts is just exploding well no
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:27.760]  but check this out though this is what was really bizarre according to my wife
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:31.640]  who she said that once she explained her situation which was that she was
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:34.880]  against what the government the NWO and what the banks were doing with this
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:41.560]  country her total demeanor change she got really defensive really scared she
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:44.880]  had a clipboard of a bunch of names but what she did with our particular
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:47.280]  situation was you flipped over the clipboard and she had a column of
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:51.560]  three different columns and she put us in one of these brackets and my wife
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:55.560]  didn't give a chance to see what it was about but she said just the entire
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:58.880]  situation Josh let me just say this the Federal Reserve is always hired
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:02.720]  professors and the local Kiwanis Club and the Masons and all these groups to
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:05.840]  go promote what they're doing they admit they've hired hundreds of thousands
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:10.680]  now to go out and basically brainwash and go to public schools and explain to
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:14.720]  kids the grass grows because of Ben Bernanke the sun shines because of
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:19.320]  Goldman Sachs no ball-headed man in a suit can do you wrong George you want
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:22.960]  to comment on this I appreciate your call Josh well first of all don't let
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:27.600]  people in your house like that and secondly there have always been pirates
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:33.360]  there's cons everywhere and we have to have the internal strength and the
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:38.220]  determination to say no to this stuff and as time goes on there's going to be
[03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:42.520]  more and more and more scams and we have to be more and more discerning yeah I
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:45.780]  don't answer my door I mean I've got glass you know they're on the side of my
[03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:50.720]  door right look out and I walk up and I say hi what do you need and and if they
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:54.240]  start saying I just I just walk away I don't even respond and a few times they
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:58.320]  keep digging the doorbell and I walk I mean and that's why it's good to have a
[03:03:58.320 --> 03:04:01.280]  you at least a screen door or burglar bars but now they're passing laws all
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:03.840]  over where you can't have them because the government criminals don't want you
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:06.920]  to protect yourself and they're looking out for their low-level criminals but
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:11.560]  you know just tell somebody get off my porch yeah and so just taking care of
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:15.400]  your property and it still is your property and and just realize that
[03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:21.080]  there's 39 million people on food stamps and that there are 30 million
[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:25.160]  illegals in this country and there is an incredible number of people who are
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:30.520]  hungry and scammed in every single way so you know just be aware and just say
[03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:34.280]  no and take out exactly here's another example see having you go through
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:38.440]  checkpoints body scanners ask questions TSA admits that was training for the
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:41.640]  streets now they're gonna have federal teams doing it that's the same thing

[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:32.120]  let's let's attack America we're for communism and how the big banks are also
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:36.360]  funding that so we're all at each other's throats and you know having

[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:45.240]  right now let's go to Laura in new york Laura you're on the air hello alex
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:50.440]  first I'd like to say I just love you you are such an angel your true God sent
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:56.960]  and I'd like to say well about me I'm a first-generation Latina and I'm a
[03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:01.480]  professional I'm in the real estate business and it's in New York so I know
[03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:07.120]  a lot about what's going on with the Latino immigrants in the community so
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:10.400]  I'd like to share that with you well it's funny that I brought that subject up
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:13.760]  right now not knowing you were about to bring that up but I did a whole show for
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:18.120]  those that just joined us yesterday about just just you know I've protested
[03:09:18.120 --> 03:09:22.360]  the Klan many times in Austin and Waco and San Antonio I'm against that group
[03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:26.280]  and then I see it's so acceptable now and Robert Rodriguez who I've met and I'm
[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:30.440]  a fan of putting this new film out machete that implies whites are basically
[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:34.160]  a racist and there's a big Mexican uprising and I've talked to Hispanics
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:38.320]  that say that more and more of the especially Mexican immigrants are trying
[03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:42.680]  to pressure Mexican-Americans kids can't wear including Hispanics you know in
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:47.800]  single-demio American flag shirts it's so upsetting to these groups how was this
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:53.240]  instilled in I'm so yeah please give us a report on what you witnessed okay what
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:58.280]  I'm thinking is that there are a lot of Arizona Mexican immigrants moving into
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:04.200]  the community so they're moving into New York especially Queens New York and for
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:09.120]  the most part they are enslaved and they are not able to enjoy life fully and
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:12.900]  what they do is they raise money and send it to their families back wherever
[03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:18.680]  they're from mostly Mexicans is what I'm referring to yes and I don't see them
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:22.680]  to have so much hate in their heart as that movie portrays I agree with you and
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:26.520]  I mean I took nothing but calls from Hispanics yesterday and every one of
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:30.880]  them said what you're saying so this is it looks like it's the media magnifying
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:36.600]  this to create this illusion why do you think they're doing that I believe it's
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:41.960]  all political it's to bring down the country and divide us in three parts to
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:46.400]  hurt you know people like me who are American Latin Americans first
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:51.640]  generation very proud of our history and I don't agree with that movie at all as
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:56.040]  a matter of fact culturally Mexicans don't even carry machetes especially
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:10:59.560]  the ones moving in here most of them are from like Mexico City and beach
[03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:05.320]  communities in Mexico so they're not even culturally those type of savages at
[03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:11.560]  all well that's what the Hispanic members of the crew told me they're
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:14.640]  concerned because they believe it'll create a negative backlash on Hispanics
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:18.560]  but me talking about you know the Robert Rodriguez trailer saying this is a
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.120]  message for Arizona and then it shows the whites is all races to being hacked
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:26.960]  up by machetes and that's that was only a small part of then I played the clip
[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:31.760]  from UCLA with him up there going I love my students we're communists though the
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:36.520]  whites are evil we're going to get them and you know my issue is the government
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:40.440]  and the universities are backing that view and most of the Hispanic callers
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:45.160]  agreed yesterday and they said I've been called a pocho if I'm pronouncing it
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.960]  right which means a sellout if I have an American flag if I do you know if I
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:53.440]  decide I want to be part of this country and that's not saying America's perfect
[03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:58.600]  but but the idea of America I mean have you ever been pressured by anybody or
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:03.520]  you're saying you don't even find this anywhere well for the most part I never
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:09.040]  actually believe I'm like you I've never really believed that there is a you know
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:14.360]  two parties I've always thought they're old just a puppet but out here for the
[03:12:14.360 --> 03:12:19.680]  most part they're very docile people over here in the New York area they're
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:23.960]  very docile and very grateful to their you know whoever they're working for and
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:28.760]  they're very good tenants because like I said I'm the real estate field what I do
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:32.600]  notice is they're not active they're not doing what they're doing out there in
[03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:37.680]  your part of the the country like in California Arizona that over there is a
[03:12:37.680 --> 03:12:42.280]  lot of lying I heard your show yesterday you know the last show you had on that
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:46.480]  topic and what I can tell you is that guy I saw him the one from that
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:52.720]  University UCLA that professor Latino he's full of it because as far as him
[03:12:52.720 --> 03:12:56.560]  saying that he's the northern front inside the belly of the beast and that
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:00.240]  he's just the beginning of Latin America well I'm from South America
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:06.800]  originally and especially Ecuador so that's my parents are from totally
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:12.760]  false I mean South America they're not they're not interested in that kind of
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:17.760]  axis they don't want that kind of union they don't care what goes on over I
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:21.880]  said something good about Hugo Chavez four years ago he led the coalition to
[03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:26.920]  stop the American Union I mean it was openly being formed and Hugo Chavez
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:30.160]  killed that I don't like the fact that he's starting to restrict free speech
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:34.120]  and do other things and I don't believe in you know socialism but I agree he
[03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:37.880]  certainly not the New World Order ma'am I appreciate your call very revealing
[03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:43.200]  God bless you Laura George Humphrey you wanted to comment on this a special
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:49.000]  insight on this my former wife is from Jalisco from Puerto Vallarta I've been

[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:06.160]  on this planet they're also very very involved in the political parties down
[03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:11.720]  there they know what's going on and they just say you know what America is the
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:18.240]  only country in the world with open borders we've got what 20 to 30 million
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:22.160]  illegals in this country you don't know exactly how many they are this is the
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:29.400]  only nation on the planet that allows this and it's not the problem of the
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:33.720]  Mexicans or the Central Americans coming up here if I was from Ecuador I'd
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:38.520]  probably come up here myself and want to come up here but the point is is that
[03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:43.560]  every country needs to take care of itself and this well the global is
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:48.360]  radicalizing and they're trying to use it as a weapon and these communist groups
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:51.840]  are saying they want to get me I'm evil I'm white they're gonna get my guns
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:55.440]  they're gonna get my kids and I'm saying look I'm not against you because you got
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:58.960]  brown skin but when you start saying you want to kill me you got a problem and
[03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:04.600]  and there's another fact that goes into this 83% of all first-generational
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:13.880]  Latin Americans who are now US citizens are for real immigration reform they
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:20.240]  know how ins they know that a Balkanized America is not a good America so well
[03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:23.120]  the government wants to make sure people don't integrate but they want to keep
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:25.560]  everybody in their group absolutely that's why they're against everybody
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:30.880]  learning English you know it's amazing 85 90% of Americans are hip to what's
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:34.640]  going on they want to close the borders they want to protect things it's the
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:38.840]  media in the government the Democrats want to bring in new imports because
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:42.520]  it's the only source of new votes and Republicans want to do it to keep things
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:48.080]  messed up and to keep wages low and we aborted 50 million Americans and so we
[03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:53.480]  have to have this new workforce when we killed I mean 50 plus percent of blacks
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:16:01.840]  are never been born since 73 sick I mean it's six it's I mean this is this is
[03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:06.200]  this this is death I mean this is let's go ahead and thank you Laura let's talk
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:11.720]  to Margaret in Oklahoma you're on the air Margaret I have four questions I
[03:16:11.720 --> 03:16:19.440]  would ask real fast safer Cox I saw a meeting he had in Montana he had in
[03:16:19.440 --> 03:16:24.200]  December I saw it and I look on the internet to see more about him and he
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:27.600]  said he was in jail and he had something called the Liberty Bells and all his
[03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:31.560]  supporters was supposed to come in and help him out I don't know who Shaeford
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:38.480]  Cox is ma'am so I can't really comment on that what what else oh okay a second
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:43.400]  when Haiti I was wondering about Haiti because is it really is it is it possible
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:48.600]  with us who actually murdered because I was living in a country in this is called
[03:16:48.600 --> 03:16:54.600]  East Pakistan a few years ago and the military went door to door murdering
[03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:59.560]  people they went well I know Haiti's incredible police state Margaret and
[03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:03.000]  that's the whole point is that America isn't perfect and now it's been seized
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.440]  as an engine of global domination so people can point to America and say
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:10.080]  we're bad but we've we've gone against our bill of rights and Constitution it's
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:13.560]  still the best and that's why the globalists want to pull it down yeah but
[03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:18.920]  this this CIA has is with probably behind what happened in East Pakistan but
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:26.760]  that the CIA has like a drug drug gang saw that there's Margaret Margaret I
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:30.880]  hear you and I agree with you I mean it's it Eric Prince said that Blackwater
[03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:34.760]  wasn't in Pakistan killing people and then he gave a speech and got recorded
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:37.920]  and Vanity Fair has it where he was saying they're in Pakistan I mean it's
[03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:42.320]  just yeah it's just nonstop and now they don't deny that our government grows
[03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:46.320]  the opium they just admit it like it's a good thing I'm over in India and Southeast
[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:51.080]  Asia every year for a couple months a year and there's no question that
[03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:55.120]  Blackwater is over there there's no question that the US government is
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:00.280]  growing the opium just like the British East India Bay Company used to grow the
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:04.440]  opium you know how Franklin Delano Roosevelt's family made all their
[03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:10.440]  palatial wealth opium opium the Delano family brought the opium from Southeast
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:17.400]  Asia to China and kept China totally totally addicted to opium for over a
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:20.720]  hundred years no they know what they're doing the government ships it in and
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:25.480]  then SWAT teams any fool that they think has it let's go to Stuart in New York
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:31.320]  Stuart you're on the air good afternoon Alex it seems that mass fear and
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:37.240]  confusion can only help our friends in the New World Order who was it said
[03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:42.920]  that it's a shame to waste a good disaster I'm paraphrasing that
[03:18:42.920 --> 03:18:46.600]  Ronald Manuel he says you don't want a good crisis to go to waste well it
[03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:51.880]  seems we've got two on the horizon now in addition to the economic crisis I'd
[03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:56.880]  like to go back to what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico and the volcano
[03:18:56.880 --> 03:19:02.920]  situation you had touched on the possibility that what happened in the
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:11.640]  Gulf was not an accident and if you remember what happened at 9-9-11 who
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:17.080]  benefits there is some talk going around that in fact it wasn't an accident
[03:19:17.080 --> 03:19:23.160]  and it's coming from what I consider to be reliable sources who benefits let's
[03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:28.000]  look at our friends in North Korea if there's anything that you can do as
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:34.760]  far as like tracing short options in the stock exchange just like we did with
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:43.960]  the the airlines when 9-11 happened I would sincerely appreciate that with
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:49.880]  the volcanoes it's going to shorten the growing seasons and it's going to create
[03:19:49.880 --> 03:19:52.400]  a food shortage and again that's something that the new you know what
[03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:55.560]  they say when it rains it pours we'll get George Humphrey's comment on that
[03:19:55.560 --> 03:19:59.840]  that we're going to get into psychic vampires of the new world order and a
[03:19:59.840 --> 03:20:03.720]  lot more straight ahead we'll be right back are you tired of out of control
[03:20:03.720 --> 03:20:07.840]  irresponsible federal deficit spending increasing the money supply without
[03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:11.920]  increasing productive output leads to inflation you get less for your money

[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:26.120]  your phone calls the controllers win if they can manipulate the political
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:29.760]  debate and give you false choices if they control the field they own the horse
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:33.560]  track they own the horses they win we have to realize that this whole game is
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:38.560]  rigged and then offer a alternative to people the average Americans been taught
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:43.280]  things are so bad because the American system doesn't work no I mean if I buy a
[03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:47.040]  new car and it's got the engine you know the way it's supposed to run it's got
[03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:51.040]  oil in it it's got all the belts on it and I'm driving you know I drive it
[03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:55.880]  around for 50,000 miles and it never has a problem and then I drain the oil out
[03:24:55.880 --> 03:25:02.960]  and remove a belt it's not gonna work so we have to fix it instead of going
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:08.560]  into this globalist system but George you were talking about how vampires and
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:13.280]  fables have to tell you what they're going to do to you before you do it and
[03:25:13.280 --> 03:25:17.240]  we've seen this in countless government productions like lone gum and the X file
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:20.080]  spinoff and I was later approached by Dean Haglin who was the star of the
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:24.120]  show and he said no the CIA came does he's been in studio and basically said
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:27.000]  you know we want this in these storylines or the government remote
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:32.640]  controls a jet into the World Trade Centers as a pretext to start a war and
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:37.840]  they use a drill to make norad stand down why do they love to tell us what
[03:25:37.840 --> 03:25:43.600]  they're going to do to us beforehand well last night I went to a movie and of
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:48.600]  the six trailers that were on four of these were vampire movies now the
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:55.960]  statistical probability of 80% of the movies that are coming out are about
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:26:02.320]  vampires is about zero and the vampire movie that's all I see is trailers and
[03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:10.160]  books it is vampire vampire vampire television movies everything and the
[03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:15.920]  reality is is that that's there because they the illuminati and when I say they
[03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:20.320]  those in separation consciousness those who are in fear-based consciousness the
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:24.080]  look what we call the aluminum their say don't masochist is that they believe in
[03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:29.480]  their own set of rules that they have to tell the victims what they're going to
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:35.800]  do before they do it to make it okay just like the movie wag the dog it was
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:39.560]  incredible and most of y'all know about that movie tell them it came out right
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:44.040]  before they actually did ran a wag the dog in Serbia well it was a movie about
[03:26:44.040 --> 03:26:48.520]  a president who was having trouble a lot of political trouble he was having an
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:54.120]  affair with one of his secretaries and that he and that he created a war in
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:27:00.400]  east Eastern Europe to get the minds of the people of America off what his and
[03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:04.120]  they used a little girl running through rubble as the excuse when it turns out
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:08.080]  they lied about babies and incubators they always put out a fake story all
[03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:15.520]  this stuff the whole movie was in the can six months before the Clinton
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:20.560]  allegations with Monica Lewinsky and what happened in Eastern Europe it I mean
[03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:25.880]  it boggles the mind when you and I started doing our stuff on 9-11 three
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:31.000]  days before on television there was a television show about an airliner going
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:36.760]  into the World Trade Center duh I mean they they had oil storm four months
[03:27:36.760 --> 03:27:41.320]  before Katrina even with the with the mayor in the show with the exact same
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:46.320]  thing happening we can go on and on and on and on and on but the archetype is is
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:51.960]  that the our so-called controllers are in separation consciousness and they
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:57.600]  believe that only by materialism by taking the blood of the people the
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:02.520]  peasants can they become more powerful and of course this is an archetype now
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:07.240]  clearly clearly clearly they're also telling us there's two ways to stop them
[03:28:07.240 --> 03:28:12.200]  with silver and with crosses they're telling us what to do with the cross
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:17.720]  represents spirituality if you believe in God and if you know that the grand
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:23.000]  organized is designed is going to protect our souls and you stand up and look
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:27.680]  these people in the eye and say I am in the light of God there is no way you can

[03:33:16.440 --> 03:33:19.560]  and they said the good times are over that's a quote you're going to be
[03:33:19.560 --> 03:33:22.520]  pouring out and they have all these other publications i remember 10 years
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:26.360]  ago hearing mpr brag we're going to have our economy fall apart it's
[03:33:26.360 --> 03:33:28.520]  unsustainable this is going to be good for the earth
[03:33:28.520 --> 03:33:33.320]  no it's good for them to control us and they've hijacked the environmental
[03:33:33.320 --> 03:33:36.920]  movement they control it they have a lot of well-meaning people working for them
[03:33:36.920 --> 03:33:39.720]  but i was talking to george umprey i was saying george you know for many years
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:42.440]  you did your tv show here in austin for more than a decade
[03:33:42.440 --> 03:33:45.800]  uh you don't do it very often anymore i said why don't you just turn a youtube
[03:33:45.800 --> 03:33:49.800]  camera on at your house once a week or when you're in town and and upload
[03:33:49.800 --> 03:33:54.200]  stuff and i was explaining to him how we have eight different youtube channels
[03:33:54.200 --> 03:33:57.800]  that that we've been uploading to for two years i mean we've had our stuff on
[03:33:57.800 --> 03:34:01.880]  youtube since 2005 when it came out but it's now more than half
[03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:05.880]  of the video on the web it's now so that's the battleground
[03:34:05.880 --> 03:34:09.320]  the other censorship there's problems but we go there because when we put it on
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:11.880]  youtube it then gets duplicated to thousands of other
[03:34:11.880 --> 03:34:16.040]  video sites and then and then reaches people but our eight channels
[03:34:16.040 --> 03:34:23.240]  over 110 million views there are 44 million views just on one channel and
[03:34:23.240 --> 03:34:27.640]  that's one small part we're on now over 80 am and fm affiliate it's not 65 we've
[03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:31.400]  grown uh we're now on shortwave satellite xm
[03:34:31.400 --> 03:34:34.680]  uh the podcast over 250 000 people downloaded today
[03:34:34.680 --> 03:34:38.200]  we started an iphone app that's free at info wars dot com 40 plus thousand
[03:34:38.200 --> 03:34:40.680]  have downloaded that in the last three months i mean we have all these
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:44.200]  different ways my films the dvds people buy them they make copies
[03:34:44.200 --> 03:34:47.320]  well a new documentary that we're carrying uh that we're gonna have first
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:51.080]  to start shipping out late next week guys don't tread on me about states
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:54.200]  rights that's available in info wars dot com but the point is
[03:34:54.200 --> 03:34:57.560]  you watch something i did 10 years ago or you did 10 years ago it's evergreen
[03:34:57.560 --> 03:35:01.400]  it's pertinent people see things we did 12 years ago it's pertinent today it's
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:04.840]  evergreen the globalists it's lies and distortions they've got to keep
[03:35:04.840 --> 03:35:09.080]  reapplying reapplying reapplying and so all this work we've done that's just on
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:13.080]  my channels 110 million views not counting all the other channels
[03:35:13.080 --> 03:35:16.760]  you know with six million here for obama deception two million there for obama
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:20.440]  deception uh 500 000 for endgame 300 000 for endgame
[03:35:20.440 --> 03:35:23.480]  a million for endgame you know just on youtube
[03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:30.680]  it's conservatively 200 million people
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:34.040]  and you know to have nightline here and they were fully aware of that that's
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:37.160]  what they were here about they wanted to understand this and that's why obama
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:40.840]  and and the un and the new york times and all these corporations aren't cast
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:43.880]  sunstein who's a big supporter of the new supreme court
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:48.280]  justice nominee kagan they've all called in fact when they had the
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:52.360]  la raza extremist out at ucola saying we're gonna get the old white people
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:55.480]  we're taking over we're gonna get you you know government funded to do this to
[03:35:55.480 --> 03:35:59.400]  divide people they had a sign behind them saying hate speech is not free
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:02.360]  speech so there they are spewing through hate but i defend their first
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:05.000]  amendment till they call for sedition which they were really doing
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:09.880]  which is fire in a theater there they were but then saying my speech has to be
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:12.840]  taken my guns have to be taken so they can carry out
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:16.600]  their system and so they're really going to try this
[03:36:16.600 --> 03:36:20.680]  i mean they're really going for broke here before we go back to calls to our
[03:36:20.680 --> 03:36:24.680]  time for your your take on the rollout the trial
[03:36:24.680 --> 03:36:28.120]  balloons for internet censorship and control well i was just reading
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:32.920]  yesterday that our wonderful new president the
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:36.680]  man of change is another one of his flip-flops he
[03:36:36.680 --> 03:36:40.280]  when he was on the campaign trail he promised that he would protect the
[03:36:40.280 --> 03:36:44.440]  privacy and the freedom of the internet and now his lawyers
[03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:47.960]  are pushing restrictions that are far greater
[03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:52.200]  than president george w bush ever thought about
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:57.000]  folks if you have any of your dear friends who still believe that
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:02.120]  Barry Sotero is there for the people of this country please take them out to
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:05.480]  lunch and just give them the objective information
[03:37:05.480 --> 03:37:09.640]  this fellow is an incredible puppet he's as as
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:14.040]  you know we know he is the tip of the spear he is an incredible choice yeah
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:17.400]  he's very good-looking he's very articulate in front of the monitors
[03:37:17.400 --> 03:37:23.640]  but he is a he is a puppet of the new world order and he's very very dangerous
[03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:27.640]  because he is so good and he is not there for your
[03:37:27.640 --> 03:37:32.360]  rights and he is working diligently to try and restrict restrict the
[03:37:32.360 --> 03:37:36.520]  internet and the internet is our friend and they're going to try to take it down
[03:37:36.520 --> 03:37:40.200]  with a false cyber attack just like they create the financial
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:43.480]  terrorism they stage the terror attacks they're saying
[03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:46.680]  oh the cyber attacks coming and we have to be able to shut the web off and
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:50.920]  restrict freedom and control all isp's and decide who can be on the web and
[03:37:50.920 --> 03:37:54.760]  we have an internet too that's kindler and gentler to stop al-qaeda
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:58.760]  attacking our internet george and just meanwhile obama's in all these speeches
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:03.320]  bemoaning how he's being discredited by the internet yeah and just fyi
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:08.360]  instead of using google you start page dot com start they don't record your
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:11.640]  searches it's a step in the right direction i think that
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:13.960]  they're one of your sponsors are no they're great folks
[03:38:13.960 --> 03:38:16.920]  um and i really support star page dot com
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:20.600]  uh it's just that when i'm on a radio show or something
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:23.560]  if i i have to say you know let's say i'm on some talk show and i've got like a
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:27.640]  minute and a half i have to say go to search engines
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:31.400]  like start page dot com but if i just say google
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:35.960]  people know and the problem is i've gotten so google obsessed
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:39.880]  where i know how to search google that with some other search engines if i give
[03:38:39.880 --> 03:38:43.400]  out a certain headline i mean it may not get what i'm looking for exactly but
[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:46.680]  but but i think it's important to use proxy servers
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:49.960]  and other systems when you go to google and i think start page is excellent as
[03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:53.000]  well and i've gone over to start page in my own research
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  and for all of you i certainly encourage all of you
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:01.160]  to have a group of friends email friends around the country
[03:39:01.160 --> 03:39:04.040]  that once a week or twice a week or once a day
[03:39:04.040 --> 03:39:07.560]  you send them information about the economy about politics
[03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:11.160]  about the environment yeah don't just receive this information
[03:39:11.160 --> 03:39:14.680]  i know most of you already know this use it because then because because it's
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:17.640]  hurting the globalist that's why they're calling for restricting be a
[03:39:17.640 --> 03:39:21.560]  magnifier be the clear light be the be the paul
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:27.400]  reveres because i'll tell you what a few of us as we grow and grow and grow we
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:31.320]  are sending out information and the information that i received just four
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:35.880]  or five years ago is just minuscule in comparison to what i receive
[03:39:35.880 --> 03:39:39.000]  every week it's exponential it's unbelievable what i'm getting and the
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:41.960]  quality of info is getting better you know the globalists have their
[03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:45.160]  disinfo agents you know it's not just radical hispanic
[03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:48.200]  groups funded by the ford foundation the cia on record
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:51.800]  that are trying to go out and and and say you're an uncle tom to hispanics that
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:55.320]  are you know free market pro second amendment pro america
[03:39:55.320 --> 03:39:59.240]  i've had the white supremacist like uh... howl turner who's now been proven to be
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:03.640]  a fed major newspapers he admits he's now fb i national security level
[03:40:03.640 --> 03:40:06.840]  why are all the white supremacists attacking me because they want to
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:11.320]  radicalize white people the feds want to make sure that we get off message
[03:40:11.320 --> 03:40:14.840]  so that it's not something that other people feel like they can be part of
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:19.880]  another microcosm of that is uh... just like we've had the republicans come in
[03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:23.000]  with the tea party express and try to take over the tea party
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:26.120]  so now it's not a ron paul libertarian type thing
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:29.800]  it's a republican thing but that's not working as well so just like i've had
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:32.920]  white supremacists try to intimidate me over the last 15 years
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:36.040]  to you know you're white you better join us or you're scum
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:39.880]  the hispanics can't give into that either and and tea party people can't go
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:43.880]  under the republican parties control all of this is about co-opting
[03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:48.280]  absolutely in the factory may is very very clear
[03:40:48.280 --> 03:40:52.040]  is that we're all in this together it's not
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:55.640]  just white americans it's not just
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:59.960]  it's not just male americans it's not just americans it's all the people of this
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:03.000]  planet and we have a choice between fear
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:06.760]  and love we have a choice between materialism and domination
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:11.800]  or an economy in a world in which we cooperate and we take care
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:15.640]  and right now is the choice every single one of you every single one of you have
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:19.400]  a choice and by sitting out by not doing anything just by
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:23.000]  listening to show i know you've already cast your vote and
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:28.040]  and one person as mahatma ghandi said can change the whole world
[03:41:28.040 --> 03:41:31.480]  trust yourself by telling the truth and having courage
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:34.360]  well i think that's the key is courage doesn't mean you have to charge a
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:37.400]  machine gun nest it means you've got to stand up in a dinner party
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:40.120]  but we were the four d and say hey i know we're all having a good time here
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:43.960]  talking about stocks and bonds and basketball scores or golf
[03:41:43.960 --> 03:41:46.920]  but you need to know this is going on i care about everybody here so i'm going
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:51.320]  to speak for a few minutes and because as americans as free people we're
[03:41:51.320 --> 03:41:54.360]  supposed to talk about real issues i mean i'll i'll be in a
[03:41:54.360 --> 03:41:59.080]  convenience store and say look at this none of this candy
[03:41:59.080 --> 03:42:03.400]  has regular sugar it's all aspartame did you know that's a chemical weapon
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:06.680]  did you know it's the byproduct of a genetically engineered bacteria
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:13.000]  go home and search engine uh the term uh aspartame manufacturing process or
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:16.680]  aspartame cancer and people will be looking at me weird and i go
[03:42:16.680 --> 03:42:20.600]  it's normal for me to warn you we're supposed to communicate not just
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:24.520]  stuff you see on tv you're meant to talk to your neighbors and so i'll start
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:27.160]  preaching even louder and i do that in front of my kids
[03:42:27.160 --> 03:42:31.000]  when they're with me at the grocery store or at a convenience store if we go
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.960]  on a hike we pull in and and and they want some water and they go and they
[03:42:33.960 --> 03:42:35.880]  want some bubblegum and i can't buy it i go
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:39.640]  i'm sorry this has chemical weapons in it let me and they go oh that's right daddy
[03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:44.040]  and then some guy starts laughing in my son terms and says i guess he's brainwashed
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:49.560]  you know i i love you alex and i i do the same thing i play a lot of golf i go
[03:42:49.560 --> 03:42:53.800]  out to the driving range and you know about once every three times i'm at the
[03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:58.040]  driving range the white jets go over and are laying down the chem trails
[03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:03.240]  and there'll be 20 people at the driving range and nobody they're outside and
[03:43:03.240 --> 03:43:07.000]  99 percent of the people never look up in the air
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:11.640]  and i'll just go hey friends take a look up there what is that up there
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:16.280]  what is that that's not a that's not a contrail and i'll get people talking
[03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:22.760]  and and and with the amazing thing is eyes wide shut these are our our
[03:43:22.760 --> 03:43:26.680]  suppressors our slave masters have done such an incredible job
[03:43:26.680 --> 03:43:32.920]  they are carrying out their crime right in front of our eyes but you know what
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:36.200]  there are people that have their eyes wide open
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:40.040]  and more and more people and you can just point to people and say what is that
[03:43:40.040 --> 03:43:43.720]  up there what is that is not a contrail and then explain to them what a chem
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:47.240]  trail is all right and i want to go over this briefly and then go to calls
[03:43:47.240 --> 03:43:50.280]  not just about chem trails but a microcosm
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:55.240]  uh in 1992 a scientist and we're making a film on this
[03:43:55.240 --> 03:43:59.240]  uh we got a Nobel prize for a plan to stop global warming which we know is a
[03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:01.960]  fraud that's just their cover story to spray
[03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:04.760]  barium salts and aluminum dioxide in the atmosphere
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:08.520]  now suddenly in the last five years high school textbooks say the government is
[03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:12.440]  spraying this is normal so for the kids they're just being conditioned for
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:16.440]  adults were told it doesn't exist then the white house science are who wrote
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:20.520]  eco science his first speech you can pull this up on youtube
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:24.520]  john p holdren talks about geo engineering and he'll say
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:28.360]  we've been doing tests since the early nineties of spraying the atmosphere
[03:44:28.360 --> 03:44:31.960]  now we're going operational but there's never a discussion about the funding or
[03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:35.400]  who's doing it so what's happened is because we've exposed the chem trails
[03:44:35.400 --> 03:44:38.520]  of the aerosol crimes yeah they come right out in plain view and
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:44.280]  calmly say yes we're spraying you move along just like they came out on fox
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:47.560]  news ap roiders the last month new york times
[03:44:47.560 --> 03:44:51.960]  and said we are helping grow the opium we have to our al-qaeda will make the
[03:44:51.960 --> 03:44:55.240]  money and they'll take over 500 billion a year no
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:58.840]  discussion of where are you shipping it why is why don't you just legalize it
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:01.720]  and then that would drive down the price and al-qaeda wouldn't get the money or
[03:45:01.720 --> 03:45:04.280]  well what do you mean al-qaeda will get the money
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:09.080]  again they just oh we are growing the opium now oh we are spraying you now
[03:45:09.080 --> 03:45:12.840]  oh we are looking at putting things in your water to sterilize you they're
[03:45:12.840 --> 03:45:15.880]  already doing it so so it's that same thing of
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:20.040]  it isn't just in their religious or sadomasochistic psycho world they do
[03:45:20.040 --> 03:45:23.160]  this there's a method to it where they just calmly
[03:45:23.160 --> 03:45:26.680]  tell you like it loses the power yeah we're spraying you
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:30.600]  yeah there's some cancer viruses in there yeah it was all hype about the flu
[03:45:30.600 --> 03:45:35.240]  yeah we're we're we're growing the drugs yeah it's amazing
[03:45:35.240 --> 03:45:38.760]  it's right in front of our eyes and again as i said before
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:43.960]  what an incredible time to be alive and i am so thankful that i am here right in
[03:45:43.960 --> 03:45:47.960]  the epicenter of the truce center say it next to my friend
[03:45:47.960 --> 03:45:52.680]  alex right here because you know what telling the truth standing up for freedom
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:45:55.800]  having love in your heart making new friends
[03:45:55.800 --> 03:45:59.960]  working for freedom working for the ideals of the republic
[03:45:59.960 --> 03:46:05.080]  cleaning up our economy and our our environment
[03:46:05.080 --> 03:46:09.480]  what more fun things are there to do and we're only alive once this is a great
[03:46:09.480 --> 03:46:12.520]  time of change and we're going to decide the destiny
[03:46:12.520 --> 03:46:16.200]  of this planet and then it's journey to the stars let's go to phone calls well
[03:46:16.200 --> 03:46:20.200]  said George Humphrey economist joining us here in studio author filmmaker as
[03:46:20.200 --> 03:46:23.640]  well again i'm alex jones if you just joined us as we attempt to wake the
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:26.680]  planet up to defeat the new world order the social
[03:46:26.680 --> 03:46:31.640]  engineers let's talk to frank and nevada you're on the air thanks for holding
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:35.480]  hey how you doing guys uh just a terrific show i'm i'm loving listening to you
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:38.760]  today but you know you gotta remember one thing in ritual
[03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:41.480]  magic one of the things that they like to do
[03:46:41.480 --> 03:46:45.560]  is they like to create out of nothing in other words
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:48.840]  when they create a work of art that that formats
[03:46:48.840 --> 03:46:52.760]  their concept like the films a couple of years ago yeah no that's the lesser
[03:46:52.760 --> 03:46:55.720]  magic that's preparing the sword you know the rough
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:47:01.880]  sword before they polish it exactly we have to remember is we cannot
[03:47:01.880 --> 03:47:06.680]  attack them based on their rules when they destroy our economy because they
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:10.040]  don't want an audit of the fed so they dump the stock market
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:14.920]  or or or they dump all this oil in the Gulf of of Mexico so that they can
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:18.200]  destroy all the coastlines along the southern part of our country
[03:47:18.200 --> 03:47:23.720]  to destroy the food chain we cannot deal with them on their level we must
[03:47:23.720 --> 03:47:26.840]  constantly be fighting them with truth and with
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:30.920]  with our purity of heart because these are evil creatures as you said
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:36.040]  they are vampires what they do is they suck on the life force of humanity
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:41.960]  well well well said my friend and uh and i think it's that separation from them
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:46.040]  you know they're in their evil we have to be part of the good and the love and we
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:50.360]  need to make the clean break and point out and even declare it
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:54.920]  saying something's powerful i am not with you i'm going to stand against you
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:47:59.320]  i'm going against you and we're going to beat you i i think it's very important
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:03.800]  to declare it and and to really consciously realize this so people who
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:06.920]  serve this system who are compartmentalized and who aren't consciously
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:10.040]  part of the evil you need to assess what you're in
[03:48:10.040 --> 03:48:14.440]  and and and and understand that if you're aiding and abetting this system
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:18.200]  uh you're part of the problem yeah it's like in the matrix in the movie the
[03:48:18.200 --> 03:48:23.400]  matrix if you weren't down as a human being in zion
[03:48:23.400 --> 03:48:27.640]  you were part of the matrix no matter how good looking you were or
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:30.920]  how rich you were you were part of the problem and
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:35.400]  there are some basic laws of the universe the law of intention
[03:48:35.400 --> 03:48:39.880]  we have to set our intention are we for freedom are we for the republic are we
[03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:44.200]  for sustainability are we for love or are we for this control matrix and
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:47.160]  remember they always have counterfeits you say love and sustainability and
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:51.240]  working together through free will they come with slavery for the collective
[03:48:51.240 --> 03:48:54.360]  absolutely they always have a counterfeit and we always have to be
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:58.200]  very articulate when we say and then just like the fellow said
[03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:02.440]  through the purity of our heart only through the law of attraction
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.360]  and we can have all the great words in the world and we can rant and rave but
[03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:09.800]  if we're not paying if we're not taking care of our families if we're
[03:49:09.800 --> 03:49:13.320]  trashing things ourselves and if we aren't living a good life
[03:49:13.320 --> 03:49:16.520]  all the words in the world now you've got a zero you've got to not just talk to
[03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:18.840]  talk you've got to walk to walk and i've noticed when i've been talking to
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:22.200]  higher-powered people if i'm tired and not focused and try to give them some
[03:49:22.200 --> 03:49:25.480]  info they'll laugh at it but but when i really get
[03:49:25.480 --> 03:49:29.080]  on and focused and it's like a spiritual message
[03:49:29.080 --> 03:49:32.920]  it's almost electric people can tell the truth it's like i'm warning you
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:35.880]  you know i'm not so many yuppies when you tell them about something they think
[03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:39.560]  you're showing off or they'll say i don't care if the market went down i'm not
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:43.400]  in it as if as if you know they're separated from
[03:49:43.400 --> 03:49:46.520]  things yeah and that's why discernment is so
[03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:51.480]  essential at this time there are a lot of souls on this planet
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:57.080]  who have chosen to go down the path of materialism and of fear
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:00.440]  and you just not going to be able to do just like you can't deal with certain
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:04.920]  alcoholics or people who are irrational you can love them and you can try and
[03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:07.800]  help them but we've got to take care of ourselves
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:11.240]  our friends and our family and have that pure intention
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:15.080]  to make charity starts at home absolutely i mean you've got to get your
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:18.760]  house in order and that doesn't but at the same time it's sophisticated
[03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:22.200]  a lot of people go to the extreme of that and i appreciate your call frank great
[03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:24.760]  points they go to the extreme and they say well i'm not
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:27.800]  perfect i don't have all the answers so i better just
[03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:30.920]  never speak out or get involved no no no no it just means
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:34.520]  you're going in the right direction you've made a decision to try to be good
[03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:38.680]  a decision to open yourself up to goodness and to set yourself
[03:50:38.680 --> 03:50:42.760]  against evil absolutely you don't have to be perfect
[03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:47.160]  this is part of a great game and working for freedom working for peace
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:51.000]  is part of the game it's a great game and it's a progression you'll get better
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.800]  and better at this you know the further you go
[03:50:53.800 --> 03:50:57.320]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen jam in a few final calls

[03:57:36.360 --> 03:57:40.760]  absolutely for example in in hitlers germany in 1930s
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:45.720]  the gays were offered all these nice new uniforms to be in the ss and they
[03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:49.480]  were told that they were going to have safety and then they came in and did the
[03:57:49.480 --> 03:57:52.760]  dirty work in a couple years later then they were put in jail night of the
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:56.040]  long knives they killed what was it fifty something thousand gays in one night
[03:57:56.040 --> 03:57:59.960]  the nazi party was a gay movement it was a gay movement and then they turned
[03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:03.640]  down you can't if you sell out you sell out yourself
[03:58:03.640 --> 03:58:06.600]  absolutely and by the way that's not even attacking gay people that's a
