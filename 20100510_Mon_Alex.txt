[00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:08.747]  Everything is proceeding
[00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:43.782]  As the bankers stated years ago, how their plan would unfold.
[00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:46.626]  Everything is proceeding as they have engineered it.
[00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:54.074]  The total collapse of Western civilization and the real economy to the banking cartel.
[00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:55.877]  Last week it was a hundred and
[00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:01.478]  50 billion plus dollars for Greece.
[00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:08.323]  Then over the weekend it was 600 billion dollars for Greece and the banks.
[00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:10.665]  And now it's a trillion today.
[00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:13.547]  And will it be 2 trillion tomorrow?
[00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:14.108]  Probably.
[00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:35.016]  See, once they hold the economy hostage, they will implode it, in looting after looting, and they're now passing the laws in Greece, they're passing the laws in European nations, to take large portions of people's 401ks and pension funds.
[00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.957]  Austerity!
[00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:39.939]  Wrecking the real economy, destroying the middle class,
[00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:49.237]  Just as has been done by the same people in Eastern Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, in poorer areas of Asia.
[00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:53.221]  Always the same system.
[00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.363]  Always the same operation.
[00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:14.547]  We have two extremely informative guests, a former stock trader, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange System, a person who has predicted what's happening years ago with total precision, Max Keiser will be joining us in the second hour from Paris.
[00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:24.253]  And then, former city council member, businessman, degreed economist, someone who predicted this all more than 10 years ago, that's who we have on.
[00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:25.494]  Understand, that's not bragging.
[00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:31.205]  It's like telling somebody, don't play with that gun, don't load it and put it to your head and pull the trigger.
[00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:34.708]  And you load it, put it to your head and pull the trigger and it blows your head off.
[00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.029]  You say, see, I told you so.
[00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:44.515]  When we point out that these guests that we have on have accurately gauged exactly what's happening, it's so people pay attention in the future.
[00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.832]  I wish we were wrong.
[00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:50.613]  I wish the globalists weren't doing this.
[00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:51.713]  Believe me, I'm freaked out.
[00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.274]  I mean, it's one thing to know they're planning it.
[00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.335]  It's another thing to see it unfold exactly as we knew it would.
[00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:00.836]  We can tell you what's coming in Phase 3 of this.
[00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:02.657]  This is Phase 2 right now.
[00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:12.400]  Phase 3, carbon taxes, VAT taxes, federal property taxes, on top of the new FEMA taxes that are a
[00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.127]  We're good to go.
[00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:42.309]  Who is hardcore anti-gun, fully funded by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Larry Summers.
[00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:55.032]  She is a acolyte of Cash Sunstein who believes in a total end to the First Amendment and free speech and liberty and who wants the arrest of anyone that criticizes anthropogenic or man-made global warming.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.982]  It is all happening.
[00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:16.118]  They are moving on every front with a blitzkrieg of oppression, a blitzkrieg of looting, a blitzkrieg of tyranny and despotism, a blitzkrieg of galactic level larceny and corruption.
[00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:19.902]  World government is openly being announced
[00:04:20.973 --> 00:04:26.398]  It is openly taking over the planet and rendering us down to abject poor slaves.
[00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:34.526]  You will see the effect of this and there will be more quote bailouts that is mass wealth transfers as they wreck the economy scientifically.
[00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:38.449]  Massive tax increases meant to further stall the economy.
[00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:53.802]  They've got us on our knees and they are coming in with daggers and knives and hatchets, stabbing the innards of liberty as the lifeblood of the economy globally pours out into the mouth of these dragons.
[00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:55.223]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:57.725]  We're going to cover it all on the other side.
[00:04:57.725 --> 00:04:58.886]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:02.962]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:05.343]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:08.565]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:13.667]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:17.869]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.533]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.417]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:26.321]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:33.933]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.654]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:42.496]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:46.180]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.261]  And I got news for you.
[00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:48.622]  You're everyone else.

[00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:09.537]  A New World Order based upon collective action.

[00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:07.027]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:12.232]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:15.095]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:20.861]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:30.230]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:37.718]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.163]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:07.944]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:27.218]  Monday through Friday, we're here live 11 a.m.
[00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:27.859]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:27.859 --> 00:08:29.681]  Central, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:30.962]  Eastern.
[00:08:30.962 --> 00:08:37.088]  Desperately trying to wake up the American people and the people of the planet.
[00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:47.419]  Desperately posting government documents, IMF, World Bank documents, globalist statements, bragging and laughing about the world government they're setting up.
[00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:56.683]  Trying to get people to get as focused on finance and the banking cartels and the military-industrial complex.
[00:08:56.683 --> 00:09:04.794]  Just trying to get people as focused on that as they are on going to the topless bars or watching their favorite football or soccer game.
[00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:22.376]  Because if we continue to allow them to have these successes that they're having now, taking over society, always in the name of stopping a crisis, which they always created, the sky's the limit.
[00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:26.838]  The last month, we've seen the head of the World Bank, the head of the IMF, the head of the Federal Reserve.
[00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:37.837]  Different banking heads of the G20 say austerity is here and we're going to destroy the economy to save the environment.
[00:09:37.837 --> 00:09:39.977]  You know, oh, it's good that we're in a depression.
[00:09:39.977 --> 00:09:42.878]  That's lowering our carbon footprints.
[00:09:42.878 --> 00:09:56.640]  All the big central banks financing the fake environmental movement that is meant to further shut down any free market industrial capacity on Main Street in your town, in your city, in your county, in your state.
[00:09:57.915 --> 00:10:05.981]  This is financial economic conquest backed up by the paramilitary forces.
[00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:08.683]  The Globalists staged the economic crises.
[00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:11.165]  On record, we have all their emails, all their documents.
[00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:13.767]  It's not even hidden that they premeditatedly did this.
[00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:17.410]  Goldman Sachs leading the wolf pack.
[00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:26.698]  We on record know that governments have staged many terror attacks as their pretext to bring in the physical force and to train us to live in a high-tech police state.
[00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:40.203]  I mean, I see articles every day, one out of Texas, where they said, well, the federal government has ordered us to not allow children to have any sweets in their lunch box.
[00:10:40.203 --> 00:10:52.329]  Instead of just taking the Coke machines out that the schools put in to make money, and making the school lunches more healthy, they go to the extreme of saying, no, we're going to inspect your lunch boxes, and if a
[00:10:54.128 --> 00:11:00.090]  Seven-year-old little girl is caught with one apple?
[00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.652]  Jolly rancher, she is expelled for one week and the school's saying she's lucky.
[00:11:05.652 --> 00:11:07.693]  This is zero tolerance.
[00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:12.954]  Next time, the police may be called in.
[00:11:12.954 --> 00:11:20.357]  But if she was eating a handful of Ritalin or Prozac, now that would have been a different story.
[00:11:21.789 --> 00:11:23.709]  And that's just the backdrop.
[00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:31.151]  Public schools watching the kids in one school district 56,000 times in one year.
[00:11:31.151 --> 00:11:35.012]  We have the school emails where they're saying, oh, it's so much fun to watch them at home.
[00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:36.953]  This is better than a soap opera.
[00:11:36.953 --> 00:11:38.833]  Oh, I love recording it.
[00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:41.194]  Oh, I love watching them in their bedrooms.
[00:11:41.194 --> 00:11:44.254]  Oh my goodness.
[00:11:44.254 --> 00:11:46.235]  And they just throw it in your face and nothing's done.
[00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:47.115]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:55.660]  You have all the heads of the big private banks come out and say, the good times are over!
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.401]  For good!
[00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:07.867]  You're going to have it worse than your parents had it, and your children are going to have it a hell of a lot worse than you've had it, but you're not going to have to wait for your kids, who are 10 years old, to grow up and be poor.
[00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:11.048]  You're going to be poor right now!
[00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:11.649]  Right now!
[00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:13.710]  We're going to take your pension funds.
[00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.311]  Private and public.
[00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:28.718]  We're gonna take it and let corporations create side companies, different divisions, and then shut down the old division and move it over and take your pension fund and fire you or make you train your replacements.
[00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:30.379]  We're gonna expand NAFTA and GAAP.
[00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:32.861]  We're gonna bust the borders wide open.
[00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:34.922]  It's open season on anybody
[00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:49.891]  Who tries to be self-sufficient and who wants to be able to live the American dream or the dream of being a free person.
[00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:50.232]  It's here!
[00:12:51.935 --> 00:13:08.368]  Just overnight, imagine all the discussions and all the debates and all of the prodding and fear-mongering and the former Goldman Sachs head, who was the Treasury head at the time, with his counterpart, the head of the New York Fed.
[00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:13.573]  You had Henry Paulson and Timmy Geithner and Ben Bernanke, all Goldman Sachs pirates.
[00:13:16.294 --> 00:13:28.825]  And they went before Congress and they said there will be blood in the streets, total depression, collapse of society unless you give us this blank check for what is now well above 30 trillion dollars.
[00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:38.754]  Another 20 trillion stolen from other nations, paid into the banks.
[00:13:38.754 --> 00:13:40.275]  And then suddenly overnight,
[00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:47.219]  Oh, there's secret meetings going on with the private bank heads in the G20 last week.
[00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:55.226]  It's a hundred and fifty billion dollars.
[00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:58.508]  It's six hundred and thirty-five billion.
[00:13:58.508 --> 00:13:59.990]  It's a trillion!
[00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.031]  No, wait!
[00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:06.195]  It's more than a trillion!
[00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:09.298]  And before they would put out lies like, oh, it's a eight hundred and...
[00:14:10.623 --> 00:14:13.784]  Eighty-six billion dollar bailout.
[00:14:13.784 --> 00:14:15.105]  No, it was in the tens of trillions.
[00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.765]  So now they're telling you it's a trillion.
[00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:19.626]  I mean, will it be a hundred trillion?
[00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:26.829]  And again, this is more money than exists in the entire planet to begin with.
[00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:27.749]  Real assets.
[00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:30.870]  You can't buy real things with all this money.
[00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.231]  It only uses a weapon to bring us into complete bondage.
[00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:38.693]  And they tell us, oh, we're doing this to save the Eurozone.
[00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:49.736]  The European countries have to give these trillions of dollars to private banks and we can't tell you where it's going.
[00:14:49.736 --> 00:14:51.917]  Oh no, that's all secret!
[00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:54.679]  Or the Euro will fall.
[00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:58.542]  And I had BBC reporter Greg Pallast on just last week.
[00:14:58.542 --> 00:15:05.587]  He talked about some of the founding members of the Euro by name bragging to him that it was designed to take over European nations.
[00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:10.041]  Get them into fraudulent derivatives debt.
[00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.444]  Oh, they planned this 50 years ago.
[00:15:13.444 --> 00:15:19.588]  Oh, sure, they were getting money and power and control and robbing people all the way along, but now this is the big sweep.
[00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:24.692]  This is the all-in, the total commitment.
[00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:34.519]  And now they've ordered socialized Europe for workers to... They socialize risk, privatize profit.
[00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:34.879]  Remember that.
[00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:39.206]  It's not socialism for the elite, it's only for us.
[00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:44.549]  And they force you to invest in government health care and in government-controlled pension funds and 401ks.
[00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.749]  You pay for it.
[00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:51.491]  In Greece, they take around half of your paycheck for your pension fund.
[00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:58.975]  And then, now that you retire and you say, I want my money, they say, oh no, you're greedy Greeks.
[00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:04.237]  You caused this, not Goldman Sachs running your country as your finance minister and your president.
[00:16:05.874 --> 00:16:08.715]  A public British agent.
[00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.255]  And they sell it to the world.
[00:16:10.255 --> 00:16:13.816]  This is all happening because of Greece.
[00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:17.617]  You've got to lose your pension funds in Europe because of the Greek workers.
[00:16:17.617 --> 00:16:19.117]  They did it.
[00:16:19.117 --> 00:16:24.879]  It's all their fault.
[00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:28.419]  And then now they tell us, uh, it's actually for the big banks.
[00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:30.100]  The governments have to pay them this money.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.980]  The government's invested in derivatives.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.581]  We have to do it, but we're not going to tell you exactly where the money's going.
[00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:39.864]  Just like here in the United States, they won't say where it went.
[00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:44.766]  And remember, this is a replay of a year and a half ago.
[00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:46.306]  Getting closer to two years ago.
[00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:56.930]  This is an absolute replay of what we saw happen in October and November of 2008.
[00:16:59.448 --> 00:17:11.419]  They told us it's the fault of the scumbag Americans why millions of these lazy people, they went out and they lied on their forms to get credit.
[00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:14.722]  And they're the ones that are causing the financial meltdown.
[00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:15.743]  No.
[00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:19.407]  Because day one when they got the money they said it's not going to the housing
[00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:23.604]  Mortgages to the housing derivatives.
[00:17:23.604 --> 00:17:24.664]  It's going somewhere else.
[00:17:24.664 --> 00:17:25.984]  We're not going to tell you.
[00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:27.424]  But that's the cover story.
[00:17:27.424 --> 00:17:31.425]  It's the American homeowners who were told to go out and take these loans.
[00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.486]  That it's the American dream.
[00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:33.806]  That all of you deserve this.
[00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:35.446]  That you've got to own a home.
[00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:39.487]  You've got to do it.
[00:17:39.487 --> 00:17:42.748]  This is command organized destruction.
[00:17:42.748 --> 00:17:44.749]  And we'll talk about it next hour with Max Keiser.
[00:17:44.749 --> 00:17:46.349]  Where it goes from here.
[00:17:46.349 --> 00:17:50.050]  The absolute total rendering down.
[00:17:51.735 --> 00:18:10.704]  The total destruction of our economy and the entire nation slipping fully into financial bondage.
[00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:14.806]  And now we've got Justice Kagan as
[00:18:19.206 --> 00:18:30.053]  I mean, I read this NewJersey.com mainstream news article, and I can't even believe I'm reading the fact that now they don't even hide this.
[00:18:30.053 --> 00:18:31.393]  They just throw it in our face.
[00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:32.594]  They don't even care.
[00:18:32.594 --> 00:18:41.619]  Justice Kagan and President Larry Summers.
[00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:45.482]  And then the article admits that Kagan
[00:18:47.222 --> 00:18:50.448]  Is a money advisor to Goldman Sachs Global Investment House.
[00:18:50.448 --> 00:18:55.538]  Meanwhile, she made Cass Sunstein, who is now an advisor to Obama, a full professor at Harvard.
[00:18:58.206 --> 00:19:02.167]  He has suggested the concept of marriage be discontinued.
[00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:11.230]  He's also argued that dogs and cats should have standing to sue in court, but that's just so the government can represent the dogs and cats and have a plaintiff to go after you.
[00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:20.653]  He also proposes an absolute ban on free speech, the end of freedom on the internet, the arrest of anyone who doesn't believe in anthropogenic global warming, or that 9-11 could be an inside job.
[00:19:20.653 --> 00:19:24.714]  I mean, this is a crew of revolutionary crooks!
[00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.235]  And now they're getting mad at CBS News.
[00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:33.857]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[00:19:33.857 --> 00:19:40.283]  White House complains about CBS News blog post saying the Supreme Court nominee is gay.
[00:19:40.283 --> 00:19:42.485]  Well, I mean, just be out in the open with it.
[00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:46.469]  If it's not a political issue, well, you're not supposed to talk about it?
[00:19:46.469 --> 00:19:46.830]  Whatever.
[00:19:47.898 --> 00:19:49.340]  She's reportedly gay.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:54.365]  What she is, is a big, fat, ugly tyrant who wants to run our lives.
[00:19:54.365 --> 00:19:58.549]  You're not getting my guns, you pile of pus.
[00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:00.411]  You cast sunsteen piece of trash.
[00:20:01.932 --> 00:20:08.934]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[00:20:08.934 --> 00:20:17.536]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:21.957]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:20:22.577 --> 00:20:22.857]  I think so.
[00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:41.196]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:03.985]  Good day, Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.985 --> 00:21:05.825]  Today is May 10, 2010.
[00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:08.166]  Gold opened at $11.9610 this morning.
[00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:12.687]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $12.2818, $6.1409 for a half ounce, and $3.0705 for a quarter ounce.
[00:21:12.687 --> 00:21:13.027]  That's $12.2818, $6.1409, and $3.0705.
[00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.791]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:28.032]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:32.893]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:36.673]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[00:22:02.344 --> 00:22:06.726]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.507]  Genetically modifying.
[00:22:08.507 --> 00:22:14.931]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:22:14.931 --> 00:22:20.674]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.855]  Starve or surrender.
[00:22:22.855 --> 00:22:23.635]  Surrender.
[00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:27.437]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:22:27.437 --> 00:22:28.318]  What then?
[00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:34.114]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:22:34.114 --> 00:22:38.456]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:41.318]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[00:23:02.287 --> 00:23:03.028]  The problem.
[00:23:03.028 --> 00:23:05.610]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.333]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:10.995]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:23:10.995 --> 00:23:13.518]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:22.506]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:24.308]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12
[00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:25.049]  We're good.
[00:23:39.665 --> 00:23:42.587]  Call 888-395-1164 today.

[00:23:57.156 --> 00:24:00.238]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.223]  These aren't just words.
[00:24:08.223 --> 00:24:17.315]  When I get up here and say, we're going into bondage, you're going to have to pay for these trillions and trillions of dollars being stolen by the banks.
[00:24:17.315 --> 00:24:20.699]  They're only intensifying their derivative sales to governments.
[00:24:21.837 --> 00:24:26.260]  They're raising taxes in every city, county, state, every nation.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:35.447]  They are just robbing everyone, and at Davos, and in the Washington Post, and everywhere, just bragging about how you didn't need the good life anyways.
[00:24:35.447 --> 00:24:37.088]  Everything goes to us.
[00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:39.209]  We're going to decide if you can have a business.
[00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:40.991]  We're training your kids to spy on you.
[00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:44.613]  We're training the Boy Scouts to take on vets and confiscate your guns.
[00:24:44.613 --> 00:24:45.174]  Ha ha!
[00:24:45.874 --> 00:24:51.018]  We're training everybody in the public schools that America's bad and the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:24:51.018 --> 00:24:53.399]  We're training everybody for communism.
[00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:55.741]  I mean, you just can't even make this stuff up.
[00:24:55.741 --> 00:25:09.751]  In the last hour today, I'm going to get back into Robert Rodriguez's new film Machete and why I'm so concerned about it and why we posted that video with the headline, New Film Machete Evokes Race War.
[00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:35.585]  Because I understand the nomenclature and the culture of the La Reconquista Invasora invasion psychology, where the media and the government and finances and funds comedians and actors and producers who will promote racial division and race war.
[00:25:38.567 --> 00:26:03.663]  And of course, yesterday I played the video and audio of a teacher at UCLA up there with their students saying, we're gonna get the white people, this is a communist revolution, Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and everybody cheering, calling for basically the plan of San Diego.
[00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:04.424]  I mean, just the most...
[00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:10.790]  I mean, look at Hattari.
[00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.172]  Federal judges ordered them released.
[00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:22.587]  They didn't say one one-hundredth of what is common with UT professors right here in Austin and UT Dallas, just where I live.
[00:26:24.494 --> 00:26:27.157]  It's whites are scum, we're going to get you.
[00:26:27.157 --> 00:26:40.869]  And then Hispanic Americans that don't want to be part of this, we opened the phones up yesterday, every Hispanic caller, it was only for Hispanic callers, disagreed with what was happening and said that they were intimidated and called basically Uncle Toms or Porchos.
[00:26:42.571 --> 00:27:01.545]  In slang in the US, you know, that means Uncle Tom, and intimidated, and attacked, and we had Hispanics calling in saying, you know, we're patriots, we're anti-New World Order, but my daughter is now a communist, and, you know, basically has fallen to La Raza and Mecha.
[00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:05.328]  It's just so horrible.
[00:27:05.328 --> 00:27:07.269]  And that's the bankers' plan.
[00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:08.811]  That's one of their little aces in the hole.
[00:27:09.758 --> 00:27:15.362]  The push for all of this tyranny, it's just overwhelming.
[00:27:15.362 --> 00:27:16.783]  This country is being ruined.
[00:27:16.783 --> 00:27:20.946]  I mean, it's already financially destroyed, and they're just piling it on.
[00:27:20.946 --> 00:27:21.966]  Why not?
[00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:26.409]  I mean, if you steal 30 trillion, why not steal a few trillion more?
[00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:37.437]  But with this European situation, it's just unspeakable.
[00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.695]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:46.642]  EU creates 1 trillion package to save Euro.
[00:27:46.642 --> 00:27:48.625]  And because it's dictatorial, no vote needed.
[00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:49.987]  They just did it.
[00:27:49.987 --> 00:27:51.410]  It goes from 150 billion overnight to a trillion.
[00:27:54.668 --> 00:28:04.692]  European Union put up a staggering 1 trillion Monday, and the banks get to leverage that out as derivatives again, to contain its spreading government debt crisis.
[00:28:04.692 --> 00:28:16.156]  Oh, it has a spreading government debt crisis, so you add more debt, which the private banks get, and keep it from tearing the euro currency apart and derailing the global economic recovery.
[00:28:16.156 --> 00:28:20.198]  See, oh, I thought the last big bailouts were going to save us.
[00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:23.599]  No, they're designed to wreck us, and this will only put the cherry on top.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.201]  And now they're just going to steal trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions more.
[00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:32.403]  And I've got a stack of news here saying, we're going to get your pension funds.
[00:28:32.403 --> 00:28:35.725]  If you want to keep any of your pension fund, you've got to give us half.
[00:28:35.725 --> 00:28:38.066]  And then a year later, you've got to give us half of that half.
[00:28:38.066 --> 00:28:40.067]  Well, do you want anything?
[00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:43.908]  Well, then you better give it to us.
[00:28:43.908 --> 00:28:45.049]  How do you even run a business?
[00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:52.812]  How do you even keep your money in the bank as capital to fund your business when they could take that any day or shut the banks down and devalue it?
[00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:54.393]  And all the smart money is on that.
[00:28:57.042 --> 00:29:00.444]  Bob Chapman, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, countless others.
[00:29:00.444 --> 00:29:03.526]  I mean, this is a designed global depression.
[00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:04.707]  Do you know what that means?
[00:29:04.707 --> 00:29:07.068]  It doesn't just mean a 3-4 year recession.
[00:29:07.068 --> 00:29:08.649]  It doesn't just mean having a pay cut.
[00:29:08.649 --> 00:29:10.591]  It doesn't just mean losing your job.
[00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:14.713]  It means total collapse.
[00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:16.795]  Poor people living all over the streets.
[00:29:16.795 --> 00:29:18.516]  Government running our lives.
[00:29:18.516 --> 00:29:20.377]  The government launching new wars.
[00:29:20.377 --> 00:29:23.739]  It's just completely evil.
[00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:24.300]  It's here.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.880]  It's happening.
[00:29:29.615 --> 00:29:30.655]  I'm gonna open the phones up.
[00:29:30.655 --> 00:29:36.960]  I want your specific take on what's happening with the banking takeover and any ideas you've got to avert this.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.861]  We've got to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:40.902]  We've got to bring these bankers to justice.
[00:29:40.902 --> 00:29:42.584]  We've got to stop this now.
[00:29:42.584 --> 00:29:43.584]  They're not going to stop.
[00:29:43.584 --> 00:29:44.585]  They're going for broke.
[00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:45.085]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:45.085 --> 00:29:45.606]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.606 --> 00:29:46.626]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:47.647]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:00.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.794 --> 00:30:02.095]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.095 --> 00:30:07.699]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:12.702]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.702 --> 00:30:17.746]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:30:18.266 --> 00:30:23.490]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.811]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:30.614]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.614 --> 00:30:31.735]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.735 --> 00:30:34.797]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:34.797 --> 00:30:38.420]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.622]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:41.622 --> 00:30:43.843]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:44.764]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:49.827]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:49.827 --> 00:30:57.450]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.851]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:06.099 --> 00:31:07.360]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.064]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:11.064 --> 00:31:13.546]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:13.546 --> 00:31:19.412]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:31:19.412 --> 00:31:25.639]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:32.042]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:36.224]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:36.224 --> 00:31:40.506]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:40.506 --> 00:31:43.287]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies...
[00:31:46.448 --> 00:31:50.009]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:51.970]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.090]  It's here.
[00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:59.913]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.315 --> 00:32:04.756]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:08.997]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:32:08.997 --> 00:32:20.680]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:26.501]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:27.381]  We're good to go.
[00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:47.226]  Let's do it!
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:15.320]  Yeah.
[00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:46.234]  Here's a headline that says it all, out of NBC Los Angeles.
[00:33:46.234 --> 00:33:47.454]  Watch your step!
[00:33:47.454 --> 00:33:48.094]  L.A.
[00:33:48.094 --> 00:33:54.136]  will consider repealing a 74 ordinance that made the city responsible for sidewalk repairs.
[00:33:54.136 --> 00:33:58.377]  Well, yeah, that was one of the big scams in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[00:33:58.377 --> 00:34:00.837]  It's now expanded out to small towns.
[00:34:00.837 --> 00:34:07.299]  They will jack up huge taxes on you, saying that they're going to repair and build and expand sidewalks.
[00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:15.912]  But now they're going to keep all the taxes they have for sidewalks, but they're not going to fix them.
[00:34:15.912 --> 00:34:26.516]  And all over the country, every day I see articles where they'll lay off half or more of the police department or sheriff's deputies, and then they announce, but the people we've got will mainly respond to
[00:34:30.097 --> 00:34:30.778]  We're good to go.
[00:34:54.869 --> 00:35:00.411]  41 deputies, they will all basically run the jail and engage in fines and fees.
[00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:18.739]  So, government will now start shrinking in actual services, but expanding in size and in taxes, because almost everything will go to interest on debt to banks.
[00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:29.326]  I don't even know what to say at this point.
[00:35:29.326 --> 00:35:36.010]  We have seen the biggest bailout ever, and that itself is a lie.
[00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.231]  This is not a bailout.
[00:35:38.697 --> 00:35:41.419]  They won't say where the trillions of dollars have gone.
[00:35:41.419 --> 00:35:44.760]  If it was $150 billion last week, it's a trillion today.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.361]  The sky is the limit.
[00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:48.262]  Why do you think the G20's been meeting in secret?
[00:35:48.262 --> 00:35:49.683]  What do you think they've been setting up?
[00:35:49.683 --> 00:35:54.486]  Well, they've all written policy reports in years past talking about how they would set up a world government.
[00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:58.428]  How they would sell derivatives to all levels of government and individuals.
[00:35:58.428 --> 00:36:03.991]  Then they would hold you hostage to it saying, give us trillions of dollars or there'll be a total global depression.
[00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:07.453]  When we're already in a global depression and they're just expanding their control.
[00:36:07.873 --> 00:36:12.178]  And then I've got stacks of news like this.
[00:36:12.178 --> 00:36:13.820]  Houston Police Department.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.043]  This is out of KHOU-TV.
[00:36:16.043 --> 00:36:22.851]  Man killed in his home invasion after suspect poses as census worker.
[00:36:22.851 --> 00:36:24.393]  Tortured him and killed him.
[00:36:24.393 --> 00:36:25.394]  Here's another one.
[00:36:25.394 --> 00:36:26.455]  WHAS-TV.
[00:36:27.898 --> 00:36:32.384]  Volunteer census worker charged with burglary and rape in Indiana.
[00:36:32.384 --> 00:36:33.926]  This happens every time they have a census.
[00:36:33.926 --> 00:36:40.495]  Just raping, killing every criminal you can imagine who wants a plastic badge, wants to boss people around.
[00:36:40.495 --> 00:36:44.200]  A volunteer census worker who made his rounds earlier this week is now accused of
[00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.925]  Returning to a physically handicapped woman's home this weekend and beating her and raping her.
[00:36:48.925 --> 00:36:50.746]  What do you think government does?
[00:36:50.746 --> 00:36:52.568]  That's why government wants you bankrupt.
[00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:53.409]  Wants you disarmed.
[00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:55.310]  They want you handicapped.
[00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.492]  It's basically... Here's the analogy.
[00:36:57.492 --> 00:36:58.553]  Here's the parable.
[00:36:58.553 --> 00:37:03.958]  The globalists are a clan of 40-foot pythons.
[00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:07.790]  Or anacondas.
[00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.453]  Choose your snake.
[00:37:10.453 --> 00:37:14.238]  And they kill by asphyxiation, by strangling you.
[00:37:14.238 --> 00:37:23.669]  And they come up in the night while you're sleeping in the bushes and they curl around you lovingly and quietly and then they squeeze you to death.
[00:37:23.669 --> 00:37:26.332]  And I've read that a lot of prize snakes
[00:37:27.332 --> 00:37:37.821]  That like to eat nutria or big rats, that they will defang and declaw the rats before they feed them to the big snakes.
[00:37:37.821 --> 00:37:38.702]  And that's what we are.
[00:37:38.702 --> 00:37:41.444]  We're all in giant cages.
[00:37:41.444 --> 00:37:47.229]  The whole world's been defanged and declawed, except for the United States, and we've been psychologically defanged and declawed.
[00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:50.031]  And we're just thrown into the mouths of the snakes all day long.
[00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:52.774]  Big, fat, giant snakes crapping all over us.
[00:37:54.534 --> 00:38:15.189]  And the public is just mesmerized by entertainment, sports, and garbage, and knows that their life is getting worse, but they can still get a six-pack of beer, they can still pull into Whataburger, they can still pull into McDonald's, they can still pull into Wendy's, they can still pull into Burger King, they can still, you know, if they save their money, get an iPad or an iPhone and sit there and watch porn all day.
[00:38:18.814 --> 00:38:20.215]  They're under mind control.
[00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:22.897]  The public is under mind control.
[00:38:22.897 --> 00:38:32.404]  And all over the country, they're arresting elementary school students if their mother sends a plastic knife to spread their butter on a roll.
[00:38:32.404 --> 00:38:36.547]  Or you're kicked out of school if you're caught with one Jolly Rancher in your lunchbox.
[00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:42.572]  Because the federal government said so with the Department of Education in Texas.
[00:38:42.572 --> 00:38:44.894]  The federal government deciding what's in lunchboxes.
[00:38:46.064 --> 00:38:51.661]  And they're just everywhere, just totally brainwashing everyone, surveilling everybody.
[00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:59.648]  In every European nation and in the United States, the sperm counts are down by over 80%.
[00:38:59.648 --> 00:39:02.110]  Most women are infertile and can't have kids.
[00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.191]  We're under chemical warfare attack.
[00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:08.594]  And the average person tuning in is laughing, saying, listen to Alex the fear monger.
[00:39:08.594 --> 00:39:09.994]  You won't go look at the textbooks.
[00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:11.255]  You won't go read the documents.
[00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:15.618]  You won't find out every major vaccine's got weaponized cancer viruses in it.
[00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:25.241]  That go into your DNA with their RNA and are hormone triggered in most cases or they're binary, they're triggered by another chemical put in the water.
[00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:27.182]  This is all confirmed.
[00:39:27.182 --> 00:39:34.165]  So that when you hit 55 on average and your hormone level drops, it triggers and you get cancer.
[00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:37.827]  I mean, these slime balls are murdering us something fierce.
[00:39:37.827 --> 00:39:39.789]  And I gotta sit here and watch this happen.
[00:39:39.789 --> 00:39:40.849]  I'm so tired of it.
[00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:43.771]  I don't know how I deal with distress.
[00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:46.963]  Today I'm so overwhelmed.
[00:39:46.963 --> 00:39:51.512]  This only happens every once in a while where I actually get dizzy.
[00:39:51.512 --> 00:39:53.577]  I'm actually dizzy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:57.017 --> 00:40:01.440]  I'm that mentally exhausted, I don't even want to talk about this anymore!
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.381]  It's so outrageous!
[00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:05.343]  It's total dehumanization!
[00:40:05.343 --> 00:40:06.523]  There's no debating it!
[00:40:06.523 --> 00:40:09.105]  It's out in the open!
[00:40:09.105 --> 00:40:11.967]  But by increments, they train us to accept evil.
[00:40:11.967 --> 00:40:13.688]  They train us to accept corruption.
[00:40:13.688 --> 00:40:17.870]  They train us to accept oppression.
[00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.331]  Until we're the frog in the pot!
[00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:22.973]  In any case, you can tell you this, you throw a
[00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.752]  Bullfrog into a boiling hot pan of water.
[00:40:26.752 --> 00:40:30.095]  You even throw its legs in after you've chopped them off.
[00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:34.859]  They'll twitch for two hours.
[00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:50.071]  But you take a bullfrog's legs you've chopped off, you throw it in a pan of water, put some seasoning in there, and it's cold water and you put it on simmer, those legs won't twitch.
[00:40:50.071 --> 00:40:52.834]  But you throw severed legs of a bullfrog
[00:40:55.777 --> 00:41:01.001]  Into boiling water, they'll twitch, they'll jump, they'll be all over the place.
[00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:02.782]  Those nerves fighting back.
[00:41:02.782 --> 00:41:04.163]  And that's all that's happened.
[00:41:04.163 --> 00:41:06.825]  It's the frog in the pot.
[00:41:06.825 --> 00:41:15.932]  And man, I tell you, this country's rolled over, on its back, it's dead in the pan, and the bankers and the criminals are just celebrating.
[00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:22.056]  They love coming out in the Washington Post and CNN and saying, it's good the economy's down.
[00:41:22.056 --> 00:41:24.538]  This saves the earth and our carbon footprint.
[00:41:28.035 --> 00:41:29.776]  The good times are over for you.
[00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:37.042]  I'll never forget, it was in 2000, I'd caught bribery down at the Capitol.
[00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:48.951]  It was in the news, off and on for a couple weeks, and then there was the Violence Policy Center director in the paper, in an interview, saying, we don't care if the majority of Americans are against our gun control.
[00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:52.554]  We have your children in the public schools.
[00:41:52.554 --> 00:41:56.497]  We have them, and we're going to get your guns within the next generation.
[00:41:57.449 --> 00:41:59.473]  Well, that's ten years ago.
[00:41:59.473 --> 00:42:02.901]  Those kids that were five, six years old are about to get out of school.
[00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:04.304]  And they're coming.
[00:42:04.304 --> 00:42:06.107]  And they got uniforms, and they got weapons.
[00:42:11.564 --> 00:42:20.748]  And they've taken our young people to universities and intimidated them, and told them to be communist, and they're not in with the in crowd if they aren't, and it's all funded by the banks!
[00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:22.929]  And you're gonna find out about communism, folks!
[00:42:22.929 --> 00:42:29.232]  You're now going to find out what it's like, and the Republicans are not going to save you when they get in office.
[00:42:29.232 --> 00:42:32.733]  Unless you run yourself, and you keep their feet to the fire.
[00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:37.035]  The good news is, three-term senator,
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.601]  What, out of Utah?
[00:42:39.601 --> 00:42:40.943]  Just lost in the primary?
[00:42:40.943 --> 00:42:42.144]  He was crying after?
[00:42:42.144 --> 00:42:49.112]  I was reading reports out of Maine where Ron Paul type patriots have taken over?
[00:42:49.112 --> 00:42:57.241]  The question is, in the legislature, of the Republican Party, the question is, will they get bought off though?
[00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.042]  It's not enough!
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.902]  That patriots take power in cities and towns and counties.
[00:43:03.902 --> 00:43:07.504]  You've got to be ready to say no to millions of dollars.
[00:43:07.504 --> 00:43:10.766]  And let me tell you, I haven't seen many people who will say no.
[00:43:10.766 --> 00:43:14.568]  I have said no.
[00:43:14.568 --> 00:43:16.229]  Because I understand the full picture.
[00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:21.972]  The only way you can keep people from selling out is for them to really know the score.
[00:43:21.972 --> 00:43:23.452]  Sell out?
[00:43:23.452 --> 00:43:25.073]  I mean, number one, I would never do that.
[00:43:25.073 --> 00:43:25.754]  That's not in me.
[00:43:26.607 --> 00:43:27.567]  I believe in honor.
[00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:29.588]  I'm committed to my cause.
[00:43:29.588 --> 00:43:30.748]  I'm not a piece of trash.
[00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:38.310]  But more than that, sell out to people that are putting poison in the water and in the medicine?
[00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.630]  What, sell out to an 18-wheeler?
[00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:48.052]  I mean, would you take a million dollars to go stand out in front of an 18-wheeler doing 100 miles an hour that will run you over?
[00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:50.477]  Absolutely not.
[00:43:50.477 --> 00:43:53.019]  Would you take a billion dollars to slit your own throat?
[00:43:53.019 --> 00:43:58.143]  Would you take a trillion dollars to jump off a 5,000 foot cliff without a parachute?
[00:43:58.143 --> 00:43:59.024]  No, you wouldn't.
[00:43:59.024 --> 00:44:01.966]  Would you take a billion dollars to have your eyes cut out?
[00:44:01.966 --> 00:44:04.148]  No.
[00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:05.169]  I mean, it's common sense.
[00:44:05.169 --> 00:44:07.831]  These people don't give quarter.
[00:44:08.868 --> 00:44:10.109]  They're not going to back off.
[00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:11.109]  They're not going to stop.
[00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.909]  They're pure evil.
[00:44:11.909 --> 00:44:14.110]  Don't you understand that?
[00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.951]  There's no dealing with these people.
[00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:17.712]  There's no half measures.
[00:44:17.712 --> 00:44:21.414]  They're not going to give us half measures.
[00:44:21.414 --> 00:44:22.874]  They've committed a billion crimes.
[00:44:22.874 --> 00:44:24.035]  Why not commit a billion more?
[00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:30.735]  I was doing the math.
[00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:33.916]  Government killed over 250 million people in the last century.
[00:44:33.916 --> 00:44:35.456]  That's a conservative number, 250.
[00:44:35.456 --> 00:44:37.977]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:44:37.977 --> 00:44:39.317]  Why does this have to happen?
[00:44:39.317 --> 00:44:39.717]  Why?
[00:44:39.717 --> 00:44:46.859]  I mean, can I sit here and read statistics and numbers and big stacks of news with government corruption at every level?
[00:44:46.859 --> 00:44:50.080]  Just absolutely out of control?
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.420]  I know the crime rate's exploded.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.060]  The media won't really tell you that.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.901]  I feel like I ought to just be home guarding my family.
[00:44:55.951 --> 00:45:06.047]  Every instinct I've got is to sell everything I own and just hightail it to some cabin in the woods and just watch society collapse.
[00:45:06.047 --> 00:45:06.928]  You see, that won't work.
[00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:14.185]  They will jack up the taxes, even on some little piece of property, and I'll have to deal with the government inspectors and the control freaks.
[00:45:14.185 --> 00:45:16.046]  They're not gonna let me go hide out.
[00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.567]  They're not gonna let me run away.
[00:45:17.567 --> 00:45:19.427]  You can't run from this, folks.
[00:45:19.427 --> 00:45:20.548]  You can't run.
[00:45:20.548 --> 00:45:23.309]  You just gotta stand up on your hind legs and fight it.
[00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:32.912]  And I just want to knock the teeth out of all of these smiley-faced, self-centered, arrogant, know-it-all, moron yuppies.
[00:45:32.912 --> 00:45:35.373]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:45:35.373 --> 00:45:36.654]  I have just had it with you.
[00:45:39.161 --> 00:45:41.062]  You should all be in the streets.
[00:45:41.062 --> 00:45:47.445]  The city council should have a hundred thousand people at it every week in Austin where I live.
[00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:53.748]  Yeah, one-tenth of the city at least should be down there every time saying, you're not going to get billions.
[00:45:53.748 --> 00:45:58.651]  They were saying today they want tens of billions for the train system in Austin.
[00:45:58.651 --> 00:46:00.932]  Billions and billions for new carbon taxes.
[00:46:00.932 --> 00:46:02.933]  I mean, they're just a bunch of crooks.
[00:46:02.933 --> 00:46:04.114]  Just robbing everyone.
[00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:07.212]  Look, you do deserve what you get.
[00:46:07.212 --> 00:46:12.033]  I understand you're under mind control, you were boiled slowly, but it doesn't matter.
[00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:16.414]  If you're listening to this show and you've been warned, I don't know what your malfunction is.
[00:46:16.414 --> 00:46:21.295]  I don't know what your problem is.
[00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:22.855]  I mean, I've got articles here.
[00:46:22.855 --> 00:46:29.216]  Look at this Daily Mail newspaper article.
[00:46:29.216 --> 00:46:32.297]  The Infertility Time Bomb.
[00:46:32.297 --> 00:46:34.597]  Are Men Facing Rapid Extinction?
[00:46:35.869 --> 00:46:46.895]  And they just report their own scourges that they're carrying out against us, like, gee, we wonder why this is happening.
[00:46:46.895 --> 00:46:51.758]  And it talks about how masses of men are infertile, and it says scientists warn it can only get worse.
[00:46:51.758 --> 00:46:54.600]  Well, of course it's only going to get worse.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.880]  Of course it's only going to get worse.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.281]  I mean, look at this.
[00:46:57.281 --> 00:47:01.904]  Jolly Rancher lands Brazos ISD third grader in detention for a week.
[00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:07.913]  And it says the federal government has ordered them no candy in the lunch boxes.
[00:47:07.913 --> 00:47:12.615]  Prisoners get candy in medium security prisons.
[00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:15.456]  This is all this is, is prison preparation.
[00:47:15.456 --> 00:47:21.259]  But still you let them raise your property taxes, still you send them to the school, still you have them turn your kids against you.
[00:47:21.259 --> 00:47:25.901]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls and Max Keiser's coming up.
[00:47:32.572 --> 00:47:46.763]  I gotta watch people like Robert Rodriguez, who thinks he's being a rebel, putting out a slasher film where white people are basically sub-humans that have to be macheted to death like something out of Rwanda.
[00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:47.964]  I could see their whole plan.
[00:47:47.964 --> 00:47:49.005]  I know their whole plan.
[00:47:49.005 --> 00:47:50.326]  I have all their documents.
[00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:51.486]  I mean, it's all public.
[00:47:51.486 --> 00:47:54.349]  I have to put up with this.
[00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.629]  Why?
[00:47:57.861 --> 00:48:03.646]  I never thought of myself as special or good or upright or as some type of, you know, special good person.
[00:48:03.646 --> 00:48:04.647]  Where are the good people?
[00:48:04.647 --> 00:48:05.527]  Where are the good men?
[00:48:05.527 --> 00:48:07.249]  Where are the people that can see what's going on?
[00:48:07.249 --> 00:48:09.851]  What's wrong with you people?
[00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:14.555]  What's your problem?
[00:48:14.555 --> 00:48:17.397]  What is your problem?
[00:48:17.397 --> 00:48:19.859]  They're saving us from a financial collapse?
[00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:22.781]  They're engineering the stinking thing!
[00:48:22.781 --> 00:48:24.743]  Cindy in Missouri, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:48:26.284 --> 00:48:35.549]  Yes, I just heard from my son-in-law in London and he was saying that Gordon Brown just resigned and I just wondered what that has to do with the economy.
[00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:37.310]  I wonder where this is going to go.
[00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:41.652]  Hey guys, go to BBC for me and pull up... Oh, you already handed me the article.
[00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.172]  Where is it?
[00:48:42.172 --> 00:48:43.673]  I can't even keep track of this anymore.
[00:48:44.923 --> 00:48:46.324]  They're just running in with big stacks.
[00:48:46.324 --> 00:48:47.085]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:47.085 --> 00:48:49.368]  The other two guys are total globalists.
[00:48:49.368 --> 00:48:59.178]  They just know that there's anger in England and so they want to give people a political change and so that's what they're doing here.
[00:48:59.178 --> 00:49:00.219]  Let me just go to BBC.
[00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:02.561]  I'll just do it right now.
[00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:03.202]  Let me see.
[00:49:03.202 --> 00:49:06.385]  BBC News.
[00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:08.107]  There we go.
[00:49:10.103 --> 00:49:12.424]  And Gordon Brown, I'll be able to give you this info.
[00:49:12.424 --> 00:49:13.245]  Yep.
[00:49:13.245 --> 00:49:15.966]  Brown to quit as Labor leader.
[00:49:15.966 --> 00:49:23.310]  Gordon Brown says he is to step down as leader of the Labor Party and has asked the search for a successor to be started.
[00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:23.951]  And so we'll...
[00:49:26.598 --> 00:49:27.358]  We'll go over that.
[00:49:27.358 --> 00:49:29.660]  Live coverage, Brown quits.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:34.743]  And he may even try to have Labor pick a new person, and then Labor still stay in power.
[00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:39.246]  Because it's a three-way hung election, which I don't believe for ten seconds.
[00:49:39.246 --> 00:49:50.773]  Meanwhile, the British Independence Party that keeps gaining seats, and within a few years can end up taking over, you know, their leader crashes in a plane and luckily barely lives.
[00:49:50.773 --> 00:49:53.395]  So, anything else you want to ask, ma'am?
[00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:57.131]  She dropped off, okay.
[00:49:57.131 --> 00:49:58.572]  Let's go to Melvin in New York.
[00:49:58.572 --> 00:50:00.492]  Melvin, you're on the air.
[00:50:00.492 --> 00:50:03.853]  Mr. Jones, this is a great honor right now.
[00:50:03.853 --> 00:50:07.594]  I just want to thank you for everything you're doing, exposing the machete movie, man.
[00:50:07.594 --> 00:50:15.375]  Because out here in New York, I'm the first American in my family, and I see what's going on, and I'm real grateful for your show.
[00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:21.757]  And I just want to say, our history is being destroyed at Hispanics.
[00:50:21.757 --> 00:50:23.477]  Our struggle against collectivism,
[00:50:24.122 --> 00:50:27.386]  Our struggle against people like Fidel Castro and all of that.
[00:50:27.386 --> 00:50:28.608]  That's being trivialized.
[00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:31.131]  It's being made into a good thing.
[00:50:31.556 --> 00:50:38.962]  Like, I remember all through our school, everything is Che Guevara, the hero, that's the cool thing, and rappers worshiping Che Guevara.
[00:50:38.962 --> 00:50:40.203]  Hang on, stay there!
[00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:40.824]  Stay there, Melvin.
[00:50:40.824 --> 00:50:43.386]  I want to come back and give you some time to talk about this.
[00:50:43.386 --> 00:50:53.075]  And in the whole last hour, we're going to open the phones up for Hispanics specifically to call in and, you know, discuss how they're trying to divide everybody in this country.
[00:50:53.075 --> 00:50:56.357]  I mean, Che Guevara, give me a break, folks.
[00:50:56.357 --> 00:50:58.639]  He was just nothing but an Argentine Hitler.
[00:50:58.639 --> 00:50:59.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.971]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.971 --> 00:51:08.553]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:08.553 --> 00:51:13.575]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:13.575 --> 00:51:19.137]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:19.137 --> 00:51:24.379]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:24.379 --> 00:51:26.240]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:26.673 --> 00:51:31.477]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:31.477 --> 00:51:32.598]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:32.598 --> 00:51:35.380]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.303]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:39.303 --> 00:51:42.486]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:42.486 --> 00:51:44.707]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:44.707 --> 00:51:45.648]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:45.648 --> 00:51:45.828]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:53.502 --> 00:51:58.326]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:58.326 --> 00:52:01.769]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[00:52:01.769 --> 00:52:04.091]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:04.091 --> 00:52:06.473]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:06.473 --> 00:52:09.676]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:14.800]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.984]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:19.284 --> 00:52:21.747]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:24.531]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:27.435]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:27.435 --> 00:52:35.045]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:35.365 --> 00:52:40.769]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.769 --> 00:52:43.611]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:47.294]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:47.294 --> 00:52:48.395]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:48.395 --> 00:52:49.716]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.716 --> 00:52:51.237]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:04.166]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:07.005 --> 00:53:08.508]  This message is for you.
[00:53:08.508 --> 00:53:12.235]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:12.235 --> 00:53:14.099]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:18.147]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous
[00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:21.404]  I think so.
[00:53:45.362 --> 00:53:47.223]  Look, I'm gonna boil it down very simply.
[00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.604]  If a nation has a middle class
[00:54:14.755 --> 00:54:19.977]  That is at least as large as 20% of the population.
[00:54:19.977 --> 00:54:24.519]  In every case, they're going to have the right to own guns, the entire population.
[00:54:24.519 --> 00:54:27.780]  There's going to be private property.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:32.762]  The United States had what you could call a middle class that was at least 45% of the population.
[00:54:32.762 --> 00:54:34.463]  Biggest in the world by the 1950s.
[00:54:34.463 --> 00:54:36.424]  It's gone, folks.
[00:54:36.424 --> 00:54:38.405]  If you really look at it, it's about 25% now.
[00:54:38.405 --> 00:54:38.985]  Within a year, it'll be 20%.
[00:54:43.117 --> 00:54:46.120]  And that's at current implosion rates.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.964]  It may be 10% in a year.
[00:54:49.964 --> 00:54:57.392]  And the ultra-rich always wage war against the middle class that's free and independent.
[00:54:57.392 --> 00:55:04.859]  And so, of course, you had blacks and others taken into the Caribbean as slaves to grow sugar cane to produce rum.
[00:55:05.962 --> 00:55:10.871]  Of course you had the native tribes enslaved and made to work as colonial slaves.
[00:55:10.871 --> 00:55:15.079]  And then the big British banks said, look, Spain has fallen.
[00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:16.421]  We've beaten them in 500 years of war.
[00:55:18.424 --> 00:55:23.709]  Plus, we've teamed up with the Dutch, we've beaten the French, they've all pulled out.
[00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:35.621]  We're going to come in and tell these poor people that if they go rob the guy that owns a few hundred acres, and actually owns a factory, that they're going to get what he has.
[00:55:35.621 --> 00:55:36.722]  And we'll put communism in.
[00:55:38.271 --> 00:55:41.372]  And that's all this is, and that's why... I mean, come on, let's be smart here.
[00:55:41.372 --> 00:55:51.535]  Why at every college and every public school... I mean, I was taught by white teachers that white people were bad and communism was good, and that Texas belonged to Mexico.
[00:55:51.535 --> 00:55:56.357]  This is taught so that they can ensure the fall of America.
[00:55:56.357 --> 00:56:03.099]  This is taught to ensure we're killing each other, and then the government will play the part of the referee.
[00:56:04.437 --> 00:56:13.550]  And I am just begging for God to rise up, to raise up Hispanic leaders who will stand up against the New World Order that I can support.
[00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:14.151]  Where are they?
[00:56:14.151 --> 00:56:17.936]  They don't exist because the government and the media have made sure they don't exist.
[00:56:17.936 --> 00:56:18.537]  They're out there!
[00:56:19.414 --> 00:56:22.877]  They've just never been able to get their head up above everybody else.
[00:56:22.877 --> 00:56:26.140]  We have got to take Latin America over for freedom.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.842]  It could just be a jewel!
[00:56:27.842 --> 00:56:31.545]  Can you imagine triple the resources Mexico has in the U.S.?
[00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:33.487]  If they'd have had a George Washington down there?
[00:56:33.487 --> 00:56:35.269]  If they'd have had some basic freedom?
[00:56:35.269 --> 00:56:37.371]  The type of wealth that'd be pouring out of there?
[00:56:37.371 --> 00:56:38.292]  Can you imagine it?
[00:56:38.292 --> 00:56:40.294]  No!
[00:56:40.294 --> 00:56:40.494]  No!
[00:56:43.052 --> 00:56:45.233]  I'm sorry, I just, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:56:45.233 --> 00:56:46.054]  I just can't handle it.
[00:56:46.054 --> 00:56:47.635]  And Robert Rodriguez makes me so sick.
[00:56:47.635 --> 00:56:49.296]  And I'm sure he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:56:49.296 --> 00:56:54.659]  But look at how this is all timed for Arizona-type race war stuff, but based in Texas.
[00:56:54.659 --> 00:56:56.360]  He's been making this for two years.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.481]  It's time to come out right in the middle of this.
[00:56:59.481 --> 00:57:03.284]  See, Hollywood wouldn't give him the funding until two years ago.
[00:57:03.284 --> 00:57:05.605]  It's not that he's an agent, it's that
[00:57:07.264 --> 00:57:09.725]  The globalists know how to wait and use people.
[00:57:09.725 --> 00:57:14.046]  It's the... I'm sorry, Melvin, make your point about Hispanics fighting against collectivism.
[00:57:14.046 --> 00:57:15.586]  I mean, you look at Latin America.
[00:57:15.586 --> 00:57:18.467]  People have been slaves down there for 500 years of collectivism.
[00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:20.528]  It's just a new form of it.
[00:57:20.528 --> 00:57:31.631]  Well, Alex, I want to really thank you, brother, because you talk about stuff that is... It's not... Out here in New York, there isn't one voice, but let me just say that, like I was saying, we're being robbed of our history.
[00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:33.331]  We're taught Che Guevara's a hero.
[00:57:33.331 --> 00:57:35.872]  All of our people we look up to in hip-hop,
[00:57:36.516 --> 00:57:39.897]  Blacks and Hispanics are told, you know, you're all gangsters.
[00:57:39.897 --> 00:57:46.179]  You're going to have an AKA, my name is so-and-so, AKA Al Capone, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Mussolini.
[00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:53.441]  These are all interwoven in the culture, it's in the music, just like they did with communism and rock and roll, instead of being something liberating.
[00:57:53.441 --> 00:58:03.404]  But just sticking with the Che Guevara thing, what they never taught us about, for example, the Dominican Republic, which is a representative republic, it's a... There we go.
[00:58:03.404 --> 00:58:05.125]  So anyway, we freed ourselves
[00:58:05.543 --> 00:58:13.266]  From the Spanish and the Haitians, excuse me, from the Spanish and the French that conquered Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the island of Hispaniola.
[00:58:13.266 --> 00:58:20.169]  They don't teach us about Juan Pablo Duarte, a great libertarian nationalist hero of the Dominican Republic.
[00:58:20.169 --> 00:58:23.870]  It's freedom that's supposed to be our culture, not communism.
[00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.011]  And this is what we're taught in school.
[00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:26.931]  I'm in New York City.
[00:58:26.931 --> 00:58:28.592]  I went to community college.
[00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:33.714]  If you are a liberal and people laugh with you and it's okay in class and the teacher praises you and if you're conservative,
[00:58:34.286 --> 00:58:35.507]  Stay there!
[00:58:35.507 --> 00:58:36.668]  Stay there!
[00:58:50.956 --> 00:58:52.857]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[00:58:52.857 --> 00:58:53.898]  Lost your remote?

[00:59:49.765 --> 00:59:56.631]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.631 --> 01:00:05.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.261]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.261 --> 01:00:08.222]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.767]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.767 --> 01:00:12.347]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:13.888]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.888 --> 01:00:18.089]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.089 --> 01:00:23.111]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:27.693]  Max Keiser to break down what happened in the stock market last week.
[01:00:27.693 --> 01:00:32.215]  Financial terrorism, meant to create fear, just like they had
[01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:38.745]  Henry Paulson and others come out and say we're going to have a depression, you better give us trillions.
[01:00:38.745 --> 01:00:43.029]  Then the markets lost confidence, dropped by over a thousand points.
[01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:46.812]  They came in with their banking takeover.
[01:00:46.812 --> 01:00:49.915]  Same thing being done in Europe right now.
[01:00:49.915 --> 01:00:52.698]  We'll be discussing this with Max Keiser coming up.
[01:00:52.698 --> 01:00:54.159]  Melvin, Fred, Kerry, Jonathan,
[01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:59.976]  Rory, others, your calls are coming up at this hour as well.
[01:00:59.976 --> 01:01:05.019]  But this is such an incredible time to be alive, to see all of this happening.
[01:01:05.019 --> 01:01:08.560]  The system controls the left, and they also control the right.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.782]  The right is just another version of collectivism.
[01:01:12.782 --> 01:01:16.364]  And then they try to manage everybody within that controlled paradigm.
[01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:18.045]  But I'll tell you this, Melvin, in New York.
[01:01:19.738 --> 01:01:27.300]  You say there are no Hispanic leaders in New York or white leaders or black for that matter that we know of that really speak the truth about the true political system.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.900]  It's up to you to take the blinders off.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.521]  It's up to you to show people the controlled system they're under.
[01:01:33.521 --> 01:01:35.542]  And so you should start making YouTube videos.
[01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.002]  You're an eloquent speaker.
[01:01:37.002 --> 01:01:38.922]  You should start an organization.
[01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:40.643]  You should, you know, get
[01:01:41.403 --> 01:01:41.763]  I think?
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.621]  I mean, I couldn't imagine that I would be able to wake up this many people.
[01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:07.623]  And I'm telling you, Melvin, you are the leader we need.
[01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:19.708]  And I know you have the respect in yourself to do it, but you need to have the commanding bearing and the facts, and you need to reach out to people and warn them and explain to them what's really happening.
[01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:20.949]  We must do this now.
[01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:22.629]  Go ahead, Melvin.
[01:02:22.629 --> 01:02:23.030]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.370]  Thank you very much, Tom.
[01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.452]  Continuing on this angle where, you know, we're giving our heroes
[01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:29.896]  Look at Scarface.
[01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:31.397]  He was an anti-hero.
[01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:33.397]  And he's the one that was escaping for Del Castro.
[01:02:33.397 --> 01:02:33.817]  What was he?
[01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:34.357]  A drug dealer?
[01:02:34.357 --> 01:02:34.878]  A co-dealer?
[01:02:34.878 --> 01:02:35.498]  A crack dealer?
[01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:35.978]  A killer?
[01:02:35.978 --> 01:02:39.819]  Died in the end and we're supposed to worship him and he's an anti-hero.
[01:02:39.819 --> 01:02:41.379]  But now look at Machete.
[01:02:41.379 --> 01:02:46.901]  He's a pure killing, murdering, assassin, killing people, trying to impose the law.
[01:02:46.901 --> 01:02:48.261]  And basically he's good.
[01:02:48.261 --> 01:02:50.662]  He's supposed to be our hero that's saving us.
[01:02:50.662 --> 01:02:51.022]  You know?
[01:02:51.022 --> 01:02:54.603]  And I think we are romanced by all the welfare systems.
[01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:55.403]  My family came here.
[01:02:55.403 --> 01:02:55.803]  Everything was
[01:02:56.630 --> 01:03:04.874]  Welfare state being offered to you and, you know, you're going to be taken care of and Section 8 just live here forever and never move out because how much is it going to cost you, you know?
[01:03:04.874 --> 01:03:09.936]  Cheese in the mailbox and all of this, like, this is not, this isn't freedom of progress.
[01:03:09.936 --> 01:03:24.962]  You know, and I think we need to wake up, like, all the Hispanic, Latinos out there, California, wherever you're at, you've got to realize this isn't a little cartoon movie where everybody holds hands together, we get rid of all our borders, and we're all going to get along, but before you know it, you can't go to another country
[01:03:25.883 --> 01:03:27.744]  With a different tax rate.
[01:03:27.744 --> 01:03:28.925]  It's all going to be the same.
[01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:29.945]  We're not going to be free.
[01:03:29.945 --> 01:03:32.206]  We're going to have to have another revolution.
[01:03:32.206 --> 01:03:35.108]  Again, the mainstream media and the... That's what the New World Order is about!
[01:03:35.108 --> 01:03:35.848]  That's what it's about.
[01:03:35.848 --> 01:03:37.329]  It's about know where to run.
[01:03:37.329 --> 01:03:38.549]  They say that.
[01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:41.911]  And they now brag that the good times are over.
[01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:43.592]  Can you imagine these bankers?
[01:03:43.592 --> 01:03:45.332]  Won't tell us where the trillions go.
[01:03:45.332 --> 01:03:47.273]  They're engaged in financial terror.
[01:03:47.273 --> 01:03:50.175]  And they say, we're not going to tell you where the money went and you're our slaves.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:04:08.779]  That's right and a lot of people out here don't understand that and Alex I want to throw this out there actually because I know you lose hope a lot but there's a shining hope for liberty and I think Ron Paul is at the forefront of this and you Judge Napolitano you guys have been demonized for a reason and this is really an outrage to anybody that
[01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:17.461]  Believe in the Constitution, and if the Hispanic doesn't believe in the Constitution of the U.S., they haven't read it, it's been hidden from them, it's not been taught.
[01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:19.263]  We're not taught about George Washington.
[01:04:19.263 --> 01:04:27.010]  We're supposed to be wearing George Washington t-shirts, and for freedom, and escape Fidel Castro and the Communism oppression of our parents and our grandparents.
[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.893]  My grandfather left Cuba, I don't know how he managed to do that.
[01:04:29.893 --> 01:04:31.054]  My whole family is Dominican.
[01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:37.718]  And all we want is a chance to make some dough, legally, and have kids, and have the right to confess.
[01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:43.621]  Exactly, but the globalists don't want you wealthy and being part of the system and really taking over the system.
[01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:48.023]  They want to use everybody to be at each other's throats and destroy the system.
[01:04:48.023 --> 01:04:49.844]  It's a gulag economy.
[01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.306]  It's a system that Max Keiser talks about.
[01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:54.327]  We're going to have him on with us when we come back.
[01:04:54.327 --> 01:04:55.567]  God bless you, Melvin.
[01:04:55.567 --> 01:04:56.488]  Melvin, stand up.
[01:04:56.488 --> 01:04:58.329]  Start making YouTube videos today.
[01:05:00.908 --> 01:05:08.916]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:05:08.916 --> 01:05:16.264]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:05:16.264 --> 01:05:23.271]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:05:23.271 --> 01:05:24.112]  Listen carefully.
[01:05:24.472 --> 01:05:34.176]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:05:34.176 --> 01:05:38.418]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:05:38.418 --> 01:05:41.420]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:01.932]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.932 --> 01:06:07.516]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.516 --> 01:06:12.540]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:17.584]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:23.328]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.328 --> 01:06:30.454]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:31.575]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.575 --> 01:06:37.940]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.443]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:43.665]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:44.706]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:48.249]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:48.249 --> 01:06:49.971]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:03.352]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.793]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:06.634]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[01:07:55.594 --> 01:07:55.994]  Big Brother.
[01:07:55.994 --> 01:07:56.695]  Mainstream Media.
[01:08:09.469 --> 01:08:11.231]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:12.833]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:14.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.374 --> 01:08:18.579]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:24.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.224 --> 01:08:28.209]  Well, Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, has just announced he's going to step down.
[01:08:31.616 --> 01:08:36.523]  They are announcing all over the country that the government is going to stop fixing roads and sidewalks now.
[01:08:36.523 --> 01:08:42.653]  Everything will go on interest to bankers that have designed this financial implosion of the global economy.
[01:08:42.653 --> 01:08:44.616]  We have the Goldman Sachs emails.
[01:08:44.616 --> 01:08:45.757]  We know it's premeditated.
[01:08:47.409 --> 01:08:56.792]  I put out two films on this last year, documenting everything that was going to unfold with Max Keiser and Webster Tarpley and many others.
[01:08:56.792 --> 01:09:03.515]  Paul the Republican, of course the Obama deception, explaining how they control both parties, where this parasite economy is going.
[01:09:04.656 --> 01:09:07.558]  First, it's $150 billion for Greece.
[01:09:07.558 --> 01:09:08.759]  Not for Greece, for the bankers.
[01:09:08.759 --> 01:09:11.341]  They've got to give up half their pension funds at least.
[01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:14.123]  Then it's $600 billion.
[01:09:14.123 --> 01:09:14.984]  Now it's a trillion.
[01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.966]  Now they're saying maybe it'll be more than a trillion.
[01:09:16.966 --> 01:09:19.267]  They won't say where the money's going.
[01:09:19.267 --> 01:09:23.931]  Merkel just lost most of her seats in Germany.
[01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:30.116]  And so the bankers are accelerating this before their governments are all thrown out.
[01:09:30.116 --> 01:09:32.198]  Nicholas Karzose, all the rest of them.
[01:09:32.198 --> 01:09:33.038]  I can't even say his name.
[01:09:33.038 --> 01:09:33.719]  I'm so upset.
[01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:56.442]  It is just, what is happening is so big that I can hardly even articulate how incredible this is, and how we've known they were going to do this, and how this is just the next step with all these new VAT and carbon taxes meant to destroy the economy.
[01:09:56.442 --> 01:10:01.424]  LA Times last week reported, oh we raised all these taxes in California, tax receipts went down.
[01:10:01.424 --> 01:10:03.325]  Of course, they know it does that.
[01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:06.527]  Nicholas Garzozzi, can't even say it today.
[01:10:06.527 --> 01:10:07.027]  Sarkozy.
[01:10:09.474 --> 01:10:14.042]  So with us is Max Keiser for the rest of the hour.
[01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:18.749]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice with what's happening with the economy.
[01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:26.313]  And again, tensions simmer as Greece readies pension reform.
[01:10:26.313 --> 01:10:28.434]  This is out of the French news agency.
[01:10:28.434 --> 01:10:39.301]  And it says, protesters rallied in Athens on Sunday as the government sought to rein in social tensions while pressing ahead with drastic austerity measures aimed at avoiding a debt default.
[01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:44.324]  That means more taxes, taking your 401ks, taking your pensions, and it announces it all here.
[01:10:45.558 --> 01:10:48.800]  But they've had all these secret bank conferences.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.502]  They're not saying where this trillion's going.
[01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:57.767]  How does it tie into the financial terrorism of the market dropping a thousand points last Thursday in five minutes?
[01:10:57.767 --> 01:11:09.816]  Max Keiser, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange System, a successful broker, author, television host on BBC, Al Jazeera, RT, Press TV, the list goes on and on.
[01:11:09.816 --> 01:11:13.859]  He is now here with us to discuss all of this.
[01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:15.180]  Max Keiser, good to have you with us.
[01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:25.985]  Good to be back, Alex Jones, and let's remember May 6th, 2010, a day that will live in infamy.
[01:11:25.985 --> 01:11:32.807]  This was the first unequivocal domestic financial attack in America.
[01:11:32.807 --> 01:11:40.250]  Financial terrorist attack, unequivocal, domestic, first of its kind in America.
[01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.150]  Break down that.
[01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:43.671]  Break down who were the terrorists, how they did it.
[01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:53.397]  Well, in Washington, there was a bill circulating to break up the too-big-to-fail banks.
[01:11:53.397 --> 01:12:04.707]  Of course, the banks don't want to break up their monopolies, so they conducted these weapons of mass financial destruction.
[01:12:04.707 --> 01:12:09.091]  They destroyed 1,000 points, a trillion dollars worth of equity on the market.
[01:12:10.071 --> 01:12:28.184]  When it looked like the coast was clear and Congress decided that they were not going to vote for anything that would break up the banks, then they allowed the markets to come back and they rewarded the Congress people, who of course own a lot of stocks and bank stocks themselves.
[01:12:28.984 --> 01:12:38.227]  So they put a gun to the head of Congress and say, do what we want you to do, or we crash this market, we crash the country's network, we crash your network.
[01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:42.949]  Hank Paulson did it in the end in October of 2008, the same kind of thing.
[01:12:42.949 --> 01:12:44.689]  They crashed the market.
[01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:45.430]  They did it again.
[01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:48.171]  This was more obvious, though.
[01:12:48.171 --> 01:12:52.012]  This 1,000-point drop that only took 15 minutes, this was unequivocal.
[01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:56.814]  Now, this is quite remarkable.
[01:12:56.814 --> 01:12:58.054]  Basically, if you want to know,
[01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:07.297]  Yeah, let's walk through the mechanics of it, and then we have all these internal emails of Goldman Sachs where they're involved in other financial terror.
[01:13:07.297 --> 01:13:08.457]  We know this is their policy.
[01:13:08.457 --> 01:13:16.360]  We know Paulson went in and said, there will be martial law if you don't give us these trillions of dollars in October of 2008, when the Congress wouldn't do it.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:28.124]  They went out on TV, the New York Fed head, the Fed chairman, the Treasury Secretary, all Goldman Sachs alumni, and they came out and they said, we are going to have a depression, and so they used fear
[01:13:28.724 --> 01:13:31.146]  To have the public pull out and drive it down.
[01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:35.190]  This time, and that's what the other experts are saying, this was not a fat finger.
[01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:37.152]  They admit this was not a mistake.
[01:13:37.152 --> 01:13:43.437]  This was insider using the Plunge Protection Team to artificially drive down the market.
[01:13:43.437 --> 01:13:45.559]  Physical financial terrorism.
[01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:46.400]  Not just using
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:54.491]  You know, bad-mouthing like the head of the Rothschilds did by claiming that Napoleon had won at Waterloo, which was a lie.
[01:13:54.491 --> 01:13:56.954]  That's similar to what happened in 2008.
[01:13:56.954 --> 01:14:01.441]  You're saying this was done physically in there.
[01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.702]  Let's go over the mechanics of this.
[01:14:04.946 --> 01:14:16.772]  So on the New York Stock Exchange, there are tens of millions, hundreds of millions of shares that trade daily, and 70% of that is conducted by computers.
[01:14:16.772 --> 01:14:24.216]  So computers are trading effectively with themselves, back and forth over these computer networks.
[01:14:24.216 --> 01:14:33.841]  Now, for the most part, the trading is somewhat benign, but the key concept here to understand is that because 70% of it are computer-to-computer trading,
[01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:36.443]  We're good to go.
[01:14:54.023 --> 01:15:09.267]  If you want to move the price of the stock up or down, and you control 70% of the volume, you have the ability to nudge prices up or down by simply increasing the number of buys over sells that you're making from computer to computer.
[01:15:09.267 --> 01:15:15.229]  If you want the prices to go down, you increase the number of sells to buys from computer to computer.
[01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:20.050]  The cost is zero, because the cost of borrowing money for Wall Street is zero.
[01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:22.851]  The cost of transacting is zero.
[01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:25.993]  And it doesn't cost them anything to engage in this.
[01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:33.819]  That's one of the reasons why interest rates are near zero, is because you have to be able to conduct this type of thing without having any cost.
[01:15:33.819 --> 01:15:49.891]  Now, the second step is when you get the price of a security like an S&P futures contract or an S&P security, which is based on the entire market, you know, it's a proxy for the entire market, it's a price signal.
[01:15:50.865 --> 01:16:00.293]  And this price signal triggers a response from those hundreds of thousands of day traders out there, who then do your dirty work for you.
[01:16:00.293 --> 01:16:13.324]  So, when the price trigger is established, let's say you can move the price up 2 or 3%, and it pops up on everyone's Bloomberg machine, and every day trader in the world sees, oh my gosh, there's a 2% move.
[01:16:13.324 --> 01:16:17.268]  Suddenly the trend momentum players, and these mom-and-poppers, and these day traders,
[01:16:17.668 --> 01:16:18.268]  We're good to go.
[01:16:35.354 --> 01:16:45.882]  And of course this gives them a great way to cover their tracks because they can say, well, you know, we didn't, it wasn't us, it was those day traders out there, it was the market, it wasn't us.
[01:16:45.882 --> 01:16:50.105]  Meanwhile, once the deed is done, in this case with Congress
[01:16:51.391 --> 01:16:51.631]  I think so.
[01:17:07.376 --> 01:17:11.159]  The buying orders come in, and effectively they refill the piñata.
[01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:25.549]  That's what that rally was about at the end of the day Thursday, refilling the piñata so that next week, if Congress decides to come again and say, you know what, we want to break you guys up, we want to attack, we want to get rid of high-frequency trading, they can just do the same thing over again.
[01:17:25.549 --> 01:17:29.371]  This is just now blatant.
[01:17:29.371 --> 01:17:31.853]  It's easy, it's costless, it's very effective.
[01:17:34.235 --> 01:17:41.709]  Now, we know the Plunge Protection Team set up by Reagan in 87 has its fingers in the market and admittedly can control it.
[01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:45.977]  They're in the AP today saying, oh, we're pumping the market up.
[01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:49.262]  I think so.
[01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:49.562]  I think so.
[01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:21.795]  And so the power to save, the power to save is the power to destroy.
[01:18:21.795 --> 01:18:25.577]  Now they're using it to engage in financial terrorism.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:36.841]  We're good to go.
[01:18:55.539 --> 01:19:17.698]  Essentially planned economy started off slowly and then over the next 25 years it kept building momentum and now you've got guys like Bob Rubin and Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke and they are now the new world committee that is got their finger on the weapons of mass financial destruction and they believe they're doing God's work
[01:19:18.078 --> 01:19:22.521]  And they move prices as they see fit to make a political end.
[01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:27.744]  In other words, these markets don't reflect economics at all.
[01:19:27.744 --> 01:19:30.186]  They only reflect a political agenda.
[01:19:30.186 --> 01:19:33.548]  It's pure price-fixing with a political agenda attached.
[01:19:33.548 --> 01:19:45.515]  This is Soviet Union 1955, but done in a way where you've got everybody plugged into their computer, day-trading, thinking that they're going to be the ones to beat the centrally planned central government.
[01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:46.936]  And at the same time,
[01:19:47.987 --> 01:19:54.835]  The central government is bringing about all of these extraordinary extra-legal measures to put people in jail.
[01:19:54.835 --> 01:19:56.277]  Alright Max, got a break.
[01:19:56.277 --> 01:19:56.698]  Stay there.

[01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:06.974]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.

[01:23:10.657 --> 01:23:14.261]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:19.507]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:22.810]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:24.969]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:23:24.969 --> 01:23:27.831]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:23:27.831 --> 01:23:31.153]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[01:23:59.144 --> 01:24:12.509]  We're going to be taking your phone calls from Max Keiser on The Economy, also George Humphrey, economist, in studio with us in the next hour.
[01:24:14.079 --> 01:24:15.680]  MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.983]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:19.983 --> 01:24:21.985]  We've got continual coverage of what's happening.
[01:24:21.985 --> 01:24:25.227]  We haven't even gotten into what's happening in Europe and Greece.
[01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.389]  What will Angela Merkel, what will Nicolas Sarkozy do?
[01:24:28.389 --> 01:24:30.570]  Why has Gordon Brown been forced to step down?
[01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:32.712]  I mean, this is a major shake-up.
[01:24:32.712 --> 01:24:35.854]  Now, I remember that last Thursday.
[01:24:35.854 --> 01:24:39.297]  They were about to pass a bill to stop Too Big to Fail.
[01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:42.431]  A bunch of other things were happening.
[01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:45.311]  Now the bill to audit the Fed is in trouble in the Senate.
[01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:48.072]  All of that did die that afternoon.
[01:24:48.072 --> 01:24:56.214]  And they've now admitted, this is mainstream news, it was not the fat finger, they said they don't know what did it, when clearly that was a manipulation.
[01:24:56.214 --> 01:25:06.017]  And so we're going to discuss that and from the evidence he has as a former trader and somebody who researches this and as a BBC and Al Jazeera and RT reporter.
[01:25:09.025 --> 01:25:09.747]  Start over, go ahead.
[01:25:09.747 --> 01:25:12.712]  I designed the technology!
[01:25:12.712 --> 01:25:14.456]  Absolutely, so Max, go over this.
[01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:30.482]  In 1996, there are 132 patents that reference my patent, the virtual specialist patent, 5950176, for making markets with an infinite inventory for price parity across virtual securities.
[01:25:30.482 --> 01:25:32.283]  I created this concept.
[01:25:32.283 --> 01:25:38.865]  Now, Goldman Sachs, when they do it, when they commit this fraud, they say they're making a market.
[01:25:38.865 --> 01:25:39.865]  That's the code word for a market.
[01:25:40.265 --> 01:25:40.505]  I'm good.
[01:25:57.459 --> 01:25:58.140]  We're good to go.
[01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:22.286]  The only thing that keeps people from putting this guy in jail is because if they do, they have to face themselves in the mirror and realize that they live in a financial hologram.
[01:26:22.286 --> 01:26:25.187]  There's nothing, there's no basis for it.
[01:26:25.187 --> 01:26:28.829]  It's complete bull!
[01:26:28.829 --> 01:26:29.949]  It was bizarre.
[01:26:29.949 --> 01:26:36.932]  The host of NBC Nightly News came out and said none of the money's real on Letterman last week.
[01:26:36.932 --> 01:26:39.313]  And he basically called it a hologram.
[01:26:39.313 --> 01:26:42.054]  But Max, you've called all this with precision.
[01:26:42.054 --> 01:26:43.155]  That's why I keep pointing that out.
[01:26:44.673 --> 01:26:45.033]  I don't know.
[01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.818]  So now they're going... Hold on, Max.
[01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:24.759]  We're good to go.
[01:27:44.710 --> 01:27:50.131]  Max, I want to go over this point by point and talk about what's happening currently in Europe and the trillion dollars.
[01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:54.772]  It goes from $150 billion to $600 billion to a trillion in the space of three days.
[01:27:54.772 --> 01:27:56.473]  What's behind that?
[01:27:56.473 --> 01:27:58.593]  What these European leaders are going to do?
[01:27:58.593 --> 01:28:01.634]  What the bankers are going to do next to try to keep control of this?
[01:28:01.634 --> 01:28:04.915]  But to quantify what you're saying in layman's terms, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:28:05.535 --> 01:28:35.215]  They're transcending fractional reserve banking of you got one dollar the bank can loan out nine or ten to just absolute derivative universe where they bankrupt the world by design, they create the new global currency, they announce their world government as they're now doing and saying all of you must capitulate and kneel to Zod like Superman kneeling to Zod or we will just destroy everything and have a total depression and we're now held in complete hostage to these people.
[01:28:35.675 --> 01:28:36.456]  Right.
[01:28:36.456 --> 01:28:45.223]  The denominator in a fractional reserve system, as you just described it, is now zero.
[01:28:45.223 --> 01:28:57.794]  So they're God, magic checkbook, they're passing all these taxes in their own documents to bankrupt us even further, and then we give them all the real assets for just made-up baloney.
[01:28:57.794 --> 01:29:03.439]  I mean, this is... and they want to destroy the economy because they're in competition.
[01:29:06.401 --> 01:29:10.503]  And 40 million Americans now, now on food stamps, up from 33 million a month ago.
[01:29:10.503 --> 01:29:11.564]  Those are the new red lines.
[01:29:11.564 --> 01:29:12.444]  Stay there, Max.
[01:29:12.444 --> 01:29:13.525]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:42.939]  It's just so amazing to be living this and to know that the average yuppie still only cares about basketball scores tonight when their whole future is destroyed.
[01:29:42.939 --> 01:29:48.582]  I want to talk about how their next phase, what's happening in Europe, and how you think we beat them.
[01:29:48.582 --> 01:29:50.383]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:29:50.383 --> 01:29:51.764]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.764 --> 01:29:53.165]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.165 --> 01:29:55.686]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.686 --> 01:29:58.368]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:06.891]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.891 --> 01:30:15.752]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.752 --> 01:30:20.393]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.393 --> 01:30:31.215]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.835 --> 01:30:41.364]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.364 --> 01:30:46.789]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.789 --> 01:30:54.275]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.275 --> 01:30:57.038]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.340]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:10.022]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:10.022 --> 01:31:12.523]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.523 --> 01:31:18.385]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.385 --> 01:31:24.627]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:25.047 --> 01:31:31.031]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:31.031 --> 01:31:35.213]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:35.213 --> 01:31:39.496]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.496 --> 01:31:45.439]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.439 --> 01:31:49.001]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:50.983]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.983 --> 01:31:51.403]  It's here.

[01:32:07.853 --> 01:32:12.997]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.997 --> 01:32:19.481]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:27.906]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:32:30.206 --> 01:32:34.788]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:34.788 --> 01:32:38.629]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:39.870]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:42.011]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:42.011 --> 01:32:43.792]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.693]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.693 --> 01:32:53.315]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:53.315 --> 01:32:56.016]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:56.016 --> 01:32:58.377]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[01:32:58.377 --> 01:32:58.878]  Others don't.
[01:33:16.128 --> 01:33:20.790]  This was financial terrorism, a false flag attack just like 2008.
[01:33:23.314 --> 01:33:25.216]  In 2008, they used fear to drive the market down.
[01:33:25.216 --> 01:33:28.077]  This time, they did it digitally, with their hands in there.
[01:33:28.077 --> 01:33:36.203]  I'm going to ask Kaiser, how do we investigate it when all the major federal regulators are openly former JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs?
[01:33:36.203 --> 01:33:39.905]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul, Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse.
[01:33:39.905 --> 01:33:42.887]  Congressman Bernanke broke promises that U.S.
[01:33:42.887 --> 01:33:46.049]  taxpayer dollars would not be sent to European banks.
[01:33:46.049 --> 01:33:48.891]  I want to take calls coming up for Max Kaiser.
[01:33:48.891 --> 01:33:50.572]  Your question specifically for him.
[01:33:51.032 --> 01:33:51.112]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:51.112 --> 01:33:51.212]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:51.212 --> 01:33:55.095]  But they are wrecking the economy by design, waging war against the real economy.
[01:33:55.095 --> 01:33:56.317]  We'll put that headline up there.
[01:33:56.317 --> 01:33:56.857]  40 million people
[01:34:07.426 --> 01:34:16.213]  Now on food stamps, Los Angeles and others announcing they're not going to basically fix roads or sidewalks anymore.
[01:34:16.213 --> 01:34:20.897]  They're announcing all over the country that police are only there to write you tickets, not to respond to crime.
[01:34:20.897 --> 01:34:27.121]  Sheriffs in Texas and Ohio are saying, buy guns, we can't protect you, all we're allowed to do is raise money now.
[01:34:27.121 --> 01:34:33.386]  At least they have some moral compass, at least admitting they're just pirates now.
[01:34:33.386 --> 01:34:35.468]  It is just unbelievable.
[01:34:35.828 --> 01:34:39.570]  Max Keiser is our guest, one of our top financial experts.
[01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:44.413]  Max, I want to go through questions quickly for you now here.
[01:34:44.413 --> 01:34:49.396]  Specifically, who are the culprits of the financial terrorism?
[01:34:49.396 --> 01:34:54.539]  A. B. Let's then look at what's happening in Europe and how that's tied to this.
[01:34:54.539 --> 01:34:59.342]  And now they're admitting, even in the Associated Press, the Euro may collapse.
[01:34:59.342 --> 01:35:02.864]  But the bankers aren't going to let that happen because that's their looting mechanism.
[01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:03.204]  Go ahead.
[01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:20.713]  Well, clearly in the area of financial terrorism and market manipulation, high frequency trading and program trading, one name stands above the rest.
[01:35:21.992 --> 01:35:38.838]  You know, I mean, Goldman Sachs, they've already been nabbed with the software that they said, yes, you can use it to manipulate markets, and they said it's a proprietary piece of software and they don't want it out in the public domain when one of their defectors was caught crossing the border, I think it was into Canada.
[01:35:39.418 --> 01:35:53.988]  They also openly discuss that they have a server that they've installed next to the New York Stock Exchange down there on Wall Street, which siphons off up to $100 million a day in cash by front-running, which is another aspect of the high-frequency trading financial terrorism.
[01:35:53.988 --> 01:36:04.816]  They, in the last quarter, they just reported, Goldman Sachs reported that their primary business of trading, they did not experience a single day
[01:36:05.698 --> 01:36:07.300]  We're good to go.
[01:36:22.914 --> 01:36:28.343]  That is quite obviously not a normal situation, and that's quite obviously market manipulation.
[01:36:28.343 --> 01:36:32.149]  Now, who's supposed to be looking at this type of stuff?
[01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:34.873]  Well, you've got Moody's, one of the rating agencies.
[01:36:34.873 --> 01:36:35.694]  Well, guess what?
[01:36:35.694 --> 01:36:37.678]  The SEC just sent them a Wells notice.
[01:36:38.338 --> 01:36:40.460]  Telling them that they're under investigation.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.781]  Oh, and guess what?
[01:36:41.781 --> 01:36:50.086]  The day that they got the Wells Notice that they're now under investigation, Warren Buffett and the CEO of Moody's sold out of their stock!
[01:36:50.086 --> 01:36:55.450]  Oh, I guess those guys are also insider traders and market manipulators and financial terrorists.
[01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:57.571]  Yeah, let's put them on the cover of Time Magazine!
[01:36:57.571 --> 01:36:59.733]  They're certainly heroes in the American economy.
[01:36:59.733 --> 01:37:02.474]  They're driving the entire economy into the ditch!
[01:37:02.474 --> 01:37:02.935]  Okay?
[01:37:02.935 --> 01:37:03.735]  So who else?
[01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:04.876]  The CFTC?
[01:37:04.876 --> 01:37:07.798]  They just got compelling evidence that there's a rampant
[01:37:08.018 --> 01:37:08.398]  We're good to go.
[01:37:30.905 --> 01:37:46.393]  Every single piece of the global economy is being rigged by the same group of five or six guys who are tied into Geithner and Bernanke and Bob Rubin and the same group of folks that we've been talking about, you've been talking about for the last, you know, ten years.
[01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:47.714]  It's just gotten worse.
[01:37:47.714 --> 01:37:48.615]  It's gotten more brazen.
[01:37:48.615 --> 01:37:50.836]  It's gotten more... They know that there's no...
[01:37:51.856 --> 01:38:07.987]  Recourse, so they are openly just basically, you know, Warren Buffett was engaged in an actual pump and dump scheme, something you would expect on a penny stock scammer, where he was actually pumping Moody's, saying, oh, it's a great stock, while he was simultaneously selling it.
[01:38:08.787 --> 01:38:13.308]  Which is illegal, which is what Goldman Sachs is in trouble for on Timberwolf.
[01:38:13.308 --> 01:38:14.969]  But let me just stop you there.
[01:38:14.969 --> 01:38:17.730]  Because rarely am I at a loss for words.
[01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:21.011]  I could hardly talk, Max, during the first hour.
[01:38:21.011 --> 01:38:24.892]  I'm having trouble forming words right now.
[01:38:24.892 --> 01:38:28.853]  And the reason I'm making this statement is this fraud is so
[01:38:29.953 --> 01:38:52.749]  Off-the-charge gargantuan that I can't even wrap my mind around how bold these people are and it scares me at a fundamental level to know that they could set off nukes and blame it on people to launch new wars, they could release bioweapons, they could stage terror attacks and blame it on Patriot groups, which they're clearly conditioning the public for, that they're not going away.
[01:38:52.749 --> 01:38:54.189]  They're not going to stop.
[01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:57.412]  This is a hot revolution by the private banking cartels.
[01:38:57.952 --> 01:39:05.658]  That only have the quote open stock market as a way to swindle people and to feed their operation.
[01:39:05.658 --> 01:39:15.545]  They're imploding Europe now and now all the experts I talked to aren't saying a year or two till we go into full total collapse, but maybe even sooner.
[01:39:15.545 --> 01:39:18.287]  So let's now, we've talked about what's going on over here.
[01:39:19.088 --> 01:39:26.090]  And then simultaneously, with no debate, no news coverage really, they just say, yeah, it's not $150 billion, it's a trillion.
[01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:28.130]  Now they're saying it may be $2 trillion.
[01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:33.312]  They're saying, just like here in our Congress, they won't tell these governments where the money's going.
[01:39:33.312 --> 01:39:37.813]  It's just, we wake up, private central banks of the G20 run everything, and they say,
[01:39:38.433 --> 01:39:40.114]  We're taking your pension funds.
[01:39:40.114 --> 01:39:41.535]  We're taking everything.
[01:39:41.535 --> 01:39:44.276]  And the SWAT teams are standing by if you don't like it.
[01:39:44.276 --> 01:39:50.640]  And you've got a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay types that are hundreds of times worse.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.361]  They own the intelligence agencies.
[01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:53.382]  They run everything.
[01:39:54.434 --> 01:39:56.315]  Let me simplify, because I'm just ranting here.
[01:39:56.315 --> 01:39:59.055]  I mean, I'm trying to even get my mind around this.
[01:39:59.055 --> 01:40:00.116]  What's happening in Europe?
[01:40:00.116 --> 01:40:01.296]  How does it tie into this?
[01:40:01.296 --> 01:40:02.377]  And what's their game plan?
[01:40:02.377 --> 01:40:04.157]  What do you see happening, Max Keiser?
[01:40:04.157 --> 01:40:15.281]  Okay, well, in Europe, they have just gone through the credit collapse that America experienced in 2008, and have finally caught up to the European banking system.
[01:40:15.281 --> 01:40:18.242]  And similarly to what we saw in the United States,
[01:40:20.032 --> 01:40:27.180]  Banking system got overextended in the sole derivatives market, which is just a fancy way to say debt.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:34.047]  And the European banks got way in over their head with hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars worth of debt.
[01:40:34.047 --> 01:40:34.968]  Now, here's the funny bit.
[01:40:36.042 --> 01:40:42.965]  All of this derivatives, all this debt in Europe is priced or manufactured in dollars.
[01:40:42.965 --> 01:40:54.791]  So in order to extricate the banks, in order for them to unwind themselves, to get out of the corner that they've painted themselves into, the United States just sent Europe a trillion US dollars in exchange for some Euros.
[01:40:55.751 --> 01:41:01.013]  Because that's the only way they can unwind their problems because they're all priced in dollars.
[01:41:01.013 --> 01:41:07.456]  So they needed a trillion dollars just so they could unwrap themselves from all this bad debt that they put themselves in.
[01:41:07.456 --> 01:41:10.177]  And in doing so, America just gave them a trillion dollars.
[01:41:10.177 --> 01:41:11.538]  No congressional review?
[01:41:12.718 --> 01:41:15.360]  No conversation, no debate.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:31.272]  They just signed a check for a trillion dollars in exchange for some euros, which of course is just another fiat currency, which is manufactured by another European central bank, another central bank, which just loans money into existence out of thin air with no, as the German Chancellor said, we just lend money with no collateral whatsoever.
[01:41:31.272 --> 01:41:41.780]  So they just did basically a swap of a trillion in worthless dollars for a trillion or less in euros, just so that the banks could on paper say that they were unwinding
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.640]  We're good to go.
[01:42:02.472 --> 01:42:12.595]  Some big problems, and gold keeps hitting new highs against the euro, against the pound, every single major currency in the world except for the dollar, which it'll hit a new high again shortly.
[01:42:12.595 --> 01:42:16.477]  But the gold vigilantes are saying, oh, wait a minute, buddy.
[01:42:16.477 --> 01:42:26.060]  You know, you just can't put trillions of dollars in thin air to help your banker buddies without at some point totally debasing that currency, and this is what's driving gold.
[01:42:27.349 --> 01:42:51.323]  But Mac, specifically, this is by design, I remember reading Trilateral Commission documents from the 70s, how they plan to create three global currencies, a Euro, a dollarized North American Union, an Asian Unified Currency, then currency wars between those, and then the answer to the crisis they had created will be this global cashless society
[01:42:51.863 --> 01:42:52.824]  Well, I think they're moving
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.621]  We're good.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.420]  Very simple.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.081]  You're going to see a global tax.
[01:43:39.081 --> 01:43:39.821]  A world tax.
[01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:42.802]  You're going to have to pay a tax to the U.S.
[01:43:42.802 --> 01:43:48.024]  and the Global Central Bank and your local municipality and your state.
[01:43:48.024 --> 01:43:52.005]  So you're going to pay local, state, federal, and world tax.
[01:44:07.165 --> 01:44:17.828]  And they've all announced this, that was going to be their carbon tax and this global VAT they're calling the fat tax, but I go back to the rest of my question.
[01:44:17.828 --> 01:44:22.970]  If it's so politically unpopular to take people's pension funds,
[01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:35.178]  And to put taxes on their cars and their food and everything else to give it to criminal bankers who made all this debt up out of nothing and Merkel almost lost control of her parliament.
[01:44:35.178 --> 01:44:42.222]  Sarkozy a few months ago dumped the carbon tax because he almost lost control in the French government.
[01:44:42.222 --> 01:44:45.844]  All these, I mean everywhere, Gordon Brown just had to step down.
[01:44:45.844 --> 01:44:48.346]  This is political suicide.
[01:44:48.346 --> 01:44:51.168]  So what are the bankers going to do to get this through?
[01:44:52.278 --> 01:44:57.900]  We're going to use more financial terrorism like we saw on Thursday.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:10.703]  And so they keep saying give us whatever we want or there'll be a depression as they walk us in to a austerity depression that's meant to be a financial poverty straitjacket.
[01:45:10.703 --> 01:45:14.884]  Alex, last Thursday the stock in Accenture went from $48 to a penny in 15 minutes.
[01:45:17.975 --> 01:45:19.957]  So they can just do whatever they want.
[01:45:19.957 --> 01:45:22.819]  Why are the bankers a thousand times more criminal than they've ever been?
[01:45:22.819 --> 01:45:23.880]  I mean, I've never...
[01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:42.011]  Small hazard has become the de facto business model of America and the world.
[01:45:42.011 --> 01:45:46.872]  There's no safeguard, there's no pushback, there's no regulation, there's nobody stopping them.
[01:45:46.872 --> 01:45:51.133]  It's a cancer, it's out of control, there's nothing stopping it!
[01:45:51.133 --> 01:45:55.254]  Ron Paul and others are saying the euro will now die within the next year.
[01:45:55.254 --> 01:45:57.094]  Do you agree with that?
[01:45:57.094 --> 01:45:58.715]  All fiat currencies are going to die.
[01:45:58.715 --> 01:46:02.276]  The only question is in what order?
[01:46:02.276 --> 01:46:03.356]  What will be the last standing?
[01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:03.736]  The dollar?
[01:46:06.718 --> 01:46:14.765]  Well, I could give you my speculation about that, but it's pointless.
[01:46:14.765 --> 01:46:26.616]  I just have to break through, even trying to figure out how many angels are going to end up on the head of that worthless pin and just buy gold.
[01:46:26.616 --> 01:46:28.498]  Well, I just can't believe it's come to this.
[01:46:28.498 --> 01:46:30.900]  I mean, these guys have really got a lot of chutzpah, don't they?
[01:46:32.679 --> 01:46:37.902]  Well, it's, um, it's, it's, it's, you know, economics is a social science.
[01:46:37.902 --> 01:46:39.023]  It's not a natural science.
[01:46:39.023 --> 01:46:41.484]  People like to think it's like physics, it's like chemistry.
[01:46:41.484 --> 01:46:42.105]  It's not.
[01:46:42.105 --> 01:46:43.526]  It's psychological.
[01:46:43.526 --> 01:46:50.890]  And we know from psychological experiments, when you give people the option to terrorize other people, they become terrorists.
[01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:57.394]  And you see this time and time again with experimentations where you give people petty authority to run a jail.
[01:46:57.394 --> 01:47:00.556]  This was done on campuses several times, you know, the famous experiment.
[01:47:00.996 --> 01:47:05.698]  And within a very short period of time, the worst elements of people rise to the surface.
[01:47:05.698 --> 01:47:08.099]  We saw it in the Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:47:08.099 --> 01:47:18.083]  You give some prison guards a little authority, and within a few weeks, they become these psychotic, torturing, sadomasochistic sexual deviants.
[01:47:18.083 --> 01:47:22.685]  And this is the nature of what we find if you don't have some kind of civilized
[01:47:23.993 --> 01:47:43.757]  And that's what our founding... And you give bankers on Wall Street, who are suicide bankers, who already have a God complex, like Lloyd Blankfein saying he thinks he's God, you give him unlimited credit with no interest costs whatsoever, and you tell him that everything he does is perfect, and you end up, that's a recipe for creating financial terrorism.
[01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.317]  Megalomania.
[01:47:44.317 --> 01:47:45.598]  That's exactly what we're talking about.
[01:47:48.772 --> 01:47:57.899]  Clearly, though, because it's a global system, they can loot one country or one region at a time while they're off in their armored fortresses.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:47:59.601]  You can tell who the real government is.
[01:47:59.601 --> 01:48:04.304]  When a president or somebody comes to town, there's a small detachment of security, comparatively a few hundred.
[01:48:04.304 --> 01:48:07.267]  When the G20 comes, it's the army.
[01:48:07.267 --> 01:48:08.728]  It's 25,000 police.
[01:48:08.728 --> 01:48:10.810]  It's no free speech in the city.
[01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:14.352]  It's police dogs attacking old women coming out of grocery stores.
[01:48:14.352 --> 01:48:16.134]  It's, we're God, we're gonna...
[01:48:16.494 --> 01:48:24.257]  What did you think of the IMF head in the Washington Post saying, the good times are over, and laughing at people, and saying, we're gonna screw you.
[01:48:24.257 --> 01:48:35.261]  I mean, they, they are just such arrogant creatures, and they really think they're gonna get away with it, because they don't care if Greece burns, they don't care if Germany burns, they don't even care if the US burns.
[01:48:35.261 --> 01:48:37.241]  They will use that as a way to consolidate things.
[01:48:37.241 --> 01:48:40.862]  We have that in the IMF documents, how they create the IMF riots.
[01:48:40.862 --> 01:48:42.523]  So how do you beat them?
[01:48:42.523 --> 01:48:45.004]  How do you beat a group of criminals that have
[01:48:45.604 --> 01:48:54.208]  Millions and millions of paramilitary police working for him that can't even balance their checkbook and bow down to anybody with a bald head in a suit.
[01:48:54.208 --> 01:49:05.194]  Well, I know how you can beat them, but I'm interested to hear you try to convince me that my way to beat them is unworkable, because I think it is workable.
[01:49:05.194 --> 01:49:10.716]  Okay, we try to shoot down Coca-Cola legally by going after its stock.
[01:49:10.716 --> 01:49:13.978]  They just breathe more fiat billions into it.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.182]  But here's the thing.
[01:49:16.182 --> 01:49:25.938]  If, in fact, Coca-Cola, which is a, um, I believe now it's roughly $50 or $60 billion, or maybe a higher billion dollar company, it's biggest shareholder is Warren Buffett.
[01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:28.907]  And, um, it's clearly an icon.
[01:49:28.907 --> 01:49:29.528]  It's global.
[01:49:29.528 --> 01:49:32.928]  It's a global currency, like the yen, the dollar, gold.
[01:49:32.928 --> 01:49:34.349]  Coca-Cola is sold everywhere.
[01:49:34.349 --> 01:49:36.549]  Somali pirates deal in Coca-Cola.
[01:49:36.549 --> 01:49:38.509]  Coca-Cola is the only currency in Somalia.
[01:49:38.509 --> 01:49:39.069]  Did you know that?
[01:49:39.069 --> 01:49:47.431]  That the tankers off the Somali coast that have Coke syrup, their major distribution point in Africa, that's the central bank of Somalia, is Coke syrup.
[01:49:47.431 --> 01:49:49.172]  And it's the world's cheapest.
[01:49:49.172 --> 01:49:50.852]  It's the poor man's gold.
[01:49:50.852 --> 01:49:55.713]  Now, if you can boycott Coca-Cola products to the point where that stock goes to zero,
[01:49:56.993 --> 01:49:59.615]  Believe me, you're going to get people's attention.
[01:49:59.615 --> 01:50:03.798]  People are going to be frightened of you instead of you having to be frightened of them.
[01:50:03.798 --> 01:50:11.703]  Because it shows them that the power has shifted from the way that they do business... So it's like Washington winning at Trenton.
[01:50:11.703 --> 01:50:14.085]  It was a minor battle, but it showed we could win.
[01:50:15.336 --> 01:50:18.417]  First of all, yeah, okay, I'll go with that, but it's not a minor battle.
[01:50:18.417 --> 01:50:19.957]  It's pretty significant.
[01:50:19.957 --> 01:50:22.297]  It's a Dow Jones stock.
[01:50:22.297 --> 01:50:23.558]  It's an icon.
[01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:25.238]  It's owned by Warren Buffett.
[01:50:25.238 --> 01:50:25.978]  It's easy to do.
[01:50:25.978 --> 01:50:29.859]  It's like Gandhi's march to the sea to make salt.
[01:50:29.859 --> 01:50:31.039]  It's a boycott.
[01:50:31.039 --> 01:50:32.300]  It's easy to do.
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:34.160]  It's a no-cost weapon of choice.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.660]  And you can tell every single day if you're winning or not.
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:37.921]  Just look at the price of Coke.
[01:50:37.921 --> 01:50:39.661]  If it's going down, you're winning.
[01:50:39.661 --> 01:50:41.201]  If it's going up, you're losing.
[01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.882]  If you take down Coke to zero, then you can move on.
[01:50:43.942 --> 01:50:44.242]  Stay there.
[01:50:44.242 --> 01:50:44.602]  Gotta break.
[01:50:44.602 --> 01:50:44.882]  Stay there.
[01:51:02.165 --> 01:51:03.466]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.466 --> 01:51:09.050]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:14.074]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:14.074 --> 01:51:19.658]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[01:54:12.335 --> 01:54:14.797]  Look, it's like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay.
[01:54:14.797 --> 01:54:16.037]  They've all committed crimes.
[01:54:16.037 --> 01:54:17.178]  Just arrest them.
[01:54:17.178 --> 01:54:19.800]  We've got to extricate ourselves out of this.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:28.086]  And if the public was as informed about fractional reserve banking and derivatives as they were about basketball or football, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[01:54:28.086 --> 01:54:29.767]  Now, we're just talking to Max Keiser.
[01:54:29.767 --> 01:54:32.769]  He says it's all going to implode when they steal everything.
[01:54:32.769 --> 01:54:34.630]  And, you know, there's a method to their madness, though.
[01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:41.795]  They plan to replace that with an eco-fascism, neo-feudalistic system, Max Keiser.
[01:54:42.728 --> 01:54:44.128]  Yeah.
[01:54:44.128 --> 01:54:45.509]  Is that a question?
[01:54:45.509 --> 01:54:49.570]  It's a statement, but yeah, you can comment on it.
[01:54:49.570 --> 01:54:57.632]  Well, you know, as I, on the break, I pointed your attention to an article that was written a few years ago when I launched this Coca-Cola boycott.
[01:54:57.632 --> 01:55:05.914]  Because what happens is, if enough people start boycotting Coke, you draw the attention of these hedge funds, who then start selling short Coke.
[01:55:06.594 --> 01:55:10.657]  On behalf of the boycott, because remember, they don't care who they're working for.
[01:55:10.657 --> 01:55:12.178]  They just want to make a quick buck.
[01:55:12.178 --> 01:55:19.164]  If you can leverage the hedge fund community to do the work of you, the humble boycotter, you've turbocharged your boycott.
[01:55:19.164 --> 01:55:35.576]  So instead of now having a few hundred thousand people boycotting Coke, and it might have the impact of subtracting $20 or $30 million from their market capitalization, you're now attracting the hedge funds who are going to subtract $10 or $20 billion from their market capitalization.
[01:55:35.917 --> 01:55:40.192]  And the hedge funds will keep shorting as long as you keep building your boycott.
[01:55:44.158 --> 01:55:44.699]  Snowballs!
[01:56:09.002 --> 01:56:11.384]  I agree with you, and I think that's a good plan.
[01:56:11.384 --> 01:56:14.307]  I also think Grand Jury should start indicting these people.
[01:56:14.307 --> 01:56:17.109]  Barney Madoff founded the Nasdaq, but he wasn't invincible.
[01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:24.956]  We can bring these criminals down by also exposing their criminality and their financial terrorism, which you've done a good job of doing, Max.
[01:56:24.956 --> 01:56:26.938]  Jeff in Missouri, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:56:26.938 --> 01:56:28.059]  Go ahead.
[01:56:28.059 --> 01:56:29.300]  Good day, gentlemen.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:31.222]  I've got two questions.
[01:56:31.222 --> 01:56:34.325]  First of all, Mr. Keiser, can you explain how
[01:56:34.969 --> 01:56:39.790]  These SDRs are going to replace the dollar.
[01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:41.671]  I know I'm a little bit familiar about SDRs.
[01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:45.312]  They've been around for a while, but exactly what are they?
[01:56:45.312 --> 01:56:52.434]  And also, my second question is, is there any way you can get an article printed up that we can hand out to other people?
[01:56:53.121 --> 01:57:01.784]  On a step-by-step, what happened last week, last Thursday... I've got Paul Watson writing an article right now about what Max said earlier in the hour.
[01:57:01.784 --> 01:57:03.304]  You can also go to MaxKaiser.com.
[01:57:03.304 --> 01:57:06.085]  He's got info on it there, but answer that first question, Max.
[01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:09.706]  Right, so an FDR is, you know, another fiat currency.
[01:57:09.706 --> 01:57:12.367]  It doesn't take anything to create a fiat currency.
[01:57:12.367 --> 01:57:18.729]  You simply say, here is a basket, a unit, a measurement, an accounting unit.
[01:57:18.729 --> 01:57:22.650]  It's going to be based on a basket of other stocks.
[01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:52.176]  Other currencies, and we're going to call it an SDR, Special Drawing Right, and we're going to recalibrate how the other currencies are weighted in this new basket, this new SDR, and as the global economy starts to, you know, continues to break apart, we'll say, well, because China's actually exporting a lot of stuff and they've got some resources, we'll give them a higher ratio as representation of this SDR because that'll keep them
[01:57:52.717 --> 01:58:05.778]  It's the bankers transcending the nation states they've sucked dry and creating a new 0% fractional reserve banking digital money that will then absorb what's left of sovereignty.
[01:58:06.837 --> 01:58:08.558]  One exists already right now.
[01:58:08.558 --> 01:58:10.340]  It's called a credit default swap.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:22.288]  A credit default swap is a global unit of fraud that banks all over the world swap with each other and they create this back-end unit of currency that they conduct all measure of multi-billion dollar fraud.
[01:58:22.288 --> 01:58:23.469]  And they use it as a weapon.
[01:58:23.469 --> 01:58:25.791]  It's designed to be corrosive.
[01:58:25.791 --> 01:58:26.852]  They want to wreck things.
[01:58:27.592 --> 01:58:29.193]  Well, it's dilutive.
[01:58:29.193 --> 01:58:37.135]  I mean, that's the key to it, is that it dilutes the existing equity that you would associate with a unit of currency.
[01:58:37.135 --> 01:58:38.255]  Max, back in one minute.
[01:58:38.255 --> 01:58:38.896]  Gotta break.
[01:58:38.896 --> 01:58:44.957]  Man, I could talk for ten hours with Max Geiser.

[01:59:36.296 --> 01:59:36.976]  Look for Max.
[01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:39.138]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:39.538]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.541 --> 02:00:09.322]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.322 --> 02:00:11.063]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.063 --> 02:00:12.664]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.664 --> 02:00:14.204]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.204 --> 02:00:18.386]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.386 --> 02:00:23.929]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.929 --> 02:00:28.491]  It's one thing to intellectually know what the new world order is.
[02:00:28.491 --> 02:00:31.493]  A global government for the administrative convenience for central bankers.
[02:00:31.493 --> 02:00:32.993]  David Rockefeller, 1991, heavy in France.
[02:00:35.037 --> 02:00:49.088]  It is another thing to see it in full practice, and to have laptops watching kids at home in their bedrooms, and FEMA camps being built, and banks stealing trillions, and now it's not even news, it's just, oh, you're mad at 150 billion?
[02:00:49.088 --> 02:00:49.909]  It's a trillion now!
[02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:58.212]  Max Keiser has agreed to stay with us about five minutes into the next segment, then George Humphrey will join us midstream, also an economist in his own right, to get his expert take on this.
[02:00:58.212 --> 02:01:12.618]  I'm holding Max over so we can at least talk to John and Charles, Jacob, Josh, and maybe Mike, but I just want to say I've done two hours of radio now, and having really plugged my films, that's how we finance ourselves here.
[02:01:12.618 --> 02:01:13.918]  We can't just make money out of nothing.
[02:01:13.918 --> 02:01:17.600]  We've got to crawl around with little crumbs and try to fund our operation to beat these people.
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:39.901]  But if you'll go to Infowars.com, the online video bookstore, and buy some of the t-shirts, videos, books, materials, they're the best films, best books, you know, not just my work, but the stuff I see that I think is really informative, we carry it at Infowars.com, whether it's Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, such key intelligence, Invisible Empire, In Order to Find, Endgame, Shadow Government.
[02:01:39.901 --> 02:01:43.124]  You can also now pre-order it, start shipping out at the end of next week.
[02:01:44.557 --> 02:01:55.860]  You can also now pre-order the new film, Don't Tread on Me, which gets into states' rights and how to take the states back, and Democracy vs. Republic.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.061]  It's such an important film by the makers of Camp FEMA, Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[02:02:00.061 --> 02:02:03.481]  Okay, let's go right back to calls for Max Keiser.
[02:02:03.481 --> 02:02:04.802]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[02:02:04.802 --> 02:02:05.542]  John, you're on the air.
[02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:18.631]  Yeah, I wanted to call you just before the end of the program when you got cut off last week and then you said call the next day and then there were no calls, so I'm going to try to relate this to what you're talking about now.
[02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:27.819]  I'd need probably a hundred times more articulateness and a thousand hours to describe all the ways that I disagree with part of your analysis.
[02:02:27.819 --> 02:02:33.364]  I think you're progressive in certain ways and absolutely fascist in other points.
[02:02:33.872 --> 02:02:35.072]  I'll tell you, I'll ask you a question.
[02:02:35.072 --> 02:02:40.514]  Now you said that the IMF and the World Bank are really the villains that are really plundering and raping the world.
[02:02:54.961 --> 02:03:08.546]  And yet, you say that countries like Chavez and Cuba, who are trying their best, imperfectly, to resist this kind of plunder, are subjected to the worst kind of slander by the media.
[02:03:08.546 --> 02:03:15.589]  And you say you don't agree with the corporate media, the CIA-connected media, yet you repeat exactly those kinds of disinformation.
[02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:16.589]  John, I appreciate your call.
[02:03:19.446 --> 02:03:23.309]  Iran is run by thugs at many levels.
[02:03:23.309 --> 02:03:25.031]  So is our government.
[02:03:25.031 --> 02:03:28.593]  It isn't either Chavez is good or Obama's good.
[02:03:28.593 --> 02:03:29.394]  They're both bad.
[02:03:29.394 --> 02:03:34.538]  I mean, it's such a child... I'm not saying you're like a child, but that is... Max Keiser, it's so childlike.
[02:03:34.538 --> 02:03:36.460]  I mean, do you have any comments?
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:45.747]  All I can say is that, you know, I wish times were better because I could give up my gig as Max the Orange Home Gang Gorilla.
[02:03:45.747 --> 02:03:46.488]  Oh my God.
[02:03:49.946 --> 02:03:52.391]  Kaiser, you've always got some ridiculous joke.
[02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:58.702]  Yeah, well, it just occurred to me every time we break to a commercial, he's talking about Max the Orange Gorilla.
[02:03:58.702 --> 02:04:02.149]  And I'm thinking to myself, Jesus, that guy's probably making better money than I am.
[02:04:04.009 --> 02:04:11.272]  Alright, Max, we're going to come back to the final segment and go to Charles, Jacob, and Josh and Mike with serious questions for Max Keiser.
[02:04:11.272 --> 02:04:12.952]  But we do have to have some gallows humor.
[02:04:12.952 --> 02:04:22.375]  But seriously, what is this mindset where people think, I've got to be, how can I be against white supremacists and against black supremacists?
[02:04:22.375 --> 02:04:24.956]  Well, I'm against all these racists.
[02:04:24.956 --> 02:04:28.817]  Or, how can I be against communism, but then I'm against the big banks?
[02:04:28.817 --> 02:04:32.979]  I'm against any form of tyranny, and tyranny has a lot of different flavors, doesn't it, Max?
[02:04:34.204 --> 02:04:43.156]  Well, that's a problem you have, because you are very far-ranging in your look and criticism of things.
[02:04:43.156 --> 02:04:49.205]  I focus purely on the banks, markets, and finance, and through that prism, I see things clearly.
[02:04:50.248 --> 02:04:50.848]  If you know what I mean.
[02:04:50.848 --> 02:04:54.530]  I'm not trying to evade the answer, I'm just saying that... No, no, I agree with you!
[02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:57.871]  I mean, the big threat is not Hugo Chavez, it's Goldman Sachs.
[02:04:57.871 --> 02:05:01.252]  But it doesn't mean I have to bow down to Hugo Chavez.
[02:05:01.252 --> 02:05:09.255]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[02:05:09.255 --> 02:05:16.257]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[02:05:16.597 --> 02:05:23.559]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[02:05:23.559 --> 02:05:24.799]  Listen carefully.
[02:05:24.799 --> 02:05:34.521]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[02:05:34.521 --> 02:05:38.742]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[02:05:38.742 --> 02:05:41.743]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[02:05:41.743 --> 02:05:45.024]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex
[02:05:45.524 --> 02:05:46.025]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:46.025 --> 02:05:48.148]  That's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex 800-409-5633.
[02:05:48.148 --> 02:05:51.253]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex 800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.984 --> 02:06:02.304]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.304 --> 02:06:07.886]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:07.886 --> 02:06:12.908]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:12.908 --> 02:06:17.930]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:23.694]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:06:23.694 --> 02:06:26.015]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:06:26.015 --> 02:06:30.818]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:06:30.818 --> 02:06:31.939]  And here's the best part.
[02:06:31.939 --> 02:06:35.001]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:06:35.001 --> 02:06:38.624]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:06:48.590 --> 02:06:52.834]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:06:52.834 --> 02:06:57.658]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:57.658 --> 02:07:00.061]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:00.757 --> 02:07:03.078]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:07:03.078 --> 02:07:05.460]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.661]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:13.784]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:13.784 --> 02:07:18.307]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:18.307 --> 02:07:20.648]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:20.648 --> 02:07:23.189]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:26.031]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:26.431 --> 02:07:34.055]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:34.372 --> 02:07:39.777]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:39.777 --> 02:07:42.619]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:42.619 --> 02:07:46.302]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:46.302 --> 02:07:47.383]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:47.383 --> 02:07:48.724]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:48.724 --> 02:07:50.226]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:04.048 --> 02:08:10.670]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:10.670 --> 02:08:14.211]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.211 --> 02:08:16.171]  We are going into financial bondage.
[02:08:16.171 --> 02:08:18.752]  We are under financial siege.
[02:08:18.752 --> 02:08:23.313]  A trillion dollars pumped into private banks, Europe being told they've got to give up their pension funds.
[02:08:24.333 --> 02:08:26.975]  The Germans on the verge of throwing out Merkel.
[02:08:26.975 --> 02:08:29.997]  She lost many seats in their government.
[02:08:29.997 --> 02:08:30.537]  Same thing.
[02:08:30.537 --> 02:08:32.098]  Gordon Brown steps down.
[02:08:32.098 --> 02:08:35.420]  Nicolas Sarkozy in trouble, saying no to the carbon tax.
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:44.906]  So we're having some victories against the bankers setting up their global tax, but they're going to hold us in financial hostages until we go along with it and continue to play games.
[02:08:44.906 --> 02:08:49.929]  As the real economy dies, they continue to have everyone addicted to their stock market.
[02:08:49.929 --> 02:08:52.891]  Is that a good assessment, Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com?
[02:08:53.371 --> 02:09:08.722]  Well, all the professionals who work in the gaming industry, and we talked about this last time, and the online gaming industry are migrating into the finance business so that all of the techniques that get people hooked on games
[02:09:09.677 --> 02:09:12.819]  ...are being used to get people hooked on doing day trading.
[02:09:12.819 --> 02:09:30.828]  So, as I explained earlier in the show, when you see a Goldman Sachs or somebody like that pushing prices up 2 or 3 percent, the folks that are on the day trading, you know, addiction, kick in, and they are doing the dirty work for them.
[02:09:30.828 --> 02:09:36.191]  So they've basically created an army of what I call Manchurian candidates.
[02:09:36.191 --> 02:09:38.312]  These people, they just, when they hear the trigger word,
[02:09:38.812 --> 02:09:39.033]  We're good.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.601]  And it's like that with terrorism.
[02:09:48.601 --> 02:09:51.101]  It's like that with the phony environmental movement.
[02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:55.082]  It's all these mind-controlled zombie groups that give the globalists power.
[02:09:55.082 --> 02:09:56.743]  But look at the controllers.
[02:09:56.743 --> 02:10:01.084]  They can't even plug this oil leak that's now millions and millions of gallons.
[02:10:01.084 --> 02:10:03.464]  They lied about that and said it was a few thousand gallons.
[02:10:03.464 --> 02:10:04.344]  They're not God.
[02:10:04.344 --> 02:10:09.206]  And that's what's even more dangerous is that I think they're going to lose control.
[02:10:09.206 --> 02:10:11.106]  I believe they're starting to lose control.
[02:10:11.106 --> 02:10:13.847]  Webster Tarpley, who I really respect, believes that as well.
[02:10:13.847 --> 02:10:15.127]  I mean, do you see them losing control?
[02:10:16.101 --> 02:10:22.185]  Wait a minute, the payout from the insurance company is way more than the money they're losing on that oil spill, Alex.
[02:10:22.185 --> 02:10:28.550]  The insurance is overwritten, just like these companies in America buy life insurance on employees.
[02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:33.313]  So when employees die, the life insurance company gets the money, not the family.
[02:10:33.313 --> 02:10:37.456]  No, that's what Walmart greeters are for, is they do actuaries that's come out.
[02:10:37.456 --> 02:10:43.440]  They know when they're going to die statistically, so they just hire a bunch of old people to stand there because they're putting three mil on each one of them.
[02:10:43.848 --> 02:10:44.228]  I don't know.
[02:11:02.782 --> 02:11:06.123]  Risk is socialized, profit privatized.
[02:11:06.123 --> 02:11:13.785]  We're going to take a few quick questions because we've got George Humphrey here in studio and Max Keiser has to go here in just a moment.
[02:11:13.785 --> 02:11:16.986]  But Charles in Louisiana, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:11:16.986 --> 02:11:17.326]  Go ahead.
[02:11:17.326 --> 02:11:19.066]  How are you doing, sir?
[02:11:19.066 --> 02:11:22.627]  Yeah, I'm down here in Louisiana watching all this.
[02:11:22.627 --> 02:11:26.468]  They said in 72 hours they might be going to try something else.
[02:11:26.468 --> 02:11:28.148]  But they really haven't.
[02:11:28.148 --> 02:11:30.929]  It's another Katrina, and they laid back on it.
[02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:38.179]  What they want to do now is take human hair and animal hair and suck it up off the pieces to make mats out of it.
[02:11:38.179 --> 02:11:43.680]  But I think what's going to... the Bayou Boys, it's going to tear them up.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.201]  It's going to finish the Bayou Boys.
[02:11:45.201 --> 02:11:46.721]  All the boats are docked right now.
[02:11:46.721 --> 02:11:51.462]  They can't buy no seafood.
[02:11:51.462 --> 02:11:52.803]  It's right now in Venice.
[02:11:52.803 --> 02:11:55.063]  It's ten miles off the shore, real heavy.
[02:11:55.063 --> 02:11:57.024]  And they hit the shore in Alabama now.
[02:11:58.237 --> 02:12:03.401]  When it hits here, it's just going to wipe Louisiana out.
[02:12:03.401 --> 02:12:05.002]  And I think all the southern states.
[02:12:05.002 --> 02:12:07.464]  Well, they continue to underestimate the amount.
[02:12:07.464 --> 02:12:09.986]  First, it was a few thousand gallons a day.
[02:12:09.986 --> 02:12:14.329]  But experts looked at the satellite photos and said it had to be hundreds of thousands a day.
[02:12:14.329 --> 02:12:16.991]  It's now 3.5 million gallons.
[02:12:16.991 --> 02:12:17.371]  Who knows?
[02:12:17.371 --> 02:12:19.312]  It could be 20 million gallons.
[02:12:19.312 --> 02:12:21.113]  I mean, they're such liars, Max Keiser.
[02:12:21.113 --> 02:12:22.134]  Who knows?
[02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:23.255]  Well, it sounds medieval.
[02:12:23.255 --> 02:12:25.256]  They're making mats out of people's hair.
[02:12:25.256 --> 02:12:25.637]  What's next?
[02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:25.857]  Leeches?
[02:12:27.659 --> 02:12:28.940]  Yeah, I don't know what this is.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:34.683]  I heard it on news radio driving in this morning, and the host was saying, what are mats of hair going to do?
[02:12:34.683 --> 02:12:37.645]  In fact, guys, pull up oil spill mats of hair.
[02:12:37.645 --> 02:12:39.006]  What are they talking about?
[02:12:39.006 --> 02:12:40.927]  Mats of hair?
[02:12:40.927 --> 02:12:51.633]  Because if you go back a few hundred years, people back in the medieval times, when they had problems like this, they would band together and cut their hair off and make mats of hair.
[02:12:51.633 --> 02:12:54.155]  But I mean, is this the best America has to offer?
[02:12:54.155 --> 02:12:54.995]  Medieval cures?
[02:12:56.836 --> 02:12:59.477]  You know, what century are we in?
[02:12:59.477 --> 02:13:02.678]  But listen, people, you think we're joking.
[02:13:02.678 --> 02:13:04.679]  What have you heard about the mats of hair?
[02:13:04.679 --> 02:13:11.641]  I thought it was, I thought I was in the Twilight Zone driving in, but it was a mainstream talk radio going, what is this about mats of hair in the Gulf?
[02:13:11.641 --> 02:13:14.802]  So they're going to have people cut their hair off and throw it in the ocean?
[02:13:16.022 --> 02:13:16.542]  I think?
[02:13:46.122 --> 02:14:08.257]  All right, real fast, because I want to go to calls, but specifically, we've had some guests on who talk about the fact that this happened right after the Day After Earth Day, that Obama didn't really want to allow drilling, that BP is going to make money off insurance on this, that they're only liable for something like $750 million.
[02:14:08.257 --> 02:14:10.078]  Are you hinting at this being staged, Max?
[02:14:10.768 --> 02:14:11.489]  No.
[02:14:11.489 --> 02:14:12.509]  No, I'm not hinting.
[02:14:12.509 --> 02:14:19.295]  I'm hinting that the companies are too cheap to buy adequate safety equipment.
[02:14:19.295 --> 02:14:35.847]  Think about, for example, I don't want to go open a big thing here, but for $50 an airplane, it would have been very easy to have an adequate lock between the cockpit and the fuselage of an airplane.
[02:14:35.847 --> 02:14:37.388]  But airlines are too cheap.
[02:14:37.388 --> 02:14:38.409]  Industry is too cheap.
[02:14:38.409 --> 02:14:40.631]  They could have prevented terrorist attacks.
[02:14:41.472 --> 02:14:45.477]  But Max, you know as well as I, 9-11 was a staged event.
[02:14:45.477 --> 02:14:49.042]  Well, you know, but I'm just saying that ultimately they're cheap.
[02:14:49.042 --> 02:14:54.269]  So this is a half a million dollar piece of equipment that BP, other countries by the way, not in America.
[02:14:54.269 --> 02:14:56.031]  Now I know, everybody else has them.
[02:14:58.208 --> 02:14:59.049]  All right, Max, absolutely.
[02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:03.811]  Let's get to a few final questions for you because you've got to go.
[02:15:03.811 --> 02:15:05.112]  Jacob in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:15:24.241 --> 02:15:27.423]  You're on the air with Max, the home game orange gorilla.
[02:15:27.423 --> 02:15:29.084]  Go ahead.
[02:15:29.084 --> 02:15:29.765]  Fantastic.
[02:15:29.765 --> 02:15:30.365]  Thanks, Max.
[02:15:30.365 --> 02:15:32.047]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:15:32.047 --> 02:15:39.091]  Max, thanks, first of all, for answering most of my questions, actually, during the course of this show.
[02:15:39.091 --> 02:15:53.842]  But I do have one final one, and that is that, you know, reading over the patent, I've only read the one from 1999 that looks at the virtual specialist, kind of sets it up as a sort of distributed system of trading, kind of turns, kind of developed a trading machine gun.
[02:15:54.628 --> 02:16:05.335]  Now it sounds, it seems like it's being used as a nuclear weapon to, except instead of a bomb just destroying your house, it takes everything from your neighbor's garage and puts it in yours.
[02:16:05.335 --> 02:16:12.320]  How, is this really the first strike, would you say, in what we would consider cyber warfare?
[02:16:13.897 --> 02:16:21.139]  Well, as I said at the top of the show, I think it's an example of a domestic financial terrorist attack, unequivocal, so it's the first example.
[02:16:21.139 --> 02:16:23.680]  As far as my patent goes, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:25.481]  It's not used the way it was designed.
[02:16:25.481 --> 02:16:32.323]  It was designed, actually, to eliminate front-running and to eliminate the broker-dealer conflict.
[02:16:32.323 --> 02:16:42.886]  But instead, the new owner, Cancer Fitzgerald, they've accentuated the broker-dealer conflict, and they've turned it inside out, which under European laws is completely illegal, by the way.
[02:16:45.021 --> 02:16:46.983]  Because it's all globalized, they do whatever they want.
[02:16:46.983 --> 02:16:48.144]  But let me throw this out there.
[02:16:48.144 --> 02:16:55.349]  Did you see the Hill newspaper and also CBS with Obama over the weekend saying this may have been cyber terror?
[02:16:55.349 --> 02:17:01.674]  Well obviously it's Goldman Sachs doing it and they stand to gain and it was staged, it wasn't a fat finger.
[02:17:01.674 --> 02:17:07.219]  So now they're going to use this to take our internet freedoms claiming that some guy in a cave did this.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:17.184]  Well, I think you have to differentiate between cyber terror, as that term is understood, and this is financial, what I call financial terror.
[02:17:17.184 --> 02:17:22.046]  Cyber terror would be something like a distributed denial of service attack you see between China and the U.S.
[02:17:22.046 --> 02:17:22.586]  all the time.
[02:17:22.586 --> 02:17:23.727]  It takes place over the internet.
[02:17:23.727 --> 02:17:26.048]  Or somebody hacking into a hospital and turning the power off.
[02:17:27.034 --> 02:17:27.334]  No, I know.
[02:17:27.334 --> 02:17:32.437]  My question is, Max, what do you think of Obama floating the idea that men with turbines did this?
[02:17:41.417 --> 02:17:51.571]  Well, I didn't hear him say that, but I can tell you that it was Goldman Sachs.
[02:17:51.571 --> 02:17:52.932]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:17:52.932 --> 02:17:53.814]  What else can I tell you?
[02:17:53.814 --> 02:17:55.476]  No, I know.
[02:17:55.476 --> 02:17:56.097]  I agree with you.
[02:17:56.097 --> 02:17:56.938]  Hey guys, pull it up.
[02:17:59.278 --> 02:18:06.425]  Pull it up, Obama says stock market plunge, maybe cyber attack, or maybe sabotage was the headline.
[02:18:06.425 --> 02:18:08.787]  If he said it, he's completely misinformed.
[02:18:08.787 --> 02:18:14.372]  Well, he's misinformed, I mean, he's not an expert in these areas, and he made a misstatement.
[02:18:14.372 --> 02:18:15.773]  He doesn't really understand.
[02:18:15.773 --> 02:18:18.215]  Well, I don't think it's a misstatement.
[02:18:18.215 --> 02:18:22.820]  I mean, when somebody slips on a banana peel, they say Al Qaeda did it, and we just give up all our rights and keep us safe.
[02:18:24.218 --> 02:18:31.774]  Well, I'm telling you what happened, from the point of view of somebody who is very familiar with these systems.
[02:18:32.978 --> 02:18:35.961]  Well, we know they're lying and saying a fat finger did it.
[02:18:35.961 --> 02:18:39.165]  I mean, they're saying a fat finger did it, now they admit it wasn't a fat finger.
[02:18:39.165 --> 02:18:41.107]  No, it was not a fat finger.
[02:18:41.107 --> 02:18:42.388]  That was not the problem.
[02:18:42.388 --> 02:18:44.290]  They've already been discredited at that height.
[02:18:44.290 --> 02:18:47.273]  That idea is no longer even being considered.
[02:18:47.273 --> 02:18:54.541]  And now, if you have people like Janet Cavacoli, who is extremely well-respected, now questioning whether or not this was market manipulation,
[02:18:54.801 --> 02:18:57.184]  Gary Ritholtz over there at the big picture.
[02:18:57.184 --> 02:19:00.408]  He's a very plugged in guy on Wall Street.
[02:19:00.408 --> 02:19:04.193]  He republished my blog and some things I've written about it.
[02:19:04.193 --> 02:19:07.618]  He's now saying this is actually kind of a plausible idea.
[02:19:07.618 --> 02:19:10.201]  And you've got a lot of people stepping up to the plate and saying, you know what?
[02:19:12.059 --> 02:19:13.359]  That's right.
[02:19:13.359 --> 02:19:17.800]  And I'm going to have Paul Watson go over to MaxKaiser.com and get your top story about this.
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.821]  We're going to do our own big report on it.
[02:19:19.821 --> 02:19:20.941]  MaxKaiser.com.
[02:19:20.941 --> 02:19:24.242]  Kaiser spelled K-E-I-S-E-R.
[02:19:24.242 --> 02:19:25.803]  Max, it's always great having you on.
[02:19:25.803 --> 02:19:26.883]  I appreciate your time.
[02:19:26.883 --> 02:19:30.824]  It's always thought provoking and you have been dead on right about everything so far.
[02:19:31.644 --> 02:19:46.208]  I just wish that you were wrong about this gulag economy, but you normally join us once a month, so that means you're coming up in just a week or two, and so I look forward to having you back on with us to be able to cover the aftermath of the latest looting that's happened.
[02:19:46.208 --> 02:19:53.150]  Yeah, remember the home-grown gorilla.
[02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:55.111]  Man, I tell you what, you are something else.
[02:19:55.111 --> 02:19:57.151]  Max Keiser, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:19:57.151 --> 02:19:58.232]  God bless you.
[02:19:58.232 --> 02:19:58.992]  Alright, see ya.
[02:20:02.045 --> 02:20:03.246]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.246 --> 02:20:04.467]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.467 --> 02:20:05.428]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.428 --> 02:20:06.929]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:06.929 --> 02:20:08.890]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:08.890 --> 02:20:11.272]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.272 --> 02:20:12.814]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:12.814 --> 02:20:14.835]  To get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:20:14.835 --> 02:20:16.897]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[02:20:16.897 --> 02:20:24.423]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:24.423 --> 02:20:29.667]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:20:29.967 --> 02:20:45.425]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[02:20:45.425 --> 02:20:50.050]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[02:20:50.050 --> 02:20:50.511]  That's right.
[02:20:50.691 --> 02:20:51.232]  We're good to go.
[02:21:02.170 --> 02:21:05.131]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:05.131 --> 02:21:09.273]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:21:09.273 --> 02:21:11.553]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:11.553 --> 02:21:16.715]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:16.715 --> 02:21:18.536]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:20.076]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:20.076 --> 02:21:21.557]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:21:21.557 --> 02:21:24.598]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:24.938 --> 02:21:30.304]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:30.304 --> 02:21:39.655]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[02:21:39.655 --> 02:21:41.978]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:44.821 --> 02:21:48.304]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[02:21:48.304 --> 02:21:52.067]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:52.067 --> 02:21:54.228]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[02:21:54.228 --> 02:21:54.389]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.892 --> 02:22:04.273]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:04.273 --> 02:22:06.594]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.594 --> 02:22:09.815]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.815 --> 02:22:14.917]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.917 --> 02:22:19.118]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:19.418 --> 02:22:21.901]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.901 --> 02:22:24.325]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.325 --> 02:22:27.569]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.569 --> 02:22:35.179]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.499 --> 02:22:40.901]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.901 --> 02:22:43.743]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.743 --> 02:22:47.424]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:47.424 --> 02:22:48.505]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:48.505 --> 02:22:49.845]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.845 --> 02:22:51.346]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:02.031 --> 02:23:03.792]  Let's talk tough.
[02:23:03.792 --> 02:23:04.852]  Let's talk conference.
[02:23:05.188 --> 02:23:12.513]  Let's talk about down home value, made in the USA, blue jeans, like you wore as a kid.
[02:23:12.513 --> 02:23:13.394]  Remember?
[02:23:13.394 --> 02:23:22.040]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:26.083]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:23:26.083 --> 02:23:28.425]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:23:30.447 --> 02:23:41.209]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.
[02:23:41.209 --> 02:23:42.950]  Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:44.450]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[02:23:44.450 --> 02:23:47.710]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:48.551]  See them at gusset.com.
[02:23:48.551 --> 02:23:49.691]  That's gusset.com.
[02:23:49.691 --> 02:23:50.251]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[02:23:50.251 --> 02:23:50.491]  That's 888-848-7738.
[02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:51.431]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:23:51.431 --> 02:23:51.811]  Others don't.
[02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:07.923]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:24:07.923 --> 02:24:10.685]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:10.685 --> 02:24:15.648]  Okay, he's going to be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[02:24:15.648 --> 02:24:18.010]  And I'm just going to cover the whole of Reconquista.
[02:24:19.696 --> 02:24:29.001]  Machete movie and all these speeches around the country with the illegal alien groups saying whites are the devil, we gotta get them, we gotta bring in communism.
[02:24:29.001 --> 02:24:31.023]  How it's all funded by the government on record.
[02:24:31.023 --> 02:24:33.024]  I'm just going to cover that for an hour tomorrow.
[02:24:33.024 --> 02:24:35.945]  Because this economic information is too important.
[02:24:35.945 --> 02:24:40.508]  Here it is, White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's wild Wall Street plunge.
[02:24:40.508 --> 02:24:42.189]  That's out of the hill.
[02:24:42.189 --> 02:24:45.371]  And they've got that from the West Wing office.
[02:24:45.371 --> 02:24:46.512]  Gibbs told reporters this.
[02:24:49.625 --> 02:24:51.186]  Meanwhile, it's Goldman Sachs.
[02:24:51.186 --> 02:24:52.367]  Clearly, I agree with Kaiser.
[02:24:52.367 --> 02:24:53.608]  All the evidence is there.
[02:24:53.608 --> 02:25:06.598]  George Humphrey is a author, filmmaker, former Austin City Council member, a degreed economist, good friend of mine, and he's with us now for probably more than an hour, and it's great to have him in studio.
[02:25:06.598 --> 02:25:07.538]  So much is happening.
[02:25:07.538 --> 02:25:12.682]  Everything is accelerating and quickening, George, and he's here with us in studio.
[02:25:12.682 --> 02:25:16.004]  You've got the floor about what's happening in the markets and where all this is headed.
[02:25:16.004 --> 02:25:17.606]  Well, first of all, I want to say
[02:25:18.206 --> 02:25:23.450]  If you like excitement and if you like fun, this is the place to be right now.
[02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:33.417]  There's nothing more exciting that is happening in the world, and there is no place in the world that you can get better information than on this radio show.
[02:25:33.417 --> 02:25:37.680]  And I am truly honored to be here and to be your friend.
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.663]  And this Max Geiser who was just on, man, that guy rocks!
[02:25:41.663 --> 02:25:43.464]  He is incredible!
[02:25:43.464 --> 02:25:46.827]  And, you know, you have people like Bob Chapman on the show who is
[02:25:47.387 --> 02:25:49.928]  One of the finest economists in the whole country.
[02:25:49.928 --> 02:26:02.470]  And so for the listeners who are brand new, you know, I know, I've known Alex since he was 17 and he rants and he raves and he yells and all sorts of stuff, but he's telling you the truth, you know?
[02:26:02.470 --> 02:26:06.131]  And so keep listening and keep buying the product.
[02:26:06.131 --> 02:26:06.451]  That's right.
[02:26:06.451 --> 02:26:11.913]  I knew you in high school because you were involved with Pat Buchanan and stuff in his first run.
[02:26:11.913 --> 02:26:13.713]  And I remember coming by your house to get signs.
[02:26:14.013 --> 02:26:16.955]  Yeah, and we've been doing this for a long, long, long time.
[02:26:16.955 --> 02:26:22.159]  And back in the early 90s, people used to make fun of us and yell at us.
[02:26:22.159 --> 02:26:30.824]  And when 9-11 happened, you know, and that week we came out and said it was not what the government was saying.
[02:26:30.824 --> 02:26:33.966]  And for the couple of years, we took a lot of heat from that.
[02:26:35.087 --> 02:26:45.725]  And not everything that I say or you say is absolutely dead right on, but I'll tell you what, I would match your record against any record in any prognication
[02:26:46.263 --> 02:26:54.207]  of anybody in this country, and the point is, is that we are facing an economic and political tsunami.
[02:26:54.207 --> 02:26:57.008]  There is no question whatsoever.
[02:26:57.008 --> 02:27:03.110]  Now, 15 years ago, if we were on the beach and the water started pulling out, we wouldn't know what was happening.
[02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:07.392]  We'd probably just sit there and get hit by the tsunami.
[02:27:07.392 --> 02:27:15.096]  Now, because of shows like this and because of the work of myself and thousands of other patriots, people are waking up to what's going on.
[02:27:15.876 --> 02:27:22.403]  The economic tide has pulled out and it's going out further and further.
[02:27:22.403 --> 02:27:33.815]  There is no question whatsoever that we are going to experience the largest economic tsunami in the history of this Western culture.
[02:27:34.355 --> 02:27:34.635]  In this
[02:27:53.689 --> 02:27:55.370]  are dying as we speak.
[02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:57.412]  It's a dead man walking.
[02:27:57.412 --> 02:28:05.458]  No matter what we do, no matter how much money is printed, how much credit is put out there, no matter how many lies they tell,
[02:28:06.502 --> 02:28:08.663]  We cannot fix the American economy.
[02:28:08.663 --> 02:28:09.863]  And the globalists know that.
[02:28:09.863 --> 02:28:10.923]  That's the trap.
[02:28:10.923 --> 02:28:12.584]  That's the loan sharking.
[02:28:12.584 --> 02:28:14.785]  And they're just amassing power right now.
[02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:23.968]  Yes, and one of the things is when you study history, you realize is that the Illuminati's motto is, out of chaos, power.
[02:28:23.968 --> 02:28:26.188]  Out of chaos is order.
[02:28:26.188 --> 02:28:34.351]  And all of this is pre-arranged disintegration of the very vehicle that keeps America
[02:28:35.191 --> 02:28:44.858]  The American Republic, the strongest government, the strongest concept of hope and of freedom in the whole world.
[02:28:44.858 --> 02:28:50.963]  Our nation, our republic, our society is being systematically destroyed.
[02:28:50.963 --> 02:29:03.412]  And I know that for some people this is very difficult to understand, but when one looks at the facts, the facts are that the economic tsunami that is coming at us is going to make what happened
[02:29:03.852 --> 02:29:20.657]  in indonesian thailand and india seem like small fry and all you have to do is take a look at the fact that total federal state local personal debt is nine hundred percent greater than the gross national product that's not including the derivatives
[02:29:21.357 --> 02:29:23.919]  And then if you add the derivatives, there's another hundred...
[02:29:37.935 --> 02:29:41.938]  The reasons they want the world government, and it only gets worse from there.
[02:29:41.938 --> 02:29:44.380]  And so George Humphrey is our guest economist.
[02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:45.501]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:29:45.501 --> 02:29:47.923]  He'll be with us into the next hour as well.
[02:29:47.923 --> 02:29:48.463]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:48.463 --> 02:29:52.266]  We appreciate George being here.
[02:29:52.266 --> 02:29:53.608]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.608 --> 02:29:56.130]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.130 --> 02:29:58.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.451 --> 02:30:03.333]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[02:30:03.333 --> 02:30:04.394]  Lost your remote?
[02:30:04.394 --> 02:30:06.957]  Or is your remote control just not working?
[02:30:06.957 --> 02:30:10.461]  Let ReplacementRemotes.com replace or fix it for you.
[02:30:10.461 --> 02:30:16.427]  We carry a complete line of remote controls for all brands of TV, home audio, or DVD remotes, including
[02:30:16.687 --> 02:30:17.568]  We're good to go!
[02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:47.734]  For all your remote control needs, visit ReplacementRemotes.com.
[02:30:47.734 --> 02:30:47.774]  336-377-2220.
[02:31:00.971 --> 02:31:08.956]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[02:31:08.956 --> 02:31:16.301]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[02:31:16.301 --> 02:31:23.305]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[02:31:23.305 --> 02:31:24.146]  Listen carefully.
[02:31:24.506 --> 02:31:34.233]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[02:31:34.233 --> 02:31:38.477]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[02:31:38.477 --> 02:31:41.479]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[02:31:41.479 --> 02:31:45.622]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:45.622 --> 02:31:46.763]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex 800-409-5633.
[02:31:54.189 --> 02:31:57.299]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[02:32:01.923 --> 02:32:10.409]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:32:10.409 --> 02:32:21.298]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:32:21.298 --> 02:32:26.742]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:32:27.282 --> 02:32:32.185]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:32:32.185 --> 02:32:41.251]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:51.358]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[02:32:51.358 --> 02:32:55.041]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:55.041 --> 02:32:56.041]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:33:07.210 --> 02:33:11.373]  We're going back to George Humphrey here in just a moment, and then your phone calls.
[02:33:11.373 --> 02:33:16.076]  Again, economist, successful businessman, former city council member, author, filmmaker.
[02:33:16.076 --> 02:33:24.082]  Before we go back to George to go over the economic facts we're facing, because we're in much greater debt than Greece was, much greater debt than even England.
[02:33:24.082 --> 02:33:29.266]  This has all been designed through fraud, and then now you're seeing the government announce
[02:33:30.396 --> 02:33:35.181]  Almost all the taxes will go to interest on debt, not to services.
[02:33:35.181 --> 02:33:40.827]  And Bloomberg and others announcing what's already happened in Greece, we want all or part of your pension funds.
[02:33:40.827 --> 02:33:43.730]  That isn't just the government coming and taking your pension funds.
[02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:50.777]  That is private corporations just shutting down and leaving, or creating a subsidiary, then destroying the old company and taking your pension fund.
[02:33:50.777 --> 02:33:52.359]  I mean, so many scams.
[02:33:52.359 --> 02:33:53.139]  They've now set up a
[02:33:54.465 --> 02:33:58.226]  FEMA, over 40% plus of the U.S.
[02:33:58.226 --> 02:34:02.688]  national property tax on 40% of the property in the country.
[02:34:02.688 --> 02:34:03.748]  They call flood insurance.
[02:34:03.748 --> 02:34:05.328]  I mean, it's all happening now.
[02:34:05.328 --> 02:34:06.349]  We're going to talk about it in a moment.
[02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:10.470]  Before we do that, a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:34:11.693 --> 02:34:13.514]  One of them is a Coloblue.
[02:34:13.514 --> 02:34:17.155]  Did you know that you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[02:34:17.155 --> 02:34:18.896]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:34:18.896 --> 02:34:24.658]  Our sponsor, Coloblue, their Coloblue 28 and a Coloblue 30 machines will allow you to do just that.
[02:34:24.658 --> 02:34:27.779]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[02:34:28.419 --> 02:34:38.748]  The water once generated passes through 7 or 12, depending on the unit you get, stage filtration process and reverse osmosis carbon filtration, ensuring that you know exactly what you're drinking.
[02:34:38.748 --> 02:34:40.889]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:34:40.889 --> 02:34:43.852]  We spend so much time talking about on air.
[02:34:43.852 --> 02:34:46.654]  You're unlimited clean water out of the air.
[02:34:46.654 --> 02:34:47.555]  You can't get better.
[02:34:47.555 --> 02:34:52.499]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[02:34:57.543 --> 02:35:02.749]  And again, everything we promote here is about waking people up, but also becoming self-sufficient.
[02:35:02.749 --> 02:35:08.835]  Because what is already happening and what's coming down, you will need to be as self-sufficient as you can be.
[02:35:08.835 --> 02:35:11.618]  And water and food and energy are so important.
[02:35:11.618 --> 02:35:14.080]  And one of those is MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:16.022]  We've been promoting this for now almost three years.
[02:35:16.022 --> 02:35:17.163]  I get nothing but rave reviews.
[02:35:18.536 --> 02:35:21.400]  It's a plug-and-play solar generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:28.671]  These portable power systems need no insulation and supply household current wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[02:35:28.671 --> 02:35:31.916]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:35:31.916 --> 02:35:33.438]  It's like having your own electrical power plant.
[02:35:33.979 --> 02:35:36.280]  And it's perfect for your home or campsite.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:41.741]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:47.602]  So check them out online at mysolarbackup.com or call for a free information package at 877-327-0365.
[02:35:47.602 --> 02:35:54.644]  That's 877-327-0365, mysolarbackup.com.
[02:35:54.644 --> 02:35:56.905]  Okay, George, you got cut off by the break.
[02:35:56.905 --> 02:36:00.786]  And I want to go through the info that you wanted to talk about, you know, the facts of the economy.
[02:36:00.786 --> 02:36:01.746]  But before we run out of time,
[02:36:02.606 --> 02:36:08.529]  First, do you agree with Kaiser's analysis on the financial terrorism last week?
[02:36:08.529 --> 02:36:15.332]  And what's your take on what's happening with, first it's $150 billion, then it's $600 billion, then it's a trillion today.
[02:36:15.332 --> 02:36:19.174]  Now they're saying more than a trillion, and they won't even say where the money's going.
[02:36:19.474 --> 02:36:25.176]  Yeah, first of all, Max Keiser is amazing, and I really enjoyed and learned listening from him.
[02:36:25.176 --> 02:36:37.921]  And it was really funny because I brought into the show a bunch of information that said that the bailout was $147 billion, and on the way here, I hear that's a trillion dollars for Europe.
[02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:43.163]  Now, the first thing that has to be understood is that this is not a bailout for Greece.
[02:36:44.138 --> 02:36:45.018]  Let me repeat this.
[02:36:45.018 --> 02:36:47.120]  This is not a bailout for Greece.
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:53.063]  This is a bailout for the banks of that region.
[02:36:53.063 --> 02:37:01.227]  The only people getting the shaft on this are the Greek people, and then it's going to be the Italian people, and then the Spanish people, and all the people of Europe.
[02:37:01.227 --> 02:37:04.809]  A one trillion dollar bailout right now.
[02:37:04.809 --> 02:37:10.092]  And the thing that must be remembered is that in the last week they keep talking about that
[02:37:10.752 --> 02:37:14.656]  The German and the French banks are the ones that are going to take this heaviest.
[02:37:14.656 --> 02:37:23.506]  Well, now it's my understanding that the IMF is good for about 27 to 35 percent of this trillion dollars.
[02:37:23.506 --> 02:37:25.588]  And guess who pays most of the IMF?
[02:37:26.269 --> 02:37:28.870]  The people of the United States.
[02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:36.314]  This so-called bailout is being paid for by you and by me and by your families.
[02:37:36.314 --> 02:37:39.455]  This is just absolutely insane.
[02:37:39.455 --> 02:37:47.179]  And that is why shows like this are so absolutely important because getting this information out has to be done.
[02:37:47.779 --> 02:38:10.625]  this is absolute criminal criminal behavior and as i have said over and over and over again no matter how much the bailouts no matter how many zeros you add you can't bail it out you can't fix something that's already dead with fractional reserve banking it is a dead system from the first day and right now
[02:38:11.465 --> 02:38:19.908]  The economies of Greece and Spain and Germany do not represent the real productivity or unproductivity of the country.
[02:38:19.908 --> 02:38:20.809]  And it's a black hole!
[02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:26.791]  The bankers brag over time to get you in debt, grow the size of the state, and then it all implodes into the black hole.
[02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:28.333]  Absolutely.
[02:38:28.333 --> 02:38:34.821]  And then also, of course, the size of government, you know, and I've been yelling about this forever.
[02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:41.290]  The total debt of Greece is 118% of the gross national product.
[02:38:41.290 --> 02:38:42.892]  The total debt of Italy
[02:38:43.272 --> 02:38:43.632]  We're good to go!
[02:39:13.092 --> 02:39:13.332]  I think?
[02:39:29.184 --> 02:39:31.926]  Both systems, the U.S.
[02:39:31.926 --> 02:39:34.668]  dollar and the euro are headed for disaster.
[02:39:34.668 --> 02:39:47.297]  Now I want you to go over that, but I want to direct all radio listeners to go to PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, and Steve Watson are on fire.
[02:39:47.297 --> 02:39:48.557]  I called them all this morning.
[02:39:48.557 --> 02:39:50.559]  I asked them to cover a whole bunch of key subjects.
[02:39:51.159 --> 02:39:52.080]  I sent them documents.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:53.741]  They'd already done their own research.
[02:39:53.741 --> 02:40:04.368]  There are a whole bunch of articles that are on the front page of PrisonPlanet.com that while you're talking, George, I'm going to have my guys go to the featured news stories and put them over the screen while you're talking.
[02:40:04.368 --> 02:40:15.475]  These are all so important so your friends, your family, your neighbors, people around you know why this is happening and that it's predestined and pre-planned by these criminals.
[02:40:15.475 --> 02:40:20.599]  Bankers, economists, mass centralization at heart of Euro bailout.
[02:40:21.239 --> 02:40:22.801]  That's government admitting that.
[02:40:22.801 --> 02:40:23.322]  Here's another one.
[02:40:23.322 --> 02:40:26.746]  Bankers destroy global economy by design to consolidate power.
[02:40:26.746 --> 02:40:28.288]  Another key article.
[02:40:28.288 --> 02:40:29.810]  Here's another one the guys wrote.
[02:40:29.810 --> 02:40:32.353]  All linked to direct statements.
[02:40:32.353 --> 02:40:33.114]  Ron Paul.
[02:40:33.114 --> 02:40:36.278]  Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse.
[02:40:36.278 --> 02:40:36.959]  Here's another one.
[02:40:36.959 --> 02:40:39.442]  Euro bailout fund is a desperate measure.
[02:40:40.103 --> 02:40:40.684]  Here's another one.
[02:40:40.684 --> 02:40:44.947]  Banksters throw a trillion bucks down a black hole.
[02:40:44.947 --> 02:40:46.949]  This is all key.
[02:40:46.949 --> 02:40:49.551]  These articles have all the proof, all the statements.
[02:40:49.551 --> 02:40:51.572]  This is the intelligence that we need to get out to everyone.
[02:40:51.572 --> 02:40:52.513]  I'm begging the listeners.
[02:40:52.513 --> 02:41:01.420]  Post this on Facebook, MySpace, your email list, everyone you know, and say, this is what's really going on, and send them this list of articles.
[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:06.825]  This is life and death information, because if we just lay here and take these attacks, they win.
[02:41:07.165 --> 02:41:12.029]  But if we take this attack like Judo and use it against them, they have reached too far.
[02:41:12.029 --> 02:41:19.115]  They can fall just like Ceausescu, or just like Hitler, or just like, you know, so many other thugs throughout history.
[02:41:19.115 --> 02:41:20.897]  Bernie, Madoff, Ken Lay.
[02:41:20.897 --> 02:41:27.482]  Now, I just wanted to cover those articles, tell folks that it's all documented there for them at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:41:27.482 --> 02:41:30.505]  George Humphrey, take us out to break in the next 10 minutes.
[02:41:30.505 --> 02:41:32.907]  Break down the real economics of this.
[02:41:32.907 --> 02:41:34.948]  And again, I pointed this out last week.
[02:41:35.789 --> 02:41:40.012]  I remember, when did you put out your first audio book off your first book, Common Sense?
[02:41:40.012 --> 02:41:41.914]  1998.
[02:41:41.914 --> 02:41:50.361]  1998, I remember driving to San Antonio, listening on CDs, that was like 8 hours long, of your book with that great radio host you had read it.
[02:41:51.454 --> 02:42:01.079]  And I remember learning about derivatives, learning how they were going to implode it to bring in a world government, how it was going to work, how they would set up the SDRs, and that was twelve years ago.
[02:42:01.079 --> 02:42:06.321]  I remember driving to San Antonio to interview the police chief, and driving back, listening to it, and learning so much.
[02:42:06.321 --> 02:42:08.502]  So, I'd like to give credit where credit's due.
[02:42:08.502 --> 02:42:10.363]  You're not just saying this.
[02:42:10.363 --> 02:42:11.684]  You understood this.
[02:42:11.684 --> 02:42:15.566]  You were one of the first people to specifically lay it out, and now you're laying it out again.
[02:42:15.566 --> 02:42:16.046]  Go ahead.
[02:42:16.046 --> 02:42:17.647]  Yeah, well, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:42:17.647 --> 02:42:19.387]  I appreciate that.
[02:42:19.387 --> 02:42:19.728]  Anyway,
[02:42:21.832 --> 02:42:22.893]  Information is power.
[02:42:22.893 --> 02:42:24.234]  There's no question about it.
[02:42:24.234 --> 02:42:33.099]  And at the same time, my job is to distill all the... I have people I'm talking to from all over the country, all over the world, who are really, really smart people.
[02:42:33.099 --> 02:42:40.044]  And I'm taking this, and I try and distill it and make it as simple as possible so that people can understand it.
[02:42:40.044 --> 02:42:48.069]  And the reality is, is that we are facing the largest economic tsunami in the history of modern
[02:42:48.812 --> 02:43:13.176]  modern history and all you have to do is look at seven basic facts number one is that the total debt in this country federal state local corporate and personal debt when you put those together not including derivatives is about nine hundred percent greater than the gross domestic product
[02:43:13.758 --> 02:43:18.488]  And the percentages are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:43:18.488 --> 02:43:22.537]  Just that alone assures that we cannot recover from this problem.
[02:43:23.143 --> 02:43:37.877]  Number two, is that the derivative situation, and anybody who says that they know how much there are in toxic derivatives, well maybe they know more than I do, but I've been studying this stuff for about 12 years and I don't know how much.
[02:43:37.877 --> 02:43:40.660]  Tarpoli says 1.5 quadrillion.
[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:46.025]  Yeah, and that's possible using the most conservative numbers, which is about 130
[02:43:48.268 --> 02:43:48.588]  I think?
[02:44:02.156 --> 02:44:12.859]  Japan in 1989, which is one of the most productive nations in the whole world, they had something very similar to derivatives and they went down much, much smaller in comparison.
[02:44:12.859 --> 02:44:21.361]  And even though Japan is one of the hardest working, most productive nations in the world, they have had 20 years of the Japan syndrome.
[02:44:21.761 --> 02:44:28.805]  of recession, recession, recession, because they just keep feeding this monster instead of flushing this stuff out.
[02:44:28.805 --> 02:44:31.266]  Number three is the balance of trade.
[02:44:31.266 --> 02:44:39.870]  I come from a manufacturing family, and what made America great is that we used to make things.
[02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:43.372]  We used to make things and sell things.
[02:44:43.372 --> 02:44:47.214]  And manufacturing was what made this country strong.
[02:44:48.530 --> 02:44:55.338]  Just 35 years ago, manufacturing represented 43% of the economy.
[02:44:55.338 --> 02:44:59.543]  Today, it is about 9% of the economy.
[02:44:59.543 --> 02:45:07.411]  Friends, if you have a hot dog stand and you don't sell as many hot dogs as you buy in product and rent, you go broke.
[02:45:08.285 --> 02:45:21.453]  For the last 25 years, we have had over $300 billion per year, at the minimum, of a negative trade balance, and it was up to $850 billion a year.
[02:45:21.453 --> 02:45:27.798]  This year, it's about $500 billion, which is about 3% of our economy, year in, year out, that's going right out.
[02:45:27.798 --> 02:45:36.003]  Number four is that the government of this country, the state and local governments, federal governments,
[02:45:37.544 --> 02:45:41.988]  In 1900, total represented about 4% of the GNP.
[02:45:41.988 --> 02:45:44.731]  Forty years ago, it was about 14%.
[02:45:44.731 --> 02:45:52.178]  Now, total government spending represents about 44-45% of the gross domestic product.
[02:45:52.178 --> 02:45:54.400]  This is way past the tipping point.
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:57.663]  And government last month became the biggest hire.
[02:45:57.663 --> 02:45:58.424]  No question.
[02:45:58.424 --> 02:46:01.206]  It's now creating more jobs in the private sector.
[02:46:01.206 --> 02:46:02.087]  Not even close.
[02:46:03.528 --> 02:46:07.051]  By definition, government is not productive.
[02:46:07.051 --> 02:46:10.034]  It is there supposedly to help the people.
[02:46:10.034 --> 02:46:15.459]  We are so fast far past the tipping point as far as the size of government.
[02:46:15.459 --> 02:46:19.963]  You know, we used to point our fingers at Sweden and talk about socialism and all that.
[02:46:19.963 --> 02:46:21.164]  Folks, it's right here.
[02:46:21.164 --> 02:46:23.065]  The monster has come here.
[02:46:23.065 --> 02:46:24.427]  And it's not socialism.
[02:46:25.737 --> 02:46:37.699]  is fascism because the large multinational corporations have are are working together with the government and by definition that is not socialism that is fascism
[02:46:38.656 --> 02:46:43.279]  Um, unemployment in this country, you know, they say it's 10% baloney.
[02:46:43.279 --> 02:46:50.084]  It's closer to 16% and we now have 39.5 million people in this country.
[02:46:50.084 --> 02:46:54.807]  And I just heard on Alex just a little bit ago, it's now over 40 million people.
[02:46:54.807 --> 02:46:58.289]  40 million Americans are now on food stamps.
[02:46:58.289 --> 02:47:02.192]  That's one out of every 7.8 people, that's one out of 7.8 people.
[02:47:05.477 --> 02:47:07.910]  Friends, that's insane!
[02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:08.795]  You can't have that!
[02:47:10.562 --> 02:47:17.848]  40 million people on food stamps, and they would be riding on the streets, and they've turned over the benefit package.
[02:47:17.848 --> 02:47:22.051]  There's this period of time that you get food stamps, and then it's supposed to go away.
[02:47:22.051 --> 02:47:26.235]  They've turned this over, not once, or twice, or three times, but four times.
[02:47:26.235 --> 02:47:34.741]  Obama knows that if he didn't keep turning this thing over, and that the middle class of this country kept paying for it, there would be rioting in the streets.
[02:47:34.741 --> 02:47:35.942]  Well, those are the new bread lines.
[02:47:35.942 --> 02:47:39.125]  Imagine 40 million people every day lining up at soup kitchens.
[02:47:39.525 --> 02:47:47.627]  You know, I watched the movie Gladiator the other day, and the old concept of bread and circus is so very real.
[02:47:47.627 --> 02:47:55.309]  The government is providing bread to the very poor and creating the golf channel and the basketball... The Romans did that!
[02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:56.310]  They had the dole!
[02:47:56.310 --> 02:47:57.470]  They handed free bread out!
[02:47:57.470 --> 02:48:07.593]  Absolutely, and when it was a republic, they used to have about 10 or 12 events in the Coliseum per year, but when it became an empire, it got up to 175
[02:48:09.233 --> 02:48:10.594]  Thousands of channels!
[02:48:30.569 --> 02:48:32.009]  Thousands of channels.
[02:48:32.009 --> 02:48:38.291]  And finally, the basic thing is, is that we have what's called the Federal Reserve Banking Act.
[02:48:38.291 --> 02:48:40.932]  It is not federal, there's no reserves.
[02:48:40.932 --> 02:48:50.055]  Our founding fathers were so astute, they knew that we had to have a decentralized, publicly owned money system to keep a free nation.
[02:48:50.635 --> 02:48:50.655]  I
[02:49:07.250 --> 02:49:07.990]  IMF.
[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:17.132]  And boy, all those old-timers that told us they were going to bankrupt the country by design and turn us over to a world government, and they all got put on a list and called names, now it's on the news.
[02:49:17.132 --> 02:49:20.293]  We've got to have a world government, and you're going to pay your taxes to us.
[02:49:20.293 --> 02:49:22.773]  And so the economic tsunami is here.
[02:49:22.773 --> 02:49:34.956]  The water, as we're standing on this beach of our society, and the economy is the ocean, the economy has started pulling back further and further and further and further and further.
[02:49:35.888 --> 02:49:51.133]  Now, 15, 20 years ago, because we didn't have this information, because we didn't have the Alex Jones Shows to listen to, and the other shows, David Ickes, myself, and many others, it was understandable that people did not know what was going on.
[02:49:51.133 --> 02:49:52.034]  Now, if you've got
[02:49:52.794 --> 02:50:14.809]  Any sort of awareness or open-mindedness, you realize that what is happening right now is the water, the economic water, drawing back and getting ready to come rushing in on us and to create the chaos, the planned chaos of the destruction of the economy of not only the United States but of the Western world.
[02:50:15.609 --> 02:50:18.751]  And this is a planned event.
[02:50:18.751 --> 02:50:27.417]  Now, we can sit here and argue about it, and we can sit here and scratch about it, or we can look for seashells, or we can do what smart people do.
[02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:38.864]  We can take off in the tsunami relief routes and get up on high ground and take care of ourselves, because the whole system of this nation
[02:50:39.224 --> 02:50:45.906]  The economic, political, and cultural institutions of the United States of America are full of cancer.
[02:50:45.906 --> 02:50:46.746]  They're dying.
[02:50:46.746 --> 02:50:48.347]  They cannot be fixed.
[02:50:48.347 --> 02:50:53.808]  And they plan for it to collapse into a mega-tyranny, a tyranny the likes of which the planet's never seen.
[02:50:53.808 --> 02:50:54.408]  George Humphrey, stay there.
[02:50:54.408 --> 02:50:59.890]  We're gonna come back, finish up with your information, then open up phones in the next hour.
[02:50:59.890 --> 02:51:01.850]  This information could not be more important.
[02:51:01.850 --> 02:51:03.231]  We'll talk about those tsunami routes.
[02:51:03.231 --> 02:51:04.171]  Fatigue.
[02:51:04.171 --> 02:51:05.291]  Headaches.
[02:51:05.291 --> 02:51:06.632]  Allergies and asthma.
[02:51:06.632 --> 02:51:07.312]  Chronic disease.
[02:51:09.957 --> 02:51:10.817]  Here's a fact.
[02:51:10.817 --> 02:51:18.801]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:26.005]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.

[02:51:40.029 --> 02:51:40.289]  I think so.
[02:52:02.466 --> 02:52:04.889]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:04.889 --> 02:52:07.191]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:07.191 --> 02:52:10.394]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:10.394 --> 02:52:15.500]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:15.500 --> 02:52:19.704]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:20.003 --> 02:52:22.346]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:22.346 --> 02:52:24.909]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.909 --> 02:52:28.153]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:28.153 --> 02:52:35.762]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:36.082 --> 02:52:41.487]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:41.487 --> 02:52:44.330]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:44.330 --> 02:52:48.013]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:48.013 --> 02:52:49.094]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:49.094 --> 02:52:50.435]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:50.435 --> 02:52:51.937]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:56.342 --> 02:53:56.662]  It works!
[02:54:09.211 --> 02:54:13.855]  We have a decision to make as a society, as a species, the human race.
[02:54:13.855 --> 02:54:16.496]  The global controllers are going to try to play us off against each other.
[02:54:16.496 --> 02:54:19.779]  Race, religion, they're going to try to start new wars.
[02:54:19.779 --> 02:54:25.583]  I believe they're going to try to launch a new war against Iran in the midst of this global meltdown to get political support at home.
[02:54:25.583 --> 02:54:30.026]  That has people, you know, shift into this primitive mode of rallying around, you know, the chief.
[02:54:31.206 --> 02:54:33.207]  But I do see the system complaining.
[02:54:33.207 --> 02:54:36.488]  Obama and others are saying, Cass Sunstein's complaining.
[02:54:36.488 --> 02:54:38.828]  Oh my God, none of them listen to us anymore.
[02:54:38.828 --> 02:54:43.609]  The new Supreme Court nominee is anti-free speech, anti-Second Amendment.
[02:54:43.609 --> 02:54:57.633]  So they're definitely trying to come in with a tyranny, but I think all this bluster and this attempt to race us to the finish line is because they understand their time is running out and the awakening is accelerating.
[02:54:57.813 --> 02:55:05.758]  Yeah, Alex, I couldn't agree with you more and one of the things that we talked about is that you and I have been doing this for a long time and ten years ago I was
[02:55:07.108 --> 02:55:13.053]  Frankly, pretty frantic about what the future was for myself and my family and my country and my world.
[02:55:13.053 --> 02:55:28.185]  I am more positive today, even though I have a hundred times more information about the bad stuff, I'm more positive today about the future of what we, as individuals, as part of God's creation, can do.
[02:55:28.185 --> 02:55:30.867]  And we do know that this economic tsunami is coming.
[02:55:31.247 --> 02:55:35.512]  So, we've got to chop wood and carry water and we've got to get to the high ground.
[02:55:35.512 --> 02:55:38.775]  So, what does a smart person do to get to the high ground?
[02:55:38.775 --> 02:55:41.278]  And I know you talk about this all the time.
[02:55:41.278 --> 02:55:42.899]  First thing, you've got to have a passport.
[02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:44.341]  Everybody's listening here.
[02:55:44.341 --> 02:55:46.383]  Get yourself a valid passport.
[02:55:46.383 --> 02:55:48.906]  Number two, get yourself out of debt.
[02:55:50.063 --> 02:55:55.605]  Get the ceiling on desires, cut your spending, and be more efficient.
[02:55:55.605 --> 02:56:01.287]  Put at least 15% of your reserves in gold and silver bullion.
[02:56:01.287 --> 02:56:02.647]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:02.647 --> 02:56:07.769]  Gold and silver have been a medium of exchange forever and ever and ever.
[02:56:09.770 --> 02:56:11.270]  You gotta take care of that body.
[02:56:11.270 --> 02:56:12.731]  Start a vegetable garden.
[02:56:12.731 --> 02:56:14.151]  It's really a lot of fun.
[02:56:14.151 --> 02:56:19.613]  Make sure that you and your family have at least a month, if not two months, food supply in your pantry.
[02:56:19.613 --> 02:56:21.914]  It's not a big deal, but take care of yourself.
[02:56:21.914 --> 02:56:26.415]  Number four, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.
[02:56:26.415 --> 02:56:28.316]  Don't drink fluoridated water.
[02:56:29.136 --> 02:56:31.338]  Get your exercise every day.
[02:56:31.338 --> 02:56:33.079]  This is so important.
[02:56:33.079 --> 02:56:36.761]  Get outside and get that vitamin D and get out in nature.
[02:56:36.761 --> 02:56:40.224]  Go down to the Barton Creek Greenbelt and spend some time.
[02:56:40.224 --> 02:56:44.127]  Number five, probably, you know, create community.
[02:56:44.127 --> 02:56:51.792]  There's a heck of a lot more people out there who are feeling the same way you are about what's going on than you may realize.
[02:56:51.792 --> 02:56:53.754]  And as you drop, you know, as Jesus said,
[02:56:54.614 --> 02:56:56.515]  Separate the wheat from the chaff.
[02:56:56.515 --> 02:57:00.596]  There's a lot of people who just aren't going to get this stuff.
[02:57:00.596 --> 02:57:01.776]  And you know what?
[02:57:01.776 --> 02:57:06.658]  Some of my friends, I love them and God love them, they're going to go their own way.
[02:57:06.658 --> 02:57:16.801]  But I have created so many more new and vibrant friends who are aware of this stuff and who believe in America and who believe in the Republic and who believe in God.
[02:57:16.801 --> 02:57:18.481]  So create community.
[02:57:18.481 --> 02:57:19.982]  Then make sure
[02:57:20.842 --> 02:57:26.147]  That every day, in your own way, whatever way you do it, pray and meditate.
[02:57:26.147 --> 02:57:29.470]  Pray and meditate the attitude of gratitude.
[02:57:29.470 --> 02:57:30.711]  And finally... Yeah, slow down.
[02:57:30.711 --> 02:57:32.473]  Get out of the media mind control.
[02:57:32.473 --> 02:57:32.793]  Absolutely.
[02:57:32.793 --> 02:57:42.482]  Because they get us racing so fast all the time, we can't just calm down and look at how we've been slowly brought through these levels into this deep tyranny.
[02:57:42.482 --> 02:57:44.724]  And you know, one of the things I know Alex about
[02:57:45.305 --> 02:57:47.326]  Better than most of the people down here.
[02:57:47.326 --> 02:57:49.927]  And a lot of people see Alex the tough guy.
[02:57:49.927 --> 02:57:51.347]  And he is tough, I'll tell you what.
[02:57:51.347 --> 02:57:52.668]  Oh, let's not talk about me.
[02:57:52.668 --> 02:57:53.828]  I'll tell you what.
[02:57:53.828 --> 02:58:03.592]  Alex is doing this because he has a deep, deep, abiding connection with the highest creator, the Grand Organized Design.
[02:58:03.592 --> 02:58:14.256]  And that's why he's not here to make a bunch of money, you know, he's not here, you know, we all have our egos, but his basic thing is, is because he believes in the goodness in man.
[02:58:15.529 --> 02:58:22.315]  And the last thing is, the last thing, and the most important thing is, this is a great time to be alive!
[02:58:22.315 --> 02:58:25.537]  Wow, what an incredible time to be embodied!
[02:58:25.537 --> 02:58:38.008]  All these things that are happening, and if you're afraid, and if you're in fear-based consciousness, these rascals, these vampires, these people who solve fear are gonna make you shrivel right up!
[02:58:38.008 --> 02:58:38.769]  But you know what?
[02:58:38.769 --> 02:58:40.550]  People like Alex, people like you!
[02:58:43.292 --> 02:58:48.976]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:48.976 --> 02:58:51.578]  We are the GCN Radio.
[02:58:51.578 --> 02:58:52.879]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.879 --> 02:58:58.463]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.463 --> 02:59:03.487]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.487 --> 02:59:08.531]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:09.051 --> 02:59:14.275]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:14.275 --> 02:59:16.596]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:59:16.596 --> 02:59:21.399]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:21.399 --> 02:59:22.520]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:25.582]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:25.582 --> 02:59:29.205]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:29.205 --> 02:59:32.387]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:32.387 --> 02:59:34.628]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:59:34.628 --> 02:59:35.549]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.552 --> 02:59:43.413]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:43.413 --> 02:59:48.235]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:48.235 --> 02:59:56.059]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:56.059 --> 02:59:58.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:01.201]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:08.621 --> 03:00:12.444]  It is already hour number four.
[03:00:12.444 --> 03:00:14.645]  Gordon Brown, the puppet of England, has stepped down.
[03:00:14.645 --> 03:00:20.670]  Now they're debating the new puppet that's going to be in power because the Parliament is hung.
[03:00:20.670 --> 03:00:22.892]  Angela Merkel has lost most of her seat.
[03:00:22.892 --> 03:00:24.813]  She's on the verge of being brought down.
[03:00:24.813 --> 03:00:27.095]  But still, they do what the bankers tell them.
[03:00:27.095 --> 03:00:31.218]  We're not just going to give the private bankers $150 million, it's going to be a trillion, maybe more!
[03:00:33.527 --> 03:00:35.690]  Nicolas Sarkozy almost lost control.
[03:00:35.690 --> 03:00:43.703]  He's backed off the carbon taxes, but he just rushes ahead without the global tax, just with a new tax where they just say a trillion is the private bankers.
[03:00:44.468 --> 03:00:48.192]  This is the global criminal consolidation of the economy.
[03:00:48.192 --> 03:00:59.022]  Max Keiser, amazing info last hour, breaking down that that was a Goldman Sachs government-run false flag attack last week to kill legislation in Congress to break up the too-big-to-fail.
[03:00:59.022 --> 03:01:03.025]  They now admit it wasn't the fat finger, it wasn't a mistake, but they're not going to investigate.
[03:01:03.025 --> 03:01:04.166]  That was a staged event.
[03:01:04.977 --> 03:01:07.359]  We talked about the computer systems they use to do it.
[03:01:07.359 --> 03:01:08.819]  Such incredible info.
[03:01:08.819 --> 03:01:09.760]  I want to go to your calls.
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:31.133]  We're going to get into a bunch of other issues here with George Humphrey, economist, good friend of mine, author, former Austin City Council member, who predicted this all with absolute precision 12 years ago in his book, Common Sense, and the audio CD set that, by the way, we carry at InfoWars.com, laying out derivatives that were designed to destroy the economy and consolidate power.
[03:01:31.133 --> 03:01:33.275]  But right now, we're going to go to your calls and then get into some
[03:01:33.815 --> 03:01:34.315]  Thank you, sir.
[03:01:34.315 --> 03:01:37.436]  To God be the glory for what we're all trying to do here.
[03:02:01.332 --> 03:02:18.123]  Um, I wanted to get your guys' take on something that had happened to my wife a couple weeks ago, and it had to do with a couple of bank representatives, um, not looking like bank representatives coming to our house and asking us for donations for bailing out the bank so that they can create new jobs.
[03:02:18.123 --> 03:02:19.884]  It's probably just total con artists.
[03:02:19.884 --> 03:02:24.747]  Probably, I mean, the con artists' behavior, crime of all sorts, is just exploding.
[03:02:24.747 --> 03:02:25.887]  Well, no, but check this out, though.
[03:02:25.887 --> 03:02:27.849]  This is what was really bizarre, according to my wife.
[03:02:29.025 --> 03:02:37.949]  The one she explained her situation, which was that she was against what the government, the NWO, and what the banks were doing with this country, her total demeanor changed.
[03:02:37.949 --> 03:02:41.431]  She got really defensive, really scared.
[03:02:41.431 --> 03:02:50.475]  She had a clipboard of a bunch of names, but what she did with our particular situation was she flipped over the clipboard and she had a column of three different columns, and she put us in one of these brackets.
[03:02:51.357 --> 03:02:56.160]  My wife didn't give a chance to see what it was about, but she said just the entire situation...
[03:03:21.717 --> 03:03:24.620]  Well, first of all, don't let people into your house like that.
[03:03:24.620 --> 03:03:27.643]  And secondly, there have always been pirates.
[03:03:27.643 --> 03:03:29.944]  There's cons everywhere.
[03:03:29.944 --> 03:03:36.490]  And we have to have the internal strength and the determination to say no to this stuff.
[03:03:36.490 --> 03:03:40.754]  And as time goes on, there's going to be more and more and more scams.
[03:03:40.754 --> 03:03:42.395]  And we have to be more and more discerning.
[03:03:42.395 --> 03:03:44.157]  Yeah, I don't answer my door.
[03:03:44.157 --> 03:03:47.039]  I've got glass, you know, there on the side of my door where I can look out.
[03:03:47.039 --> 03:03:48.520]  And I walk up and I say, hi, what do you need?
[03:03:49.361 --> 03:03:52.364]  And, uh, and they start saying, I just, I just walk away.
[03:03:52.364 --> 03:03:53.565]  I don't even respond.
[03:03:53.565 --> 03:03:56.208]  And then a few times they keep, you know, dinging the doorbell and I walk.
[03:03:56.208 --> 03:04:06.798]  I mean, and that's why it's good to have a, you know, at least a screen door or burglar bars, but now they're passing laws all over where you can't have them because the government criminals don't want you to protect yourself and they're looking out for their low level criminals.
[03:04:06.798 --> 03:04:08.920]  But you know, just tell somebody, get off my porch.
[03:04:09.571 --> 03:04:28.456]  Yeah, so just taking care of your property, and it still is your property, and just realize that there's 39 million people on food stamps, and that there are 30 million illegals in this country, and there's an incredible number of people who are hungry and scamming in every single way.
[03:04:28.456 --> 03:04:31.537]  So, you know, just be aware and just say no and take care of yourself.
[03:04:31.537 --> 03:04:32.057]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:32.057 --> 03:04:32.877]  Here's another example.
[03:04:33.277 --> 03:04:38.982]  See, having you go through checkpoints, body scanners, ask questions, TSA admits that was training for the streets.
[03:04:38.982 --> 03:04:41.043]  Now they're gonna have federal teams doing it.
[03:04:41.043 --> 03:04:46.307]  That's the same thing with the census asking, do you own guns, what's your toilet, do you have stocks and bonds?
[03:04:46.307 --> 03:04:49.290]  Everybody doesn't get that, but some families do.
[03:04:49.290 --> 03:04:51.171]  Well, here it is.
[03:04:51.171 --> 03:04:54.594]  Volunteer census worker charged with burglary and rape in Indiana.
[03:04:54.594 --> 03:04:55.595]  Here's another one.
[03:04:55.595 --> 03:05:00.479]  Houston Police Department, man killed in home invasion after suspect poses as census worker.
[03:05:00.479 --> 03:05:01.700]  Don't answer the door, folks.
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:08.662]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:05:08.662 --> 03:05:13.784]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:05:13.784 --> 03:05:22.528]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:05:22.528 --> 03:05:26.589]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[03:05:26.589 --> 03:05:28.690]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[03:05:31.025 --> 03:05:35.607]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:05:35.607 --> 03:05:40.669]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[03:05:40.669 --> 03:05:42.830]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:44.611]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[03:05:44.611 --> 03:05:47.492]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[03:05:56.815 --> 03:06:00.057]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[03:06:05.618 --> 03:06:06.878]  Tyranny is here.
[03:06:06.878 --> 03:06:10.760]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:13.041]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:06:13.041 --> 03:06:18.923]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:06:18.923 --> 03:06:25.125]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:06:25.585 --> 03:06:31.569]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:06:31.569 --> 03:06:35.731]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:06:35.731 --> 03:06:40.034]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[03:06:45.977 --> 03:06:49.539]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:06:49.539 --> 03:06:51.500]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:51.941]  It's here.

[03:07:01.252 --> 03:07:09.234]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[03:07:09.234 --> 03:07:16.595]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:07:16.595 --> 03:07:23.577]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:07:23.577 --> 03:07:24.397]  Listen carefully.

[03:08:02.603 --> 03:08:04.825]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.825 --> 03:08:08.947]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.947 --> 03:08:09.367]  You know what?
[03:08:09.367 --> 03:08:17.473]  We're just gonna have economist, former Austin City Council member, author, filmmaker, George Humphrey with us for the rest of the hour talking about the economy.
[03:08:17.473 --> 03:08:18.734]  We appreciate him spending so much time with us.
[03:08:18.734 --> 03:08:20.235]  We're gonna have open phones.
[03:08:20.235 --> 03:08:24.998]  I'm gonna get into some separate subject before he leaves like all these speeches by the illegal alien supporters
[03:08:25.818 --> 03:08:28.480]  Hello Alex, first I'd like to say I just love you.
[03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:29.540]  You are such an angel.
[03:08:29.540 --> 03:08:30.340]  You're a true godsend.
[03:08:51.281 --> 03:08:57.851]  And I'd like to say, well, about me, I'm a first generation Latina and I'm a professional.
[03:08:57.851 --> 03:09:01.096]  I'm in the real estate business and it's in New York.
[03:09:01.096 --> 03:09:05.824]  So I know a lot about what's going on with the Latino immigrants in the community.
[03:09:07.034 --> 03:09:08.675]  So I'd like to share that with you.
[03:09:08.675 --> 03:09:12.738]  Well, it's funny that I brought that subject up right now, not knowing you were about to bring that up.
[03:09:12.738 --> 03:09:21.523]  But I did a whole show for those who just joined us yesterday about just, just, you know, I've protested the Klan many times in Austin and Waco and San Antonio.
[03:09:21.523 --> 03:09:22.864]  I'm against that group.
[03:09:22.864 --> 03:09:24.865]  And then I see it's so acceptable now.
[03:09:24.865 --> 03:09:28.488]  And Robert Rodriguez, who I've met and I'm a fan of putting this new film out, Machete,
[03:09:28.968 --> 03:09:40.418]  That implies whites are basically racist and there's a big Mexican uprising and I've talked to Hispanics that say that more and more of the, especially Mexican immigrants, are trying to pressure Mexican-Americans.
[03:09:40.418 --> 03:09:44.782]  Kids can't wear, including Hispanics, you know, on Cinco de Mayo American flag shirts.
[03:09:44.782 --> 03:09:47.344]  It's so upsetting to these groups.
[03:09:47.344 --> 03:09:48.705]  How was this instilled in them?
[03:09:48.705 --> 03:09:51.748]  So, yeah, please give us a report on what you witnessed.
[03:09:52.734 --> 03:10:03.363]  Okay, what I'm seeing is that there are a lot of Arizona Mexican immigrants moving into the community, so they're moving into New York, especially Queens, New York.
[03:10:03.363 --> 03:10:09.269]  And for the most part, they are enslaved, and they are not able to enjoy life fully.
[03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:15.914]  And what they do is they raise money and send it to their families back wherever they're from, mostly Mexicans, is what I'm referring to.
[03:10:15.914 --> 03:10:16.055]  Yes.
[03:10:18.092 --> 03:10:21.693]  I don't see them to have so much hate in their heart as that movie portrays.
[03:10:21.693 --> 03:10:22.793]  I agree with you.
[03:10:22.793 --> 03:10:27.954]  I mean, I took nothing but calls from Hispanics yesterday and every one of them said what you're saying.
[03:10:27.954 --> 03:10:33.535]  So this is, it looks like it's the media magnifying this to create this illusion.
[03:10:33.535 --> 03:10:35.695]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[03:10:35.695 --> 03:10:37.755]  Um, I believe it's all political.
[03:10:37.755 --> 03:10:41.696]  It's to bring down the country and divide us in three parts.
[03:10:41.696 --> 03:10:47.537]  Uh, to hurt the, you know, people like me who are American, Latin Americans, first generation, very proud of
[03:10:47.964 --> 03:10:48.485]  I don't think so.
[03:11:06.658 --> 03:11:11.440]  Well, that's what the Hispanic members of the crew told me.
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:26.086]  They're concerned because they believe it will create a negative backlash on Hispanics, but me talking about, you know, the Robert Rodriguez trailer saying this is a message for Arizona, and that it shows the whites as all racist and being hacked up by machetes, that was only a small part of it.
[03:11:26.086 --> 03:11:33.568]  Then I played the clip from UCLA with him up there going, I love my students, we're communists, the whites are evil, we're going to get them.
[03:11:34.949 --> 03:11:52.058]  You know, my issue is the government and the universities are backing that view, and most of the Hispanic callers agreed yesterday, and they said, I've been called a pocho, if I'm pronouncing it right, which means a sellout if I have an American flag, if I decide I want to be part of this country.
[03:11:52.058 --> 03:11:55.880]  And that's not saying America's perfect, but the idea of America.
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:00.343]  I mean, have you ever been pressured by anybody, or you're saying you don't even find this anywhere?
[03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:06.091]  Well, for the most part, I've never actually believed... I'm like you.
[03:12:06.091 --> 03:12:09.912]  I've never really believed that there is a, you know, two parties.
[03:12:09.912 --> 03:12:13.052]  I've always thought they're all just a puppet.
[03:12:13.052 --> 03:12:19.594]  But out here, for the most part, they're very docile people over here in the New York area.
[03:12:19.594 --> 03:12:26.175]  They're very docile and very grateful to their, you know, whoever they're working for, and they're very good tenants.
[03:12:26.175 --> 03:12:28.396]  Because, like I said, I'm in the real estate field.
[03:12:28.396 --> 03:12:30.116]  What I do notice is they're not active
[03:12:30.846 --> 03:12:36.751]  They're not doing what they're doing out there in your part of the country, like in California, Arizona.
[03:12:36.751 --> 03:12:38.713]  That over there is a lot of lying.
[03:12:38.713 --> 03:12:58.910]  I heard your show yesterday, you know, the last show you had on that topic, and what I can tell you is that guy, I saw him, the one from that university, UCLA, that professor, Latino, he's full of it, because as far as him saying that he's the northern front inside the belly of the beast, and that he's just the beginning of Latin America,
[03:12:59.417 --> 03:13:01.879]  Well, I'm from South America originally.
[03:13:01.879 --> 03:13:03.501]  And, um, especially Ecuador.
[03:13:03.501 --> 03:13:05.803]  So, that's where my parents are from.
[03:13:05.803 --> 03:13:07.725]  Um, totally false.
[03:13:07.725 --> 03:13:09.547]  I mean, South America?
[03:13:10.394 --> 03:13:14.496]  They're not interested in that kind of axis.
[03:13:14.496 --> 03:13:16.097]  They don't want that kind of union.
[03:13:16.097 --> 03:13:17.658]  They don't care what goes on over here.
[03:13:17.658 --> 03:13:20.640]  Well, I said something good about Hugo Chavez four years ago.
[03:13:20.640 --> 03:13:23.781]  He led the coalition to stop the American Union.
[03:13:23.781 --> 03:13:27.924]  I mean, it was openly being formed, and Hugo Chavez killed that.
[03:13:27.924 --> 03:13:35.648]  I don't like the fact that he's starting to restrict free speech and do other things, and I don't believe in socialism, but I agree, he's certainly not the New World Order.
[03:13:35.908 --> 03:13:37.149]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[03:13:37.149 --> 03:13:37.869]  Very revealing.
[03:13:37.869 --> 03:13:40.130]  God bless you, Laura.
[03:13:40.130 --> 03:13:41.650]  George Humphrey, you wanted to comment on this?
[03:13:41.650 --> 03:13:44.711]  Yeah, I have a special insight on this.
[03:13:44.711 --> 03:13:48.393]  My former wife is from Jalisco, from Puerto Vallarta.
[03:13:48.393 --> 03:13:53.475]  I've been down in Mexico at least once or twice a year for the last 25 years.
[03:13:53.475 --> 03:13:57.456]  My kids speak puro, puro, puro Espanol.
[03:13:57.456 --> 03:14:01.578]  My in-laws down in Mexico are some of the finest people on this planet.
[03:14:01.578 --> 03:14:04.079]  They're also very, very involved in the
[03:14:04.839 --> 03:14:26.195]  uh... political parties down there they know what's going on and they just say you know what america is the only country in the world with open borders we've got what twenty to thirty million illegals in this country you don't know exactly how many they are this is the only nation on the planet that allows this
[03:14:27.162 --> 03:14:32.326]  And it's not the problem of the Mexicans or the Central Americans coming up here.
[03:14:32.326 --> 03:14:36.669]  If I was from Ecuador, I'd probably come up here myself and want to come up here.
[03:14:37.193 --> 03:14:42.576]  But the point is, is that every country needs to take care of itself.
[03:14:42.576 --> 03:14:46.819]  Well, the globalists are radicalizing, and they're trying to use it as a weapon.
[03:14:46.819 --> 03:14:53.182]  And these communist groups are saying, they want to get me, I'm evil, I'm white, they're going to get my guns, they're going to get my kids.
[03:14:53.182 --> 03:14:58.985]  And I'm saying, look, I'm not against you because you got brown skin, but when you start saying you want to kill me, you got a problem.
[03:14:58.985 --> 03:15:01.547]  And there's another fact that goes into this.
[03:15:03.129 --> 03:15:09.678]  83% of all first-generational Latin Americans who are now US citizens are for real...
[03:15:12.556 --> 03:15:13.757]  Immigration reform.
[03:15:13.757 --> 03:15:19.341]  They know that a Balkanized America is not a good America.
[03:15:19.341 --> 03:15:22.644]  Well, the government wants to make sure people don't integrate.
[03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:24.285]  But they want to keep everybody in their group.
[03:15:24.285 --> 03:15:24.705]  Absolutely.
[03:15:24.705 --> 03:15:26.407]  That's why they're against everybody learning English.
[03:15:26.407 --> 03:15:28.328]  You know, it's amazing.
[03:15:28.328 --> 03:15:31.531]  85-90% of Americans are hip to what's going on.
[03:15:31.531 --> 03:15:32.792]  They want to close the borders.
[03:15:32.792 --> 03:15:34.393]  They want to protect things.
[03:15:34.393 --> 03:15:35.814]  It's the media and the government.
[03:15:35.814 --> 03:15:37.235]  The Democrats want to bring in
[03:15:37.731 --> 03:15:45.414]  New imports because it's the only source of new votes and Republicans want to do it to keep things messed up and to keep wages low.
[03:15:45.414 --> 03:15:49.916]  And we aborted 50 million Americans and so we have to have this new workforce.
[03:15:49.916 --> 03:15:50.637]  I mean, we killed.
[03:15:50.637 --> 03:15:55.279]  I mean, 50 plus percent of blacks have never been born since 73.
[03:15:55.279 --> 03:15:55.559]  Sick.
[03:15:55.559 --> 03:15:59.420]  I mean, it's sick.
[03:15:59.420 --> 03:16:00.701]  I mean, this is death.
[03:16:04.446 --> 03:16:05.907]  Let's go ahead and thank you, Laura.
[03:16:05.907 --> 03:16:07.808]  Let's talk to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[03:16:07.808 --> 03:16:09.949]  You're on the air, Margaret.
[03:16:09.949 --> 03:16:10.790]  Hello.
[03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:13.992]  I have four questions I want to ask real fast.
[03:16:13.992 --> 03:16:20.515]  Schaefer Cox, I saw a meeting he had in Montana, he had in December.
[03:16:20.515 --> 03:16:25.278]  I saw it and I looked on the internet to see more about him and he said he was in jail
[03:16:25.834 --> 03:16:30.437]  He had something called the Liberty Bell that all his supporters were supposed to come and help him out.
[03:16:30.437 --> 03:16:33.759]  I don't know who Schaefer Cox is, ma'am, so I can't really comment on that.
[03:16:33.759 --> 03:16:35.180]  What else?
[03:16:35.180 --> 03:16:38.102]  Oh, okay.
[03:16:38.102 --> 03:16:39.343]  A second one, Haiti.
[03:16:39.343 --> 03:16:45.007]  I was wondering about Haiti, because is it really, is it possible that those two were actually murdered?
[03:16:45.007 --> 03:16:54.914]  Because I was living in a country in, this is called East Pakistan, a few years ago, and the military went door-to-door murdering people.
[03:16:56.005 --> 03:17:10.034]  Well, I know Haiti is an incredible police state, Margaret, and that's the whole point, is that America isn't perfect, and now it's been seized as an engine of global domination, so people can point at America and say we're bad, but we've gone against our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:17:10.034 --> 03:17:12.575]  It's still the best, and that's why the globalists want to pull it down.
[03:17:12.575 --> 03:17:23.142]  Yeah, but the CIA was probably behind what happened in East Pakistan, but the CIA has, like, drug
[03:17:26.026 --> 03:17:29.086]  Margaret, I hear you and I agree with you.
[03:17:29.086 --> 03:17:38.569]  Eric Prince said that Blackwater wasn't in Pakistan killing people and then he gave a speech and got recorded at Vanity Fair Hazard where he was saying they're in Pakistan.
[03:17:38.569 --> 03:17:44.531]  It's just non-stop and now they don't deny that our government grows the opium, they just admit it like it's a good thing.
[03:17:44.531 --> 03:17:48.432]  I'm over in India and Southeast Asia every year for a couple months a year.
[03:17:49.072 --> 03:17:52.875]  And there's no question that Blackwater is over there.
[03:17:52.875 --> 03:17:54.556]  There's no question that the U.S.
[03:17:54.556 --> 03:18:01.260]  government is growing the opium, just like the British East India Bay Company used to grow the opium.
[03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:05.683]  You know how Franklin Delano Roosevelt's family made all their palatial wealth?
[03:18:05.683 --> 03:18:05.963]  Opium!
[03:18:06.403 --> 03:18:06.843]  Opium.
[03:18:06.843 --> 03:18:18.448]  The Delano family brought the opium from Southeast Asia to China and kept China totally, totally addicted to opium for over a hundred years.
[03:18:18.448 --> 03:18:19.408]  No, they know what they're doing.
[03:18:19.408 --> 03:18:24.010]  The government ships it in, and then SWAT teams any fool that they think has it.
[03:18:24.010 --> 03:18:25.590]  Let's go to Stewart in New York.
[03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:26.991]  Stewart, you're on the air.
[03:18:26.991 --> 03:18:29.132]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:18:29.132 --> 03:18:35.554]  It seems that mass fear and confusion can only help our friends in the New World Order.
[03:18:36.632 --> 03:18:40.775]  Who was it that said that it's a shame to waste a good disaster?
[03:18:40.775 --> 03:18:42.896]  I'm just paraphrasing that.
[03:18:42.896 --> 03:18:43.817]  It's Rahm Emanuel.
[03:18:43.817 --> 03:18:46.319]  He says you don't want a good crisis to go to waste.
[03:18:46.319 --> 03:18:48.940]  Well, it seems we've got two on the horizon now.
[03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:58.947]  In addition to the economic crisis, I'd like to go back to what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico and the volcano situation.
[03:18:58.947 --> 03:19:01.068]  You had touched on the possibility that
[03:19:02.133 --> 03:19:06.375]  What happened in the Gulf was not an accident.
[03:19:06.375 --> 03:19:13.098]  And if you remember what happened at 9-11, who benefits?
[03:19:13.098 --> 03:19:21.662]  There is some talk going around that, in fact, it wasn't an accident and it's coming from what I consider to be reliable sources.
[03:19:21.662 --> 03:19:23.043]  Who benefits?
[03:19:23.043 --> 03:19:26.864]  Let's look at our friends in North Korea.
[03:19:26.864 --> 03:19:29.145]  If there's anything that you can do as far as tracing
[03:19:31.329 --> 03:19:40.079]  Short options in the stock exchanges like we did with the airlines when 9-11 happened.
[03:19:40.079 --> 03:19:43.863]  I would sincerely appreciate that.
[03:19:43.863 --> 03:19:47.948]  With the volcanoes, it's going to shorten the growing seasons.
[03:19:49.077 --> 03:19:50.759]  And it's going to create a food shortage.
[03:19:50.759 --> 03:19:54.021]  And again, that's something that the new... Well, you know what they say, when it rains, it pours.
[03:19:54.021 --> 03:19:55.563]  We'll get George Humphrey's comment on that.
[03:19:55.563 --> 03:20:01.207]  Then we're going to get into psychic vampires of the New World Order and a lot more straight ahead.
[03:20:01.207 --> 03:20:02.268]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.268 --> 03:20:06.391]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[03:20:06.391 --> 03:20:10.655]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[03:20:10.655 --> 03:20:12.236]  You get less for your money.
[03:20:12.236 --> 03:20:17.921]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[03:20:17.961 --> 03:20:18.501]  I think so.
[03:20:41.898 --> 03:20:43.159]  We're good to go.
[03:21:02.131 --> 03:21:03.512]  Are you prepared?
[03:21:03.512 --> 03:21:05.813]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[03:21:05.813 --> 03:21:07.194]  There is a difference.
[03:21:07.194 --> 03:21:13.078]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[03:21:21.023 --> 03:21:21.623]  Holsters for $21.

[03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:05.512]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:26.272 --> 03:22:32.234]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:32.234 --> 03:22:36.416]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[03:22:46.644 --> 03:22:50.205]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:50.205 --> 03:22:52.186]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:52.186 --> 03:22:53.306]  It's here.

[03:24:10.026 --> 03:24:20.363]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[03:24:20.363 --> 03:24:22.366]  The controllers win if they can
[03:24:24.389 --> 03:24:27.730]  Manipulate the political debate and give you false choices.
[03:24:27.730 --> 03:24:31.691]  If they control the field, they own the horse track, they own the horses, they win.
[03:24:31.691 --> 03:24:37.333]  We have to realize that this whole game is rigged and then offer an alternative to people.
[03:24:37.333 --> 03:24:41.515]  The average American's been taught things are so bad because the American system doesn't work.
[03:24:41.515 --> 03:24:41.655]  No.
[03:24:42.675 --> 03:24:59.878]  I mean, if I buy a new car and it's got the engine, you know, the way it's supposed to run, it's got oil in it, it's got all the belts on it, and I'm driving, you know, I drive it around for 50,000 miles and it never has a problem, and then I drain the oil out and remove a belt, it's not going to work!
[03:24:59.878 --> 03:25:04.999]  So we have to fix it instead of going into this globalist system.
[03:25:04.999 --> 03:25:09.020]  But, George, you were talking about how vampires and fables
[03:25:10.247 --> 03:25:10.427]  I think?
[03:25:41.427 --> 03:25:48.090]  Well, last night I went to a movie, and of the six trailers that were on, four of these were vampire movies.
[03:25:48.090 --> 03:25:59.314]  Now, the statistical probability of 80% of the movies that are coming out are about vampires is about zero.
[03:25:59.314 --> 03:26:02.736]  And the vampire movie... That's all I see is trailers and books!
[03:26:02.736 --> 03:26:04.876]  It is vampire, vampire, vampire!
[03:26:04.876 --> 03:26:08.718]  Television, movies, everything.
[03:26:09.628 --> 03:26:21.634]  And the reality is, is that that's there because they, the Illuminati, and when I say they, those in separation consciousness, those who are in fear-based consciousness, what we call the Illuminati.
[03:26:21.634 --> 03:26:22.814]  They're sadomasochists.
[03:26:22.814 --> 03:26:32.999]  Is that they believe in their own set of rules, that they have to tell the victims what they're going to do before they do it to make it okay.
[03:26:32.999 --> 03:26:35.320]  Just like the movie Wag the Dog.
[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:38.602]  It was incredible, and most of y'all know about that movie.
[03:26:38.602 --> 03:26:39.002]  Tell them!
[03:26:39.002 --> 03:26:42.824]  It came out right before they actually ran a Wag the Dog in Serbia.
[03:26:42.824 --> 03:26:47.447]  Well, it was a movie about a president who was having trouble, a lot of political trouble.
[03:26:47.447 --> 03:26:51.470]  He was having an affair with one of his secretaries and that he...
[03:26:52.512 --> 03:27:06.783]  And that he created a war in Eastern Europe to get the minds of the people of America off what his... And they used a little girl running through rubble as the excuse when it turns out they lied about babies in incubators.
[03:27:06.783 --> 03:27:08.104]  They always put out a fake story.
[03:27:08.104 --> 03:27:09.245]  All this stuff.
[03:27:09.245 --> 03:27:11.947]  The whole movie was in the can.
[03:27:12.988 --> 03:27:19.893]  Six months before the Clinton allegations with Monica Lewinsky and what happened in Eastern Europe.
[03:27:19.893 --> 03:27:22.695]  It boggles the mind.
[03:27:22.695 --> 03:27:32.823]  When you and I started doing our stuff on 9-11, three days before on television there was a television show about an airliner going into the World Trade Center.
[03:27:32.823 --> 03:27:34.865]  Duh!
[03:27:34.865 --> 03:27:41.970]  They had oil storm four months before Katrina, even with the mayor in the show with the exact same thing happening.
[03:27:42.090 --> 03:27:44.512]  We can go on and on and on and on and on.
[03:27:44.512 --> 03:28:00.085]  But the archetype is, is that our so-called controllers are in separation consciousness, and they believe that only by materialism, by taking the blood of the people, the peasants, can they become more powerful.
[03:28:00.085 --> 03:28:02.447]  And of course, this is an archetype.
[03:28:02.447 --> 03:28:07.271]  Now, clearly, clearly, clearly, they're also telling us there's two ways to stop them.
[03:28:08.012 --> 03:28:10.514]  With silver and with crosses.
[03:28:10.514 --> 03:28:11.775]  They're telling us what to do.
[03:28:11.775 --> 03:28:14.837]  The cross represents spirituality.
[03:28:14.837 --> 03:28:29.507]  If you believe in God, and if you know that the grand organized design is going to protect our souls, and you stand up and look these people in the eye and say, I am in the light of God, there is no way you can hurt me, and silver.
[03:28:29.507 --> 03:28:30.788]  Silver and gold are the
[03:28:32.329 --> 03:28:33.150]  We're good to go.
[03:28:50.350 --> 03:28:51.530]  You have to stand up.
[03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:52.010]  Absolutely.
[03:28:52.010 --> 03:28:58.212]  What's the Abel Lugosi one where he's saying you have a strong will for one who's only lived one life.
[03:28:58.212 --> 03:28:59.652]  You have to stand up against them too.
[03:28:59.652 --> 03:29:04.654]  Yeah, and let me say this because I believe this very strongly.
[03:29:04.654 --> 03:29:07.114]  We humans, we are not victims.
[03:29:07.114 --> 03:29:10.235]  We as the citizens of this country are not victims.
[03:29:10.235 --> 03:29:12.756]  God does not create junk.
[03:29:12.756 --> 03:29:18.397]  If we allow the good energy, the loving energy, the healthy energy of the
[03:29:18.977 --> 03:29:19.278]  I think?
[03:29:35.475 --> 03:29:37.576]  The understanding that we are incredibly powerful.
[03:29:37.576 --> 03:29:41.217]  The globalists see us not as little pathetic weak things.
[03:29:41.217 --> 03:29:43.198]  They see us as 800 foot giants.
[03:29:43.198 --> 03:29:44.239]  They're scared to death of us.
[03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:52.642]  That's why they got TV and movies and cultures and drugs in our water and food to try to suppress us because they're horrified of us.
[03:29:52.642 --> 03:29:54.023]  We're on the march.
[03:29:54.023 --> 03:29:56.564]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.564 --> 03:29:59.245]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:02.276 --> 03:31:04.598]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:31:04.598 --> 03:31:06.980]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:31:06.980 --> 03:31:10.182]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:31:10.182 --> 03:31:15.287]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:15.287 --> 03:31:19.490]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:22.153]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:22.153 --> 03:31:24.696]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.696 --> 03:31:27.940]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.940 --> 03:31:35.529]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.882 --> 03:31:41.283]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:41.283 --> 03:31:44.124]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:44.124 --> 03:31:47.804]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.804 --> 03:31:48.885]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.885 --> 03:31:50.225]  You're everyone else.
[03:31:50.225 --> 03:31:51.705]  Invisible Empire.

[03:32:01.576 --> 03:32:02.377]  Hi, everyone.
[03:32:02.377 --> 03:32:03.438]  Andy Anderson here.
[03:32:03.438 --> 03:32:07.862]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.862 --> 03:32:13.647]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.647 --> 03:32:17.991]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.991 --> 03:32:19.693]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:19.833 --> 03:32:21.194]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[03:32:21.194 --> 03:32:25.575]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[03:32:25.575 --> 03:32:27.776]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[03:32:27.776 --> 03:32:39.800]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[03:32:39.800 --> 03:32:40.840]  Moles and fungus, too.
[03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:42.381]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[03:32:42.481 --> 03:32:45.663]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[03:32:45.663 --> 03:32:46.823]  No more dry skin.
[03:32:46.823 --> 03:32:51.426]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[03:32:51.426 --> 03:32:58.610]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:58.890]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:13.382 --> 03:33:20.089]  It's like the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, they've all come out and they've said, the good times are over, that's a quote, you're going to be poor now.
[03:33:20.089 --> 03:33:21.931]  And they have all these other publications.
[03:33:21.931 --> 03:33:28.659]  I remember 10 years ago hearing NPR brag, we're going to have our economy fall apart, it's unsustainable, this is going to be good for the earth.
[03:33:28.659 --> 03:33:30.380]  No, it's good for them to control us.
[03:33:31.383 --> 03:33:34.064]  And they've hijacked the environmental movement.
[03:33:34.064 --> 03:33:34.864]  They control it.
[03:33:34.864 --> 03:33:37.064]  They have a lot of well-meaning people working for them.
[03:33:37.064 --> 03:33:38.185]  But I was talking to George Humphrey.
[03:33:38.185 --> 03:33:43.426]  I was saying, George, you know, for many years, you did your TV show here in Austin for more than a decade.
[03:33:43.426 --> 03:33:44.546]  You don't do it very often anymore.
[03:33:44.546 --> 03:33:50.128]  I said, why don't you just turn a YouTube camera on at your house once a week or when you're in town and upload stuff?
[03:33:50.128 --> 03:33:56.269]  And I was explaining to him how we have eight different YouTube channels that we've been uploading to for two years.
[03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:58.770]  I mean, we've had our stuff on YouTube since 2005 when it came out.
[03:34:00.330 --> 03:34:04.751]  But it's now more than half of the video on the web.
[03:34:04.751 --> 03:34:06.072]  So that's the battleground.
[03:34:06.072 --> 03:34:14.414]  Yeah, there's censorship, there's problems, but we go there because when we put it on YouTube it then gets duplicated to thousands of other video sites and then reaches people.
[03:34:14.414 --> 03:34:18.255]  But our 8 channels, over 110 million views, there are 44 million views.
[03:34:21.636 --> 03:34:24.439]  Just on one channel, and that's one small part.
[03:34:24.439 --> 03:34:28.762]  We're on now over 80 AM and FM affiliates, not 65, we've grown.
[03:34:28.762 --> 03:34:34.847]  We're now on Shortwave, Satellite, XM, the podcast, over 250,000 people downloaded today.
[03:34:34.847 --> 03:34:39.812]  We started an iPhone app that's free at Infowars.com, 40-plus thousand have downloaded that in the last three months.
[03:34:39.812 --> 03:34:41.413]  I mean, we have all these different ways.
[03:34:41.413 --> 03:34:44.636]  My films, the DVDs, people buy them, they make copies.
[03:34:44.636 --> 03:34:48.099]  A new documentary that we're carrying that we're going to have first that starts shipping out.
[03:34:48.559 --> 03:34:48.799]  I don't
[03:35:13.272 --> 03:35:13.673]  We're good to go.
[03:35:30.922 --> 03:35:33.984]  And, you know, to have Nightline here, and they were fully aware of that.
[03:35:33.984 --> 03:35:34.865]  That's what they were here about.
[03:35:34.865 --> 03:35:46.252]  They wanted to understand this, and that's why Obama and the UN and the New York Times and all these corporations, our Cass Sunstein, who's a big supporter of the new Supreme Court Justice nominee Kagan, they've all called
[03:35:46.872 --> 03:36:00.079]  In fact, when they had the La Raza extremist out at UCLA saying, we're going to get the old white people, we're taking over, we're going to get you, you know, government funded to do this, to divide people, they had a sign behind them saying, hate speech is not free speech.
[03:36:00.079 --> 03:36:06.442]  So there they are spewing true hate, but I defend their First Amendment until they call for sedition, which they were really doing, which is firing a theater.
[03:36:07.262 --> 03:36:10.624]  There they were, but then saying, my speech has to be taken.
[03:36:10.624 --> 03:36:13.926]  My guns have to be taken so they can carry out their system.
[03:36:13.926 --> 03:36:16.747]  And so they're really going to try this.
[03:36:16.747 --> 03:36:19.669]  I mean, they're really going for broke here.
[03:36:19.669 --> 03:36:27.334]  Before we go back to calls, George Humphrey, your take on the rollout, the trial balloons for Internet censorship and control.
[03:36:27.334 --> 03:36:28.954]  Well, I was just reading yesterday that
[03:36:30.602 --> 03:36:36.844]  Our wonderful new president, the man of change, is another one of his flip-flops.
[03:36:36.844 --> 03:36:51.610]  When he was on the campaign trail, he promised that he would protect the privacy and the freedom of the internet, and now his lawyers are pushing restrictions that are far greater than President George W. Bush ever thought about.
[03:36:52.270 --> 03:37:05.568]  Folks, if you have any of your dear friends who still believe that Barry Sotero is there for the people of this country, please take them out to lunch and just give them the objective information.
[03:37:05.568 --> 03:37:07.751]  This fellow is an incredible puppet.
[03:37:07.751 --> 03:37:08.192]  He's as
[03:37:09.741 --> 03:37:12.341]  You know, we know he is the tip of the spear.
[03:37:12.341 --> 03:37:13.862]  He is an incredible choice.
[03:37:13.862 --> 03:37:25.864]  Yeah, he's very good-looking, he's very articulate in front of the monitors, but he is a puppet of the New World Order, and he's very, very dangerous because he is so good.
[03:37:25.864 --> 03:37:32.965]  And he is not there for your rights, and he is working diligently to try and restrict the Internet.
[03:37:32.965 --> 03:37:35.465]  And the Internet is our friend.
[03:37:35.465 --> 03:37:38.086]  And they're going to try to take it down with a false cyber attack.
[03:37:38.686 --> 03:37:40.828]  It's like they create the financial terrorism.
[03:37:40.828 --> 03:37:42.469]  They stage the terror attacks.
[03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:56.922]  They're saying, oh the cyber attack's coming and we have to be able to shut the web off and restrict freedom and control all ISPs and decide who can be on the web and we have an internet too that's kindler and gentler to stop Al-Qaeda attacking our internet, George.
[03:37:56.922 --> 03:38:01.446]  Meanwhile, Obama's in all these speeches bemoaning how he's being discredited by the internet.
[03:38:01.446 --> 03:38:02.948]  Yeah, and just FYI,
[03:38:03.388 --> 03:38:06.869]  Instead of using Google, use StartPage.com.
[03:38:06.869 --> 03:38:09.409]  They don't record your searches.
[03:38:09.409 --> 03:38:11.310]  It's a step in the right direction.
[03:38:11.310 --> 03:38:12.970]  I think that they're one of your sponsors, aren't they?
[03:38:12.970 --> 03:38:14.751]  No, no, they're great folks.
[03:38:14.751 --> 03:38:17.291]  And I really support StartPage.com.
[03:38:17.291 --> 03:38:24.153]  It's just that when I'm on a radio show or something, I have to say, you know, let's say I'm on some talk show and I've got like a minute and a half.
[03:38:25.242 --> 03:38:32.664]  I have to say, go to search engines, like startpage.com, but if I just say Google, people know.
[03:38:32.664 --> 03:38:43.486]  And the problem is, I've gotten so Google obsessed, where I know how to search Google, that with some other search engines, if I give out a certain headline, it may not get what I'm looking for.
[03:38:43.486 --> 03:38:45.947]  But I think it's important to use proxy servers.
[03:38:46.787 --> 03:38:53.110]  And I've gone over to Startpage in my own research.
[03:38:53.110 --> 03:39:07.318]  And for all of you, I certainly encourage all of you to have a group of friends, email friends, around the country that once a week or twice a week or once a day, you send them information about the economy, about politics,
[03:39:08.079 --> 03:39:14.344]  Yeah, don't just receive this information, and I know most of you already know this, use it!
[03:39:14.344 --> 03:39:17.227]  Because it's hurting the globalists, that's why they're calling for restricting it.
[03:39:17.227 --> 03:39:23.533]  Be a magnifier, be the clear light, be the Paul Reveres, because I'll tell you what,
[03:39:24.508 --> 03:39:29.352]  A few of us, as we grow and grow and grow, we are sending out information.
[03:39:29.352 --> 03:39:36.499]  And the information that I received just four or five years ago is just minuscule in comparison to what I receive every week.
[03:39:36.499 --> 03:39:37.300]  It's exponential.
[03:39:37.300 --> 03:39:38.821]  It's unbelievable what I'm getting.
[03:39:38.821 --> 03:39:40.783]  And the quality of info is getting better.
[03:39:40.783 --> 03:39:42.985]  You know, the globalists have their disinfo agents.
[03:39:43.385 --> 03:39:55.550]  You know, it's not just radical Hispanic groups funded by the Ford Foundation and the CIA on record that are trying to go out and say, you're an Uncle Tom to Hispanics that are, you know, free market, pro-Second Amendment, pro-America.
[03:39:55.550 --> 03:40:00.953]  I've had the white supremacist, like Hal Turner, who's now been proven to be a Fed in major newspapers, he admits he's...
[03:40:01.733 --> 03:40:02.394]  We're good to go.
[03:40:23.152 --> 03:40:29.057]  So now it's not a Ron Paul libertarian type thing, it's a Republican thing, but that's not working as well.
[03:40:29.057 --> 03:40:41.967]  So just like I've had white supremacists try to intimidate me over the last 15 years to, you know, you're white, you better join us or you're scum, the Hispanics can't give in to that either, and Tea Party people can't go under the Republican Party's control.
[03:40:41.967 --> 03:40:43.388]  All of this is about co-opting.
[03:40:44.028 --> 03:40:44.629]  Absolutely.
[03:40:44.629 --> 03:40:51.358]  And the fact remains, is very very clear, is that we're all in this together.
[03:40:51.358 --> 03:40:54.002]  It's not just white Americans.
[03:40:54.002 --> 03:40:54.843]  It's not just...
[03:40:55.794 --> 03:41:00.536]  It's not just male Americans, it's not just Americans, it's all the people of this planet.
[03:41:00.536 --> 03:41:03.618]  And we have a choice between fear and love.
[03:41:03.618 --> 03:41:11.922]  We have a choice between materialism and domination, or an economy and a world in which we cooperate and we take care.
[03:41:11.922 --> 03:41:13.363]  And right now is the choice.
[03:41:13.363 --> 03:41:16.724]  Every single one of you, every single one of you have a choice.
[03:41:16.724 --> 03:41:20.246]  And by sitting out, by not doing anything, and just by listening to the show,
[03:41:20.646 --> 03:41:22.508]  I know you've already cast your vote.
[03:41:22.508 --> 03:41:28.135]  And one person, as Mahatma Gandhi said, can change the whole world.
[03:41:28.135 --> 03:41:31.619]  Trust yourself by telling the truth and having courage.
[03:41:31.619 --> 03:41:33.081]  Well, I think that's the key.
[03:41:33.081 --> 03:41:35.303]  Courage doesn't mean you have to charge a machine gun next.
[03:41:35.303 --> 03:41:36.905]  It means you've got to stand up at a dinner party.
[03:41:37.506 --> 03:41:39.348]  I mean, I'll be in a convenience store and say, look at this!
[03:41:56.667 --> 03:42:00.510]  None of this candy has regular sugar.
[03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:01.811]  It's all aspartame.
[03:42:01.811 --> 03:42:03.512]  Did you know that's a chemical weapon?
[03:42:03.512 --> 03:42:06.754]  Did you know it's the byproduct of a genetically engineered bacteria?
[03:42:06.754 --> 03:42:15.100]  Go home and search engine the term aspartame manufacturing process or aspartame cancer.
[03:42:15.100 --> 03:42:18.383]  And people will be looking at me weird and I go, it's normal for me to warn you.
[03:42:18.803 --> 03:42:22.266]  We're supposed to communicate, not just stuff you see on TV.
[03:42:22.266 --> 03:42:23.967]  You're meant to talk to your neighbors.
[03:42:23.967 --> 03:42:35.556]  And so I'll start preaching even louder and I do that in front of my kids when they're with me at the grocery store or at a convenience store after we go on a hike and we pull in and they want some water and they want some bubblegum and I can't buy it.
[03:42:35.556 --> 03:42:38.138]  I go, I'm sorry, this has chemical weapons in it.
[03:42:38.138 --> 03:42:39.819]  And they go, oh, that's right, daddy.
[03:42:39.819 --> 03:42:43.822]  And then some guy starts laughing and my son turns and says, I guess he's brainwashed.
[03:42:45.595 --> 03:42:47.337]  I love you, Alex.
[03:42:47.337 --> 03:42:48.418]  I do the same thing.
[03:42:48.418 --> 03:42:49.418]  I play a lot of golf.
[03:42:49.418 --> 03:43:07.234]  I go out to the driving range, and you know, about once every three times I'm at the driving range, the white jets go over and are laying down the chemtrails, and there'll be 20 people at the driving range, and nobody, they're outside, and 99% of the people never look up in the air.
[03:43:07.234 --> 03:43:10.137]  And I'll just go, hey, friends, take a look up there.
[03:43:10.137 --> 03:43:11.338]  What is that up there?
[03:43:11.798 --> 03:43:12.518]  What is that?
[03:43:12.518 --> 03:43:22.544]  That's not a contrail, and I'll get people talking, and the amazing thing is, eyes wide shut.
[03:43:22.544 --> 03:43:26.766]  Our suppressors, our slave masters, have done such an incredible job.
[03:43:26.766 --> 03:43:28.968]  They are carrying out their crime.
[03:43:29.888 --> 03:43:32.290]  Right in front of our eyes.
[03:43:32.290 --> 03:43:33.031]  But you know what?
[03:43:33.031 --> 03:43:36.354]  There are people that have their eyes wide open.
[03:43:36.354 --> 03:43:37.775]  And more and more people.
[03:43:37.775 --> 03:43:40.497]  And you can just point to people and say, what is that up there?
[03:43:40.497 --> 03:43:40.977]  What is that?
[03:43:40.977 --> 03:43:42.339]  That is not a contrail.
[03:43:42.339 --> 03:43:44.420]  And then explain to them what a chemtrail is.
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:43:47.383]  And I want to go over this briefly and then go to calls.
[03:43:47.383 --> 03:43:49.565]  Not just about chemtrails, but a microcosm.
[03:43:51.004 --> 03:44:04.854]  In 1992, a scientist, and we're making a film on this, got a Nobel Prize for a plan to stop global warming, which we know is a fraud, that's just their cover story, to spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide in the atmosphere.
[03:44:04.854 --> 03:44:10.217]  Now suddenly in the last five years, high school textbooks say the government is spraying, this is normal.
[03:44:10.217 --> 03:44:12.379]  So for the kids, they're just being conditioned.
[03:44:12.379 --> 03:44:14.420]  For adults, we're told it doesn't exist.
[03:44:14.420 --> 03:44:19.844]  Then the White House science czar who wrote EcoScience, his first speech, you can pull this up on YouTube,
[03:44:20.624 --> 03:44:23.827]  John P. Holdren talks about geoengineering.
[03:44:23.827 --> 03:44:28.492]  And he'll say, we've been doing tests since the early 90s of spraying the atmosphere.
[03:44:28.492 --> 03:44:30.153]  Now we're going operational.
[03:44:30.153 --> 03:44:32.696]  But there's never a discussion about the funding or who's doing it.
[03:44:32.696 --> 03:44:36.460]  So what's happened is, because we've exposed the chemtrails of the aerosol crimes.
[03:44:36.460 --> 03:44:36.600]  Yeah.
[03:44:37.020 --> 03:44:52.829]  They come right out in plain view and calmly say, yes we're spraying you, move along, just like they came out on Fox News, AP, Reuters the last month, New York Times, and said, we are helping grow the opium, we have to or Al-Qaeda will make the money.
[03:44:52.829 --> 03:44:55.210]  And they'll take over $500 billion a year.
[03:44:55.210 --> 03:45:03.835]  No discussion of where are you shipping it, why don't you just legalize it, and then that would drive down the price and Al-Qaeda wouldn't get the money, or, well what do you mean Al-Qaeda will get the money?
[03:45:04.415 --> 03:45:07.356]  Again, they just, oh, we are growing the opium now.
[03:45:07.356 --> 03:45:09.317]  Oh, we are spraying you now.
[03:45:09.317 --> 03:45:12.718]  Oh, we are looking at putting things in your water to sterilize you.
[03:45:12.718 --> 03:45:13.778]  They're already doing it.
[03:45:13.778 --> 03:45:20.580]  So it's that same thing of, it isn't just in their religious or sadomasochistic psycho world they do this.
[03:45:20.580 --> 03:45:25.322]  There's a method to it where they just calmly tell you, like it loses the power.
[03:45:25.322 --> 03:45:26.802]  Yeah, we're spraying you.
[03:45:26.802 --> 03:45:28.903]  Yeah, there's some cancer viruses in there.
[03:45:28.903 --> 03:45:30.743]  Yeah, I was all hype about the flu.
[03:45:30.743 --> 03:45:33.144]  Yeah, we're growing the drugs, yeah.
[03:45:34.446 --> 03:45:35.367]  It's amazing!
[03:45:35.367 --> 03:45:36.908]  It's right in front of our eyes!
[03:46:05.186 --> 03:46:07.168]  What more fun things are there to do?
[03:46:07.168 --> 03:46:08.468]  And we're only alive once.
[03:46:08.468 --> 03:46:15.172]  This is a great time of change and we're going to decide the destiny of this planet and then its journey to the stars.
[03:46:15.172 --> 03:46:16.073]  Let's go to phone calls.
[03:46:16.073 --> 03:46:19.314]  Well said, George Humphrey, economist, joining us here in studio.
[03:46:19.314 --> 03:46:20.755]  Author, filmmaker as well.
[03:46:20.755 --> 03:46:21.616]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:46:21.616 --> 03:46:27.899]  If you just joined us as we attempt to wake the planet up to defeat the New World Order, the social engineers.
[03:46:27.899 --> 03:46:29.600]  Let's talk to Frank in Nevada.
[03:46:29.600 --> 03:46:30.161]  You're on the air.
[03:46:30.161 --> 03:46:30.741]  Thanks for holding.
[03:46:31.809 --> 03:46:33.150]  Hey, how you doing, guys?
[03:46:33.150 --> 03:46:34.451]  Just a terrific show.
[03:46:34.451 --> 03:46:36.753]  I'm loving listening to you today.
[03:46:36.753 --> 03:46:38.234]  You know, you've got to remember one thing.
[03:46:38.234 --> 03:46:44.979]  In ritual magic, one of the things that they like to do is they like to create out of nothing.
[03:46:44.979 --> 03:46:51.723]  In other words, when they create a work of art that formants their concept, like the films a couple of years ago.
[03:46:51.723 --> 03:46:53.345]  Yeah, no, that's the lesser magic.
[03:46:53.345 --> 03:46:58.168]  That's preparing the sword, you know, the rough sword, before they polish it.
[03:46:58.168 --> 03:46:58.748]  Exactly.
[03:46:58.748 --> 03:47:00.810]  The thing we have to remember is we cannot
[03:47:01.909 --> 03:47:02.109]  I don't
[03:47:21.525 --> 03:47:22.486]  Well, well, well said, my friend.
[03:47:39.740 --> 03:47:41.762]  And I think it's that separation from them.
[03:47:41.762 --> 03:47:43.624]  You know, they're in their evil.
[03:47:43.624 --> 03:47:50.490]  We have to be part of the good and the love and we need to make the clean break and point out and even declare it.
[03:47:50.490 --> 03:47:52.132]  Saying something's powerful.
[03:47:52.132 --> 03:47:53.032]  I am not with you.
[03:47:53.032 --> 03:47:55.094]  I'm going to stand against you.
[03:47:55.094 --> 03:47:57.677]  I'm going against you and we're going to beat you.
[03:47:58.397 --> 03:48:13.919]  I think it's very important to declare it and to really consciously realize this so people who serve this system who are compartmentalized and who aren't consciously part of the evil, you need to assess what you're in and understand that if you're aiding and abetting this system
[03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:16.382]  Uh, you're part of the problem.
[03:48:16.382 --> 03:48:25.369]  Yeah, and it's like in the Matrix, in the movie The Matrix, if you weren't down as a human being in Zion, you were part of the Matrix.
[03:48:25.369 --> 03:48:30.093]  No matter how good looking you were or how rich you were, you were part of the problem.
[03:48:30.533 --> 03:48:33.654]  And there are some basic laws of the universe.
[03:48:33.654 --> 03:48:35.495]  The law of intention.
[03:48:35.495 --> 03:48:37.476]  We have to set our intention.
[03:48:37.476 --> 03:48:38.476]  Are we for freedom?
[03:48:38.476 --> 03:48:39.717]  Are we for the Republic?
[03:48:39.717 --> 03:48:41.077]  Are we for sustainability?
[03:48:41.077 --> 03:48:42.238]  Are we for love?
[03:48:42.238 --> 03:48:44.218]  Or are we for this control matrix?
[03:48:44.218 --> 03:48:45.739]  And remember, they always have counterfeits.
[03:48:45.739 --> 03:48:49.480]  You say love and sustainability and working together through free will.
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:51.461]  They come with slavery for the collective.
[03:48:51.561 --> 03:48:51.781]  Absolutely.
[03:48:51.781 --> 03:48:52.882]  They always have a counterfeit.
[03:48:52.882 --> 03:48:56.264]  And we always have to be very articulate in what we say.
[03:48:56.264 --> 03:49:14.456]  And then, just like the fellow said, through the purity of our heart, only through the law of attraction, and we can have all the great words in the world and we can rant and rave, but if we're not taking care of our families, if we're trashing things ourselves, and if we aren't living a good life, all the words in the world...
[03:49:15.376 --> 03:49:15.656]  Zero.
[03:49:15.656 --> 03:49:17.637]  You've got to not just talk the talk, you've got to walk the walk.
[03:49:17.637 --> 03:49:24.340]  And I've noticed when I've been talking to higher-powered people, if I'm tired and not focused and just try to give them some info, they'll laugh at it.
[03:49:24.340 --> 03:49:30.223]  But when I really get on and focused and it's like a spiritual message, it's almost electric.
[03:49:30.223 --> 03:49:31.543]  People can tell the truth.
[03:49:31.543 --> 03:49:32.664]  It's like I'm warning you.
[03:49:32.664 --> 03:49:37.446]  You know, I'm not... So many yuppies, when you tell them about something, they think you're showing off.
[03:49:37.446 --> 03:49:40.307]  Or they'll say, I don't care if the market went down, I'm not in it.
[03:49:40.307 --> 03:49:43.749]  As if, as if, you know, they're separated from things.
[03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:48.091]  And that's why discernment is so essential at this time.
[03:49:48.091 --> 03:49:57.217]  There are a lot of souls on this planet who have chosen to go down the path of materialism and of fear.
[03:49:57.217 --> 03:50:03.421]  And you're just not going to be able to deal, just like you can't deal with certain alcoholics or people who are irrational.
[03:50:03.421 --> 03:50:09.205]  You can love them and you can try and help them, but we've got to take care of ourselves, our friends, and our family,
[03:50:09.605 --> 03:50:12.967]  And have that pure intention to make charity starts at home.
[03:50:39.885 --> 03:50:40.886]  Absolutely.
[03:50:40.886 --> 03:50:42.826]  You don't have to be perfect.
[03:50:42.826 --> 03:50:48.348]  This is part of a great game, and working for freedom, working for peace is part of the game.
[03:50:48.348 --> 03:50:49.549]  It's a great game.
[03:50:49.549 --> 03:50:50.449]  And it's a progression.
[03:50:50.449 --> 03:50:53.890]  You'll get better and better at this, you know, the further you go.
[03:50:53.890 --> 03:50:57.411]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, jamming a few final calls.
[03:50:57.411 --> 03:50:59.172]  Justin, Chris, Adam, and others.
[03:50:59.172 --> 03:51:02.593]  George Humphries, our guest.
[03:51:02.593 --> 03:51:07.415]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume
[03:51:09.255 --> 03:51:09.675]  I think so.
[03:51:35.213 --> 03:51:35.793]  I think so.
[03:52:04.611 --> 03:52:07.112]  And you're subject to public police action.
[03:52:07.112 --> 03:52:08.372]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:08.372 --> 03:52:12.053]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:12.053 --> 03:52:14.534]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:14.534 --> 03:52:20.395]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:20.395 --> 03:52:26.637]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:27.077 --> 03:52:33.041]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:33.041 --> 03:52:37.244]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:37.244 --> 03:52:41.527]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:41.527 --> 03:52:44.229]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies...
[03:52:47.974 --> 03:52:53.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:52:54.122]  It's here.

[03:53:31.878 --> 03:53:33.119]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:53:33.119 --> 03:53:37.662]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:53:37.662 --> 03:53:43.486]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:53:43.486 --> 03:53:47.148]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:53:47.148 --> 03:53:49.850]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:53:49.850 --> 03:53:54.913]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:53:54.913 --> 03:53:55.154]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:53:55.154 --> 03:53:56.555]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:54:02.118 --> 03:54:04.979]  Big John.
[03:54:04.979 --> 03:54:08.200]  Big John.
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:10.781]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[03:54:10.781 --> 03:54:13.202]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[03:54:13.202 --> 03:54:16.343]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[03:54:16.343 --> 03:54:19.944]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[03:54:19.944 --> 03:54:20.964]  Big John.
[03:54:28.954 --> 03:54:30.835]  You know, I wish that we had more time.
[03:54:30.835 --> 03:54:32.496]  The show is basically over.
[03:54:32.496 --> 03:54:33.837]  The broadcast is over.
[03:54:33.837 --> 03:54:36.598]  We're trying to take a few final phone calls.
[03:54:36.598 --> 03:54:38.819]  We've created a mirror over at GCNlive.com.
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:42.903]  We post a lot of our news over there exclusively now.
[03:54:42.903 --> 03:54:55.255]  I saw an amazing video from We Are Change Ireland shouting down David Rockefeller saying your new order will never succeed, then getting into the restaurant where he is at a globalist meeting, engineering this for the Trilateral Commission, and getting in his face.
[03:54:55.255 --> 03:54:57.538]  That video is up at GCNlive.com.
[03:54:57.538 --> 03:55:00.400]  David Rockefeller confronted at his dinner table by the sovereign.
[03:55:01.241 --> 03:55:29.778]  uh... independence the name of the group of the trilateral commission uh... i mean you talk about incredible they went in the trilateral commission and confronted them that is the and and and when they yelled at him david rockefeller you'll never get your new world order he turned around and he was not arrogant they said you're not going to make it you're not going to live long enough to do it and he was just like like the emperor just like oh i meant to get to that today just incredible remind me to play that tomorrow let me just break in there for i saw uh... carl roe the other day at our coffee shop
[03:55:30.718 --> 03:55:36.043]  And it was just so, he was getting out to his car, so I couldn't talk to him, but I just looked him in the eye.
[03:55:36.043 --> 03:55:39.686]  And I just looked at him and smiled and went, turned my thumb down.
[03:55:39.686 --> 03:55:42.009]  The guy is evil.
[03:55:42.009 --> 03:55:44.651]  You know, bless his soul, the guy is evil.
[03:55:44.651 --> 03:55:45.692]  And you know what?
[03:55:45.692 --> 03:55:54.840]  When you see these car rows, when you see the David Rockefellers, or even your local city council member who's sold out to the Chamber of Commerce for the big business,
[03:55:55.481 --> 03:55:57.964]  Go and look him in the eye and talk to him.
[03:55:57.964 --> 03:55:58.966]  Why are you doing that?
[03:55:58.966 --> 03:56:00.127]  Confront them.
[03:56:00.127 --> 03:56:03.692]  Not with anger, but look him in the eye and be very, very clear.
[03:56:03.692 --> 03:56:04.673]  No, very stern.
[03:56:04.673 --> 03:56:05.073]  Steely.
[03:56:05.073 --> 03:56:05.514]  Yes.
[03:56:05.514 --> 03:56:07.336]  Look, I don't like what you're doing.
[03:56:07.336 --> 03:56:07.877]  It's wrong.
[03:56:07.877 --> 03:56:08.818]  And I see you.
[03:56:08.818 --> 03:56:09.118]  Yeah.
[03:56:09.118 --> 03:56:12.723]  I think it's important to say I see you means I look into you.
[03:56:12.723 --> 03:56:13.444]  I know what you are.
[03:56:13.584 --> 03:56:13.984]  Yes.
[03:56:13.984 --> 03:56:16.106]  And why are you doing this?
[03:56:16.106 --> 03:56:18.167]  And what is your relationship to God?
[03:56:18.167 --> 03:56:22.850]  Why are you selling out the people of Austin or Sacramento or Boston?
[03:56:22.850 --> 03:56:24.371]  Well, what about your family line?
[03:56:24.371 --> 03:56:26.212]  This is going to come back on their grandchildren.
[03:56:26.212 --> 03:56:27.073]  Absolutely.
[03:56:27.073 --> 03:56:34.938]  You know, when I grew up, a man's highest value was the value of his word and his service to his community.
[03:56:36.030 --> 03:56:43.839]  Now that doesn't mean a thing, but you know, in a real society, a person's integrity is their most valuable asset.
[03:56:43.839 --> 03:56:50.567]  And you know, all of these clowns, whether they're the county commissioners or the city councilmen or the U.S.
[03:56:50.567 --> 03:56:51.748]  congressmen, they are
[03:56:54.146 --> 03:56:58.148]  98% bought and paid for by the... And most of them are just unconscious.
[03:56:58.148 --> 03:56:59.889]  They say, how do I go up that ladder?
[03:56:59.889 --> 03:57:00.989]  I do whatever I'm told?
[03:57:00.989 --> 03:57:01.690]  Okay.
[03:57:01.690 --> 03:57:05.371]  I mean, they're not even thinking about selling out.
[03:57:05.371 --> 03:57:07.072]  Selling out is what it is.
[03:57:07.072 --> 03:57:07.652]  Yes.
[03:57:07.652 --> 03:57:08.133]  Yeah.
[03:57:08.133 --> 03:57:11.014]  And that's why the globalists are moving on us so hard.
[03:57:11.014 --> 03:57:13.956]  I mean, people say, God, you know, Alex, how come you haven't sold out?
[03:57:13.956 --> 03:57:16.337]  And I've been, I mean, I've been given bonafide offers.
[03:57:17.393 --> 03:57:19.094]  Sell out?
[03:57:19.094 --> 03:57:22.256]  Sell out to a group that's poisoning my water supply?
[03:57:22.256 --> 03:57:26.098]  Sell out to a group that... I mean, sell out to jumping off a cliff?
[03:57:26.098 --> 03:57:28.540]  I mean, there is no selling out to evil.
[03:57:28.540 --> 03:57:29.620]  That's a mind game.
[03:57:29.620 --> 03:57:32.182]  You cannot win selling out to this.
[03:57:33.583 --> 03:57:36.465]  There is no winning, and that's the mind game, George.
[03:57:36.465 --> 03:57:36.946]  Absolutely.
[03:57:36.946 --> 03:57:52.516]  For example, in Hitler's Germany in 1930s, the gays were offered all these nice new uniforms to be in the SS, and they were told that they were going to have safety, and then they came in and did the dirty work, and a couple years later, then they were put in jail.
[03:57:52.516 --> 03:57:56.198]  Night of the Long Knives, they killed, what was it, 50-something thousand gays in one night?
[03:57:56.198 --> 03:57:58.260]  The Nazi Party was a gay movement.
[03:57:58.260 --> 03:58:00.721]  It was a gay movement, and then they turned on them.
[03:58:00.721 --> 03:58:03.183]  You can't, if you sell out, you sell out yourself.
[03:58:03.804 --> 03:58:04.605]  Absolutely.
[03:58:04.605 --> 03:58:06.408]  And by the way, that's not even attacking gay people.
[03:58:06.408 --> 03:58:07.509]  That's a historical fact.
[03:58:07.509 --> 03:58:08.510]  Ernst Röhm.
[03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:09.091]  It's a fact.
[03:58:09.091 --> 03:58:09.752]  Go look it up.
[03:58:09.752 --> 03:58:12.055]  I've read more than a hundred books.
[03:58:12.055 --> 03:58:13.037]  Order of the Deathshead.
[03:58:13.037 --> 03:58:17.163]  I mean, we're talking about Shearer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[03:58:17.163 --> 03:58:18.504]  I mean, these are Pulitzer Prize winners.
[03:58:18.504 --> 03:58:19.526]  This is not...
[03:58:20.427 --> 03:58:23.350]  But we're out of time, and I apologize to the last callers.
[03:58:23.350 --> 03:58:24.311]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:58:24.311 --> 03:58:25.732]  I'll get you on.
[03:58:25.732 --> 03:58:26.713]  Great job with the crew.
[03:58:26.713 --> 03:58:30.856]  Again, bankers are destroying the global economy by design to consolidate power.

[03:58:51.998 --> 03:58:54.321]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:58:54.321 --> 03:58:56.723]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:58:56.723 --> 03:58:59.926]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:58:59.926 --> 03:59:05.030]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:09.234]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:59:09.534 --> 03:59:11.876]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:59:11.876 --> 03:59:14.757]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:59:14.757 --> 03:59:17.679]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:59:17.679 --> 03:59:25.284]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:59:25.618 --> 03:59:31.003]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:59:31.003 --> 03:59:33.326]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:59:33.326 --> 03:59:37.550]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:38.611]  And I got news for you.
[03:59:38.611 --> 03:59:39.972]  You're everyone else.
[03:59:39.972 --> 03:59:41.453]  Invisible Empire.
