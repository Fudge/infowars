[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  It's Wednesday, August 4th, 2021. We're live.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  You may not even stand up in the Info War and say,
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:43.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  The President called on states and local governments to use funding
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan,
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  If financial incentives like these help us get more shots in arms,
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  we should use them.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  Do you want to see those entities pass a vaccine mandate?
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Well, I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction,
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  and that's why I've pointed out, I had asked the Justice Department
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  to determine whether they're able to do that legally, and they can.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  Local communities can do that, local businesses can do that.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  the whole country. I don't know that yet.
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.000]  The British government officially warns that 2.6 billion people
[01:32.000 --> 01:43.000]  may die as a result of the mutations coming from the so-called COVID-19 vaccines
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  that are really just genetically modified injections.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  And everybody from the Washington Post to CNN to Fox News to the Wall Street Journal
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  to Bill Maher saying the vaccines don't work,
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  and the majority of people sick and majority of people in hospital,
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  majority of people dying, have had their COVID injections,
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  and I've got the government statistics from Israel, from Singapore,
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  from the UK, from Canada, from the United States,
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  from all the countries around the world.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  A member crimson contagion that we covered four or five months ago
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  that got millions, 10 million views or so,
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  General Flynn said it was the best work he'd seen on COVID.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Here's the thing, in this whole thing, this whole document,
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  they have their disclaimer, and at the end they go,
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  the infectious pathogens, medical countermeasures,
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  characters, new media experts, blah, blah, blah,
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  are hereby described, are entirely fictional.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  They say it's entirely fictional, but when we show you how it relates
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  in the real world scenario, you're going to be blown away.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media,
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  suggesting that the virus had been purposely created
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  and introduced to the population by drug companies,
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  or that it had escaped from a government lab secretly testing bio weapons.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  This is in 2017, right after Fauci says a virus will be released,
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  it's going to happen, it's going to challenge Trump,
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  it's going to be a surprise operation.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  The war game from three and a half years ago,
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  put out by the Rockefellers and others,
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  saying they would inject people with this vaccine,
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  everybody would get sick,
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  and then out of that would collapse civilization.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  We discover that almost all of the different types of mammals
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  that they injected with similar vaccines
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  that target spike proteins on coronaviruses,
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  that in almost every case the animals die
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  within a few months of being given the injection.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  And it can be extrapolated out that humans
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  in the physiological differences would die in a few years.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  That's how Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and so many other
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  respected medical doctors came on this show
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  and said you will see antibody-dependent enhancement
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  by the first fall and winter after the injections,
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.000]  and now it's already beginning.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Have antibodies to the spike proteins,
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  which will probably be around forever.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  The antibodies themselves can attack your lungs,
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  your kidneys, and your livers and cause autoimmune disease.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  And it turns out they knew from hundreds of prestigious studies
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  and government initiatives.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  University of Texas wasn't studies,
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  it was a four-year initiative of seven universities
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  led by the University of Texas,
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  where they gave all sorts of spike protein vaccines
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  for coronaviruses to rats, ferrets of their animals.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  And some rats lived, none of the ferrets lived.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  This is all a test to see what they can do to you.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  Just like they said six months ago,
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  oh, it's a rare heart condition, a rare blood clot in the brain,
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  a rare stroke.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  No, it's in the majority of people,
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  because it starts growing protein crystals.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  You don't have a virus.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  You get given protein crystals,
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  that's what the spike protein is,
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  and your body starts growing it.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  And in every case they've done this,
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  it kills the lab animals, the vast majority.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  They knew what they did,
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  like if you poured a gallon of gasoline on yourself,
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  let it soak in and then struck a match what's going to happen.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  You're going to burn to death.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell,
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  that I've ever done.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  I'm having a cybersupposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  on my new platform, frankspeech.com.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  to go to frankspeech.com now.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  To help support this cybersupposium event,
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  but they're only offered at frankspeech.com.

[06:00.000 --> 06:06.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  Well, so does he.
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  First night, though, we're continuing to follow the business
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  of the big brother, Alex Jones.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000]  First night, though, we're continuing to follow the bizarre
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  and very fast-changing guidance on COVID from the White House.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  Remember when they told you the last administration was incompetent?
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  We've never seen anything like this.
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  It's beyond belief.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  It was just a week ago that Rochelle Walensky of the CDC did her best
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  to terrify all of us over the new Indian strain of COVID.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  Walensky described the so-called Delta variant as, quote,
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  one of the most infectious respiratory diseases we know of
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  and that I have seen in my 20-year career.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  An internal CDC document summed it up in martial terms, quote,
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  the war has changed, wrote the CDC.
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  In response to those horrifying developments,
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  the administration immediately re-implemented indoor mask mandates
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  even for people who've been fully vaccinated.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  That was enough to get even the deeply incurious American news media
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  asking questions.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  Wait a second.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  If the vaccines work, why the masks?
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  So they started digging and they didn't have to dig much.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  On Friday morning, the Washington Post ran this headline, quote,
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  vaccinated people made up three-quarters of those infected
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  in a massive Massachusetts COVID-19 outbreak,
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  pivotal CDC study finds, end quote.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  New York Times ran a similar piece. Again, it was based on numbers
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  from the CDC.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  And yet just minutes after those articles appeared,
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  the White House panicked.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  A senior member of its COVID-19 response team,
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  a man who is not a doctor but instead a career flag called Ben Wanaka,
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  jumped on social media to attack the media
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  and, in fact, attack the administration's own scientists.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  Here was Wanaka's message to the New York Times on Twitter over the weekend.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  He wrote it in all caps as if he was shouting, quote,
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  vaccinated people do not transmit the virus at the same rate
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  as unvaccinated people.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  And if you fail to include that context, you're doing it wrong.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  He barked.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  He went on to call the Washington Post coverage of it irresponsible
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  and he added this, quote, let's be clear.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  If 10 vaccinated people walk into a room full of COVID,
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  about nine of them would walk out of the room with no COVID, nine of them.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  But is that true?
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  Ben Wanaka, the one who was not a doctor but instead a flag,
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  did not provide a citation for that statistic.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  And, in fact, judging by the CDC's own numbers,
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  it appears to be wrong.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  In other words, it is classic misinformation,
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  possibly Russian in origin.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  And yet, strangely, Ben Wanaka, who knows much less about science
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  than, say, Alex Jones, was not banned from the Internet.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  He just kept tweeting.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  And then a few hours later, he got backup support
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  from Rachelle Walensky herself.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  The vaccine works, Walensky shouted.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  In fact, it works so well, you may soon be forced to get it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.000]  Are you for mandating a vaccine on a federal level?
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  You know, that's something that I think the administration is looking into.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  It's something that I think we're looking to see approval of from the vaccine.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  Overall, I think in general, I am all for more vaccination.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  But, you know, I have nothing further to say on that,
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  except that we're looking into those policies.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  And quite honestly, as people are doing that locally,
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  those are individual local decisions as well.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  So we're looking into a federal vaccine mandate.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  But then just minutes after she said that,
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Rachelle Walensky went on Twitter to take it back.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  Quote, to clarify, there will be no nationwide mandate.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  I was referring to mandates by private institutions
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  and portions of the federal government.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  And quote, but of course, that's not at all what she said.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  She said, we're looking into a federal mandate nationwide.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  And that's how the psychology works of these people, as they say.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  We're going to phase it in and then bring in a mandate
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  and have a World ID card system.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  And then when you say, I don't want to do it,
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  well, then it doesn't exist and you're crazy.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  So they announce it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  You say, we don't want it. I don't want that.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  They go, you're crazy. No one's doing that.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  It's like, hey, countries with 95, 99% vaccination rate
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  have the highest rates of dead from COVID.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  And almost everyone in the hospital has had the shot.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  The shot's doing it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  And they just take you off Twitter or Facebook or YouTube.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  And you show the foreign newspaper headlines,
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  which then weeks later end up being here,
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  but it's still bizarre because you talk to friends and family
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  that don't believe you. It's happened to me.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  And they just go, Alex, I'm talking about cousins,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  people like that. Alex, they wouldn't be pushing this
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  if it was really going to hurt people. Come on.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  And I'm like, let me just show you.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  No, I don't want to look at it. Okay?
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  I haven't had one family member who got very ill
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  off the first shot.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.000]  And I said, don't take the second one.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And they said, don't get in my business
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  and won't talk to me now.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  You talk about like the Civil War where you'd have
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  brother against brother back in the 1860s here.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  Well, that's the same story here now.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Or this is a spiritual choice people are making.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  Let me raise something here that we've talked
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  quite a bit about, but hasn't gotten any attention.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  And then I think could bring this whole house of cards down.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  And it's this right here. This is a small stack.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  COVID vaccines causing cancer.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  And it's all mainstream news.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  Them telling you, okay, listen, in your lymph nodes,
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  your uterus, your ovaries, your testicles,
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  your breasts, the vaccine, which isn't a vaccine,
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  does cause tumors to grow.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  And they may tell you that they're malignant,
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  but just don't go to the doctor for six months.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  Or if the doctor says it's cancer, late six months.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  Now I'm going to show you official CDC guidance
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  that when your doctor says you've got tumors,
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  malignant, you know, the ones that eat you alive,
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  not benign, just don't worry about it.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  I mean, it's all just a test of how many of us they can kill.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  And can they come squat at your dinner table
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  and take a dump in front of you
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  and tell you it's chocolate ice cream.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  And then piss in your face and tell you it's lemonade.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  I mean, it's hard to use the gross analogy,
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  but this is ridiculous.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  And I can open the phones up and say,
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  just call in if you're 80
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  and you started having menstrual cycles again.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Or just call in if you had emergency surgery
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  because a huge tumor grew in your uterus
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  a month after you hit the shot.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  We'll load the phones.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Just tune in if you got breast cancer.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  They did emergency surgery on you and it was malignant.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  We'll have full phone lines
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  because I know people personally
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  whose wives had to have emergency surgery after they took the shot.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  I know people personally whose testicles swole up so big
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  they had to have emergency surgery.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  I know people personally that were told they had lymphatic cancer
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  two weeks after they took the shot
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  and they told them the shot, get it!
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  I know people personally
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  that have had big fat heart attacks
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  who were only 40-something years old
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  and had no heart problems after they took it
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  and they admit it doesn't!
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is gas lighting.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I have a whole stack of young people dead and dying
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  and heart attacks, 15-year-old boys you name it
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  after they take the shot.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And they admit, oh, it can cause that.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  So the main effect is growing protein crystals
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  that will kill you over the next five years or so, maybe less.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  We're going to find out, but that's what all the scientists say.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  See, that's the thing. It's like all the scientists.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  They go, oh, trust the science.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Like all the major scientists go, don't do this.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  It's going to grow protein crystals
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  and it's going to attack the body
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  and it's going to cause heart attacks
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  and it's going to cause strokes and it's going to grow tumors.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  I mean, what do you think happens when they put
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  a program in your body to have your cells
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  all start producing a spike protein?
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  I mean, what do you think?
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's the spike protein that makes you sick.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  And I guess it grows cancer like sunshine and rain
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  and good soil grows plants.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  And we've had all these scientists
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  and all these doctors on explaining it to you
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  and they predicted it all and now it's here.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  So I've got this stack of news.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  I had a bunch of other news first, but anybody can research this
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  or anybody can just talk to your neighbors.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  People have gotten the shots.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  89-year-old women having menstrual cycles
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  and now they want to give it to all our children
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  and it turns out they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  with the White House directing it
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  with state, local and federal international money
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  to target now teenagers and below 12
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  getting ready for authorization for that under emergency use.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  So now it's not enough to kill all the old people
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  and people dumb enough to use it.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Now it's not enough to coerce everybody
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  and say you got to take it or you can't go into a restaurant
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  or have a job or a grocery store.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  Now they're going to target people below the age of consent
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  and California passed the law.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  They can give 12-year-olds the vaccine
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  without even getting authorization,
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  which isn't a vaccine.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  It's a gene modification system.
[15:57.000 --> 16:21.000]  Yep, the future's here.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  Frankspeech.com.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  to go to Frankspeech.com now.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  To help support the CyberSupposium event,
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  on my pillow products,
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  but they're only offered at Frankspeech.com.
[16:46.000 --> 16:58.000]  Thank you and God bless.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  the truth is they've had to come out in the open
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  So as bad as these times are,
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  and a lot of negative things are about to happen,
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  realize humanity is winning.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  That is invincible.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God,
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  to lead God and direct your soul,
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  and then take action against the globalists and realize,
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  We will never back down from the globalists,
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  and we will never surrender.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  in the background, and I made the point that,
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  hey, the cavalry is here, but it's really true.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  Listeners are incredible,
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  and when we're able to keep these great products in stock,
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  we're able to fund ourselves last year
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  that we've been in because I expanded so much
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  for the 2020 election.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  But thanks to you, we're still on air.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  But now because of the shutdown in production
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  and because of slowdowns with the whole COVID lockdowns
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  with the supply chain, a lot of our best-selling products
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  have not been available for months and months and months.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  Some for six months, some have been discontinued.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  But the cavalry is here now in our funding
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  because a lot of these products are finally coming back in.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  Prostagard, Vaso Beats, Alpha Power,
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  and of course, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  are all in our top 10 best-sellers.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  Our second best-seller is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  95% for secret humanoids.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  It is back in stock right now, 50% off at mforestore.com.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  So really, you are the cavalry
[18:57.000 --> 19:11.000]  when you order these products at mforestore.com.
[19:27.000 --> 19:46.000]  Now, the top-rated music talks about the chemtrails.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  Now, the top-rated podcasts sound like the Alex Jones show.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  Now, Tucker Carlson says Alex Jones knows science
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  better than the White House.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  What's that really about?
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  It's about people signaling they know the truth.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  It's about people signaling they want to live.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  It's about people signaling they're not going to be part of the big lie.
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  It's about coming together.
[20:10.000 --> 20:13.000]  It's not about following Alex Jones.
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  It's about awakening.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  It's about using our minds together in a family of truth,
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  in a family of understanding,
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  in a family of love for our species,
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  and for the truth,
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  a family that loves truth.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Let me show you who doesn't love truth.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Overhead shot, please.
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  There are few people that have as evil accountants as this woman.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  And everything that comes out of her mouth
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  is calculated gaslighting to enslave and oppress
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  and overturn every hard-fought liberty that humans have.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  CNN media analysts, they don't tell you
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  globalist, eugenicist, former head of Planned Parenthood,
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Bill Gates Acolyte,
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  post-humanist, CNN medical analyst.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  We can't trust the unvaccinated.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  Lena Nguyen.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  And just look at her.
[21:12.000 --> 21:19.000]  She's like a coiled snake, a viper.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  A true monster.
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.000]  I wouldn't want to be her when she faces the creator.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Here's another one.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  Australian MP says unvaccinated people need to be controlled
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  and restricted.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  Same all over the world.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  Oh, nobody's going to restrict anybody.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  Jennifer Aniston Ripp, Sandy Vaxers,
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  says they have moral duty to identify themselves.
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  Yes, so maybe wear a yellow star on ourselves,
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  identify that we didn't take the experimental Nuremberg
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  violating injection, that the majority of people sick
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  and dying have taken the shot.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  She does what she's told.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  Jennifer Aniston, when she's not starring in Leprechaun
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  or done on friends, because nobody has real friends,
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  they sit and watch, simulated friends,
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  she's going to tell us all about our medical world
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  and our personal life.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  Hey, how about it's my body, Bimbo?
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  You shut up.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  How about we come protest at your house?
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  You want to identify us?
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Stop stalking us, Hollywood.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  Get out of our lives.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Look at this monster.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Everything we see in Australia is coming here.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  The same health minister last week that said,
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  don't talk to your neighbors.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Remember today the minister said,
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  we're going to keep lockdown in forever.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  When anybody talking to each other unauthorized,
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  you might spread this info.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  I mean, the cult's out in the open.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  Australian health official tells grandparents,
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  don't go anywhere near your grandkids.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  They've had 10 deaths this year, they claim of COVID.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  And they say, if there's ever one, they'll shut down.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  No matter how many people it stars and death
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  or commit suicide, it's all martial law.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  Australia's just gone back to being a total prison colony.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  But you know, when it was a prison colony,
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.000]  if you worked hard all week in the fields,
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  they'd let you walk around on the woods
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  or go to the beach a little bit on Saturday before Sunday.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  Of course, you got locked up at night at the penal camps
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  just because you were poor from Ireland or Scotland or England.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  But they're just right back to the penal colony they were.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Great people in Australia.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  We ought to open the phones up.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  In fact, let's do this.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  I'm going to do this.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  Let's open the phones up because we've got a bunch of big activists.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  We've got a big activist helping lead the fight.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Well-known actor and activist.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  I ran for mayor in London.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  I'm friends with Paul Joseph Watson.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  We've got a special guest joining us next hour.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  It's part of these big, giant rallies.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  And we've got Chris Sky leading the fight,
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  rallying us to lockdowns, also joining us.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  Even more of his predictions have come true.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  But let's intersperse throughout all this.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  Your calls. Let's start out with the first round.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  Haulers from Australia. Please, no one else call.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  I know it's the middle of the night in Australia,
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  but a lot of you are still up.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  How are you liking the second endless lockdown?
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  The helicopter is telling you you can't go to the beach.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  People being beat up and arrested at their houses
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  because they're trying to organize criticism against the lockdown,
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  which is a political move.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  How dare you want to get out of prison?
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  At least in prison, you can petition the Congress
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  or petition the courts, petition the warden.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  You don't even allow the petition.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  Just shut up and stay in your house while we put you on welfare
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  and then all the resources dry up.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Almost all these people are communist leaders.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  Australian health officials tell grandparents,
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  don't go anywhere near your grandkids.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  Video clips, planfullwars.com.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  New state of segregation.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Vaccine cards are just the beginning,
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  and in New York, they particularly target black people.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  Oh, because you're more at risk, they say,
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  so they're going to be even meaner to you.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  Tough love.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  Rand Paul says the NIH director's stupid
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  after he called a wear mask at home.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  Well, the cult's always got to expand the power.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Senator introduces legislation to mandate voter ID
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  for states that mandate vaccine passports.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Oh, the left says that can't happen.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  Texas judge blocks governor's order halting transport
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  of COVID positive illegals to be let go onto the streets
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  saying not letting them go on streets spreads COVID.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  You're like, that's not true.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  No, read the ruling.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  Says not letting them go spreads COVID.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  Just like, remember, they said,
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Black Lives Matter marching stopped COVID.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  Anyone else marching spreads COVID.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  Associated Press reports.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  You're like, that's not logical.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  They want to murder logic.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  They want to get you used to not having logic.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  There you go.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Biden confronted allowing untested
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  and unvaccinated illegals into the U.S.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  And it goes on and on.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  But first, let's get to the admitted Marxist-Leninist
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Mayor de Blasio.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  And here he is saying, oh, yes, it is a mandate.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  So again, though it's never going to be a vaccine mandate,
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  even though it's going in all the world,
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  there's never going to be a tracker pass,
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  even though Klaus Schwab said five years ago,
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  we're going to use the threat of a virus
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  to bring in a World Government ID card
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  that will be standardized under the U.N.,
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  they'll then wear on your clothes,
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  then it'll be a face scanner, a hand scan,
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  and then it'll be an implantable chip.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  And they'll run the show.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  But when we say, hey, we don't want that word,
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  oh, the ADL, some of them probably lost it,
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  and it says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  That's code word for racism.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  The new terrorism policy, it says.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Protesting lockdowns is terrorism.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's white supremacy.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  And protesting election is you're not allowed to do it
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  because they're liberals and you're free.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  So I think we should all shut up and do what they say
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  and let them put handcuffs on us
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  and put us in the back of the van
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  and put us in that dungeon will be much safer
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  if we don't fight back.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  Here is the mayor saying the first in the nation policy,
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  not a law requiring COVID vaccination.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  So today I announced a new approach
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  which we're calling the key to NYC pass,
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  the key to New York City.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  When you hear those words, I want you to imagine the notion
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  that because someone's vaccinated,
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  they can do all the amazing things
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  that are available in this city.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  Let's stop there. It gets a lot worse.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  So in Israel, wearing a bracelet that tracks you
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  in GPS is called a freedom pass.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  It was going to be called the Excelsior pass.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  But people don't want the Excelsior pass.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  No, that's not Stan Lee's Excelsior.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  Now it's the key to the city
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  with him smiling like a demon,
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  like the Joker is the mayor of New York.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  Haha, kids, you drink this, you'll feel great.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  Yeah, take this shot.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  I'm a commie.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  America's mine.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  I'm going to explain something really important when we come back.
[27:47.000 --> 27:57.000]  We'll see you in a few others.
[28:17.000 --> 28:27.000]  We'll see you in a few others.
[28:47.000 --> 29:03.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  by the lies we are told.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  is with our higher senses,
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  and shuts down its natural functions,
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye,
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  also described as the seat of the soul.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  will keep your drinking water fluoride-free
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  and the procure shower head will seal the deal.
[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  The entire new world water system is about making you feel pathetic,
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  making you feel weak,
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  making you play the part of a victim
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  And the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  Being given free will, being given consciousness
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  the beauty of music,
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  the fact that you can commune with that
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  and resonate with that is energetic
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL,
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  don't worship all the things in the system
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  and appreciate your consciousness
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:28.000 --> 31:38.000]  Evil always launches its attack.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  And it always looks like it's winning in the beginning.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  But soon the tide turns and good comes out on top.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  If we take action and cry out to God to lead God and direct us,
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  we are unstoppable.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  All right, my friends,
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  let me get back to the creature,
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  the admitted Marxist-Leninists, they all are.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  In fact, there's now mainline articles going,
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  have you noticed all the people running the lockdowns worldwide are Marxist?
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  And why suddenly are they in power everywhere?
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  And why are megabanks funding them?
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  Well, megabanks funded the Bolshevik Revolution.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  It's an elite attack on the people telling the people it's grassroots.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  It's the opposite.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  And you ask, well, what's it going to do to New York?
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  And what's it going to do to L.A. and San Francisco
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  and all these cities that are already collapsing
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  when they're jacking up taxes even more, regulations even more?
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  I couldn't afford to live in New York.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  And I'm not that rich, but I got some money.
[32:44.000 --> 32:49.000]  And I've been there and seen what, like, tiny apartments I couldn't pay for.
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  How do people live there?
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  And now they're just stacking all of this stuff up on top of it
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  and saying, if you want to have a business,
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  if you want to go in a grocery store, if you want to go at the mall,
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  if you want to go on a bus, you've got to show a New York City pass
[33:08.000 --> 33:13.000]  that's a part of this global UN slash Bill Gates system,
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  this affiliated program with a QR code of your medical record,
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  and then they're going to always say more shots, more shots,
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  and you don't see that database as a danger when they admit
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  it's about a world ID and a world social credit score
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  and the backbone of the entire control system.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  On a scale of 1 to 10, when you're carrying a little computer around
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  and be able to go in stores or get on a bus
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  and you've got a show and ID to do it,
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  with your medical records, you've got to take an experimental shot
[33:42.000 --> 33:49.000]  in their own literature, massively contributing to health issues.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  This ain't like smoking a few packs of cigarettes.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  This is like smoking cigarettes for 30 years when you take a shot.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  This is like getting hit by a truck.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  We know it's premeditated and these people are going to line up
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  because metaphysically they need you to at least agree to it,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  even if it's coerced.
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  Again, I'm somebody that knew this was coming.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  I'm somebody that is not easy to push around.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'm pretty pigheaded, pretty donkey-like,
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  and I'll be honest with you, I'm pretty scared.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  And by scared, I mean, I'm freaked out for my family, for you, for everybody.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  I'm not scared of the enemy and I'm not going to back down,
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  but I am scared for humanity.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  I mean, I am legitimately shook up bad.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  And I don't know how anybody on the enemy side carrying the crime out would feel,
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  because that's why I'm scared. I'm scared of God.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  I'm scared of separation from God and I look in the mirror a lot
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  and I think you're not doing enough, Jones.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  Even though I'm doing everything I can do, my conscience tells me I should do it more
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  because there is no words that can describe how evil this is.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  This is bad.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  And we need to see what Tucker Carlson's doing, duplicate it.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  And I don't tell this story before I play this clip to just go look how great Alex Jones is.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  But even if they kill me or put me in prison, this is a big satisfaction point
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  in success and completion of the mission.
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  If I could wake up Tucker Carlson,
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  and Tucker's told me face-to-face, he'll credit it with me with helping wake him up to a great extent,
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  he's a super smart guy.
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.000]  Once he shifted his awareness and became cynical, then he sees even more than I do, you understand?
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  And he's more eloquent in many ways.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  But I woke up countless others, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  This show has, and that means you have by supporting us,
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  and that means you can go out and wake others up who will be powerful forces for good against this evil
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  and then my job will be complete.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  In fact, we're very close to converting even more major thought leaders
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  and even if I disappeared at this point, I think I could say my main mission,
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  and I know God's other missions for me and I intend to keep going on,
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  but I do feel a great feeling of completion.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  There's so many people that get it now that it's kind of like a three-stage rocket booster,
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  and the third stage broke away and we made it into orbit,
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  and we made the orbit where we wanted to make the orbit,
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  and I just want to look back at the last 27 years and salute the listeners,
[36:29.000 --> 36:36.000]  salute all the supporters, salute my parents and my family and all of you that made this possible,
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  because I think it's important in all this negativity and all these bad things happening
[36:40.000 --> 36:47.000]  to pause for a moment and to really take stock of the fact that info wars delivered the goods,
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  and that means everybody that's worked here, everybody that's supported,
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  that means the crew, the host, everybody putting up with me.
[36:55.000 --> 37:03.000]  You guys did this, and I just think you should know that the enemy did not hit us flat-footed,
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  and because we did this, they're in a lot of trouble right now,
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  and I have no doubt they're going to make me pay severely for this.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's okay, because I didn't want to live a life of serving evil,
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  I didn't want to live a life of being another man's minion,
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  I didn't want to live a life on my knees, but on my feet,
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  and I can just tell you though that I can metaphysically feel a major disturbance
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  in the forces they would say, and things are about to get very, very dangerous and very, very bad,
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  because the enemy is losing badly right now.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And I feel very, very sad actually for a lot of their little scared minions
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  that wanted power, not because they were evil, a lot of them, but because they were scared little men,
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  and I think now they realize they've signed on to something very evil.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  I mean for all of you that pushed the force inoculations and all the lies,
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  I mean you are mass murderers now, I mean you have really killed a lot of people,
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  and what do you think is going to happen when you metaphysically already cross one big flaming line
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  on your road to perdition?
[38:02.000 --> 38:09.000]  There's one more line that when you cross it and you target people that are not of the age of consent
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.000]  with drugs or sex or corruption, evil, that God really, and in every other culture,
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  the Greeks said the most important thing you could do was corrupt the young.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  I mean humans have this written on our heart.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  You're now going after two-year-olds, these liberal parents are signing waivers
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  and giving experimental shots to their two-year-olds and one-year-olds,
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  and many are dying, I have that right here in the articles,
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  and the families say it's worth it for science when their kids die.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  This is the same as sacrificing your children to an idol.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  And so history is repeating itself and now they want to bully and come in
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  and bully the children and bully the parents to target children with this.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  It's one thing if you pressure somebody with their job and do that, that violates the Nuremberg code,
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  that's evil, that's wrong.
[38:56.000 --> 39:04.000]  But it's something entirely different when you target young children.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  And that's the final line, the ultimate sin.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  And all I am is a sign on the way to hell, flipping here in the wind.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  Like a tree with a tree branch with a sign hanging off saying this way is your damnation.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  And there's the sign just swinging on the wind.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  Turn back now, it's creaking on the wind.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  Turn back now, you need to turn back right now, doom is down that road.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  Stop, stop now.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  But when you look at DeBlasio and you look at these other people,
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  you look at Governor Newsom and Governor of, oh she's so demonically possessed,
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  of Michigan just totally demoned out.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  I can't make the faces.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  I can't even let flow that energy through me to show it to you.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  But you don't want to talk about like a jack-o'-lantern lit up on Halloween.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  When you look at them and they start talking about,
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  you're going to have the key to the city.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  It's going to be so good.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  Just take the shot.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  Oh yes.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  And you, the liberals are like, I took it.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  I love it.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  Oh, they know it's evil.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  They know it's bad.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  They know they're giving up their humanity.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  They know they're self-harming.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  And they're harming you and they are getting off.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  I mean, Fauci is on all these children's TV shows.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  I was watching it this morning and I had to stop.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  I was getting so upset.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  I mean, I don't need that level of hate in my heart, you know.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  Look at that little garden gnome, that little demon.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And he's just sitting there.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  Yes, children will take it good for you.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  It's all safe.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  It's nice taking, oh, nice.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  Oh, it's so nice.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  And they've got these beautiful supermodel women.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  They're targeting little girls and little boys to take it.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  I mean, this is so sick to watch these demons put a beautiful goddess
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  on the end of a hook to lure children in
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  because children trust women.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  This historically, children can trust women.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Jacob in Ohio.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  Good, bro.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  Great last call, Eric.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  for the owner of the product.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  The XChicoop does wonders.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  Get off the fence. Get the product.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  Support the info war.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  It's an honor.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  Honored talk to you.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Awesome.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say,
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  I love the product.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  she loves it.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  And it helps with the bedroom.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  It definitely works.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  It's not a joke.
[41:52.000 --> 42:18.000]  Absolutely.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenesis Globalist
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  than HIV.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  and create autoimmune disorders.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  and would be non-lethal down the road.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[42:55.000 --> 43:24.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:25.000 --> 43:47.000]  I'm Anthony Fauci.
[43:47.000 --> 44:02.000]  I'm Anthony Fauci.
[44:02.000 --> 44:31.000]  I'm Anthony Fauci.
[44:31.000 --> 44:58.000]  I'm Anthony Fauci.
[44:58.000 --> 45:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  We are back live.
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  I've never been to Australia, but they wanted me to go there
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.000]  and give speeches.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  I know per Capitum on Alexa back before they got bought by
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  Amazon and they rigged it.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  We were number one for a political show in England.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  We were number four in Australia and number 20 in the U.S.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  So we're more popular in Australia.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  We've even been per Capita in the United States.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  But Australia was a penal colony.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  Part of the U.S. had penal colonies as well.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  They dumped a lot of prisoners in the U.S.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  So the U.S.'s history is very similar to Australia's.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  And I really love Aussies.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  But man, do they have an evil government out of control
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  and they are the model of lockdown, the model of oppression.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  They're telling Aussies all sorts of horrible things.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  A year ago, Aussies called in and said,
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  they're secretly arresting people and taking them to facilities
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  if they criticize the lockdown.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  I even had trouble believing it.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  We had like five calls in a row one day saying it.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  They sounded very credible.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  Months later, they were arresting people on TV
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  for protesting online.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  They come to their houses, arrest them.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  So it's true.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  And now that model is coming here.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  They're saying arrest people that put out this info
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  and criticize the lockdowns.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  It's happening in Germany.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  I mean, just a year ago, I was having trouble believing it.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  And then it happened and was confirmed.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  So I want to open the phones up.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  We have Lawrence Fox, who is a very successful actor.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  He's also a very successful leader against the lockdowns.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  And there's a big part of those giant protests you've been seeing
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  with hundreds of thousands of people marching each time.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  He's going to be joining us.
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  And while he's on with us, I'm going to take some calls from Australia.
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  And then I'm going to segue the calls from Europe and the UK and Canada
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  when Chris Sky is on in the third hour.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  It's all about activism.
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  It's all about standing up.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  It's all about calling the fraud out, calling for the rest of the globalists.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  So start giving the number out right now.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  And sometimes when I give the number out,
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  because it's the middle of the night right now in Australia,
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  2, 3, 4 in the morning, depending on which time zone,
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  sometimes we load the phones up, sometimes we get one or two calls.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  But regardless, we'll go to you.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Give us your take on what you're witnessing and what you're seeing.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  The toll free number is 877-789-2539.
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  877-789-2539.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  Dial your country code and 877-789-2539.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  Now, obviously some folks can't call in a 1-800
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  because they're on a digital phone line or whatever.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  That's fine. Call 01512-646-1776.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  01512-646-1776.
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.000]  01512-646-1776.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  And I'd love to hear what you think about the ongoing lockdowns
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  and being the epicenter of the globalist tyranny.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  10 deaths this year in seven months from COVID, they claim.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  Country completely locked back down. New Zealand says we won't allow one case.
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  And it's all based on a fraudulent PCR test.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  And the question is, why are they doing this?
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  Well, because the public is putting up with it.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  It's like Hawaii was overthrown and taken over by the U.S. government.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  It's not really a free state.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  They do stuff there. They don't get away with it anywhere else
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  because the public never learned the rights of U.S. citizens.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  And I don't get in people's business, native groups,
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  but I like the Hawaiians. They love me when I'm out there.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  They don't really like a lot of other people from outside.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  They love me because they know I'm against the system.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  And I've been invited to meet with some of their top actual chiefs and stuff.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  I was blown away when I found out who it was they wanted me to meet with.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  But I mean, I'd love to come help lead a rebellion there
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  and establish America in America.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  Because it's not the U.S. government that's enslaving people in Hawaii.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  It's the globalists that are enslaving us all.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  But I want to see everybody free.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  I want to see the Aussies free. I want to see the Hawaiians free.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  I'd love the Hawaiians to take back their islands and they can run it.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  And then we can have a free country.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  I want to save America, but man, the footage we've got all over the U.S.,
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  all over Europe, just beating women and children up,
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  riding people over with Clydesdale horses.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  I mean, it is just absolutely out of control.
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  This is just maximum tyranny.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  And now they say they want to arrest us.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  You know, beat a little girl. Look at that.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Hitting like a 12-year-old girl.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  In fact, take that down. I can't even look at it.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  That's Germany. Here's France.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  So we're going to cover all of that here today, 877-789-2539,
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  if you live in Australia, or we'll throw New Zealand in it, too.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  I know it's really bad.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  But then Canada and Europe in the third hour today.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  Now, before I go any further, let's finish up with de Blasio.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  Here's the admitted communist going,
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  you're going to get the key to the city when you take the shot.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  But with 70% of New York already injected,
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  47% of the U.S., notice they said,
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  oh, sorry, you still got to wear a mask.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  You got to take more shots now.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  Once they get you with that pass, that's not a key to the city.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  That's a ball and chain around your neck, around your body.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Them putting in your body what they want.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  I mean, think about that in context while this creepy looking dude.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  That again, if I was going to cast for a horror movie,
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  where a guy runs a bed and breakfast,
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  and he really eats the people and kills them that come to bed and breakfast,
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  I would hire him.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  I mean, he just comes off as ultra evil.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  So first, we're going to give you a hamburger.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  We're going to give you some fries, a donut.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  Now, we're going to let you go outside.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  We're going to let you go in businesses.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  We're going to track where you go, too, buddy.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Think about that.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  Just like that.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  The Holy Grail, the New World Order.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  So today I announced a new approach,
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  which we're calling the key to NYC pass,
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  the key to New York City.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  When you hear those words, I want you to imagine the notion that
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  because someone's vaccinated, they can do all the amazing things
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  that are available in the city.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  All the amazing things that Lee Laylee can do across the border.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  All this, let's start it over.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Imagine, it is imagining,
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  imagine you can do all these wondrous things
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  once you let Big Pharma put something in your body.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  Just imagine, start it over.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  So today I announced a new approach,
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  which we're calling the key to NYC pass,
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  the key to New York City.
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  When you hear those words, I want you to imagine the notion that
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  because someone's vaccinated, they can do all the amazing things
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  that are available in the city.
[51:27.000 --> 51:31.000]  This is a miraculous place, literally full of wonders.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  And if you're vaccinated.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  This is a miraculous place full of wonders, kids.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  Just let us put an experimental secret thing in your body
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  from the populationist, and it's going to be so much fun.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  If you're vaccinated, all that's going to open up to you.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  You'll have the key, you can open the door.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  But if you're unvaccinated, unfortunately,
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  you will not be able to participate in anything.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  This is so biblical.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  This is Mark of the Beast.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  If you can't open the door, you're a prisoner.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  So get out of the door, stick your arm out, and let us shoot you up.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  And look else, who runs it?
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  Former head of Planned Parenthood says you can't trust the unvaccinated.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  Lock them up, don't let them have food.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  How would you trust anybody like this maniac?
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  And now they confirm the majority of sick took the shot.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  The majority of the dying took the shot,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  and they're trying to suppress that desperately.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  He thinks he's so powerful, he can kill you.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  And he'll get away with it, continue.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  That's the point we're trying to get across.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  It's time for people to see vaccination as literally necessary
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  to living a good and full and healthy life.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  You know, everything they say to use a lie.
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.000]  So listen, you need to see it as essentially leading a good and full and healthy life.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  You understand, even though it means it destroys your immune system,
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  can hurt, you can kill you.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  You need to see it as that, and imagine that.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  Imagine you're going to be free, just take the shot,
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  even though all these idiots took the shot and they're not.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  Continue.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  The NYC Pass will be a first in the nation approach.
[53:01.000 --> 53:06.000]  It will require vaccination for workers and customers
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  in indoor dining, in indoor fitness facilities,
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  indoor entertainment facilities.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  Then pause again.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  And that means tracking and control and databases expanded everything.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  I mean, this is the, again, the holy grail of evil, continue.
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.000]  Requirement, the only way to patronize these establishments indoors
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  will be if you're vaccinated, at least one dose.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  Let's stop again.
[53:28.000 --> 53:34.000]  They're also saying that even if you've already had the disease
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  or whatever, that can kill you to take a shot, you need to do it.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  They don't care about science or anything.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  So this is the violation of the Nuremberg Code,
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  and he is proud to announce he's the first one to do it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  He's the top Nazi.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  Continue.
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.000]  For folks in terms of work, they'll need at least one dose.
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  This is crucial because we know that this will encourage a lot more
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  vaccination.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  We've seen it already.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  We've seen the impact of the mandate we've put in place for city workers.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  Already.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  That's enough.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  These are the people that sent folks with the flu and with pneumonia
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  into nursing homes to get high death rates.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  This is a mass murderer.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  This man is a communist.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  This man is the enemy of humanity.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  And there goes New York.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  These are globalist enclaves, globalist colonized zones.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  They're going to run all the Americans out of them, no matter what color you are,
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  if you still believe in freedom, and then bring in new third world slaves
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  to then expand the colonization of the rest of the country.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  This is a scientific plan, and these are just ultra-evil people.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  I saw him three years ago when he first got in.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Bragg at the UN, how they were going under UN control in New York,
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  and they had a big celebration.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  They had tears in their eyes.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  This is insane.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  Please remember we have a new big sale going.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's only going for one week, and then it will end.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  It's the Info Wars Limited Supply Flash Sale.

[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  That ends this week.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  We are the resistance.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[55:42.000 --> 56:10.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[56:10.000 --> 56:35.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[56:35.000 --> 56:42.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[56:42.000 --> 57:11.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[57:11.000 --> 57:40.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[57:40.000 --> 58:09.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[58:09.000 --> 58:38.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[58:38.000 --> 59:07.000]  We'll be back with our number two with your calls and a special guest.
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.000]  Here's a very important report that I wanted to get to.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  And let's go ahead and roll that report and we'll be right back.
[59:19.000 --> 59:27.000]  Just like we need to be unified nation in response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  Now I know the infrastructure deal that they're talking about and Manchin said they're going to introduce it today.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  They're going to bring out the language is obviously a lot smaller than you wanted a lot smaller than a lot of your fellow progressives wanted.
[59:36.000 --> 59:44.000]  It still does include things that you like, including funding for electric vehicle charging stations, public transit, clean water systems, broadband, more.
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  When it comes before the House, as it looks like will happen, will you vote for it?
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  We have to hold onto that bargain.
[59:51.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  If there is not a reconciliation bill in the House and if the Senate does not pass the reconciliation bill, we will uphold our end of the bargain and not pass the bipartisan bill until we get all of these investments in.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  If you ask her, who's going to pay for all this? It's a fantasy.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  So we're in a situation right now where we're on the edge, I think, of significant inflation because the government's spending far more than it's taking in.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  It is putting dramatic inflationary pressure on the economy and every American will end up being poorer because of the policies of the left-wing Democrats.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  The Democrats infrastructure deal is merely the Green New Deal with another name.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  As The Washington Times reports, a slew of liberal priorities, including health care, climate change and anti-poverty initiatives, Democrats also plan to push for amnesty for illegal immigrants and new mandates,
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  raising out fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas from the electrical grid. The fact that a bipartisan Congress is even considering the legislation is evidence that the legislative branch has finally reached the end of its usefulness to the American people.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  There are parties within our government that are well aware that advanced technologies exist, yet the United Nations climate change initiatives and Klaus Schwab's foreseeable cyber attacks will plummet humanity back into the Stone Age.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  It may look like business as usual, but the Democrats are preparing yet another dagger to plunge into the heart of America.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  But the biggest problem is Nancy Pelosi has said she's going to handcuff the two together. The real infrastructure with this spending monstrosity, which is reckless tax and spending.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  So just to be clear, this is a bill almost 3,000 pages long and you haven't seen much of it. You don't really know what's in there.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Well, we're still looking for the details of it. The parts I've seen that are concerning to me and I'm from Wyoming and energy state. Again, this is a bipartisan bill.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I have concerns about the energy component where the Democrats have insisted that the model for energy ought to be the California model.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Well, Maria, in California, electricity prices are the highest in the country. They have their ongoing blackouts. They have this approach that I think is not the right one for America.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  We have gone from an energy dominant nation now under President Biden. We're becoming much more energy dependent and I think it's the wrong direction to go.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  But in the end, the Democrats failed yet again as the New York Times reported the infrastructure package is far from the transformational package that President Biden had sought.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  The bill includes no mechanisms to immediately mandate the reduction of fossil fuel emissions.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  So Biden has predictably failed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which will not please his handlers who are eagerly implementing the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told. And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  In existence, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  You know, I tell the great producers of this show who I'd like to get on and then it just works out where a theme of particular show kind of forms itself without us even trying. And that's what today's broadcast is about, is about waking up to the prison being built around us and resisting it, not giving into it, not submitting.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  So we've got Lawrence Fox, who's helping lead with a lot of other great folks, a movement against the permanent emergency lockdown in the United Kingdom and Europe. And then of course we have Chris Skye, who's doing an amazing job coming up in the third hour in Canada and all over the world as well, really exposing the global plan for a permanent lockdown, just how draconian this is.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  And then I thought maybe in this hour, it's the middle of the night over there, give the number out to take a few calls from Australia, where they are the most oppressive that we've seen in the world other than North Korea, and really reverting back to a prison colony.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  And we've got Adam, James, Jamal, Brad, and others that have already called in from Australia middle of the night, so I will intersperse your calls with our guests. But Lawrence Fox is a well-known successful actor, not going to get into all the things he's done.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  But he's now a critic of political correctness and cancel culture, both on actual TV and social media, although he may be best known for playing James Hathaway in the British TV drama series Lewis from 2006-2015. He's also the founder and leader of the Reclaim Party in the UK.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  We keep up with everything Lawrence is doing at the Reclaim Party by visiting ReclaimParty.co.uk, or by following him on Twitter at LoZzaFox. And the Reclaim Party at Twitter as well, ReclaimParty.co.uk.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  We've seen some of the amazing big rallies they've had in Trafalgar Square in the hundreds of thousands. We see millions in Germany, millions in France, hundreds of thousands going out in Australia. Then they face-scan them, come back to their houses and beat them.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I mean, this Germany beating little kids, running over women with Clydesdale horses. I don't hate the police. I don't hate the military. But when it's not in our hands and it's unconstitutional, it becomes like North Korean military evil.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  And as a man, I'm not going to, like the IRA, go blow anything up or anything. I'm just saying, they're really crossing a Rubicon of violence here. So we should up the civil disobedience and the love and really get more aggressive but not play the violence game.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. I want to get your take on this. Lawrence Fox during this amazing period in human history.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Thanks so much for having me, Alex. Actually, yes, today has been a particularly dark day in England because what happens is the way the authoritarians play the game is that they release a poll from a company called YouGov, which was formed by the vaccines minister.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Ironic that, saying that everyone wants more vaccines, more lockdowns, more masks. And the government have now announced today that they're going to start jabbing children. And it's just utterly horrific. And I think the times of evil are coming upon us, actually.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  I have no other way of looking at this, experimenting on children for me is utterly, utterly disgusting.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Yeah, that for me is Joseph Mengele territory and really crosses a final line.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Absolutely, it does. And we're watching, the horribleness of it is we're watching it take place slowly. So we're slowly being strangled by this government.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  We don't, we don't have an opposition in the United Kingdom. Our opposition in the UK says, whatever the government do, yes, let's do that and more.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  So we live in a one party state, which is essentially we're living under a regime and authoritarian regime. Any semblance of democracy in the UK is finished. And now we're experimenting on our children. It's appalling.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  Boy, didn't Boris Johnson turn out to be a Trojan horse?
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Boris Johnson. The only thing Boris Johnson has is self serving. When Britain voted for Brexit, when we Boris Johnson wrote two letters, one in support of remaining in the European Union and one in support of leaving.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  The man has no backbones, no principles and no leadership skills whatsoever. So we're being led by a baby and a massively adulterous baby as well.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  He operates this country in the same way that he operated private life, which is a shambles and immoral disaster area.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Where to start because these are amazing roundlies. These speeches are so historical, but the mainstream media blocks them out for folks that don't know.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  I would say Europe, the UK, Australia is the epicenter of this tyranny announcing COVID passports, pushing all this.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  What's happening on the ground and what can you report to the world because what is happening in your country is obviously coming here next.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Well, the UK's biggest advertiser in the mainstream media to the tune of 180 million last year was the mainstream media.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  The government were the biggest advertiser on the mainstream media.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  So we have no reporting of the hundreds of thousands of people that stand against tyranny and for freedom.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  And the temperature within these rallies and these protest marches is getting more and more, is getting hotter.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  And the government think that they can ignore it and keep shoveling propaganda down the necks of us poor plebs while the establishment maintain their wealth.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And we're watching our currencies about to fall apart as well.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  So we're going to we're looking at the government are trying to thinking of trying to rush in a CBDC into the UK and that's going to fail as well.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Because the government couldn't even organize a test and trace out where we've got millions of people being told that they cannot go to work.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  So you you expect them to rebuild the currency with Rishi Sunak, our Chancellor of the Exchequer spent 400 billion pounds trying to keep every pay everybody off with a furlough scheme in the UK.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  And when that stops, something else will start and it's not going to be good.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Well, let's think big picture. You're a smart guy and I don't think I'm that stupid.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  The powers that be the multinational corporations know this destabilization is going to do what the great reset wants collapse things bringing universal income.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  So the politicians are following orders thinking, oh, we're just going to make people take shots, create an ID track and control the public.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  But really, like you said, they're starting a division in society that's going to form a giant black market economy and make people not follow any of the laws.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  I mean, if I wanted to end civilization, I would do what the UK government's doing right now.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Absolutely. They're making it impossible to do.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  The only people that don't consent usually within any population are the working people.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  They don't want to be told what to do.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  So whenever they get a chance to vote like Brexit, like Trump, they vote what they want to see.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And the establishment spend their time stamping that out and trying to tell us all what to think.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And I think people have just had enough now.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  The temperature is fibrile in London.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  London is a dead city.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  I mean, the cities across England are dead now.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  You barely see people walking around.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  The rural areas are much more lively and the mainstream media just ignore this.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  They think we're so stupid that if they keep shoveling us this propaganda paid for by the government, the government's own polling station paid for.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  A polling company is paid for that will somehow buy it.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  But people won't.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  The people now need to stand up and resist this because this is an overt.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  We're being overtaken by this power hungry, greedy, spineless regime.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Well, you know, I say the UK and places are the epicenter.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  What about Pakistan where whole regions are told we're going to turn your phone off if you don't come take the shot?
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  So hundreds of thousands in one town fled hundreds of thousands lined up this weekend to take the injections.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  I mean, it's so obvious that the more we accept the phone and the digital ID and the social credit score and the vaccine passport that that's when we're trapped.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  It's not like the mayor of New York says you'll have the key to the city.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  You'll be free.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  No, once I accept this, I won't be free.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Well, exactly in the north of England and in areas outside the lost parts of Britain, like London, they say cash is king and they live with paper money.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And that's how they operate.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And it is the way that they do it.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  It is it is it is inevitable that the only way that they can get a digital ideas via the vaccine passport, they're not going to stop.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And they won't stop even until they've started jabbing young children.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Unfortunately, I think for many, many, many, many people will be a red line and the government will find out that you can't suppress freedom.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  You can't do it.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  It doesn't work after a while.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  I mean, I physically am not looking for trouble, Lawrence.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  But when they start coming after little kids and I read about them dying in the test trials, I physically get mad at myself not doing more.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  So when we come back, tell us what they've announced in the UK concerning children. I'll tell folks what's happening here and around the world where they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars out of the gate with the White House coordinating it to hire influencers that your children subscribe to to tell them to demand the shot from your parents.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  So this is the Internet, just like a pervert online, but it's a corporate bureaucrat that your kid is signed up with suddenly going to start pushing them with an experimental shot that doesn't even protect them.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And that news, the majority of the people sick of taking the vaccine will cover it all with Lawrence Fox helping lead the way with the Reclaim Freedom Party over in the UK.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Stay with us. Your calls from Australia as well.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Thank you.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Thank you.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Bio septic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms. Visit thebio pros dot com today and protect your septic system. That's the bio pros dot com.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  The bio pros dot com.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Gerald of South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Johnson.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  So Boris Johnson after locking down the country for more than a year said, oh, you'll be free on this day and announced digital passports, controls, ongoing lockdowns, all of it on Freedom Day.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  So Lawrence Fox and others by the hundreds of thousands in London, a millions total in the country and all over Europe as well went out and have been protesting basically ever since.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And here's just a small sampling of that activism.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  And again, only way this gets out is you sharing it.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  I think it's quite clear that those that make the rules are following them and enough is enough. And I want to be open for all.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  It's here today because they've had enough of the government hypocrisy and double standards and the precedents that have been set for the conditions on our freedom.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  We are all utterly sick to death of the lies and the hopes of the government, the government corruption.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  And even if all of this ends tomorrow, which some people might think it will, the most important thing is that we establish that it can never happen again.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Because I don't want my children growing up with the threat of these restrictions looming over them.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  This lockdown has had a significant impact on people's mental health.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  If freedom may fight for freedom, for freedom of choice, freedom of movement, freedom to assemble, look at that. And I'm totally rigging. I'm just webbing, he said, I'm rigging.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  It's time for change. It's time for us, the people to stand up and say enough is enough. We're not tolerating this nanny state anymore and the people's voices do be good.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  That's what's happening in London today and this should be happening all across the UK, including Wales.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We are free. We are free. We are free. We are free. We are free.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Here we are on the tiny little march in London. See, the rules don't apply to the elites, apparently. That's the thing.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  The rules don't advise about handcuffs while he tracks and traces little ladies' consoles. But the rules still guide you up, apparently.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  Well, I'm sorry, but enough is enough. Today is freedom day, Boris. Today.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  All right. Lawrence is our guest. Lawrence Fox. You can go to the website, reclaimparty.co.uk. I want to get some calls from Australia and we'll go to those in a moment.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Brad and Adam and Jamel and Grant and others. I know it's the middle of the night over there and we appreciate them holding.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  But just getting back to this, a lot of hopes keep her missing their children, the children. Influencers are being paid by the government to shield COVID vaccines to children.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  New York Times reveals and brags. They're targeting children as young as five, telling them demand you get the vaccine.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  So this is the government in corporations literally trying to contact your children with an experimental, dangerous injection. This is war.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Absolutely. Even one of the doctors said today, he said, children want to choose to have this jab. It's like, that's not true.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Parents are there to look after their children and protect their freedoms and their rights for them. They're not there to be coerced by a government.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  It's appalling. They started off last week. They do the same thing every time they go. 16, 17 year old vulnerable children can be considered for the vaccine. That's changed today to any 16 and 17 year old.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And then that's changed today to now 12 to 16, 17 year olds who are vulnerable. And that will change to every single child until we jab a lot of you.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  And we have proved to you that this mass failed government public health experiment is that we can win and we will demand your compliance. Otherwise, we will destroy.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  And Lawrence, usually the UK is ahead of the U.S. Now for what, three months, they've been 12 and up. And I've got a whole stack of articles here.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Young people having heart attacks, many of them dying after they take it. Healthy children.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  I've been speaking to doctors about that. There's a huge risk of myocarditis in young people. And why would you put that? Why would you ever even risk a child's health on that?
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And I look at that March, Alex, and I remember that and the footage of that March. And these are good people. These are the good people in this country.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  The freedom loving people are people that keep fabric of society held together. And these people have been demonized and destroyed by our press and our government.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  And they are the people that are marching for others freedom.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  By the way, I'm not putting down football hoodlums because they get the bad end of the stick. A lot of times at least they'll fight when Islamic extremists are stabbing people.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  But I've looked at these crowds. These are not football hoodlums. These are a black, white, old, young, a British, very, you can tell, middle class, upper middle class, hardworking, working class.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  But these are normal people that do not go out and look for fights that are in the streets right now and are really angry.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  The people that were interviewed were middle class people, but the vast proportion of these people are working people and they are desperate.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  They've been abandoned by this government. They have nothing. And they will come out and they come out with such love.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  And the atmosphere is what you would expect in some of these crappy lefty festivals like Woodstock and Glass City.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Exactly. The real unity is there in this populism that they're calling right wing and racist and everything else. What do you make of other parts of the world and the demonstrations you're seeing there?
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  I mean, that's got to be heartening to you.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  It's heartening, but it's very worrying what you're seeing. The disproportionality, the behavior of the police, beating people, beating women, beating children around the head for non-compliance.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  And as we push further and further against these measures, they're going to be equal and opposite reactions to that.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  And the thing is, I don't think the states are going to stop. What's next? You have to have a job.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Also, then now when you're 25, you don't need two kidneys. You can have one kidney. The state need that kidney for somebody else. Where do we stop with this?
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  It's a medical theory. That was my next question. We see the police in Italy and France joining with the protesters.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  We see them attacking, particularly in Germany and Spain and the UK. Yeah, just shocking behavior. What's wrong with these police?
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  Well, I feel for the police in the UK. This particular process, which you're witnessing now, was actually attended by some pretty hardcore, crazy people.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  This was pretty bad, but a lot of the police who I speak to privately are on our side, but they also have jobs and they want to keep their jobs.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  That was my question. We see the police joining a lot of people around the world. That's got to scare the establishment.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  Yeah, the establishment should be scared because as they ramp up the pressure that we will ramp up our pressure in return.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And they will need to know we're not the ones that are going to be violent. But if you come anywhere near my child with a job, you'll meet me with a giant shovel.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  And you'll have to get past me first. And I think that I speak for many, many families across this country.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Ireland's not known for being compliant, but they're particularly compliant. What's going on there? I mean, it's really bad.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Ireland is having the same peculiar problem as Australia, almost. You saw Australia was the land of the sort of reckless rascal.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  But look at them. They are basically under martial law in Australia now. It's horrendous. It's a lie, though. It's a lie that we're all being told.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  And at some point, someone is going to say the emperor is not wearing any clothes. And that's going to be the moment.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  And then we have to think about what comes next. But this is horrendous what's been done to the people of this country.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  We're going to break in 30 seconds. We'll connect with calls from Australia. But why do you, Mr. Fox, think the establishment is at war with the people all over the world?
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  What is the point of them starting this war?
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  So they can keep their money and they can turn us all into their slaves and their plebs and they can give us our free universal basic income and we can be grateful for it and we learn no skills and we have no jobs and we never have any ambition.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  We do what we're told. They send our kibble to us to eat every day and we shut up and we do as we're told. That's what they want.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  That was a perfect 20 seconds. We want to come back and ask you the way out of this and how you see us trying to fix this non-violently when they're physically attacking us and putting a poisonous jab in us.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  And that's not begging a question. I don't want to be violent. They're going to win if we do that. I'm simply saying how do we respond to violence in a non-violent way and still keep our humanity and stop this?
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  We'll be right back with your phone calls from Australia. Stay with us.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job. They stole the election. We can't get down about that. We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed. They're scared. That's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  No we're a bunch of winners. They're trying to suppress us. Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening. Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.

[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this. Some people get about 8 hours. But people take this. People are taking sports. People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. You know, I know who Lawrence Fox is. He's been in some big movies and TV shows, but I really don't care about that. I like Lawrence Fox because he's engaged in fighting for my freedom and his freedom and his family's freedom.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  And that to me is what's important. I don't care if you're a movie star or whether you're an auto mechanic or a farmer, I don't care if your skin's brown or black or white or pink or red. If you want human justice and you want freedom, we're brothers and sisters together in this epic fight.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  But the Aussies have come through. We have a huge audience in Australia and I've been told don't even try to come to Australia over a year ago with a group that wanted to bring me there because I'm a troublemaker. So we need to see Australia free. We need to see the UK free. We need to see blue cities and states and the US free.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  Canada's still under a lockdown. They admit for political control. We need to see them freed. We're all in solidarity. We got Logan and Brad and Adam and Jamal and Grant. I'm going to go to you all in 60 seconds and we're going to keep Lawrence Fox with us here.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  But I thought it was important today while we had somebody on from the UK and somebody on from Canada and I'm here in Texas to show we're all facing the exact same attack because it's all directed by multinational corporations posing as our doctors, posing as our saviors, trying to bring in a world medical ID that they admit will be the social credit score.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  And so when the mayor of New York says this is your key to freedom, how creepy is that when it's not the key to freedom, he will hold the key to your change.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  Absolutely. I've just been on the break. Actually, someone just sent me a message from a media publication in England that said Lawrence Fox holds reprehensible pro freedom views.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  You know, now where are we? North Korea? When did Great Britain suddenly decided we wanted to be like China? When did this happen?
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Say that again. Say what you just said again because there was a tweet two weeks ago by the New York Times. The New York Times headline said groups chanting freedom and other anti government slogans.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  Same thing. So say that again.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  This is what it said. So this is the thing. It said Lawrence Fox says Neil Oliver, who is an absolute speaker of great truth in this country and speaks for many, many of the disaffected freedom lovers.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  Lawrence Fox says Neil Oliver speaks for us all with reprehensible pro freedom views. I mean, when did that happen?
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  When did the love of freedom and the love of personal autonomy and the desire and ability to look after your own life and the people you love make your own decisions about your life become reprehensible to these authoritarian bastards?
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  When did that happen? When was that acceptable? It's not acceptable to me ever.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  Wow. The crew just found that in 30 seconds. There is New York Times shouting freedom and other anti government slogans. Hundreds of Cubans.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  The Cubans are bad now. Took to the streets and cities around the country. So there even the New York Times is against Cubans that don't want to live under communism.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  They're against anybody who loves freedom. And this man, Neil, who you've got on your screen at the moment, has spent the last 48 hours being attacked for saying, I will sacrifice everything for your freedom.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  And he's being attacked by people.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  By the way, for those that don't know, I'm sure most people know Lawrence. I know you know this. When you're willing to sacrifice everything, you get everything.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  When you're willing to sell out, we lose everything. The attitude of battling down is what makes slaves. And I don't want to live in North Korea.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  No, I don't want to live in North Korea either. But unfortunately, they're bringing it in by proxy and by stealth in this country.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  And we need an organized, very organized political opposition to this because we don't have one. We live in a one party state where we're told what to do.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  And as much as I love the citizens coming together, I mean, well, we're now just organs of the state essentially, aren't we?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  But what we need is a very organized political opposition, which essentially is me at the moment.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  And I'm walking up and down the country and I'm driving up and down the country and I'm finding the best people in those areas.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  I should have said that up front as I've been following all the different groups. I know you're one of the main leaders of it.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  We should have pointed out one of the main leaders of the UK on the ground opposition. What type of harassment have any of you gone through?
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  There's a lot of other people I know that stick their heads up. They really come after them.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Oh, I mean, in the street, people come up to me. I've got people come up to me in tears saying, thank you.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  The street is a very different place from the social media platforms that represent, you know, this is where cowards go to hide in their mothers.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Exactly. So you have the alternate universe of social media where you're a bad guy, but on the street everybody loves you.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Well, it's not it's not love, but they're grateful that someone is saying it, you know, and I'm not I'm not.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Well, when I say love, they love themselves. I mean, there's a there's a love of freedom.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Absolutely. They're the best in every society and they keep every society upheld. The people that fight to defend your freedom.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  That's the people that you know. Absolutely. All right, let's go to calls here.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Ride shotgun with us, Lawrence Fox. Let's talk to Logan and then we'll talk to Jamal, Brad, Adam and Grant.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Appreciate you all from the great land down under now following the tyranny.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Logan, tell us what it's like in the endless lockdown.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  You know, the people spirits down here are broken. We've got a city that's absolutely destroyed.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Now we've got the northern part of the country being completely taken apart.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  All the businesses are shut. I mean, they're not showing none of that on the TV.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  Even harder and harder.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Even here in Austin, and we had a limited lockdown, half the businesses never reopened. It's like a ghost town.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Please continue. Tell us, tell us where you are and what's happening.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Well, I'm in Victoria and tonight we found out that with one case that might be in a school
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  and we're going back into a lockdown in Victoria again, one day after coming out of a lockdown.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  People are absolutely at their ends with down here.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  But no one's listening to us in the government.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  Every day, all we hear is 30% increase in their wages, 40% increase in their wages.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  But nothing changes for the people.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Now the people in Sydney, they've shut the businesses down.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  They're putting $750 into people's accounts every week. They're not going to protest.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  But again, there won't be any businesses or goods to buy with that.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  They're purposely collapsing society to bring in a universal income.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  You've got to get that message out to folks that once the universal income's in, they've got you.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  People not just people anymore. I mean, I'm sure you've seen it. It's absolutely out of control.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  Yeah, what do you make of your health minister saying, don't talk to your neighbors.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Don't talk to your grandchildren.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  Well, that gives us every indication that there's a medical tyranny going on.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  We hear that, not just that, we hear that our prime ministers getting advice from CEOs from vaccine companies.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Makes no sense. Who runs the company?
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Yeah, Big Pharma now runs things. They tell the government what to do. This is insane.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  And what happened to your, quote, conservative prime minister?
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  I saw him on TV two days ago. He said, I was watching OAN. He goes,
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  We've only got 20% inoculated. So we're going to stay locked down till 70% take it.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  Well, he's very confusing at the moment. Alex, he is conservative of my heart behind him.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Other than him, you're about the only other person we can listen to and get advice from.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  It's getting very hard now.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  There's a lot of things like carbon taxes. He said no to China. He said no.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  But why is he like a gun to his head going along with the lockdowns? He needs to stop that.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  To me, it feels like that's where the medical part of it comes in.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Keep hearing about Pfizer giving recommendations here.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  And I don't know if they're running the country or if the prime minister's running the country,
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  but every time they make a recommendation, it goes through.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  That's right. Logan, thank you for the call. Take Bolsonaro.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  He can't even run his own country because medical corporate tyranny.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  That's what globalism is, is corporate fascism.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with Brad, Adam, Jamal, Grant, and all of you.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  But real quick, talking to Lawrence Fox here, one of the main leaders of the lockdown opposition in the UK.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  What do you make of this where it seems like presidents, prime ministers don't have power?
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  It's now the corporations.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Yeah. Well, what did Mussolini say?
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  It's fascism is a combination of corporatism and, you know, he mentioned corporatism in it.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  It's a merger of the corporations of the state. Yeah.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  There you go. Exactly. Sorry. That was that. That was the quote.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  No, we have to, we, we, we, it's encouraging this thing to him.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Talking to my was that on from Australia, because it's confusing.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And the idea is to destroy small businesses and to destroy anybody's opportunity to be hopeful about their own life
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  and make them utterly dependent on the state.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  That's the job that they want to achieve and they're succeeding in it.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  They're bribing us in the UK with further and it sounds like they're bribing them in Australia as well.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  Terrible.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  That's what's happening back in four minutes.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  I'm going directly to Brad and then Jamal and then Adam and then Grant.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Your calls are straight ahead with our special guest Lawrence Fox of reclaim party.co.uk.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  He's helping lead the charge of these big demonstrations.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And believe me, folks, what's happening in the UK is coming here next and then coming up in about 15 minutes.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Chris Sky.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Chris Sky from Canada.

[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  We'll be back.

[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  That's why this one's white.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  Get it packaged.

[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  The globalists are having their revolution.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  But for humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  Orson slaves are just just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars is the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  their robot takeover.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  to be able to find it off.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  and they're also funding our operation.

[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.

[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  on my new platform frankspeech.com.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to frankspeech.com now.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  To help support this cyber symposium event,
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  but they're only offered at frankspeech.com.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Thank you and God bless.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  We shall defend our island, whatever the crust may be.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  We shall fight in the hills.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  We shall never surrender.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Well, my friends, look at these three headlines from today.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Influencers are being paid by the government to shill COVID vaccines to children.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  Experimental, deadly, incredible.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  And look at this.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  You saw major U.S. newspapers called for porn for children delivered by the state to keep them safe.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  BBC asked, is there a place for porn for children?
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  That's the new talking point.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  And if you protest the BBC, they call the police on you.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Then of course this woman helped run Planned Parenthood.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  She did run it.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  Now she's in charge of pushing vaccines for CNN.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  It's all about aborting your children one way or another, getting their soul.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  True evil.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  Talking about Australia.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  Got the headline right here.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Australian Prime Minister says that a vaccine of people need to be controlled and restricted.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  So, we've got our special guest leading the charge in the U.K. with us.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  Mr. Fox, we're taking calls.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Let's talk to Jamal in Australia and then Brad.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  Go ahead, Jamal.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  You're on the air.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  Good day, Alex. How are you going? We spoke about a year ago with our first lockdown.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  Yes, sir. I remember.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  So, give us your take on what it's like, what's happening, what's unfolding.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  Absolutely.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  My name is Jamal Bookaboo.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  The only one on Google, bookaboo.com.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  I'm a singer-songwriter.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  And I work with Dr. Wallach with the Infowars Health Team with Ted Anderson.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  And I am in New South Wales, which is the most popular state.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  I'm not in Sydney at the moment, but Sydney is in lockdown where you can't go out five kilometres from your house,
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  which is like three miles.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  And it's pretty bad, Alex.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  And, you know, another important factor I'd need to put out is that in Australia,
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  a very low percentage of the population have been vaccinated.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  I think it's about 28%.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  So that could be a reason why they've got such a hard lockdown.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  Oh, I saw the Prime Minister on TV two days ago saying,
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  because you haven't taken your shot, the lockdown continues.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  So he admits he's holding you hostage.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Yeah, I'd say, great job.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  Aussie's not buying this crap.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Why do you think the folks in Australia aren't buying this bull?
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  I'm a bit pessimistic because I know a lot of people that I thought wouldn't get the shot.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  They've just lined up and got it and posted it on Facebook like they're great citizens.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  But I do think there is an element in Australian culture that we are a bit hesitant
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  with the, you know, the whole agenda of everything.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  But I would like to say that I can see plenty of sheep in this country as well.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  No, no, I hear you.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  But the US is 50%.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Areas of Europe are even higher.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Like Gibraltar is 98%.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  They have the highest COVID outbreaks.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  It's the truth that's going to expose this.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  Let me get the take of Lawrence Fox, our guest, hearing this from Australia.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  It's just amazing to know that as bad as the UK is, Australia is even worse.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  I don't understand why Australia, you would have thought Australia was once a free developing country has descended into this.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  But can I quickly say, Alex, that thing that you showed, the BBC porn thing.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  Yes.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  The British Broadcasting Corporation who were meant to uphold the culture of this country and meant to celebrate the good parts about it and question the less good parts about it
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  have spent the last two decades trying to destroy our culture in this country.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And they are one of the institutions that should have been absolutely resolute in the questioning of the government and have absolutely just got taken a knee to whatever the government have said.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  And they should be finished and ended.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  Australia's got the same problem because they've shut down Sky News Australia off YouTube as well.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  So any dissenting views, it's finished.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  And they're talking about child porn now.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  I mean, for God's sake.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  And that's a talking point all over the world now.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Thank you so much, Jamal.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  Okay, let's go to Brad in Australia, currently in New Jersey visiting folks, but has family in Australia.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Brad, what's your take on the situation?
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Yeah, it's just crazy to see the last year and a half you've had celebrities go to Australia to kind of escape the lockdown from the U.S.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  That's kind of like a resort with less restrictions.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  And then you've seen this quick downward spiral into a tyrannical control.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  And you've got Sydney, people can't even go 10 kilometers from their house.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  And you've got one hour of exercise.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And I'm not sure if you've seen that video, but people are going to that beach, to the beach.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  So the doctor says you can't be at the beach when the best place you want to be for health is the beach.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Exactly.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  Yeah, saltwater.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  You're far from people.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  They were just saying you will be fine if you don't leave the beach.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  It's $500 fine.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  If you don't have a mask, it's just getting really crazy.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  And it's especially worse than the east.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Why do you think worldwide there's a concerted U.N. effort to do this?
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Just to test their power, I think it's because they're getting ready to pop the Ponzi scheme and bring in a new world currency.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  They don't want to go to jail for what they've done.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  So they want to do the virus.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  So they're in charge and claim all the new digital money and digital passports and digital social credit scores because of the virus and not the collapse.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Yeah, it's crazy to see you see all of them have the exact same talking points.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  It's like they've just put them in at the perfect time or all got the corrupt people at the perfect time.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  But you've had, I think it was the mayor of Sydney even drop.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  This is the new world order about a year ago, he said that on live TV.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  He said, this is the new world order.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Get used to it.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Exactly.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And just other things.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  Just got a friend in the army is being forced to take the vaccine.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Otherwise he wouldn't be allowed on employment.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  He's got those massive quarantine camps being built in Sydney.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  And then just saying we'll have perpetual lockdowns if we have one case of this virus, which I don't know how people are not seeing how this.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  They're building quarantine camps all the world.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  The UN said the end goal is taking people out of their homes.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  So now, oh, contact tracing app said you might have it.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Now you got to go to this camp.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  It's used to you disappear.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  You come back.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  It's total end of due process into Magna Carta.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  This is it folks.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  This is the FEMA camp takeover.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  You've got to resist it.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Thank you, Brad.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Thank you, sir.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  I got a bunch of the calls from Australia.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  Any other points from that last caller, Lawrence?
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Yeah, I think people have a voice and they need to use their voice and they need to those that don't agree with this.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  They need to take that voice into their workplace and they need to take that voice out socially and they need to be around the people that wouldn't necessarily agree with them.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  And they need to say there's a problem here because unless people feel in bold and empowered to speak the truth, which is that we're being driven into authoritarianism under the excuse of some very, very nonlethal virus in relatively.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Then would there's no answer to more people that stand up the better.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  That's right.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  Stand up.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  We lose.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  We should fear the tyranny, not the virus in the order.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  The calls have come in.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I really appreciate Adam and then Grant Adam in Australia.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  You're on the air.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Thank you.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Thanks for taking my call on the first time call us.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  I just bear with me.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  But look, the reaction that this country, Australia has had to the COVID and everything is just insane.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  I live in South Australia.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  We've had four deaths from COVID in what now it's been around for 36 months.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  And we've gone through three or four lockdowns where you can't leave your house for like about two kilometer radius and all of these crazy things.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  Everything gets closed down.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And we've been a state that's actually been pretty lucky.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  I mean, most of the footage that you see of the cops arresting people for protesting and all that kind of stuff that comes from Victoria and New South Wales.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  And I mean, you look at the COVID numbers in Australia all around.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  We haven't even had a thousand deaths, like 35,000 cases.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  A majority of those cases all come from the one state in Victoria.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Oh, it's a total pretext for control.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  And yeah, and it just blows my mind how we react like this to those sorts of numbers.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  And like our biggest problem, I think, is because you got three groups of people, you have the people who are awake, they're aware of what's going on.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  They're spreading the information.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  You have people who are fully in lockstep with the COVID, they're pro the COVID, they're pro vaccine.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  They'll tell you all the numbers where all the hotspots are all these things.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  They probably won't have their minds changed.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  They're probably lost.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  And they're not even the majority.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  The majority of people are the people who they sit on the fence.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  They'll tell you all the numbers and they'll give you this and it starts and they'll keep a track of all this stuff.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And then you sit there and you tell them about the numbers like that.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  Or you tell them, you know, like across the world in 36 months, you've had not even four and a half million deaths and cancer and starvation combined in that same period.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  Absolutely, it's all a fraud.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  And I see the cops beating men, women and children with billy clubs.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  My God, what criminal activity, shame on them.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Adam, do you think the police are ashamed of themselves or are they proud of themselves in Australia?
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  I mean, it's tough to tell.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  It's probably a split.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  But I mean, a lot of them seem to just be power hungry people who just like to exercise their power.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  But it's these people that you tell all of these things and they, you know, they open their eyes and they go, oh, OK.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  And then the next day.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  It's the cheap that erases kids.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Thank you.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  Next hour, more calls coming up.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Final comments from Lawrence Fox.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Stay with us.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  One of the products that I'm very proud of.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  I don't talk enough about because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  It takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth, your throat and lungs are really thin.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you wanted to essential oils, not our lung cleanse.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhale.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  And it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  It's just very, very soothing.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  And it's just one more thing for you and your family to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  So get your lung cleanse discounted at infowarstore.com and get yourself and your family prepared.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  While at the same time, funding the InfoWar, a total 360 win, infowarstore.com.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Granny Do Right.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Granny Do Right.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Go ahead.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  I am a granny.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is the ticket.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  This is working.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  This is wonderful.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  No, thank you, Alex, so much for having me on and for expressing and using your absolute fundamental human right to freedom of speech,
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  because that prevents violence.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  And I suppose the only last thing I want to say is what John Adams said in 777,
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  I hope you will make good use of it.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  And that's what we should do for each other.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Well, that's beautifully said, but just you're there, you're helping lead this, taking the temperature.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  I'm not the enemy of the police.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  I don't want war.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  I don't need that to prove I'm a man.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  They're waging war against us.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  It's like the political system wants to be our savior, but we don't want to be our savior.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  So now they're going to be our dominator.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  This is not going to end well.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  It's like a man trying to keep a woman from leaving.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  It's not going to end well.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  Well, yeah, it is actually good analogy.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  It's an abusive relationship, isn't it?
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  It's a coercive relationship.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  It's like, no, no, this is fine.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  I won't do anything more.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  Just this little extra bit, just a bit of vaccine for your children.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  Just this, just that.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  It's not, it's not ethical.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  It's immoral.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  It's coercive.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  It's totally in contravention of the Nuremberg Code.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  And we have rewritten and redrawn society in 16, 17 months and changed us from citizens with rights to organs of the state who are asking for their rights as privileges.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  And it is an appalling readjustment of society.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  And we must each and every one of us who believes in freedom, we must stand up and we must resist it with every single thing we have in our hearts.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  Final question, Lawrence, gut level, what do you think is going to happen?
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  Because I don't see this going well for the tyrants, but how far do you think they'll push?
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  They seem to just be totally committed to acting like monsters.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  I think every action has an equal and opposite reaction, doesn't it, as Isaac Newton taught us.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  So I think what they'll find is that it is like trying to break a wild horse.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  You know, at some point, like you can break that wild horse and you can stick a saddle on it.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  But that wild horse, the minute you turn around, it'll kick you in the face.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  And I think that's what will happen.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  That is a perfect analogy.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  My uncle used to try to buy really good horses from Mexico, but they were genetically great, but they'd never been broken.
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  And that horse would let you break it until you're riding along one day and it rolls over and kills you.
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  Absolutely.
[1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  You want a horse to love you, not hate you, is a point.
[1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  Well, you do.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  But also what the government is doing is it's breaking us slowly.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  So, you know, we need to know that and be aware of the fact that every time they lied to you,
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:09.000]  every time they changed the goalpost, they moved them around.
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Every time we'd never do that to remind ourselves that the people are called spreaders of misinformation,
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  as I was called on national television the other day, and, you know, anti-vaxxers or whatever we're called,
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  day after day after day, every single thing that we have predicted has come true, every single one.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  And we need an opposition.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  And that's a badge of courage.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  That's a good thing, exactly.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  All right.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  Lawrence Fox, reclaimparty.co.uk.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  Thank you.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  And I really appreciate Grant in Australia holding.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And I really appreciate.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  Now we got all these calls from the UK and other calls from Australia.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  So we've got Chris Sky coming on for a full hour, or almost a full hour.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  We're going to go to him, but I'm going to get your calls in this first segment coming back,
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  because it's so important.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  And we got a clip, too.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  We come out of break.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  Let's play that new Chris Sky clip.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  It's not new.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  It's a year old.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  We've even made more predictions.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  It's a Chris Sky clip.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  So let's come in with an intro and then play that straight ahead here.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  I can see Chris right there.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  He's in a car.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Always on the move is Chris Sky.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  We love him.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  We appreciate him.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  And I tell you, I mean, here's the deal.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  I'm not glad all this is happening, but it's like you're in it.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  Like you're in some new punches.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  You're like, well, I'm not worried about getting a, I'm going to beat your ass now.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Like you just popped me upside the head.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  You're about to find out.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  And like we're already in that point where they're like, you're like, whoa, you actually
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  want to, you want to fight?
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  And then so they're going to get what they want is the point.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  They're going to get it.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  The point is we want to take the high road and not let them trick us.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  We want to be very calculated about this because we are about to skin us a new World
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  Order operation.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  We're at backstage.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  The Hindu Chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  of the soul.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  dimensions of reality.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  free and the proprio shower head will seal the deal.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  So we're into the third hour here taking your phone calls from Australia, the UK, Canada
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  about the ongoing globalist lockdown and war on humanity.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  Here's Chris Sky again a year ago on Canadian TV explaining how he was able to predict the
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  lockdowns that then began to unfold off their own document.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  Here it is.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  I saw the exact same, a lot of people saw it.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  It was a UN document, this is common knowledge and it basically outlined the lockdowns and
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  they just gave it to each country and allowed each country to tweak it for their own people
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  to make it more palpable for their people and to give the impression that it wasn't
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  an international document disseminated to all countries to make it, people think that
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  every country made up their own rules.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  The five levels of lockdown were in there.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  In a place like Ireland, they went level one to five.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  In a place like Canada where we like colors, now we got green to gray.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  It's still five levels of lockdown.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  All the five levels are identical.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  They used Australia as the model for the fifth level of lockdown where you can't leave your
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  house, you can't literally do anything.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  And that's what they really want to do here.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Well, I heard about the mandatory quarantine hotel and I knew right away it's a complete
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  violation of our rights and the only reason they're doing it is because they want to convince
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  you to accept the vaccine passport.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  I want to stress that everything that they're doing, closing your business, closing your
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  gym, forcing you to wear a mask, all the stuff they're doing is to try to convince you that
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  it's a good idea for you to go along with this idea of a vaccine passport so they can
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  vaccinate you multiple times a year every year and then use that as an excuse to prevent
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  you from travel, work, congregating, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  And if you think it's a conspiracy theory, they already have it in place in Israel and
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  they've already made it quite clear that if you don't get vaccinated, you're going to
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  be relegated to small shops and grocery stores and you're basically shunned from the rest
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  of society.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  And that's what they want.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  They want a complete medical tyranny on you.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  Once you give in to medical tyranny and you do not have bodily autonomy and they can
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  literally forcibly inject you with whatever they want as a pretense for you to live your
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  life, are you free?
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Absolutely not.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  That's the most invasive violation of our rights thus far.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  And that's why they waited an entire year of demoralizing you and destroying your life
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  and making you as hopeless as possible so you will not just accept it, you will beg for
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  it.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  That's what they're doing.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  They're doing psychological warfare on you to weaken you to the point where you will not
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  only accept defeat, you will accept perpetual defeat for the rest of your life.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Well, Chris Sky is a leader.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  That's what we need is leaders.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  And he joins us from some unknown location driving around Canada like a 21st century
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  version of Paul Revere.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  Now suddenly it's all over the news that pedophilia is good, the BBC, the New York Times, time
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  to show porn to children.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  I mean, what the hell is going on?
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  New York's announcing you can't go into any business or anything without a tracker system.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  The city gives you an app to do it, but the borders are wide open.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  This is crazy.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  Chris Sky, what moment in history are we right now?
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  We're at a very pivotal moment in history.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  We're at a moment in history where we could either stand up for ourselves and we could
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  have a crystal age, a golden age where truth reigns free, freedom reigns free and there's
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  prosperity for all, or we could submit to the tyranny that's closing in all around us
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  and we can be relegated from individuals with freedom to literal little blips on a screen
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  that they can eliminate with the flick of a switch.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Tell me more about the crystal age.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  I agree with you.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  We're literally at the crossroads of dark age versus human empowerment.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  They're trying to take us down the rattle.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Well, if everybody actually heeds our warning and listens to the things we've been saying
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  and sees how everything we've been saying has been coming true and listens to the solution,
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  which is united non-compliance, everybody coming together and realizing number one,
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  this is not about our safety, this is about control.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Once you realize that, you've woken up.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  That was the global awakening.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  That's what 2020 was.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  The evolution of consciousness to know that this was not about our health and safety.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  This is about control.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  Phase two is taking action and that's mobilizing all the people that we know we've woken up
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  and we get the small business owners to stay open.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  We get concerned parents to attack the school boards and demand the masks off their children.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  We get employees to band together and reject mandatory masks
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  and we get the people as a whole to take off their masks.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  That's all it takes to end this.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  That's it.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  And they want you to look at political solutions.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  They want you to follow candidates.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  They want you to follow their rules and comply, but it's all bull.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  Exactly.
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Don't count on Trump.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  Don't know.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  You've got to do it.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  Yes.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  If I was running as a president or prime minister, my campaign slogan would be,
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  don't count on me.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have to save yourself.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  I lead by example.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  I show you what to do for yourself and your family to secure yourself.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  I agree.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  My mindset would be exactly don't count on me.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  You are the leader.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  You are the resistance.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  That's right.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  And I like that quote you just put from Malcolm X.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  It's very similar to why I like to say freedom is never given.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  It's always taken.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  And we literally gave our freedom away.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  I agree.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  And I'm telling the globalist you ain't taking my freedom.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  It's mine.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  That's right.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  That's all you got to do.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Billions of people fought and died for those freedoms that you just gave up on a silver platter.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  And now we're wallowing in tyranny and the people want to vote their way out of it.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Name one time in history where people have voted their way out of tyranny.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  It just doesn't happen.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  And of course, he's quoting Frederick Douglass there.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Freedom is not given.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  It's taken.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  That's right.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  We gave it.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  We gave our freedom away, but now we got to take it back.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  And that's the thing, folks.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  They don't give it to you by us laying down.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  We invited wolves back when this country stood up for itself.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Nobody tried to take somebody's freedom.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  They'd die before they gave their freedom.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  And that's a big point.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  And that's why they don't want Canadians to be more like Americans,
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  because Americans will fight.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Americans will disobey.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  Americans are well-armed.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  And Americans do value our freedom.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  And that's why you guys are far more open than Canadians are.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Well, in certain areas, in certain areas, I mean, you know.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  Well, yeah, you guys are starting to get locked down too,
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  just like I was warning everybody.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  The whole reason I'm on this tour in the first place is to warn Canadians
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  that even though they let you take off your mask
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  and open your business for right now, it's not over.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  Well, that's to kill opposition.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  Explain that.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  They admit.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  It's to kill opposition.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  It's to pacify you.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  It's to lure your guard.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  It's to lull you into submission.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  It's to destroy the momentum and the organization
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  of the freedom movement in general.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  And it's to try to pacify the whole movement.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  So when September comes around,
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  we don't even see it coming.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  They pull the rug out from under our feet.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  We're back on lockdown and we're back to square one.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  Reorganizing, trying to get everybody.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  A year ago, you predicted this summer,
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  they take it off in Canada for a month or two,
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  bring it right back.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  And now they even admit that's their plan.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  Of course.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  I even went to Kelowna, British Columbia,
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  one of the stops on my tour, July 28th.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  And the day that I got there,
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  they reinstituted the mandatory mask mandate.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  Like they couldn't have waited, done it at a better time.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  Literally the day I went there to give my speech
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  and warn everybody restrictions are coming back.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  Midnight that night, they put the mask back.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And now yesterday, what did the CDC say?
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Mandatory masks indoors all over Canada and the US,
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  regardless of your vaccination status.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  It's almost like I made a video over a year ago
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  saying exactly that.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  These cold-blooded bastards,
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  look, we know that we've rejected their politics
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  that's why they're doing this, but it's hurting them.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  Why do they keep pushing this agenda, no matter what?
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Because how is it hurting them?
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  It's hurting them a little bit financially.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  No, it's not.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  We've seen the largest transfer of wealth in the last year
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  that we've ever seen.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  We're seeing small businesses go broke.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  We have almost 30% of all our small businesses
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  broke in Canada, while the big boys like Walmart
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  and all the pharmaceutical companies
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  are going through the roof.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  So what have they sacrificed?
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  They haven't sacrificed anything,
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  except maybe the little integrity they might have had.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  Other than that, they're doing well.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  They're gaining control every day.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  They're lowering our resistance every day.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  They're gaining wealth every day.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  And every day, more and more people seem to be complying,
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  but it's not really the case.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  And I'll tell everybody, I had somebody walk up to me
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  just two days ago on the street,
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  and they were masked up, and he walked over,
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  and I was expecting him to say something derogatory.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  And you know what he said?
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  He said, I know who you are.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  I'm double jabbed, and I wear a mask,
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  but I still appreciate everything you do,
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  and I agree with everything you say.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  So it goes to show you that even if someone's jabbed,
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  even if someone wears the mask,
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  that doesn't mean that they agree in vaccine passports.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  That doesn't mean anything. That's right. Stay there. Stay there.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  I recently ran an ad where we played a cavalry bugle call
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  in the background, and I made the point today
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  the cavalry is here, but it's really true.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  Listeners are incredible,
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  and when we're able to keep these great products in stock,
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  we were able to fund ourselves last year
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  that we'd been in because I expanded so much
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  for the 2020 election.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  But thanks to you, we're still on air.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  But now because of the shutdown in production
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  and because of slowdowns with the whole COVID lockdowns
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  with the supply chain, a lot of our best-selling products
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  have not been available for months and months and months.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Some for six months. Some have been discontinued.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  But the cavalry is here now in our funding,
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  because a lot of these products are finally coming back in.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Prostagard, Vaso Beats, Alpha Power,
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  and of course, BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  are all in our top 10 bestsellers.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  Our second bestseller is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  95% for humanoid.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  It is back in stock right now,
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  50% off at InfoWorstware.com.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  So really, you are the cavalry when you order these products
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  at InfoWorstware.com.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  We could not be in a more epic time right now.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  World corporate government, big tech mad scientist
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  trying to put genetically engineered,
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  deadly compounds into our body.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  We've got Chris Sky with us,
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  leading on-the-ground activists in the world,
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  fighting back David versus Goliath.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  But imagine just how insane this is
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  that they've actually made their move.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  I've got callers, John and Australia have been holding
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  when I go to you, Grant and Australia holding over an hour
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  when I go to you first, callers from Canada,
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  Denmark, the UK want to talk to Chris Sky
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  at 877-789-2539.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  We'll start going to those now,
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  so you don't have to hold.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  But I mean, Chris, how epic is it
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  that you got the UN document, I got it,
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  we predicted it because it's there, it happened.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  And just now, it's all coming out.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  Where do you expect this to go?
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  How do you see this unfolding?
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  There were reports from Australia
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  that the army actually came to a town,
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  surrounded it, and vowed that they were going to
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  forcibly vaccinate everybody.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  And the town stood up for themselves
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  and just said, no, like I tell everybody to do.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  And the army left that said they'll be back.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  So this is what they have planned for us.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  Australia, the Commonwealth Island, is the model.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  And then they do that there for their winter
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  and then they do it in Canada
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  next because we're coming next.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  And I'm sorry, I got to apologize to everybody
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  for the bad video quality and everything.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  We're on the road, we've been driving over.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  Now, your comments are great, brother.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  So yeah, Australia is the model, keep going.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  Australia is the model.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  They want to lock us down in the way
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  where we can't leave our house.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  They want to forcibly vaccinate us with the military
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  if required.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  The narrative is going to be this,
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  and this is very important that everybody hears this,
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  everybody understands this,
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  and everybody disseminates this information.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  In the fall and even earlier, cases will rise.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  The vaccinated will be getting sick.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  They will blame it on a new variant
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  and say it's resistant to the vaccine.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  In reality, the vaccine is going to be causing
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  the people to get sick.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  But the government is going to say the variant
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  was caused by the unvaccinated.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  That's going to set the stage for massive division in society,
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  way worse than mask wearers versus non-mask wearers.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  And it's going to provide the 75% of the population
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  that got vaccinated are going to be scared
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  into supporting the idea that the vaccine passport
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  needs to apply to all unvaccinated people
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  for all aspects of society.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  So no going to the gym, no going to the grocery store,
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  no going to a movie, et cetera, et cetera,
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  unless you're vaccinated and unless you're up to date.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  And again, they've all proposed that.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  They're trying it. This is like, it's here.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  Used to, I would speculate, now it's here.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  It is here. It's already in France.
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  In France, you can't even go to the grocery store
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  unless you show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  And that's disgusting. And that's why there's riots.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  That's why there's tear gas.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  And most recently, that's why you saw officers
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  marching with civilians in the streets.
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  And that's what we need.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  That's what united non-compliance.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  And by the way, they still have churches shut down right now in Canada.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  I mean, this is so obviously evil.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  My God, they made their move.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  We've got time to talk next segment.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  But Chris Sky, why the system make their move now?
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  I mean, this is not going to go well for them.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  It's because they have a financial collapse coming.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  There are Ponzi schemes coming down.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  They need martial law in place before that happens.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  It's kind of like they needed to do it now
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  because of what you said with inflation
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  and the debt and everything going on.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  The international banking system based on fractional debt reserve
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  is going to crash. They know that.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  And now what they want to do is while it's crashing,
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  they want to transfer as much wealth and property to themselves as possible
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  and take as much from the masses as possible
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  before they go through what they call the great reset.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  So COVID, we'll call it COVID,
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  is literally just a vehicle to attain all of their agendas.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  It gets rid of our rights.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  It gets rid of our businesses.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  It gets rid of our jobs.
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  It gets rid of our financial independence.
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  And it helps them allocate all the money, resources,
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  and property to themselves
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  and puts them in a perpetual state of control
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  over a once sort of free population.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  We thought we were free.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  We were never really free.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  But now they're taking this.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  I totally agree.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Excellent analysis.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Grant in Australia on the air with Chris Sky from Canada.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  Go ahead.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  Alex, great to talk.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  We love you, brother.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Go ahead.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  Give us your take.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  So I'm just ringing to tell you what I'm seeing in Australia
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  where I live.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  There's coming with the QR code in the shops.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  So they want you to scan in every time.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  Some shops have the real, they're enforcing.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  They want you to know if you've checked in.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Everyone who works in the shops has to wear a mask.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  They want everyone to wear masks.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  Every now and then you'll see someone who doesn't.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  But they've got like a big rash on their face.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  I'm trying to inform people to not wear the microplastic masks.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  But some people are not wearing the mask as much.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  Some people are wearing the mask in their car.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  They're like, I wouldn't get upset about it.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  So that's what I'm seeing.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  The medical appointments, when you go for a medical appointment,
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  they're totally all about the mask.
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  You've got to have the mask.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  You've got to, you know, they're really, the police are running around
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  with their masks on in the cars.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  The ambulances too.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  I'm rural, so I haven't seen like heavy track downs yet.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  It's a symbol of total submission.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  And some people are just, they're just all about the signal submit.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  You go to Aldi and they've got the clever together.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  You know, the planet with the hands holding the planet up.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  They have that on the way into Aldi next to the sign in spot.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  It's a corporate evil authoritarian acting like it's for the people.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  How sick?
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  I've called into like David Knight and Harrison on the American Journal.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  And I write to the politicians and I reckon every, if everyone writes to them,
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  that puts the pressure on them.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  Be careful not to write threatening things.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  If you get upset, don't let that come through in your letter.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  Just be straight up.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  Thank you for your information, Alex, because it's the fidelity,
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  the accuracy is perfect.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  And that's what you need to do.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  Put that, put that accurate information in your letter or your email
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  and put the pressure on them because they're getting pressure from,
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  from the globalists and everyone.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  That's right.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  The globalists are pressuring them threatening to tell about their mistress,
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  threatening to put them in jail for something they didn't do.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  Exactly.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  Great point.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  Thank you, Grant.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  And you know, I can.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  Sorry.
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  I can say that I want to say really real quick because in multiple airports in Canada,
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  after they said they're not going to try to do a two tier society or segregate
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  non-vax and non-vax, they actually made two separate lineups in the airports for vaccinated
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  and non-vaccinated Canadians when you re-enter the country.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  And because people freaked out, called, emailed and went nuts within 24 hours,
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  all those lineups were taken away.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  So it does work when you do put enough pressure on them.
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  Stay there.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  I want to talk about that.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  When we resist, we win.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  When we submit, we die.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  Let's talk about that.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  Take your call from Australia.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  John and Australia, you're up next.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Then callers in Denmark, Canada, Canada, UK, Canada.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  Stay with us back in three minutes.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts,
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,

[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  All the way out into 2024.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  And then in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that the U.S. policy is set
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf,
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  that trained the Couserville Home Institute in Germany.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  Info Wars will continue to selflessly fight this.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  I don't know how long we can.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  God bless and good luck.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  I would again get right with God right now.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  everywhere we go and what we do.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  and great ways to communicate, I still have one
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage,
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.

[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  Thank you and God bless.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  Well, I was blessed.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  I had family and my uncle and so many people tell me everything was going to come.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  40 years ago, 30 years ago, then I got to know General Bitton K. Parton,
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  the former head of Air Force Weapons.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  I got to know Ted Gunderson and countless others.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  It told me everything and they said, you will face the assault.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  You will face the world government.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  You will face the force inoculation.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  You will face the mark of the beach.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  You will win.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  And now at 47 years old, we'll have about 60, there's a stress.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  I am now here and all the enemy's preparation is over.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  The beta's over.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Now their full assault is here.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  Chris Sky, the leading on the ground activist in the world, joins us in this fight.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  I want to go to John in Australia, Johnny, Matt Stewart, Full Metal, Charlie,
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  and Dav and Angela before we end this broadcast today,
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  or have the next guest host coming up and taking over.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  But what a moment to be alive.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  I mean, this is epic.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  If you had a science fiction movie where they're trying to make you take a deadly experimental shot
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  and it's killing people and it doesn't protect you,
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  they wouldn't believe a movie like this.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  Chris Sky, we're living this now.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  We are. And it's really scary.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  And I take it so seriously that I had to pull over on my ride back home
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  and if I gave you away at my location right now, I could probably be arrested.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  You don't talk about that.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  You're a hunted man for your speech.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  Just like Australia arrest people to criticize lockdowns.
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  Yeah, I have a warrant in Manitoba for my arrest for something they said I was going to do,
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  which was speak, and then I never even ended up speaking,
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  but they kept the warrant out just so they could grab me whenever they see me.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  Because that's how our government in Canada works now.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  They use the emergency and the pandemic as a way to basically do whatever they want
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  and not even just bend the rule of law, but completely circumvent it altogether for their own interests.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  And we're seeing a collusion between government, the court system, and the police,
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  when they're all supposed to be separate entities,
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  but they're working together at the highest levels to try to subjugate us
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  and to try to put this tyranny off.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  Well, pirates always try the power grab.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  Don't they get it always fails Newtonian physics?
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  Well, yeah, it always fails in the end because we're the good, we're the light,
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  and we always win.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  The only problem is the longer we take the stand up for ourselves,
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  the bigger the price everyone's going to pay and the bigger the sacrifice.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:02.000]  And we're talking about sacrificing the children's future and their children's potential
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  because what they're going to do in the schools in the fall
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  and what they're going to do with the whole target without their lick in their lips over the kids.
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  They want to sterilize them so bad.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  They want to steal their future.
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  They love getting their hands on the children because they're even easier to mold than the adults
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  and look how easy the adults were.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  So if they can get their hands on this generation of children
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  and make them like the rest of the parents were it's game over.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  They've won and that's why it's imperative for people like us to not only sound the alarm
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  but to get people to actually take action against this.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  That's what we need to do and I believe in the fall.
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  We're going to see that happen because even the most compliant,
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  even the most trusting was told take your vaccine and everything will go back to normal.
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  Now they're going to tell them take a third vaccine, maybe even a fourth vaccine
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  and they're still going to mask them. They're still going to lock them down.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  So nobody in their right mind is going to believe that a fifth or sixth shot is going to get them their freedom back.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  So the gig is going to be up and at that point we already have the silent majority on our side.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  At that point they're not going to be silent anymore. They're just going to be the majority.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  And how do I know this is true?
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  I've seen a massive shift in society the last couple of months
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  before I could go to a freedom rally and everybody would know who I am
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  and everybody would appreciate what I do.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  Obviously they're at a freedom rally.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  Now I can't go anywhere in Canada, anywhere.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  I can't walk down a street for 50 feet without people coming up and knowing who I am,
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  knowing what's going on and understanding that the government is up to something.
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  And that's exactly what I've experienced.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  So now we have to tell them don't look for Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Chris got to do it.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  They have to be leaders and say no. They have to go to city council. They have to go to the school district.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  They have to lead now, go and destroy the lies, expose it.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:02.000]  That's it. And if you don't, if you're not going to stand up for your children,
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  if you're a parent, that should be your driving force.
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  If you're not a parent, stand up for your family.
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:11.000]  If you don't have a family, stand up for yourself, stand up for your country.
[2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  Your only responsibility as a citizen of your country
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  is the medical tyranny that cooked it up at Wuhan with a forced inoculation coming after.
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  So jamming some calls. Chris Guy arrived in shock and went, this was an amazing job.
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  All right, John in Australia, you're on the year. Thanks for holding.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  Yeah, thank you for having me on, Alex.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  I'm actually in Salt Lake City. I lived in Australia for 20 years.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  I just returned in a couple or a couple of years ago.
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  I was the creator and producer of the once well-known ghost radio network.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  And I watched Australia descended to a police state following the 9-11 thing.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  And we tried to warn a lot of people.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  We've had David Eich on our show and I recently just republished the interview that we did in March
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  because he was dead accurate. And the stuff that you have said years ago on prison planet was dead accurate.
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  And I didn't realize how bad it was until 2010.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  And when they sent me to jail for fake crimes, but they told me over and over, you have no rights in Australia.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  I got the consulate, I got the ambassador and they both told me, I'm sorry, you have no rights in Australia.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  And the reason for this is that we see everything going on now is because Australia is the only democracy that doesn't have a written bill of rights for its people.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  And I've long...
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  Well, you're right. They never got out from under the penal system and they're trying to reinstate that. It's the same truth.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  Absolutely. And even back in those days of ghost radio, we tried to warn that Australia is an indicator nation.
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  And Chris Guy said that, you've said that a hundred times.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  What's going on in Australia is going to come here.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  They pick on Australia, the UK, Canada, and they basically surround us.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  They've taken all of our allies, compromised them and moving in for the kill on the United States.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  And one of the things that I pointed out down in Australia is, look, Australians get bombarded with America news and media.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  But, you know, in the United States, we don't hear a whimper from Australia, except very rarely.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  And I think the answer, that's why the phones up to Australians.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  We need to hear Australians, whether they reach one person or a million, every Australian should say no and use every platform they've got to say no.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  And they're going to need the United States people.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  The people of America have to realize what's going on there because...
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  No, no, I agree, John. They should take what Australians do and they should magnify it.
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  Thank you for the call. LeCham and one more Aussie here because we've got to get these calls in.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  Let's go ahead and I guess they hung up.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  We had one more call from Australia, I guess they're gone.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  So we got Johnny and Denmark, Matt and Canada, Stewart and Canada, Full Metal Charlie in Canada, Dave in UK, and Angelo in Canada.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  We're going to break it a minute and a half, but Chris Sky, how exciting is this fight to be able to be on the good side?
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  As negative as this is, at least the enemy's out in the open, right?
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  Well, I've known about this plan like you for many, many years.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  So to me, it's actually refreshing that they finally showed their cards and played their hand because I've been waiting for this fight and I'm ready for this fight.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  They're not ready for me and they've shown it. They demonstrated it in many ways.
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  They're scared of me. They're scared of us and they should be because we're coming for them and we are bringing an army.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  We're bringing an army of good and the army of good always wins.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  And your Skype just broke up. We'll come back to you as soon as it reconnects.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  I don't use the cheesy Star Wars analogy in like episode four with Han Solo and they're like, oh my God, they're coming to attack us.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  He goes, well, it's a lot better than all this sneaking around. I mean, seriously, I'm not scared of these globalists, man.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  And now they're like, we want to eff your kids. We want to rule you. We want to inject. Well, okay, good.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  All you fat ass pedophiles, get ready for war.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  We'll come back with Chris Sky on the other side of the break. We're going to jam in all these calls as Skype came in, came out.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  He just disconnected. But I tell you, once they get the internet ID in place, then we'll have no free speech.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  But we've got communications now and we've got truth now.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  And so now use the communications now while you can.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, freeworldnews.tv, band.video, share those links.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  We are the resistance.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the info wars.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  Awesome. So, personally, I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.

[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  So, personally, I wanted to do was say, I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Thank you.

[2:42:34.940 --> 2:42:38.620]  It's kind of like Empire Strikes Back Imperial troops are in the base.
[2:42:38.620 --> 2:42:39.620]  I mean we are.
[2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:44.380]  I knew this was all coming, it's okay but I mean my God it's gotten insane.
[2:42:44.380 --> 2:42:48.460]  The stuff they're doing to us right now is not fun and I've gotten so used to attacks
[2:42:48.460 --> 2:42:52.340]  like people are stabbing me and I'm like well that's all right, miss the heart again or
[2:42:52.340 --> 2:42:57.100]  they hit my heart but it rebuilds is like I'm a little too confident is the problem
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:00.700]  because I've been sitting here getting punched and attacked and spit on and crapped on so
[2:43:00.700 --> 2:43:05.820]  long that I've gotten pretty tough but then I don't want to bitch about a solicitor saying
[2:43:05.820 --> 2:43:09.780]  oh that's Alex he can take it he can he can take it no folks I need to go on your knees
[2:43:09.780 --> 2:43:14.460]  and pray for God for strength I need that spiritual transfusion right now and you to
[2:43:14.460 --> 2:43:20.980]  pray for our crew and pray for pray for people right now I'm leaving it that because during
[2:43:20.980 --> 2:43:25.980]  this break I got some more horrible news but that's the way it is so long as we just get
[2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:31.020]  right with God Chris Scott we got four or five more calls to make and I love these folks
[2:43:31.020 --> 2:43:36.100]  that are holding from Canada and Canada and Canada and the UK and Canada and I know you
[2:43:36.100 --> 2:43:41.660]  want to respond to these listeners but just let me guess you are a regular guy a business
[2:43:41.660 --> 2:43:47.580]  owner a manager they mess with you you took action you kicked ass are you not more empowered
[2:43:47.580 --> 2:43:52.020]  now at the end of the day and and I guess you wouldn't have it any other way or are
[2:43:52.020 --> 2:43:57.260]  you glad you fought this evil or do you wish you would have submitted to it oh my God if
[2:43:57.260 --> 2:44:01.980]  I had to do it all again I'd do it all again in a heartbeat in a heartbeat this is the most
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:06.940]  important fight not only of our generation but many generations past and to be a part
[2:44:06.940 --> 2:44:13.220]  of it and to be as you said referred to as the leading goal activist on the ground that's
[2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:18.060]  an honor that I wouldn't give up for anything and I'm ready for them like you said they
[2:44:18.060 --> 2:44:21.700]  come they hit us every single day it's gone to the point that if they don't do something
[2:44:21.700 --> 2:44:24.820]  to me I'm almost disappointed but they're not going to stop me from getting to where
[2:44:24.820 --> 2:44:28.420]  I got to go we got a lot of things coming that's going to try that's going to try to
[2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:32.980]  win this fight and put it in our favor I'm going to be starting my own social media platform
[2:44:32.980 --> 2:44:37.260]  and it's going to be very similar to a Facebook style without the censorship I'm going to
[2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:42.620]  be back in Calgary on the 19th for the freedom awards because I'm nominated for an award
[2:44:42.620 --> 2:44:47.620]  and then in the 20th or 21st we're going to be having a very special event in Edmonton
[2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:54.660]  a private event for all entrepreneurs business owners anybody who is connected and does not
[2:44:54.660 --> 2:44:59.820]  want this to carry on and part of the business world is going to be at this party and we're
[2:44:59.820 --> 2:45:05.020]  going to start the revolution from a little warehouse in Edmonton because enough is enough
[2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:09.860]  and everybody knows what's coming and now not only are the people aligned the people
[2:45:09.860 --> 2:45:13.860]  are ready to work together the people are ready to fight back and that's why they're
[2:45:13.860 --> 2:45:19.420]  coming for you harder than ever even my own website it gets attacked daily by entire teams
[2:45:19.420 --> 2:45:25.100]  of hackers from around the world they are so scared of us they see us as the only threat
[2:45:25.100 --> 2:45:30.460]  to them winning and we're not the only threat there's a lot of threats but we are the threat
[2:45:30.460 --> 2:45:34.980]  that's going to make the difference you just start something deep there I realize that
[2:45:34.980 --> 2:45:40.700]  I'm supposed to take the heat so they don't see all the real threats that's right that's
[2:45:40.700 --> 2:45:45.620]  right we're in the spotlight so they have to focus on us just like their main goal with
[2:45:45.620 --> 2:45:50.420]  me right now is to try to distract me try to bombard me with people that push me off
[2:45:50.420 --> 2:45:57.140]  my goals we're doing that to them tenfold they got everything focused on us for instance
[2:45:57.140 --> 2:46:02.660]  to fly to Calgary I had a freedom fighter pick us up with his airplane in Ontario we
[2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:07.140]  had to refuel in another part of Ontario so we wouldn't have to land in Manitoba where
[2:46:07.140 --> 2:46:12.940]  they would be able to arrest me when we refueled at the airport in Canora Ontario I had forgot
[2:46:12.940 --> 2:46:18.220]  that I went live and I posted the tail fin on the plane well we refueled and as we were
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:22.660]  getting on the runway it was like a scene from con air you saw all these cops coming
[2:46:22.660 --> 2:46:27.020]  up the airport and we literally just tug off literally so this is the kind of stuff we
[2:46:27.020 --> 2:46:31.820]  deal with all because you're promoting freedom yeah all because I'm trying to inform Canadians
[2:46:31.820 --> 2:46:36.780]  of their rights and freedoms and here's how it works I bet that pilot didn't feel intimidated
[2:46:36.780 --> 2:46:42.540]  he felt empowered by that that pilot has been a business owner in Canada since he's nineteen
[2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:48.780]  years old he's almost sixty and he's ready to pick up and move out of the country he sees
[2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:54.060]  me and people like me as the last hope for this country and a lot of people see that
[2:46:54.060 --> 2:46:59.740]  a lot of people to the point where people are begging me begging me to run for prime
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:04.380]  minister of Canada and to me it's like a joke but at the same because not the thing I would
[2:47:04.380 --> 2:47:08.500]  want to do there's a thousand other jobs I could say I'd rather do than that but to
[2:47:08.500 --> 2:47:13.020]  be honest I told everybody that I would do anything I need to do to win this fight and
[2:47:13.020 --> 2:47:19.420]  if it came down to it and I had to I would do it well Chris I hear you because evil
[2:47:19.420 --> 2:47:23.420]  is taking over I have tears in my eyes because if more people just do what you're doing we
[2:47:23.420 --> 2:47:30.660]  would win we got calls to get to here so who's up first here who's been home the longest
[2:47:30.660 --> 2:47:35.100]  that would be uh yep Dave in the UK dive in the UK go ahead you're on the air with Chris
[2:47:35.100 --> 2:47:41.660]  Guy can you hear me Alex yes sir go ahead uh it means a lot to me that you're taking
[2:47:41.660 --> 2:47:45.340]  my call I've been listening to you for years a lot to me brother I love you go ahead the
[2:47:45.340 --> 2:47:50.620]  info war keeps me strong um before I tell you about my reaction to the vaccine and situation
[2:47:50.620 --> 2:47:55.660]  in the UK I want to make a kind of quick plug because the benefit system and job market is
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:48:01.140]  a mess here so I've little money so what I do is gorilla style awakenings I make my
[2:48:01.140 --> 2:48:06.340]  own stickers I've got an old school cd burner to share end game recordings of your broadcast
[2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:11.860]  you name it I do it because if I can just wake up one person with a sticker or sharing
[2:48:11.860 --> 2:48:19.940]  a burnt dvd waking up one person is waking up the universe absolutely um but yeah so
[2:48:19.940 --> 2:48:25.900]  um so far I've had my first Pfizer shot and at first I thought yeah all right bit still
[2:48:25.900 --> 2:48:33.420]  on the arm 48 hours after my shot my entire left arm apart from my fingertips goes numb
[2:48:33.420 --> 2:48:38.260]  completely paralyzed for another 48 hours I was like the police inspector from young
[2:48:38.260 --> 2:48:47.700]  Frankenstein the one who has to move his arm with his other arm wow and it's working now
[2:48:47.700 --> 2:48:52.140]  I was that close to calling you know the ER or something going yeah this isn't right
[2:48:52.140 --> 2:48:56.100]  and obviously I'm hesitant about my second shot but the only way I can get out of the
[2:48:56.100 --> 2:49:01.020]  UK is to get my second shot and then bomb out to Norway so I can live in the woods with
[2:49:01.020 --> 2:49:07.660]  my friends well that sounds good brother I wish I was in Norway with you and your friends
[2:49:07.660 --> 2:49:14.780]  so so you you took the shot and had a problem yeah yeah and I and all my other friends
[2:49:14.780 --> 2:49:18.660]  that have had reactions and stuff they've kept it so shut so shush so shdum you know
[2:49:18.660 --> 2:49:22.780]  they don't want to talk about it they don't want to spread their truth you know it's not
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:27.380]  like I just want to be heard we just want to be heard but we get dismissed by even our
[2:49:27.380 --> 2:49:33.340]  own friends and family and it's people like us they'll blame us and will be the reason
[2:49:33.340 --> 2:49:37.500]  to tighten the leash over and over as you keep saying well dad we love you and keep
[2:49:37.500 --> 2:49:41.580]  calling back let's talk to another caller here we'll Chris go on the line with us let's
[2:49:41.580 --> 2:49:47.180]  talk to Matt Canada you want to say something but but he said about the vaccine if I'm talking
[2:49:47.180 --> 2:49:52.740]  to a group of 3,000 people I'll ask them how many of you know someone who got killed or
[2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:57.180]  was severely injured by COVID and you'll literally be able to count the number of hands in the
[2:49:57.180 --> 2:50:02.380]  air then I'll ask the same audience how many of you know someone who was killed or severely
[2:50:02.380 --> 2:50:08.700]  injured by the vaccine and every single time at least 60 to 70% of the hands in the audience
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:12.260]  regardless of the size of the audience go up and that should tell you everything you
[2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:21.220]  need to know about that lethal injection absolutely all right Matt in Canada lockdowns give us
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:29.980]  your view on it hi Alex welcome thanks for having me on your show well I don't know what
[2:50:29.980 --> 2:50:35.380]  to say about what's going on up here in Canada I had a friend named Derek Sorbel on head
[2:50:35.380 --> 2:50:42.420]  of Occupy Canada he passed away in a mysterious way back in February when COVID started he
[2:50:42.420 --> 2:50:48.860]  told me about how the police were tracking him for a long time chasing him around searching
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:56.260]  his laptop anyways these Canadians up here need to wake up we need to stand up we need
[2:50:56.260 --> 2:51:05.260]  to fight verbally fight get out there on the streets I agree it's time for pushback hyper
[2:51:05.260 --> 2:51:12.940]  action keep going Matt what else happened but I never committed any of the crimes they
[2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:18.180]  said I committed up here in Canada but I have a criminal record now so they I'm hindered
[2:51:18.180 --> 2:51:23.140]  now I'm hindered by these Canadians and these Canadians right now need to wake up because
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:28.740]  we're not strong enough in this fight right now he's 100% right what the government does
[2:51:28.740 --> 2:51:33.820]  to you if they see you as a threat they use the emergency orders to arrest you on some
[2:51:33.820 --> 2:51:38.580]  innocuous charge and then they give you a whole bunch of conditions that are now criminal
[2:51:38.580 --> 2:51:43.380]  charges if you greets them which were just normal freedoms for instance my conditions
[2:51:43.380 --> 2:51:48.680]  include not being able to drive not being able to fly not being able to speak anywhere
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:54.300]  in Ontario with a certain amount of people having to be on bail and needing permission
[2:51:54.300 --> 2:51:59.180]  from the man who bailed me out to even stay at home with my wife that's how strict my
[2:51:59.180 --> 2:52:04.420]  conditions of release are because I'm such a threat to the government not the people
[2:52:04.420 --> 2:52:08.060]  let's be clear I'm not a threat to the people at all I'm a threat to the government's agenda
[2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:12.780]  all right stay there Chris Guy hour number four thank you Matt with Stuart full metal

[2:56:01.860 --> 2:56:06.780]  gonna turn loose now they're never gonna end the lockdown now until we expose them if we
[2:56:06.780 --> 2:56:11.340]  don't defeat the lockdown now it's gonna turn into climate lockdowns after this and they're
[2:56:11.340 --> 2:56:15.180]  gonna just keep going and then they're gonna use environmental regulations to finish off
[2:56:15.180 --> 2:56:19.780]  the last transfer of wealth and property that we have left and then they're gonna get their
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:24.580]  great reset they're gonna get their world in 2035 where the average person can't buy
[2:56:24.580 --> 2:56:29.100]  a car the average person lives in 150 square feet the average person lives from home the
[2:56:29.100 --> 2:56:33.900]  average person never travels to other countries that's not a life we want and I know that
[2:56:33.900 --> 2:56:39.660]  millions not even millions billions of people are willing to fight for their freedom and
[2:56:39.660 --> 2:56:43.780]  I'm gonna make sure cuz I'm gonna put a fire under their ass and I'm not gonna stop until
[2:56:43.780 --> 2:56:47.940]  we win and they're not gonna be able to stop me they haven't stopped me yet they only made
[2:56:47.940 --> 2:56:51.940]  me stronger and they're only gonna keep making me strong oh you're an example of future my
[2:56:51.940 --> 2:56:58.020]  friend and it shows how greedy and evil they are that they are trying this I mean this
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:03.420]  is outrageously obvious but they keep doing it because they never get held accountable
[2:57:03.420 --> 2:57:07.740]  in closing how do we hold them accountable how do we hold your prime minister that says
[2:57:07.740 --> 2:57:13.500]  I want to be a Chinese dictator or Biden a Chinese agent how do we hold them accountable
[2:57:13.500 --> 2:57:18.620]  that's phase three of united non-compliance Alex and we do it by phase two taking action
[2:57:18.620 --> 2:57:22.780]  everybody needs to take off their mask everybody needs to open their business everybody needs
[2:57:22.780 --> 2:57:27.940]  to just say no to the vaccine and all the other restrictions and then if you really
[2:57:27.940 --> 2:57:32.100]  want to be able to hold them accountable you can you can get your freedom back without
[2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:37.420]  an election with an election we can hold them accountable you elect the right person we can
[2:57:37.420 --> 2:57:43.580]  hold them accountable am I the right person maybe I am a sham in a color from Canada let's
[2:57:43.580 --> 2:57:48.580]  talk to full metal Charlie in Canada go ahead you're on here with Chris guy hey Alex how
[2:57:48.580 --> 2:57:56.580]  you doing brother good brother yeah I fully support Chris guy I've been following this
[2:57:56.580 --> 2:58:02.980]  movement from the beginning and I knew a year ago that it was the bologna virus that's exactly
[2:58:02.980 --> 2:58:10.700]  what it was bologna virus yeah yeah totally and I know Canada sent out an SOS to the US
[2:58:10.700 --> 2:58:17.220]  well I'm an American living in southern Ontario and I'm known as the big mouth American so
[2:58:17.220 --> 2:58:25.340]  if you want my advice Canadians need to get rid of the word fear and accept the word no
[2:58:25.340 --> 2:58:32.220]  and start using it because they're off lose yeah a lot what we have up here right now
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:39.060]  is the army of the afraid and the confused I have people who got the facts that agreed
[2:58:39.060 --> 2:58:45.780]  with me and they're having problems you know they took their their boot off our neck a
[2:58:45.780 --> 2:58:50.380]  little bit and everybody's walking around in la la la land going off this is what it's
[2:58:50.380 --> 2:58:57.100]  like some kind of freedom this isn't freedom they're going to put the boot back on real
[2:58:57.100 --> 2:59:05.740]  soon and it is coming so Canada if if you really want to have this flight all you have
[2:59:05.740 --> 2:59:13.540]  to do is say no it's very very simple and honor I'm honored to be alive right now to
[2:59:13.540 --> 2:59:18.180]  look at that one in the eye up here I'm known as big mouth American because I don't care
[2:59:18.180 --> 2:59:24.660]  I say what I want attack me go ahead because we've got so much to lose Canada was once
[2:59:24.660 --> 2:59:32.100]  known as the country where everybody was cool I agree with Joe Rogan eighty percent where
[2:59:32.100 --> 2:59:37.300]  I'm sorry twenty percent less of a jerk up here but it's that Canadian sense of politeness
[2:59:37.300 --> 2:59:41.820]  and not upsetting the apple cart that's got Canadians by the throat has been used against
[2:59:41.820 --> 2:59:50.140]  you all right Chris guy full metal Charlie thank you so much we'll be right back it is
[2:59:50.140 --> 2:59:56.500]  through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and
[2:59:56.500 --> 3:00:01.660]  the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[3:00:01.660 --> 3:00:07.540]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal
[3:00:07.540 --> 3:00:12.700]  gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for
[3:00:12.700 --> 3:00:17.580]  millennia the Hindu chakras aligned with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with
[3:00:17.580 --> 3:00:23.820]  the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is
[3:00:23.820 --> 3:00:30.220]  what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[3:00:30.220 --> 3:00:36.180]  fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration
[3:00:36.180 --> 3:00:41.580]  systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the
[3:00:41.580 --> 3:00:47.660]  propure shower head will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or a friend at
[3:00:47.660 --> 3:00:59.140]  infowarstore.com
[3:00:59.140 --> 3:01:04.420]  all right hello welcome everyone I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman your guest host once again for the
[3:01:04.420 --> 3:01:10.700]  Alex Jones show and thank you so much Alex and Chris Sky for that last segment it's great
[3:01:10.700 --> 3:01:19.900]  to see Chris's courage to be a rebel against the tyranny in Canada well today I have a
[3:01:19.900 --> 3:01:28.100]  very special guest as well Karen Kingston is planning to join us and she is a consultant
[3:01:28.100 --> 3:01:34.140]  from the pharmaceutical and medical device industry who has recently decided to go public
[3:01:34.140 --> 3:01:39.860]  with some very important information not only about the ingredients in the so-called covid
[3:01:39.860 --> 3:01:47.500]  vaccines but also some inside information about the clinical trials and some of the obfuscation
[3:01:47.500 --> 3:01:54.420]  of data and and outcome information that we have seen in the recent past so Karen are
[3:01:54.420 --> 3:02:07.020]  you with us welcome to the Alex Jones show yes we do so Karen you've been you've been
[3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:11.620]  very courageous in the past couple of weeks could you tell us a little bit about your
[3:02:11.620 --> 3:02:19.580]  background and how you decided to speak publicly about these issues sure I am I've been in
[3:02:19.580 --> 3:02:25.140]  a pharma med device industry for just over 25 years now and I had my own full service
[3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:28.820]  consulting agency for a number of years and I've been an independent consultant for the
[3:02:28.820 --> 3:02:34.780]  past 10 years sometimes I'm an interim CMO or marketing director for international companies
[3:02:34.780 --> 3:02:39.940]  but basically I'm an analyst so I had companies hire me to take a look at all the clinical
[3:02:39.940 --> 3:02:48.700]  data the IP landscape med legal regular regulatory guidelines and legislation case law and I
[3:02:48.700 --> 3:02:55.820]  basically come up with strategies and messaging to best move forward to you know continue to
[3:02:55.820 --> 3:03:03.300]  grow their market share and also take a look at potential IP extensions for products well
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:08.620]  that's quite a broad category of expertise so this includes like the patent landscape
[3:03:08.620 --> 3:03:15.260]  the intellectual property it includes regulatory issues as well as marketing and business strategies
[3:03:15.260 --> 3:03:21.500]  is that am I summing it up correctly yeah because there's strategic business units within companies
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:25.500]  so there's portfolios of products so you have to decide what you're going to focus on where
[3:03:25.500 --> 3:03:28.660]  you have the greatest opportunity for growth and what you need to just continue so you
[3:03:28.660 --> 3:03:34.140]  have to understand the your your IP as well as a competitive landscape for a long term
[3:03:34.140 --> 3:03:40.340]  growth strategy if that makes sense so this yes absolutely so this must give you you know
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:46.380]  a lot of exposure to various inside conversations correspondence and back and forth with regulatory
[3:03:46.380 --> 3:03:53.780]  agencies that would kind of inform your expertise to the current situation no I work directly
[3:03:53.780 --> 3:03:58.980]  with the law lawyers of the companies or the C level executives and they're also their
[3:03:58.980 --> 3:04:04.100]  clinical staff their MDs and PhDs so I don't present my own information I give my information
[3:04:04.100 --> 3:04:11.180]  to to those individuals and then they presented to the FDA or you know or investors or what
[3:04:11.180 --> 3:04:16.740]  not not me right but I mean you see some of the correspondence and you talk to these people
[3:04:16.740 --> 3:04:21.220]  right so you kind of know a little bit about the workings of the company and the and the
[3:04:21.220 --> 3:04:25.820]  regulation and the industry in general oh yeah I get the I see the morning letters and
[3:04:25.820 --> 3:04:32.460]  things like that yeah yeah yeah so what led what led you to you know come in and speak
[3:04:32.460 --> 3:04:40.540]  out with the the information that you're currently talking about well I think everyone who works
[3:04:40.540 --> 3:04:47.460]  in the industry and understands via viruses and pandemics you know from the get go we
[3:04:47.460 --> 3:04:50.740]  probably saw back in March of last year that it seemed like we were getting set up for a
[3:04:50.740 --> 3:04:56.420]  vaccine rollout and you know that was suspicious but nothing too alarming it's kind of like
[3:04:56.420 --> 3:05:00.300]  well this is big form of doing their thing again and you know and I always when I looked
[3:05:00.300 --> 3:05:05.660]  at the data I was like okay it's a palliative treatment and which isn't a vaccine and that
[3:05:05.660 --> 3:05:11.820]  that is what it is but when they started saying they wanted to go and inject children whose
[3:05:11.820 --> 3:05:17.860]  natural immune system is far superior than any vaccine or product could be I mean just
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:22.300]  their their natural immune response you couldn't make something statistically or clinically
[3:05:22.300 --> 3:05:27.420]  superior to that that was when a red flag went off and I thought I would just start investigating
[3:05:27.420 --> 3:05:33.540]  more the data that I could find online from the FDA filings as well as you know some of
[3:05:33.540 --> 3:05:40.220]  the studies that were done to just prove that it wasn't necessary for children to get injected
[3:05:40.220 --> 3:05:46.900]  and when I found the patents I was very alarmed because they didn't read as a vaccine they
[3:05:46.900 --> 3:05:52.860]  read as a bio weapon basically and then I went back and I found some of the original
[3:05:52.860 --> 3:05:58.500]  studies where they used bat coronaviruses and spike them if you will they used you know
[3:05:58.500 --> 3:06:06.420]  they created these chimeric superviruses using HIV glycoproteins and the GAG protein and
[3:06:06.420 --> 3:06:15.140]  it was very alarming and upsetting and when I realized what Americans were making themselves
[3:06:15.140 --> 3:06:23.900]  susceptible to it just it was an anchor on my heart so I put together a two-page email
[3:06:23.900 --> 3:06:29.460]  with all the references and the studies and the patents and I sent it out to about 30
[3:06:29.460 --> 3:06:37.180]  or so media outlets and influencers well that's fantastic and I'm so glad that you decided
[3:06:37.180 --> 3:06:43.740]  to make this important contribution so let's get right into the vaccine technology and
[3:06:43.740 --> 3:06:47.020]  if you could bring up the first slide please.
[3:06:47.020 --> 3:06:56.140]  So this is a representation of the ingredients in the vaccines and I know that Karen you
[3:06:56.140 --> 3:07:02.220]  expressed some serious concern about one particular ingredient and if you look at the slide here
[3:07:02.220 --> 3:07:09.460]  it's the longest names it has crazy names these chemicals but if you could go to slide
[3:07:09.460 --> 3:07:15.260]  two Karen why don't you tell us a little bit about the so-called lipid nanoparticles.
[3:07:15.260 --> 3:07:20.060]  Sure and if you're looking at the ingredients slide it's that you know 80 or so alphanumeric
[3:07:20.060 --> 3:07:27.740]  that ends in the 2000 the PEG 2000 that stands for polyethylene glycol 2000 you can find
[3:07:27.740 --> 3:07:33.780]  that listed in the Moderna patent I think it's on page 29 or 30 the Moderna patent and so
[3:07:33.780 --> 3:07:39.940]  basically the lipid nanoparticles are made up of four lipids so keep in mind that mRNA
[3:07:39.940 --> 3:07:45.180]  or RNA viruses single-healed expires are very unstable 80 degree weather kills them sunlight
[3:07:45.180 --> 3:07:52.020]  kills them even the inventors of the mRNA vaccine say if you look at it wrong it falls
[3:07:52.020 --> 3:07:56.820]  apart so they needed to create a biosphere to protect it so the biosphere contains four
[3:07:56.820 --> 3:08:02.060]  lipids one is cholesterol our blood loves cholesterol the second is a phospholipid the
[3:08:02.060 --> 3:08:10.420]  phospholipid enables the lipid nanoparticle to adhere to the cell membrane for penetration
[3:08:10.420 --> 3:08:15.100]  there's an ionizable lipid so that gives it a positive ionic charge for penetration and
[3:08:15.100 --> 3:08:19.820]  then there's the pegalated lipid which is the polyethylene glycol lipid and all you know
[3:08:19.820 --> 3:08:24.740]  evidence shows you know if you take a look at where it's being manufactured and what's
[3:08:24.740 --> 3:08:32.140]  in it it has a graphing oxide in it as well and graphing oxide it can withstand 1700 degree
[3:08:32.140 --> 3:08:37.300]  Fahrenheit temperature it's 4,000 times higher than titanium so basically the inventors took
[3:08:37.300 --> 3:08:44.820]  a very unstable molecule a single helix RNA or synthetic RNA molecule protein and they
[3:08:44.820 --> 3:08:49.060]  encapsulated it in a biosphere that made it indestructible.
[3:08:49.060 --> 3:08:55.900]  Wow so if I could summarize Karen that basically what we have here is that that the manufacturers
[3:08:55.900 --> 3:09:03.060]  are trying to deliver either a piece of messenger RNA to the cells and the people that are vaccinated
[3:09:03.060 --> 3:09:09.300]  and of course we know that mRNA as a just a standalone molecule and by the way the mRNA
[3:09:09.300 --> 3:09:14.660]  that's in these injections is actually made synthetically not by a natural organism but
[3:09:14.660 --> 3:09:22.300]  it's very unstable right so it needs two things it needs protection right and so these spherical
[3:09:22.300 --> 3:09:27.580]  nanoparticles made of these lipids which are is another name for fats right protects it
[3:09:27.580 --> 3:09:33.860]  so that it's stable and then also it is like a delivery vehicle right kind of like it has
[3:09:33.860 --> 3:09:40.260]  the address for a cell written on it and those lipids help it fuse with the cell membrane
[3:09:40.260 --> 3:09:48.300]  and deliver that mRNA and another name for these lipid nanoparticles is hydrogels and
[3:09:48.300 --> 3:09:54.340]  that's going to be important to see look at some of the research that we're going to examine
[3:09:54.340 --> 3:10:01.940]  with respect to graphene oxide so once again we have Karen Kingston pharmaceutical and
[3:10:01.940 --> 3:10:08.220]  medical device insider on the Alex Jones show and I'm your host Dr. Andrew Kaufman filling
[3:10:08.220 --> 3:10:15.140]  in this week for the fourth hour and when we come back we'll be talking more about the
[3:10:15.140 --> 3:10:21.540]  ingredients of vaccines with a special focus on graphene oxide and the toxicity of the
[3:10:21.540 --> 3:10:48.860]  hydrogel lipid nanoparticles please stay tuned for more information
[3:10:48.860 --> 3:10:53.660]  Hello I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that

[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:11.780]  and welcome back to the alex jones show once again i'm your guest host for this fourth
[3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:17.280]  hour dr andrew kaufman and I have with me today pharmaceutical and medical device industry
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:23.620]  consultant and insider Karen Kingston and we had just begin talking about some of the
[3:13:23.620 --> 3:13:29.380]  ingredients in the vaccine as specifically the lipid nanoparticles and if we could have
[3:13:29.380 --> 3:13:35.500]  slide number three this is just a representation to see that these particles actually are distributed
[3:13:35.500 --> 3:13:46.980]  very very widely throughout the body and seem to be concentrated in the sorry in the genital
[3:13:46.980 --> 3:13:51.940]  and reproductive system so that's something to be important of and if we go to the next
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:13:59.180]  slide after that so Karen has uncovered a sort of chain of custody or supply chain of
[3:13:59.180 --> 3:14:06.940]  custody of the vaccine manufacturers using graphene oxide in these hydrogel lipid nanoparticles
[3:14:06.940 --> 3:14:12.620]  so Karen you want to tell us a little bit about what you've uncovered and I can't my
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:19.100]  screen is completely frozen i'm not sure what you're sharing right now i'm so sorry so that's
[3:14:19.100 --> 3:14:26.700]  okay you don't have to worry about the about what's being shown but you were talking about
[3:14:26.700 --> 3:14:31.500]  uncovering that there's a Chinese manufacturer that makes many of the
[3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:38.860]  ingredients on the screen so if you if you take a look at the ingredients that are listed
[3:14:38.860 --> 3:14:44.940]  in the FDA phase three filings and the initial new drug application for the mRNA vaccines
[3:14:44.940 --> 3:14:51.740]  that's Pfizer and Moderna you'll see that they have a seven digit alphanumeric names
[3:14:51.740 --> 3:14:59.020]  i believe the fires wonder probably showing is a lc 0159 that is the the material safety
[3:14:59.020 --> 3:15:04.940]  base data sheet cast number if you go to a company called synopeg.com you can search by
[3:15:04.940 --> 3:15:13.100]  those cast numbers the category the category um numbers and it'll pull up um the that 80
[3:15:13.100 --> 3:15:22.460]  alphanumeric name of the the lipid nanoparticle and what you'll find is there's a whole
[3:15:23.340 --> 3:15:32.300]  tab on COVID-19 excipients for these mRNA LMP vaccines and those are not just for the United
[3:15:32.300 --> 3:15:39.020]  States vaccines but for other vaccines that that require this encapsulation and on the site they
[3:15:39.020 --> 3:15:48.460]  also do talk about how these are polyethylene glycol graphene oxide um uh cores or some shells
[3:15:48.460 --> 3:15:55.100]  core shells and uh there's some studies that have been done in animals with the fire and biotech
[3:15:57.420 --> 3:16:02.860]  vaccine and and and what you'll find is those link back to um other studies that talk about
[3:16:02.860 --> 3:16:10.540]  how these LMPs are used as a theronostic which is also listed in the Moderna vaccine uh because the
[3:16:10.540 --> 3:16:16.860]  graphene oxide is an excellent conductor of electromagnetic fields for diagnostic purposes
[3:16:16.860 --> 3:16:21.980]  theronostic stands for therapeutic and diagnostic so without seeing this stuff and walking you guys
[3:16:21.980 --> 3:16:27.580]  through it it sounds you know it's there's there's many documents that tie together and
[3:16:27.580 --> 3:16:34.060]  and they have the same exact um alphanumeric codes they have the same diagrams and you know they all
[3:16:34.060 --> 3:16:40.940]  go back to the the patent or this company in china and and peer review publications and also
[3:16:40.940 --> 3:16:46.700]  chemical and engineering news which is the uh non peer review journal for this this industry
[3:16:47.900 --> 3:16:52.220]  right now Karen so you know it sounds like you've done some real detective work here and and what
[3:16:52.220 --> 3:16:57.820]  and and what you're describing is essentially if you track down where the drug companies that make
[3:16:57.820 --> 3:17:04.220]  these so-called vaccines actually buy the various ingredients and then you look at various regulatory
[3:17:04.220 --> 3:17:10.220]  documents and suppliers and find right buried in their intellectual property and in articles on
[3:17:10.220 --> 3:17:15.900]  their website that they're essentially using graphene oxide in combination with these and this
[3:17:15.900 --> 3:17:21.820]  really shouldn't be terribly surprising because um after graphene oxide was invented which led
[3:17:21.820 --> 3:17:28.940]  or graphene which led to a Nobel Prize being awarded the european union established the graphene
[3:17:28.940 --> 3:17:37.900]  flagship which was at a 10 billion euro uh sorry a 1 billion euro uh enterprise to fund all research
[3:17:37.900 --> 3:17:43.500]  related to graphene and much of it was in the biomedical space so if we look for example at
[3:17:43.500 --> 3:17:50.940]  slide four we find that uh graphene based hydrogels because that's what we're talking about graphene
[3:17:50.940 --> 3:17:58.220]  oxide being uh essentially intermingled with the lipid nanoparticle shell that we see that it is
[3:17:58.220 --> 3:18:06.060]  successful for gene delivery which is exactly what the Moderna and Pfizer products are alleged to do
[3:18:06.060 --> 3:18:13.580]  and if we go to the slide after that then we'll see that actually graphene oxide has been tested
[3:18:13.580 --> 3:18:24.620]  in a flu vaccine before and one more slide we can find a coronavirus vaccine patent from China
[3:18:24.620 --> 3:18:31.660]  that also uses graphene oxide and graphene is you know talked about as a miracle material because
[3:18:31.660 --> 3:18:39.340]  it has some very unusual properties and it can add that functionality that Karen was alluding to
[3:18:39.340 --> 3:18:46.700]  for therapeutic like drug delivery gene delivery as well as potentially diagnostic purposes so
[3:18:46.700 --> 3:18:55.980]  we could be injected with nanoparticles to tell us that we are sick so please sorry can i ask
[3:18:55.980 --> 3:18:59.340]  what you're saying in regards to graphene oxide i think it's important for people to know that
[3:18:59.340 --> 3:19:05.500]  Moderna was uh an oncology a cancer uh therapy company it was not a vaccine company so there's
[3:19:05.500 --> 3:19:11.820]  about i found of over two dozen articles on graphene oxide for ovarian cancer treatment so i
[3:19:11.820 --> 3:19:18.140]  just want to read a couple titles to you to to just solidify that Moderna has been researching
[3:19:18.140 --> 3:19:23.980]  graphene oxide for for various reasons are all or in all of oncology using gene therapy so
[3:19:23.980 --> 3:19:30.780]  graphene oxide silver nano composites enhance cytotoxic and apoptoxic potential um in human
[3:19:30.780 --> 3:19:36.380]  ovarian cancer cells cytotoxic means it kills cells and apoptoxic means cell death so that's
[3:19:36.380 --> 3:19:42.380]  what that means sorry by mispronounced reduced graphene oxide silver nanoparticle
[3:19:42.380 --> 3:19:48.700]  nanocomposites a potential anti-cancer nanotherapy this is the international journal of nanomedicine
[3:19:52.860 --> 3:19:57.740]  lipid nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery current perspectives this is a great one because
[3:19:57.740 --> 3:20:05.100]  this actually specifically goes over the mRNA vaccines this is published in um where is this
[3:20:05.100 --> 3:20:11.260]  published it's an all-severe all-severe um sorry i don't see the publication name on here anyway
[3:20:11.260 --> 3:20:16.780]  there's there's dozens of of studies with graphene oxide used in in lipid nanoparticle
[3:20:16.780 --> 3:20:23.500]  delivery and in ovarian cancer treatment specifically to um annihilate or wipe out those
[3:20:23.500 --> 3:20:30.380]  ovarian cancer cells and it's just coincidental that the the data from japan um under the freedom
[3:20:30.380 --> 3:20:35.660]  information act showed that the lipid nanoparticles go through the blood and then end up in the ovaries
[3:20:35.660 --> 3:20:43.500]  and then as well as in bone marrow absolutely and we also know from the study of of graphene
[3:20:43.500 --> 3:20:48.780]  specifically that it tends to accumulate in organs and tissues over time because the body
[3:20:48.780 --> 3:20:54.700]  doesn't have a ready-made mechanism to get rid of it and karen i'm so glad you brought up those
[3:20:54.700 --> 3:21:01.340]  cancer research but but really it's just the tip of the iceberg if you start searching in the medical
[3:21:01.340 --> 3:21:06.380]  and scientific literature for biomedical applications of graphene you're going to be
[3:21:06.380 --> 3:21:13.260]  overwhelmed with dozens and dozens probably hundreds of articles um because there are books
[3:21:13.260 --> 3:21:21.020]  published and over a thousand uh peer reviewed publications on this topic so it is highly uh
[3:21:21.020 --> 3:21:27.900]  prominent in the developing technology and you know we we talked about this also specifically
[3:21:27.900 --> 3:21:35.740]  in terms of a gene therapy because that's really uh what modernist research and product development
[3:21:35.740 --> 3:21:44.220]  has been all about and that is the real technology that is being used for these vaccines and
[3:21:44.220 --> 3:21:49.740]  interestingly though this has been exploited by you know listeners call into the show and they thank
[3:21:49.740 --> 3:21:56.220]  me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support constantly
[3:21:56.780 --> 3:22:02.140]  for prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and and we're all this together and i you
[3:22:02.140 --> 3:22:06.300]  know it gets old having to come to you and say hey i got great products please bomb or we won't be
[3:22:06.300 --> 3:22:10.300]  here on air but it's true for the only media organization in the united states that promotes
[3:22:10.300 --> 3:22:15.500]  liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost
[3:22:15.500 --> 3:22:19.660]  shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole
[3:22:19.660 --> 3:22:24.780]  new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken
[3:22:24.780 --> 3:22:29.420]  off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:22:29.420 --> 3:22:34.300]  and america's still quasi-free you can't have info wars has been proven right be it on air
[3:22:34.300 --> 3:22:38.780]  with all the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready
[3:22:38.780 --> 3:22:44.060]  so thank you all and get an infowarstore.com get some great 2020 election shirts supplements and
[3:22:44.060 --> 3:22:47.020]  so much more they're wonderful products and they support the info we're thanking
[3:22:50.380 --> 3:22:55.100]  good globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[3:22:55.100 --> 3:23:03.980]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[3:23:03.980 --> 3:23:12.060]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves
[3:23:13.180 --> 3:23:16.940]  worsted slaves it's just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[3:23:17.980 --> 3:23:24.540]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic
[3:23:24.540 --> 3:23:30.300]  control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare
[3:23:30.300 --> 3:23:34.780]  dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[3:23:35.500 --> 3:23:40.780]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only
[3:23:40.780 --> 3:23:46.380]  choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip
[3:23:46.380 --> 3:23:51.420]  of the spear fighting it when listeners call to the show and thank me for all i've done i always
[3:23:51.420 --> 3:23:56.940]  stop them i say thank you for what you've done thank you for keeping info wars on the air thank you
[3:23:56.940 --> 3:24:02.140]  for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word if all of you will simply go to info

[3:25:51.420 --> 3:25:54.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:26:08.620]  special guest karen kingston
[3:26:09.180 --> 3:26:13.900]  pharmaceutical and medical device industry consultant and insider welcome back
[3:26:14.860 --> 3:26:22.620]  so karen before the break we were just about to get into the regulatory aspects of the so-called
[3:26:22.620 --> 3:26:31.180]  vaccine products and we have been talking about them as gene therapy but that's not exactly how
[3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:38.460]  they were dealt with by the fda is that correct that's correct that that was just
[3:26:39.900 --> 3:26:47.500]  an intentional misnomer so that they could get the lase fair no liability under all the
[3:26:47.500 --> 3:26:55.020]  vaccine regulatory that allows them to not be held liable for any deaths or or injuries due
[3:26:55.020 --> 3:27:00.780]  to the vaccine so that was that there's there's nothing about them that that makes them a vaccine
[3:27:00.780 --> 3:27:05.740]  dr martin went over the u.s patent office's definition of a vaccine which is that it must
[3:27:05.740 --> 3:27:10.060]  prevent infection and this does not prevent infection and they actually sent a letter to
[3:27:10.060 --> 3:27:17.500]  dr fowchee i believe 2006 saying just because you uh elicit a immune immune response doesn't mean it's a
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:24.220]  immune response that merits a vaccine uh so and even if you take a look at the fda trials specifically
[3:27:24.220 --> 3:27:29.820]  i went through a lot of detail in the fizer biotech trials they they don't prevent infection as a
[3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:37.020]  matter of fact more patients were presenting with code 19 in the in the uh vaccine group than in the
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:42.860]  in the jet in the vaccine group than the placebo group are you wow yes and i want to get into the
[3:27:42.860 --> 3:27:49.500]  details of that but we isn't it true that there is actually a regulatory guidance document from
[3:27:49.500 --> 3:27:57.260]  fda and health and human services and if we could bring up slide seven which is a guidance for
[3:27:57.260 --> 3:28:06.300]  gene therapy products and um in in this guidance right by their own definition they say a gene
[3:28:06.300 --> 3:28:13.660]  therapy product is a product that mediates its effects by translation of transferred genetic
[3:28:13.660 --> 3:28:20.220]  material which is exactly how we've described this vaccine technology is it not caron
[3:28:21.420 --> 3:28:28.060]  yes it is and i this is another one of the documents i found on the fda website so the mrna
[3:28:28.060 --> 3:28:34.860]  vaccines are as you said here they are a synthetic um ribonucleic acid uh that through
[3:28:34.860 --> 3:28:41.420]  translation produces a virion which is the the spike protein uh in our end the people that have been
[3:28:41.420 --> 3:28:48.220]  right well let's just be clear it it produces the spike protein a virion would be a complete virus
[3:28:48.220 --> 3:28:54.060]  particle with the envelope the proteins in the envelope as well as the genetic material but here
[3:28:54.060 --> 3:29:00.220]  we don't have a complete genome of a virus organism we just have actually i don't even
[3:29:00.220 --> 3:29:05.740]  believe it's a complete spike protein gene i believe it's just a subunit of the spike protein but
[3:29:05.740 --> 3:29:11.980]  we have essentially one gene that is transcribed into a messenger RNA or in the johnson and johnson
[3:29:11.980 --> 3:29:18.940]  it's a dna product but it's not a complete it's supposed to basically make a protein but not
[3:29:18.940 --> 3:29:24.140]  a whole virus yeah that's correct it doesn't create the whole the whole virus it's a particle of the
[3:29:24.140 --> 3:29:32.220]  virus right and so if we look at the next slide um in this regulatory document it talks about
[3:29:32.220 --> 3:29:39.820]  shedding so you want to tell us uh what that is uh yeah according yeah this is not according to the
[3:29:39.820 --> 3:29:46.300]  fda what they talk about is that when you use gene therapies and you your body produces uh you know
[3:29:48.620 --> 3:29:53.900]  part of a virus so you know in this case it would be the spike protein there is a high risk that
[3:29:53.900 --> 3:30:01.740]  the those who are injected can then in fact be un-injected uh with that production that biological
[3:30:01.740 --> 3:30:06.140]  production of the spike protein that's basically what shedding is right they talk about that ever
[3:30:07.660 --> 3:30:15.340]  mm-hmm one so what whatever product basically the gene that they're using in the gene therapy
[3:30:15.340 --> 3:30:21.260]  and codes for right in this case it's the spike protein but like in a cancer patient it may be
[3:30:21.260 --> 3:30:26.620]  related to an oncogene or something like that right for a different gene therapy but that product
[3:30:26.620 --> 3:30:34.300]  is a foreign protein right to us and it can be since it's produced by our body or at least that's
[3:30:34.300 --> 3:30:40.700]  what they tell us right it can actually be then in our bodily secretions and can pass to another
[3:30:40.700 --> 3:30:48.860]  person right or be transmitted yeah and if it happens through different ways respiratory through
[3:30:48.860 --> 3:30:54.700]  your saliva through your breath there can be dermal transmission as well and and then they you know
[3:30:54.700 --> 3:31:01.820]  they talk about semen semen and feces um there there was an incident in bears where a mother was
[3:31:01.820 --> 3:31:09.500]  vaccinated after her second Pfizer vaccine her she was breastfeeding a five-month-old baby boy and
[3:31:09.500 --> 3:31:17.420]  he died from um that uh vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis um and he was obviously
[3:31:17.420 --> 3:31:23.820]  unvaccinated but through breast milk there was transmission wow and um i'll tell you that i've
[3:31:23.820 --> 3:31:29.980]  actually been also part of a survey research that we haven't released fully publicly yet
[3:31:29.980 --> 3:31:36.940]  but we have 5 000 subjects who were interviewed who had various symptoms that are the types of
[3:31:36.940 --> 3:31:44.380]  symptoms that people experience from the vaccine and we we did find that people who are intimate
[3:31:44.380 --> 3:31:50.300]  partners right in other words they exchange body fluids just like you discussed um now you discussed
[3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:55.900]  a parent child with nursing of course which is a slightly different relationship but we found in
[3:31:55.900 --> 3:32:03.340]  in a significantly increased risk of these symptoms when a intimate partner or family member that
[3:32:03.340 --> 3:32:10.860]  there's an exchange of body fluids um was vaccinated recently so this is something that the FDA
[3:32:10.860 --> 3:32:17.580]  really knew that was a risk and a possibility and don't they uh require this to be looked at in
[3:32:17.580 --> 3:32:23.820]  pre-clinical studies yeah they they require for it to be looked at in in the animal studies you
[3:32:23.820 --> 3:32:29.500]  know for for shedding to then determine whether or not it even merits to move on to human studies
[3:32:29.500 --> 3:32:35.980]  and then in human studies in the phase one trial if there is risk to those uh men and women of
[3:32:35.980 --> 3:32:41.180]  childbearing age or transmission to one another they're supposed to stop the trial but if you
[3:32:41.180 --> 3:32:47.820]  take a look at the phase one protocol in the IND for Pfizer what they did was they had um men who
[3:32:47.820 --> 3:32:53.580]  were intimate with women of childbearing age to use two forms of protection also those men
[3:32:53.580 --> 3:32:58.780]  were not allowed to be near or around a pregnant woman if they breathed near one they had to report
[3:32:58.780 --> 3:33:03.580]  it to the safety board and women were not allowed to participate if they were trying to get pregnant
[3:33:03.580 --> 3:33:08.940]  and that's completely normal um that's a normal protocol for most studies but what's not normal
[3:33:08.940 --> 3:33:16.220]  is that the male participant isn't even allowed to be around a pregnant woman um and he you know if
[3:33:16.220 --> 3:33:20.460]  if he does um if he is intimate with a woman not even getting a pregnant but just intimate
[3:33:20.460 --> 3:33:24.140]  with a woman who wasn't participating they had to report that to the safety board so
[3:33:24.780 --> 3:33:30.780]  the FDA was full aware of the fact that this was high risk of transmission and shedding
[3:33:30.780 --> 3:33:36.540]  with the vaccines um but if they excluded those groups from the phase one trial these studies
[3:33:36.540 --> 3:33:42.780]  could have never moved forward to phase two or three or now this open just free-for-all
[3:33:42.780 --> 3:33:54.220]  experiment so that's what happened um they it's quite they did a lot of just dubious and um
[3:33:54.220 --> 3:34:00.300]  honestly illegal lately illegal things and got away with it right so what we can really you know
[3:34:00.300 --> 3:34:05.180]  see here as you've described is that there are these requirements to look at this issue it's
[3:34:05.180 --> 3:34:10.780]  a known risk and we know that the FDA knows about this and we know that Pfizer and Moderna
[3:34:10.780 --> 3:34:16.860]  know about this because if we look in their um protocols right we see that they're actually
[3:34:16.860 --> 3:34:22.700]  taking steps to present prevent against this but they did not do the required clinical studies
[3:34:22.700 --> 3:34:27.340]  and in fact I'll tell you this is one of the most astounding things that I've discovered
[3:34:27.340 --> 3:34:34.140]  about these so-called gene therapy based vaccines is that they're all supposed to make
[3:34:34.140 --> 3:34:40.700]  the vaccinated produce right by this recombinant genetic technology the spike protein in one
[3:34:40.700 --> 3:34:46.380]  form or another but none of these companies before they put their products on the market
[3:34:47.020 --> 3:34:54.460]  even tested anyone to see if there's actually spike protein in people they gave the vaccine to
[3:34:54.460 --> 3:35:00.540]  there's only one um study available that even looks at this at all and it was done by independent
[3:35:00.540 --> 3:35:07.100]  researchers in Canada months after these products were on the market and it only looks at about a
[3:35:07.100 --> 3:35:13.340]  dozen people and it is not very conclusive but it's just astonishing that we don't even know
[3:35:14.060 --> 3:35:20.860]  if people getting these products actually make the spike protein well I have
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:26.540]  a break I have a study that an autopsy report that shows that there is spike protein throughout
[3:35:27.340 --> 3:35:33.660]  the different systems and organs of a person who died from being vaccinated so I think there's
[3:35:33.660 --> 3:35:39.420]  probably evidence we need to continue to look at to to prove that I my inclination strong
[3:35:39.420 --> 3:35:43.580]  inclination is that they are producing spike protein that is harmful and potentially deadly
[3:35:43.580 --> 3:35:49.740]  to people great and we'll be back after the break it's time to show them what a real alpha male

[3:36:41.180 --> 3:36:54.060]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on
[3:36:54.860 --> 3:37:00.540]  and that its criminals are extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same
[3:37:00.540 --> 3:37:06.540]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[3:37:06.540 --> 3:37:15.820]  well guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of hiv and the
[3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:20.460]  mistreatment of it with act and other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and they
[3:37:20.460 --> 3:37:25.660]  were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lynx
[3:37:25.660 --> 3:37:31.980]  besides the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[3:37:31.980 --> 3:37:37.580]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the covid-19
[3:37:37.580 --> 3:37:42.140]  and the vaccine because now they admit the covid-19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[3:37:42.140 --> 3:37:45.900]  basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen
[3:37:48.220 --> 3:37:53.900]  i'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021 and i just want to say something i am
[3:37:53.900 --> 3:37:58.620]  so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and
[3:37:58.620 --> 3:38:03.180]  is truly an answer to prayer and i am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners of this
[3:38:03.180 --> 3:38:07.740]  show i want you to know that i love you and i appreciate you whether you are old whether you
[3:38:07.740 --> 3:38:12.460]  are spanish white black it doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and
[3:38:12.460 --> 3:38:19.100]  if you love our innocent children we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible
[3:38:19.100 --> 3:38:23.660]  experience to work with you over the years and as crazy your things are i want to keep working
[3:38:23.660 --> 3:38:30.140]  into the future but again that's really up to you and up to god so please i hope god works through
[3:38:30.140 --> 3:38:35.100]  you and puts a message in your heart to support us but again that's up to you and your relationship
[3:38:35.100 --> 3:38:39.180]  with god i just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:38:39.180 --> 3:38:44.860]  done and just ask you again to pray to god and ask what god's vision is for you and hopefully god
[3:38:44.860 --> 3:38:50.380]  will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse god bless it is through our five senses
[3:38:50.380 --> 3:38:56.060]  that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through
[3:38:56.060 --> 3:39:02.940]  this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too
[3:39:02.940 --> 3:39:09.100]  much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[3:39:09.100 --> 3:39:13.980]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras aligned with the
[3:39:13.980 --> 3:39:19.660]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described
[3:39:19.660 --> 3:39:25.340]  as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[3:39:25.340 --> 3:39:31.500]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[3:39:31.500 --> 3:39:37.820]  our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your
[3:39:37.820 --> 3:39:43.900]  drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get them both today
[3:39:43.900 --> 3:39:54.140]  for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:40:02.860 --> 3:40:09.900]  show i'm your guest host dr andrew kaufman here in this fourth hour with my special guest caron
[3:40:09.900 --> 3:40:18.460]  kinkston pharmaceutical medical device industry insider and consultant uh caron i thought for
[3:40:18.460 --> 3:40:25.740]  this segment we could review some of the clinical trial data for the vaccines because you have some
[3:40:25.740 --> 3:40:33.020]  unique insights about some trickery and playing with numbers here that suggests they're far less
[3:40:33.020 --> 3:40:41.260]  effective than are they're touted to be sure if you want to pull up those those the slides for
[3:40:41.260 --> 3:40:46.940]  people to see them sure if we could have slide 11 please i think you start already starting with the
[3:40:46.940 --> 3:40:57.900]  ind so the ind well why don't you just tell us tell the viewers what an ind is so they okay so
[3:40:57.900 --> 3:41:03.500]  in the initial yeah so normally you would finish preclinical trials and show safety and efficacy
[3:41:03.500 --> 3:41:09.100]  in animals which they skipped most of inside letters of intense and then you file an initial
[3:41:09.100 --> 3:41:13.980]  new drug application with your preclinical data and you map out what you're going to be doing for
[3:41:13.980 --> 3:41:21.660]  your phase one uh two two trials and phase three and the safety and efficacy endpoints and phase
[3:41:21.660 --> 3:41:28.700]  one typically includes um healthy patients but this is this is uh the phase three endpoints um so in
[3:41:28.700 --> 3:41:34.220]  the ind what they talked about was that they would have 44 000 patients enrolled or subjects
[3:41:34.220 --> 3:41:41.580]  enrolled for the phase three trial 22 000 would be injected 22 000 would be placebo get saline
[3:41:41.580 --> 3:41:47.180]  and they assumed a 1.6 infection rate over a period of six months which would give them about
[3:41:47.180 --> 3:41:56.060]  165 to 169 infected people in the placebo group and i believe they got less 10 or less in the
[3:41:56.060 --> 3:42:02.540]  vaccine group then that would give them a 95 confidence interval of reducing reducing your
[3:42:02.540 --> 3:42:09.740]  risk of getting infected by 1 over six months so it's not very effective in and of itself
[3:42:09.740 --> 3:42:18.860]  but what's very odd is that their primary outcome they had 169 patients who tested positive via the
[3:42:18.860 --> 3:42:24.860]  pcr test one week after the second injection these people were not injected in the placebo group
[3:42:24.860 --> 3:42:30.860]  and only nine in the injection group one week after the second injection and what they concluded
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:39.660]  was that hey this is 95 effective in reducing your risk of getting um COVID-19 by one percent for one
[3:42:39.660 --> 3:42:46.620]  week after the second injection from the um Pfizer group so it's it's it's focused data and if you
[3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:52.620]  go on to the next slide you'll see at that same one week time point if you want to pull it up there
[3:42:52.620 --> 3:43:01.500]  was um it's the one before before that
[3:43:05.100 --> 3:43:08.700]  there's another slide i don't know why it's not here in the placebo group there was something
[3:43:08.700 --> 3:43:15.500]  like 400 and um or sorry in the placebo group there's something 289 people that presented with
[3:43:15.500 --> 3:43:21.660]  symptoms at the one week mark and there was i believe 407 in the treatment group and so what
[3:43:21.660 --> 3:43:27.020]  that showed was they were presenting at the same time point with COVID-19 symptoms but gosh darn
[3:43:27.020 --> 3:43:30.700]  it they didn't have enough time to test those people even though more people were presenting
[3:43:30.700 --> 3:43:37.900]  with symptoms um in the in the treatment group than in the placebo group not sure why that's
[3:43:37.900 --> 3:43:46.380]  not up but that's in the the phase the phase three uh trial the FDA trial it's in this document here
[3:43:46.380 --> 3:43:53.420]  um so so what we're saying what you're what you're saying here is that they kind of picked
[3:43:53.420 --> 3:44:00.620]  which time points they looked at after administering the vaccines to make sure that they could show
[3:44:00.620 --> 3:44:06.780]  that there were fewer cases is that it's worse it's worse than it's worse than that at one week
[3:44:06.780 --> 3:44:12.140]  they decided to run the the PCR test instead of waiting two weeks so if you look at the CDC website
[3:44:12.140 --> 3:44:17.660]  it says you don't produce monoclonal antibodies until two weeks after the second dose okay they
[3:44:17.660 --> 3:44:21.660]  tested at one week because too many people were getting sick in the treatment group but worse
[3:44:21.660 --> 3:44:26.220]  than that they had more people in the treatment group presenting with COVID-19 symptoms than in
[3:44:26.220 --> 3:44:32.460]  the placebo group but they decided they ran out of time to test the people in the placebo group
[3:44:32.460 --> 3:44:35.660]  or sort of test the people in the treatment group so they just tested the people in the placebo group
[3:44:35.660 --> 3:44:40.780]  and said hey look more people are getting sick in the in the placebo group so they think it's
[3:44:40.780 --> 3:44:47.500]  horrible what they did is that doesn't make sense sorry so so they they just neglected to do the
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:56.140]  testing yes they just neglected in the treatment group they just they only tested nine of them
[3:44:56.140 --> 3:45:04.140]  not all four hundred of them that were sick wow so basically they just omitted the data that would
[3:45:04.140 --> 3:45:11.900]  have showed that more people got sick from their vaccine than got sick from any natural cause exactly
[3:45:13.100 --> 3:45:18.700]  and this is really not surprising to any of us who have been following the devastating
[3:45:19.740 --> 3:45:27.500]  side effects mortality and serious illness that has occurred in people who have been vaccinated
[3:45:27.500 --> 3:45:35.260]  so essentially what we're seeing here is that Pfizer knew about this upfront and covered it up in
[3:45:35.260 --> 3:45:41.820]  order to make sure that their authorization went through so how did they regulators at the FDA not
[3:45:41.820 --> 3:45:51.740]  pick up on these discrepancies they did they ignored it I don't understand the yeah on October 20th
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:57.980]  or 22nd of 2020 they had a meeting where they went over all of the serious adverse events that they
[3:45:57.980 --> 3:46:03.660]  needed to keep an eye out on for these vaccines prior to authorization and it included gill's
[3:46:03.660 --> 3:46:08.460]  bar it included inflammation of the brain inflammation of the spine and included myocarditis
[3:46:08.460 --> 3:46:12.940]  pericarditis thrombocytopenia thrombosis I mean the list goes on and on and on they know these
[3:46:12.940 --> 3:46:20.460]  things are not only harmful but potentially lethal and they just ignored these the the
[3:46:20.460 --> 3:46:28.380]  fraudulent and erroneous analysis that was done on the data they just chose to you know turn a
[3:46:28.380 --> 3:46:34.380]  blind eye to it what there's an eight hour recording when when they started asking questions
[3:46:34.380 --> 3:46:38.380]  about can we go into more detail about how you measure these outcomes they just said nothing
[3:46:38.380 --> 3:46:47.260]  to see here move on to the next page it's recorded well so what you know I mean what do you think
[3:46:47.260 --> 3:46:52.300]  could have been going you know is what's going on behind the scenes that they're just ignoring this
[3:46:52.300 --> 3:46:57.820]  are they are they feeling pressure or are they you know in cahoots with the pharmaceutical
[3:46:57.820 --> 3:47:03.180]  industry I mean we certainly know there is a revolving door between you know various federal
[3:47:03.180 --> 3:47:09.500]  regulatory agencies and the industry but you know do you have a kind of theory on why they would just
[3:47:09.500 --> 3:47:15.900]  let this slide by and gloss over it the way that they did no I've never seen anything like this in
[3:47:15.900 --> 3:47:23.740]  my entire career and just historical review of of any of any over-the-counter or pharmaceutical
[3:47:23.740 --> 3:47:32.540]  or you know medical device therapy it just this is you know when when pausacore came out a few
[3:47:32.540 --> 3:47:38.220]  people got pacemakers and they recalled it resilience recall for liver function test increase
[3:47:38.220 --> 3:47:43.420]  you know I mean there's all these different recalls many drugs don't get through me you need
[3:47:43.420 --> 3:47:51.180]  to your safety data to put a stent in your eye you know and before you can roll it out to thousands
[3:47:51.180 --> 3:47:58.460]  of people and now we've injected over 150 million americans I think it's 164 or more 168 now so I
[3:47:58.460 --> 3:48:04.460]  there's no there's no explanation from a person with a sound mind and conscience to explain how
[3:48:04.460 --> 3:48:12.300]  this happened so you know I think that kind of leaves us to speculate that there is some outside
[3:48:12.300 --> 3:48:19.260]  influence here that's that is very very strong and I know you know in the medical service delivery
[3:48:19.260 --> 3:48:24.700]  side of the equation like for example in hospitals now I've talked with doctors who have you know
[3:48:24.700 --> 3:48:29.580]  tried to speak out a little bit about what's going on like for example saying that their hospitals
[3:48:29.580 --> 3:48:35.900]  are empty and what happens is that the administrators of the hospital you basically censure them give
[3:48:35.900 --> 3:48:42.540]  them a stern talking to because as has been reported there are all kinds of financial incentives
[3:48:42.540 --> 3:48:49.500]  for the hospitals they get paid more based on diagnosis using certain procedures like ventilators
[3:48:49.500 --> 3:48:55.580]  right so there could be very similar types of bribery or reimbursement schemes going on here
[3:48:55.580 --> 3:49:04.460]  but you know it shows that there is the ability of whoever is running the show to not just influence
[3:49:04.460 --> 3:49:11.900]  one person here or there but systematically to take over the not only the industry the the the
[3:49:12.780 --> 3:49:18.380]  private corporations in the industry but the the government agencies involved to essentially
[3:49:18.380 --> 3:49:25.020]  turn to Bly and I and let the corporate interests reign supreme with respect to all products COVID
[3:49:26.220 --> 3:49:33.340]  yeah to your point I mean there is definitely some monetary incentives for all parties involved
[3:49:33.340 --> 3:49:38.300]  here there's no question about that but even being silenced if you speak out I mean if people speak
[3:49:38.300 --> 3:49:45.180]  out whether they're scientists or physicians or if they were on the FDA they were going to be
[3:49:45.180 --> 3:49:52.060]  ostracized mocked ridiculed and kicked out of the industry so there's that aspect too that you know
[3:49:52.060 --> 3:49:58.940]  being shamed and ridiculed on top of you know not being able to financially make an income so
[3:49:58.940 --> 3:50:07.260]  there there's a lot of terrible influences that are going on that unfortunately people instead of
[3:50:07.260 --> 3:50:13.820]  doing what was right and in good conscience they they did what was you know the easiest thing for
[3:50:13.820 --> 3:50:22.780]  them to do fantastic well Karen I really so much appreciate you taking the time to enlighten us about
[3:50:22.780 --> 3:50:30.060]  these aspects and giving us this insider perspective your bravery and courage really makes you stand
[3:50:30.060 --> 3:50:54.460]  out and we'll be back on the Alex Jones show again after the break looking forward to seeing you then
