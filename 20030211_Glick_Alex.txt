[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  Chance to talk to Jeremy Glick who has written a book. His father, port authority worker, died and the World Trade Center collapses, the U.S. government attack, and Bill O'Reilly yelled and screamed at him and told him to shut up and attack his father's memory in his name. There's nothing worse.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  And he then threatened to physically attack him and threatened to kill him and to rip his head off and began touching like a demonic demon.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  And this is all in front of witnesses being reported by the mainstream news now. We have the clip of O'Reilly freaking out on air on InfoWars.com and all because Mr. Glick, we've aired it here, I mean this was some tame stuff, folks.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  He said in the 80s our government trained them. Try 2001, Pensacola Naval Air Station, MSNBC, Fox News reported. Try Defense Language School, Monterey training of the Al Qaeda leaders, CIA operatives.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  We've had Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole, former chief of staff on about that. Try Bush, LA Times, two months before 9-1-1 reporting that $135 million was sent to the Taliban.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  Try the New Yorker Magazine, MSNBC, BBC and dozens of other publications reporting that the CIA flew out 6,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders to Pakistan as Kandahar fell because they were CIA operatives to set up the implosion of the country as a pretext for the globalists to move against that oil supply.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  You just hire bad guys to go do bad stuff in your country and the globalists attack your country. I mean the government ran these attacks. They didn't just train the terrorists.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  And O'Reilly just said it was all lies. Well, O'Reilly's not stupid. His own network reported our government trained the terrorists. Joining us is Jeremy Glick and the information terrorist is Bill O'Reilly.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  He is a creep, folks. I can't stand him calling himself anti-establishment when the guy is the epitome of an establishment-simpering lapdog, un-American evil demon.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Yes, I'm using all those words. It's true. I don't like bullies. I wish he'd come on this show. I'd tear him up. Welcome, Jeremy Glick.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  Thank you. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate giving the opportunity to share some time with you guys.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  Well, it's good to have you on with us. I know you're on the road and doing a lot of different talk shows. Tell us about your father, about yourself, about the book you've written and what happened with the demon, Mr. O'Reilly, who threatened to physically attack you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  I got together with a group of friends of mine and organizers and activists from the Active Element Foundation.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  We put together a book where a bunch of us in our 20s co-edited called Another World is Possible, Conversations in a Time of Terror.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  To our knowledge, it was the first progressive kind of pro-peace response to the 9-11 terror attack.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  And it is leftward leaning, but that's your first amendment paradigm.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  Yeah, it was coming from a kind of left progressive standpoint.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Basically, for me, I suffered and my family suffered personally a devastating loss.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  My dad, who was a port authority worker, passed on that day.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  For a month, we were up in the air about what his whereabouts were. We got calls saying he was okay. Then five minutes later, he wasn't okay.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  You can just imagine how crazy that was.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  Plus, every time you hear about 9-11, it reminds you.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  It's really frustrating.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  As I said, to never forget bumper stickers, I understand people are just trying to be sympathetic.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  But to kind of grandstand around 9-11, it makes it kind of rough for the actual mourners.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  Because you don't need to be reminded not to forget.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  I've got to add that hundreds of families went around the Bush White House with signs saying Bush did it, Bush knew.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  And O'Reilly trot out of the gate to tell you that you're the only family person that doesn't agree with Bush.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  He actually said that. He's a liar.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  This is the thing. I'm very interested in your perspective and stuff of this nature.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  But I didn't actually even go that deep.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  The only thing I said was any person who watched Rambo III would have known.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  I said that the Al Qaeda network was enabled six months even before the Soviet invasion.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  And I had a lot to do with it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  Mr. Glick, we've got a break. Stay right there. We'll be right back in three short minutes, okay?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  We'll be right back, my friends. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  Welcome back. We're talking to Jeremy Glick as the CIA says we're about to get hit by terrorists any minute.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  Give up all your rights. We'll protect you.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  Get behind a war economy that only attacks sovereign nations for the globalists.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Or Al Qaeda will get you. And Al Qaeda is the creation of the CIA.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  And Mr. Glick was there on the O'Reilly Factor. His father died in the collapse.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]  And O'Reilly started off by saying you're the only person, only victim that's written this book.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  And he goes, well, yeah, I wrote the book.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  I mean, of course, he's the only one who writes this book who's in it.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  When there's 400 families suing the president, four being involved in the attack,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  hundreds of families walked around the White House and in New York with signs saying Bush did it, Bush knew.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  But that's all ignored. And O'Reilly knows. That's been all over the Zone Network.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  He knows that this government founded Al Qaeda and Taliban, not just in the 80s, but right through into the 90s and into 2001.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  And he just basically screamed and yelled and told Jeremy to shut up.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  And then he destroyed his father's memory and his mother ought to be ashamed of him.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  The death of his father, how dare him. People that killed your father.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  You're with the people that killed your father. Very abusive. Total slander.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  This isn't borderline. This is very serious.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  This guy, and then he physically threatened to attack you, to kill you, with a verbal threat to decapitate you,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  which would get most people in jail.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  Maybe you should file a criminal complaint.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  Exactly. Go through this.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  Forrest, sir, tell us your story and then going on the O'Reilly show, the behind the scenes look and then what happened.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  O'Reilly didn't contact me based on the book.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  He contacted me on the fact that I'm a signer of, in our name, Statement of Conscience,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  which is an internationally circulated, signed by thousands of people, statement that opposes the war in Iraq.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  And O'Reilly was very surprised to find out that there were actually people who were impacted by 9-11
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  who were against escalating the terror and aggression against Iraq.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  So that's how I got into the O'Reilly show.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  Well, there have been a lot of people, a lot of family members,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  have been on TV saying stop using our memory for this war.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  There's actually Peaceful Tomorrows is an organization that was assembled strictly of 9-11 family members
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  that are calling for peace and calling for not using their name to promote further aggression.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  So I got on the show and basically I thought I was going to have a political discussion,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  and perhaps maybe get a little personal and explain to O'Reilly and his audience
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  where I was coming from in terms of the loss of my father.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  As soon as I started talking about why I thought that it wasn't really opportune to back Bush
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  in defending a kind of legacy that he inherited from his father in terms of Al Qaeda
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  and punishing further the people of Iraq, which had nothing to do with it,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  but supporting and punishing the people of Afghanistan who were suffering under the U.S.-backed Taliban,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  that I would want to back up a second and put it back to O'Reilly to say,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  well, why are you so surprised that I wouldn't support the son
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  when the father was one of the players responsible for enabling the terrorist network that killed my father?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  So he kind of cut into me and went crazy and said he wasn't interested in debating politics.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  I said, of course you are interested in debating politics because you evoke 9-11
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  to pursue your narrow agenda, everything from domestic issues to international issues.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  So he went crazy and basically said that I believe the direct quote was,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  I've done more for 9-11 families in their own admission than you'll ever do.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  And then he started saying, oh, it was a disgrace to my father, and my mom must be ashamed.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  And we went back and forth.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  He said the people of Afghanistan killed my father, and I debated him on that or attempted to,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  because it wasn't the people of Afghanistan, it was a small select group of trained assassins
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  that were enabled by members in the U.S. ruling class, amongst others in the Pakistani ruling class.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  So we went back and forth.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  Basically, O'Reilly proceeded to bully me.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  He told me to shut up.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  He cut my mic, and this was all live.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  And afterwards, he physically threatened me, and he didn't say to decapitate me.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  I'm sure he might want to, but what he said was...
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  Well, you told me on the phone yesterday in the press report that he would...
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  Don't use the profane language, please.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  No, I won't.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  I promise I won't.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  No, no, no.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  Actually, we said in the press release, and I just don't want to misrepresent,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  the press release and also I said, and let me just be clear,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  is what he said was, quote, I'm going to tear you to effin' pieces.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  So there was nothing about head.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  That's what he said.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  Well, listen, I know this.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  I know people that have gone to jail were in front of people saying,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  I'm going to tear you in pieces.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  I know.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  You know, I think that that's a really, I mean, that's a really, that's not even,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  you know, there's no foggy territory there.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  That's straight up physical attack.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  His entire staff was very apologetic to me.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  They escorted me out of the office and basically was like, you know,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  just get out of here because we don't want, you know, a further situation.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  And I assured them that I had came on to a show as a guest, an invited guest,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  to have an intellectual discussion, to have an informative debate.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  I knew it would be heated because I knew R. Riley was like a bully in a sense.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  Well, I have the clip here, and I mean, you are very calm, very nice,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  more than I could have done, as he said, but these people killed your father.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  Look at what you're doing to the memory of your father.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  Your father, your mother's ashamed.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  How did this affect your mother?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  Well, my mom was outraged, you know.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  I mean, Alex, on one level, it's, you know, somebody is, you know,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  picking on unnecessarily her little boy, you know.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  And on another level, she just thought, just like all my family thought,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  that he has no right to tell me what my father would have wanted me to do
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  or whether or not he would be proud of me and to evoke somebody who's dead
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  who can't defend or speak for themselves.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  Well, it's true that O'Reilly evokes the memory of those dead for this globalist war.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  I mean, that's, but look, he says he has all the hard guests on,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  and, you know, he'll talk to anybody.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  You can trust him.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  All he does is posture.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  There's no real substance.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  I mean, you know, I'll hear the guy say stuff that is, you know,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  just to man in control, pro-terranny, and then he'll say a few good things,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  but it's never any substance.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  And just the way he screamed at you, the things he did to you,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  it was very, very, very revealing.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  So, I mean, how soon did he, I mean, describe in detail, you know,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  it goes to commercial, you're sitting there in the chair, what happens?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  I told him that it was cowardly, very calmly.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  I told him that it was cowardly that he cut my mic
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  and that I thought that he didn't represent working people in this country.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  He represented a very rich minority, a very rich racist minority, actually.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  And I said that it was an insult to working people in this country
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  because he pretends to represent the common man, the common woman,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  the everyday working John and Jane, where he actually, in his ideology
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  and in his views and in his thuggish kind of behavior,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  he represents a very small, rich minority.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  And we were on opposite sides of the table.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  I wasn't raising my voice.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  I was sitting down.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  I wasn't in his space.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  And he just, you know, slammed his fist on the desk and said,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  get out of my studio before I tear you to bleeping pieces.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]  So at that point, you know, I wasn't trying to get into a fight, you know.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  Did he say anything else after he said that?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  No, no.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  He just said, get out, you know, get out.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  And as I said, Alex, I wasn't interested in getting into a fight.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  That's not what I was there to do.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  And I just want to say, in terms of what you were saying before about his debate,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  you know, Riley, they're not there to debate.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  He's there to intimidate.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  He's there to bait his audience.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  And that's why when he said that stuff about my dad,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  the reason why I was calm is not because that wasn't hurtful or outrageous.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  It was because that's exactly what he wants to do.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  Yeah, he was trying to get a rise out of you just cheaply using the memory
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  of your dad and father and attacking him as viciously as he could,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  and it didn't work, so he blew up.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  So basically we learned out of everything out of this,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  we learned a strategy lesson.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]  We learned that in these kind of talk show settings,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  if you come at people with facts and also you keep your cool
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  and you keep a moral high ground and not allow yourself to be baited
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  or kind of, you know, as a lot of elementary school teachers say,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  stoop to their level, they completely back off and crumble under the pressure,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  crumble so much that they have to silence you and then use extra legal threats.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  Well, he said over and over again, shut up, shut up.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  He said cut his mic.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  I mean, I've been on talk shows, supposing the government running 911,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  and they'll say openly, give me some caller that disagrees with this kook,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  and every caller is agreeing, and they'll panic and just throw me off
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  and then change the subject because I'll tune in by the Internet
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  to see what's happening, and this shows.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  I mean, I'll tell you, he doesn't represent working people.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  O'Reilly is very good at conning middle class and then working folks
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  into thinking that he is representing them
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  and looking like a middle of the road populist type person.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  And, you know, the Democrats are there just to subvert and control,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  in my evidence, not just my opinion, the working class population,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  while the Republicans are there to con the middle class
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  into thinking they're part of the establishment to go along with this raping.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  And this is not free market, and it's more than just about money.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  The globalists aren't just rich.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  They control the institutions, and this is what we're fighting.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  And, man, I tell you, the stuff you brought up,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  I'm tempted to air him again, Mr. Glick.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  I mean, you simply brought up the evidence.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  You simply brought up admitted things that his own network has reported.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  You give the example of Rambo III, you know,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  where the U.S. government works with the Taliban and they're good guys.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  I mean, that was part of our culture.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  And then just to deny it and say you're a liar, shut up,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  you ought to be ashamed of yourself,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  I mean, he's got to know that most Americans have got to see through that.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  I know a lot of conservatives sent me emails and said,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  you know, I don't like O'Reilly anymore.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  I finally see through him like you do.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  And, you know, I'll get mad at hosts sometimes if they're lying
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  or manipulating or they're trying to punch buttons.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  I'll get mad at guests.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  But, you know, I won't sit there and tell them they're lying
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]  when they're telling the truth.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  Right.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  And also, Alex, the next day on his email follow-up,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  he said I was wailing out of control like a maniac,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  anti-American hatred for this country.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  And, I mean, Alex, I was born, you know, I'm from Chicago.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]  I was raised in New Jersey.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  All I know is America.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  And to think that you have the right to, you know, tell a victim, you know,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  I mean, when my father died almost a little over two years ago,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  that you have a right to tell a victim.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  Well, he said that you were with the people.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  He said you were with the people that killed your father.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  But that's not what I said at all.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  That's outrageous.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  No, all you said was, you were very clear.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  He said, oh, you're with the people.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  And you explained, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  Bush has the connections to these people.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  I'm against the system that created the people that killed my father.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  Wasn't that crystal clear to me?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone listening to him recap it.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  Can you stay with us?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  I want to take some calls.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  All right, folks.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  You want to talk to Jeremy Glick, for those of you that saw it
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  or those of you that heard me air the clip last week,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  And we are...
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  You know, for patriots, for pro-freedom type people out there
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  that want to reach out to the left,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  you're not going to do it with a Bill O'Reilly,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  a Sean Hannity.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  They're going to see the hypocrisy.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  They're going to see the elitism.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  They're going to see the lies.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  And they're going to run back to their liberal control system
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  that is part of the same global New World Order.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  But I'm able to get on the air, and I've got the liberals,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  the academics out buying semi-automatic rifles.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  I've got them out speaking out against the New World Order.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  I've got them realizing that big government is created
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  to control the population by the elite corporations.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  We break the paradigm here,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  and we've got to stop organized criminal mouthpieces out there
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  that are trying to sell us this tyranny.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  Coming up, Patriot Act II exposed,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  the new terror alerts and much more.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  We've got loaded phones for Jeremy Glick.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  We'll try to get as many in as we can.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  And I think he's got a lot of courage and was very well spoken
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  and really deserves our heartfelt thanks
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  for standing up to that brutal assault
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  and staying cool under it,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  something I probably couldn't do.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  Joanie in Florida, thanks for holding here on the air
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]  with Jeremy Glick.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  What's left of him after the attack by the warthog O'Reilly?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  Go ahead.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  Well, I just want to say to Jeremy,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  I am so glad that you, Alex, were able to get in touch with him
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  and give him a chance to sit there
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  and very expertly explain his views
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  of what he wanted to get across that night with O'Reilly.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  I happened to be flipping channels and saw that,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  and it was such a disgrace.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  It was just unbelievable.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  And, Jeremy, you speak very well.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  You sound like you want to go with truth and document.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  And I hope and pray that you'll stay connected to Alex's website.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  And, you know, the right and the left are being drawn together
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  because the government is just pushing so hard into the globalism
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  that even though maybe a few years ago we didn't agree on things,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  but I think if you just keep speaking the truth,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  you'll find that we have a lot in common.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  And God bless you and your family.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  Wow, Joanie, thanks for the call.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  Mr. Glick, any comments?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  Well, I just wanted to thank you for the kind words.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]  All right.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Let's take another call.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  John in Texas.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  John, you're on the air worldwide with Jeremy Glick, our guest.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  Hello, Alex.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]  Hello, Jeremy.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  Hey.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  It took a lot of courage to stand up to him,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  and I appreciate it because you spoke the truth.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  And people in this country need to learn to accept the truth
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  instead of burying their head in the sand
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  because everything he said is right on target.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  And, John, you saw the psychology.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  It's to be patriotic.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  You've got to either with us or against us,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  follow whatever tyranny we say, or you're not an American.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  How dare them try to say that we're not Americans
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]  because we love this country
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  and don't want to be a bunch of bloodthirsty globalists.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  How dare them try to set up that psychology.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  Go ahead, John.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  I was called a traitor at church
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  because a guy came up to me
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  and started talking about the war with Iraq,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  and I said, well, I happen to disagree with it.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  I think it's a sham.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]  I think it's the Iraqi people have nothing to do with the terrorism.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  And, again, Saddam's former business partners with the Bushes,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  just like Noriega and bin Laden, it's the same story.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  Right, we gave him the weapons.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  The guy at church got enraged and said,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  how dare you go against Bush.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  He said, you traitor.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  And I said, I'm not a traitor.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  I'm going into law enforcement.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  I'm very patriotic.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  I believe in protecting people and their freedoms.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  I would not pick the profession I picked.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  Right.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  And when I went into law enforcement,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  I wanted to tell Alex this one thing, though.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  When they're training us at the academy,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  it's no longer a right, it's a privilege.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  We're taught it's a privilege to own a driver's license.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]  It's a privilege to own a gun.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  It's not a right.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  Privileges can be revoked.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]  Exactly, and that's why I disagreed with him.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  I brought up Posse Comitatus in the class,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  and my instructor didn't even know about it.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  He's a veteran police officer
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  at the Harris County Sheriff's Department for 26 years.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]  He didn't know about Posse Comitatus.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  Didn't know about the 1878 law prohibiting troops on the streets
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  that they're now getting rid of.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]  All right, John.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  I'm sorry he didn't.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  Thank you for the call.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  God bless you.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  Jeremy, I know you're on the road and very busy.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  Can you stay with us about ten more minutes to take some calls?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  Yeah, sure.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  All right, let's get Bill in from Wisconsin.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  Go ahead.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  Jeremy, sorry about your death.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]  Oh, I appreciate it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  Thank you.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  Okay.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  Yeah, sorry Bush killed him.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  Yeah.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  I'm serious.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]  I understand that.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  Yeah, I understand that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  You don't have to tell me that.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]  I don't know, Alex, if you're familiar with the underground newsletter.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]  It's a little publication I get out of Pennsylvania,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  but they had some interesting reprints of what Sherman Skolnick out of Chicago.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  I'll tell you what.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Stay there.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  Jeremy, stay with us, okay?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  Do we have Jeremy Gluck?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  Yeah.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]  Good.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]  Stay right there, sir.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  And I mean that when I say that about Bush.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]  You know, how dare O'Reilly attack him and say, oh, these people,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  you're for the people that killed your father.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  Bush is for the people that killed his father.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  Bush trained them.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  Pensacola Naval Air Station in 2001.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  Bush sent $135 million to them.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  Bush is the terrorist.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  Stay with me.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  Fascist.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]  We're not fighting fascists.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  We're not fighting communists.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  We're not fighting the political spectrum we've been taught
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  so that we cannot think and understand and assess the political terrain.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  We are fighting organized crime that owns large PR firms
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  run by the military industrial complex owned by the private banks
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]  that founded this criminal world government that is stripping humanity
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  of its rights, its freedoms, its dignity.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  Now, we've got another guest coming up in about ten minutes,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]  so I want to ban through these calls real quick.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  Then I'm going to get him to do a detailed analysis of the new Patriot Act
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  and the terror alerts.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]  They say Braceford attack this weekend or next week.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  The terrorists themselves, the carry.911, are up there posing as your saviors.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  Every day I look at these serial killers knowing that they're guilty,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  having to watch them pose as our saviors.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]  I was on a radio talk show this morning in St. Louis, and they said,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  Alex, we've gotten comments about your film, a few negative comments.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  You call Bush a mass murderer.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  Well, he is a mass murderer.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  He is an enemy combatant by his own designation.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  No one has greater ties to al Qaeda and Taliban than George Bush and his father.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  He should be impeached.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  He should be criminally charged for crimes against America,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  against the American people.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  He has overturned our republic, and I will stand firm against that.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  He is a gun-grabbing, open-border, arming North Korea and China traitor.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]  Okay, bottom line.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  Jeremy Glick, let's take these final calls.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]  You were speaking, Bill, in Wisconsin about a point you wanted to make
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  about Sherman Skullman.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  Go ahead.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  Right, Alex.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]  Anyway, he's brought out in a couple of features here called
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000]  The Overthrow of the Republic how one, Bush was involved in homosexual acts
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]  as a Skull and Bone member, and that the European.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  I had him on about that.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  We cannot confirm that.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  We can confirm that Skull and Bones is a bizarre, according to MSNBC,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  Nazi devil organization.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  I know they're in Bohemian Grove.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]  That just aired on national television with the Bohemian Grove admitting
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]  that it's a real ritual that I shot video of it saying, so what?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  But we cannot confirm what Skolnick said, and that was about three months ago.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  Four months ago he made that claim and said evidence was coming out.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  I need to call him back and see the evidence.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]  Right.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  Okay, the other thing that he talked about, and I wonder what your take was,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000]  that Admiral Jeremy Borda was involved in a possible arrest of Clinton,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  and there were some other high level.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  That is true.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  There were assassinations of a bunch of flag officers in the Navy and in the Army
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]  and Marines, and that is clear in a whole other episode.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  Thanks for the call.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]  All right.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]  Any comments on anything we've raised here, sir?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  I would just say that for me personally, the sexual practices of Skolnick
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  isn't really the issue.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  It's what their politics are.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  They admit they get in coffins naked next to their sole partner.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]  That's admitted.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  Maybe that's what Skolnick's talking about.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]  Yeah, I just think that the key issue is the kind of business interest
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  and then the kind of secrecy surrounding it.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  The Post article last month, or it was actually in December,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  where they showed that about half his cabinet and top officials
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  are Skull and Bones members.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]  Right.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  All right, that is important.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  That's what we can prove.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  Let's talk to Steve in Connecticut and then Mark, Don, and Ron, and that's it.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  Steve in Connecticut, you're on the air with Jeremy Glick.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  Hey, Jeremy, how are you?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]  Hey, thank you.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]  Hey, listen, I want to welcome you to the club, the Bill O'Reilly Club.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  I saw what happened to you the other night and was horrified,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  and I have complete empathy for you because I was a guest
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  on O'Reilly's show on September 3rd.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  I was a former homosexual who came out to speak out,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  and I was slammed by O'Reilly for sharing my thing.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  I went through probably just exactly what you went through,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]  and now Fox is threatening me personally with a lawsuit
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  for speaking out about O'Reilly and his unbelievable actions
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  and comments toward me.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]  When I saw you, believe me, my heart was pumping.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  I knew exactly what you were going through.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]  Well, why was she getting mad at you?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  What's your name?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  My name is Steven Bennett.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  I write commentary for WorldNetDaily, and I was brought onto his show
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  because I wrote a national commentary about Bill O'Reilly's views
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]  on the homosexual issue, and he brought me on there for one thing,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  and then he just tried to make an idiot out of me on national television,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  and actually the Associated Press picked up on the story a few days later.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  Bill O'Reilly, the way that he treats his guests now
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  is just completely disrespectful, and again, when I saw what happened,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  I happened to watch Jeremy the other night, and I just felt horrible
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  because you had such a calm attitude towards,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  you were trying to make your point, but obviously what Bill O'Reilly
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  did to you as he did to me, he brought you there to preach to you,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  and as soon as you went to make any comments,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  of course ripping the mics off, and we just could not believe it.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]  We were shocked, and I told my wife, I said,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]  I cannot believe that this is happening, it's like déjà vu,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  so believe me, I completely empathize with what you went through.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  You really did a great job.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]  I tried to keep my cool.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  O'Reilly bashes homosexuals, he bashes Mexicans, he bashes Asians.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  The guy is out of control in terms of the hate speech.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]  Well, now, the hate speech, there you get into that U.N. speech.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  It's people's right to say what they believe.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  No, and I wouldn't escut upon that, but I kind of feel like,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  I mean, he actively engages in oppressive language.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]  Well, he certainly tries to polarize and Balkanize,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  but I would guess that if Stephen on the line isn't with WorldNet daily,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  that he has a conservative view that obviously made Lord O'Reilly angry.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  Send me some information on that, Stephen.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  Thank you.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  Thank you for the support.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  All right, three more calls, and that's it,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  because I've got other guests here, and I appreciate Jeremy Glick joining us.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  Mark in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]  Yeah, thank you very much, Alex, for having me on your show.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  And, Jeremy, I listened to that MP3 off Alex Jones' website,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  and I am totally in empathy with you.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  The thing you have to understand about O'Reilly, he definitely just,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  he's not left wing, he's not right wing,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  he's just agenda-rendered from through and through.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]  He has an elitist agenda, packaging it as if it's a populist move.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]  Right.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]  Exactly.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  And, sir, I don't know what your political philosophy is,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]  but I used to be pretty much, I would consider myself middle of the road
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  to pretty much left wing myself in my thinking process.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]  Yeah.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  And as time has gone on, as I paid attention to Alex Jones' site,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]  and I actually ordered some of his movies and stuff like that
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]  and learned things about myself, it's changed my political views.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  Now, I'm not saying that you should.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]  I don't even know what your political views are.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]  But if you want to look for real truth, I mean, it's basically,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  the patriot movement has definitely got what's going on.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]  Well, I think what Mark's trying to say is that the left and right
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]  are totally co-opted by the Madison Avenue propaganda machine.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]  Right.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  Is that what you're getting at here, Mark?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]  That's exactly what I'm getting at.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]  And I don't even consider myself left or right.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]  I mean, call yourself a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]  I believe in freedom.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  Exactly.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]  I believe in dignity and freedom and decency and family.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]  That's what I consider myself as, too.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]  And national sovereignty.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]  Thank you.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]  Go ahead.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]  If I could just respond really quick.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  I mean, basically, from my perspective, I just think it's really important
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]  to have a broad, united front across ideologies to stop the war
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  and to stop further murder and destruction
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]  and the encroaching upon other nations' self-determination.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]  There you go, national sovereignty.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  And this war, I mean, Iraq is in the stone age now compared to other countries.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  I mean, North Korea is threatening to nuke us every day.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  But, oh, they're not a problem.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  Let's go after Saddam because he's got some five-foot rockets
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]  that can shoot a couple miles.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  And then the U.N. is sticking their noses in supposed chemical rockets.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  If they thought those were chemical rockets, believe me,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  they wouldn't be pulling the caps off, sticking their noses in them.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]  Right.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  This is ridiculous.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]  This is totally staged.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]  But I just think it's great that, you know, I mean,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]  I think we need to have as broad a united front as possible to, you know,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]  preempt the war and the escalation of aggression.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]  Yeah, we've got Bob Barr and the ACLU together decrying the Patriot Act.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]  Don and North Carolina, that's got to happen.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]  Don, you're on the air.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]  Go ahead.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]  Hi, Alex.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]  Hi, Jeremy.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  Hi.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]  Jeremy, I'm sorry about your dad.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]  I'll keep you and your family in my prayers.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]  Hey, I appreciate that from you and from everyone else who let me do that.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  Great.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]  I pulled that CIA off on 3,000 people.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]  It was horrible.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  Right.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]  You know, I've mentioned those insider trades to you before in the past.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  I just wanted to ask Jeremy, is he aware of a David Bonderman and Richard Blum?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  No.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]  Would you please, please have your lawyers look at the insider trades,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  David Bonderman at Continental Airlines.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  Both of these gentlemen were dumping Continental stock.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  If Bonderman was dumping his stock at Continental, he's on their chair.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  He's the chairman.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  Well, the CIA dumped a bunch of stock and was put optioning it right before,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  and it leads right back to Bush.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]  Right.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]  Well, David Bonderman is on the board of directors at Continental,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  and Richard Blum, they're both good friends.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  Richard Blum is Senator Dianne Feinstein's husband.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]  Okay.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  Now, David Bonderman was making big trades through the month of August,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]  and if you would just please have your lawyers go look at the insider trades
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]  at Continental Airlines by David.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]  His nickname is Bondo Bonderman.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]  All right.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  Well, I'm not too familiar with those two individuals.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  I know who they are, but I know about Buzzy Congar and the CIA.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  Thanks for the call.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  Any comments on what Don was saying about insider trading?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  You know, we heard, oh, we'll be able to find out who was behind 911
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]  because we have these insider trades, and then, oh, forget about it.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]  It leads back to the airlines and the CIA.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  Did you hear about that?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  Well, you know, I mean, I'm not, I mean, I think just as a general rule,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  I'm not sure about the specifics, you know, I appreciate his perspective,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]  but I think as a general rule to follow the economic trail often proves,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]  you know, very fruitful results.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  Yeah, it's called motive.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  First thing cops look at.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]  Last call here that we have time for, Ron.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]  Ron, where are you calling from, sir?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]  I'm calling from New York.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]  Welcome.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]  You're on the air with our guest, Jeremy Glick.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]  How do you do?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]  You know, I'd like to say one thing with reference to what's going on
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]  in the nation today.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]  It is no longer so much a matter of what is left, right, liberal,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]  or conservative, just what's fair and what is reasonable.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]  And this is, I think, the point we have to come together on because
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]  we're both being encroached upon.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  Now, about Bill O'Reilly, way back I had suspected him because I
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]  subscribed to something that Albert Einstein once said about someone
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]  who would lie about small things cannot be trusted in larger matters.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]  O'Reilly always poses himself as coming from a gritty,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]  working-class neighborhood in Long Island, New York,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]  which is a community I don't live that far from.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]  And he refers to it as though it's a real,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]  it's almost like a quasi-ghetto he grew up in.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]  Well, he comes from a community called Levittown.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]  The average price of a home there is $500,000.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]  Yeah, I'm familiar with that area.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  The average income is over $100,000.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]  So he was probably an upper-middle class person,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]  but he certainly never came from this tough, gritty neighborhood.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]  And keep in mind that he obtained his master's degree
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]  while walking around in Harvard Yard.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]  Now, we understand about fraternities and so forth that are in place,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]  you know, in that institution.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]  So he poses himself as something that he's not.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]  Well, he poses himself as anti-establishment,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]  and that's what we're saying.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  He obviously isn't.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]  Ron, thanks for the call.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  Any comments to that real quick here?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  I mean, you know, as I said,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]  we just have to really investigate people's alleged representation
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]  and then put that up to the actual reality
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  and not to allow people to necessarily, anyone,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]  to say that they speak for all people of a certain economic size.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]  Yeah, and if you don't agree with me, you're with a terrorist.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]  Jeremy Glick, I appreciate you joining us.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]  Okay, thank you so much.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]  You bet.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]  God bless you, sir.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]  Thank you, sir.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]  Okay, have a good one.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]  Bye.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]  Bye.
