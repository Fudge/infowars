[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's way to see, I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.000]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[00:22.000 --> 00:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to get Paul Watson in here today to really co-host the first hour
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  because he's such an expert on Brexit and what happened obviously with Lapin in this landslide defeat
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  at the hands of Emmanuel Macron, who is a literal Rothschild globalist frontman who literally poses for photos
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  bowing down at the feet of Merkel. As Lapin said last week, you'll either have me ruling you as a woman
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  or you'll have Merkel. This is all part of the cuckolding of the French, where it is a national religion now to bow down.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  Now a lot of the polls show that Lapin and a dead heat are winning, so maybe they weren't cuckled.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  Maybe the election was stolen. Paul discovered some evidence of fraud going on that's all coming up.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  I'll be popping in during this hour and we'll also be here in the second and third hour. We have a bunch of big guests today.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  I'll tell you about the start of the next segment when we have huge news dealing with what's happening with Obamacare,
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  a giant child porn bust, the largest ever with 150,000 people involved.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  That's all part of Trump giving the green light to roll up the pedophile networks and I have confirmed from our sources
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  the president has ordered an end to secret of geoengineering programs. I've noticed that myself,
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  but I put some questions in and the word came back that yes, the president's aware of that, the programs are being reviewed.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  So a lot of huge news today, speaking of breaking news from inside the White House, Roger Stones and the name Names
[01:58.000 --> 02:07.000]  in the third hour of the mold inside the White House and inside the State Department being run by even people like Donna Brazil.
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  You can't make that up. So today, Jack Pasobiak is going to be joining us, Roger Stone, Leanne Magadou, David Knight and many, many others.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  But right now, Paul Watson, we got about three minutes to break. I appreciate you coming in to mainly host the first hour today
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  because of your expertise. Obviously, you got family that lives in France. You live there part of the year.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  I guess you told me you're evacuating to another location in Europe because the Islamists have overrun things.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  We don't want to mention where that is. But wow, Paul, what's coming up today?
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Well, it's going to break down what happened with Macron. He entered to make his acceptance speech.
[02:42.000 --> 02:50.000]  And by the way, there's a hilarious clip of him trying to read from a teleprompter and completely failing, which shows you the kind of presidency that it's going to be.
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  Total puppet.
[02:51.000 --> 03:00.000]  Yeah, there's video of him entering to make his acceptance speech and he walks out to the EU national anthem before they even play the French national anthem.
[03:00.000 --> 03:11.000]  He's walking out to the EU anthem in front of a giant pyramid in the Louvre with a red blinking guy at the top of the pyramid right above his head.
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.000]  And I think they've actually got a gif image of that that I sent that they can play to show you that Macron giving his acceptance speech in front of the Louvre.
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  Again, the giant pyramid symbolism behind him. And of course, the EU's got its own symbolism, Alex, just like the stars and stripes is a form of symbolism.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  You know, the Pledge of Allegiance is a form of symbolism. Yeah, that's him reading out the teleprompter.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's the gif right there. All hail the new world order.
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  Now, come on. We've got our own symbolism when it comes to nationalism and patriotism. That is globalist symbolism.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  By the way, Francois Mitterrand, Francois Mitterrand, this is mainstream news, was a Luciferian.
[03:49.000 --> 03:57.000]  He commissioned the 666 pieces of pink glass, pink orange glass for the pyramid.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  And he believed that it is the site of where now Lucifer resides.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  So that was Francois Mitterrand, the former French president, saying that the Louvre is the center of Satanism in the world.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  And of course, they have it in movies when the aliens invade.
[04:11.000 --> 04:20.000]  And that Tom Cruise, maybe they came out a few years ago, that's where the aliens have their mothership is at the Louvre. I mean, talk about throwing in our face, Paul.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Well, this is a guy who said, quote, there's no such thing as French culture.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  The call to prayer in the Paris streets, they're now petitioning to that Islamic prayer to be made completely legal and acceptable.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  This is the future of France, and we're going to talk about it after the break, Alex.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  All right, I'm going to come back and a few of the other stories that are coming up and hand the baton to Paul for the rest of the hour.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  Really great to have Paul here. I'll also be back tomorrow hosting the fourth hour.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  Please tell everybody you know, listening on AMFM, Internet, you name it, tune in now.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're trying to censor us and block us everywhere because we are so effective in the face of the globalist.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  We are the resistance. Their new world order is an anti-human transhumanist movement.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups, the Trump effect on the Democrats and liberals is surely maddening.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  As if the 178-year-old millennial Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention,
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  the James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage of the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring ovation.
[05:17.000 --> 05:23.000]  The wig won the award for Best Fight Against the System, another side Trump effect on the left, giving themselves awards.
[05:23.000 --> 05:34.000]  Check Chelsea Clinton, Barack Obama, now a James Brown wig. The classy Democrat Senator Kamala Harris, also from California, decided to drop an F bomb while speaking about health care during a public event.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  Listen to the young turds for more than 60 seconds and you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  But now the Hill has published a story, The 43 People Who Might Run Against Trump, which includes the worst of the Democrat Party,
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus act fit of berserking.
[05:54.000 --> 06:19.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock in Infowarsstore.com. Research across the board is clear.
[06:19.000 --> 06:27.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:34.000 --> 06:42.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more,
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[06:50.000 --> 06:59.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[06:59.000 --> 07:09.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.

[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[08:00.000 --> 08:12.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[08:16.000 --> 08:31.000]  In front of a pyramid designed by Francois Mitterrand, the former president of France, with 666 pieces of pink glass dedicated to Lucifer,
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  Mr. Macron, the new president who won by a landslide against the nationalist, Marine Le Pen,
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  walked out to the EU National Anthem and there is the headline out of the Express News.
[08:43.000 --> 08:51.000]  I'll defend Europe, Macron snubs French National Anthem and walks out to EU song after win.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  Wow. Wow. Unbelievable.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  Imagine like having Hillary Clinton win the presidency and she walks out to a North American Union Anthem.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  Dun dun dun dun dun. Instead of the Star Spangled Banner.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  Then they go into the French Anthem. I mean, talk about minions.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  This is truly incredible. Paul Watson lives in France part of the year. His family lives there.
[09:25.000 --> 09:33.000]  He's an expert on it. He's evacuating with his family because he's Islamic overrun of multi-million people.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  Paris is now a giant, feces covered cesspit. That's mainstream news.
[09:38.000 --> 09:44.000]  80% down in the last decade of their tourism, but they don't care. They want to be cuckold.
[09:44.000 --> 09:52.000]  That's why we put the photo on screen for TV viewers of Macron kneeling and bowing at the feet of Merkel.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  So France capitulated to Hitler in less than two weeks in World War II because their high command stood down
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  and became dictators over the country with their new capital in the South, Vichy France.
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  And now they've done it again. But it isn't the German people. The Germans are paying for the EU.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  They're actually paying for the French pensions and the French welfare system.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  So Macron is attached to Germany like a giant lamprey.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  Truly insane. Coming up in the next hour, research. Unvaccinated children far healthier, have fewer disorders.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  Mainstream news. I've got a stack of studies.
[10:26.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'm going to tie it into the globalists trying to destabilize the West. Also, Florida man's sentenced to 30 years for world's largest child porn website.
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.000]  Get this. It's called playpin. Could it be sugar? How about hatch it upside your head?
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  Look at that demon. We're going to break that down as part of Trump's giant suite rounding up the pedophiles everywhere.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  That's all coming up. Also, Rand Paul's discovery and others are that thousands of Americans were targeted by the NSA
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  during the election for political purposes. He wants the details.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  We also have insult to injury. Unreal. Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who calls you dumb idiots, says,
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  thank God you're so stupid and have no memories. He blames Trump for rising premiums when Obamacare was designed to do that.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And Obamacare is still in place.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  Unreal. He thinks you have no memory. He says, thank God you're so stupid. So that's all coming up today.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  Let me tell you who we have joining us in the second hour.
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.000]  Jack Hosebiak, Roger Stone with Huge Inside Intel from the White House on exactly who the traders are,
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  how the shadow government deep states blocking Trump, Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, and many others today.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  Paul Joseph Watson now takes over this hour, and I will be back in the second hour with also this report.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  It's one of the most viral videos out there in the last two days. It was just posted on May 6.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  What humans will look like in a thousand years. They're telling you the reality of the world, telling you what they're planning.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  Not a thousand in a hundred years, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  This is the system thrown in your face at idiotic level.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  I've been warning you about this in my film, In Game, and so much more. This is the machine takeover of humanity.
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  We're going to be breaking all this down. So they're getting rid of the genders right now, preparing you to not have a gender
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  because you're going to be non biological as if you're even going to exist.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  So we're going to break all this down. Everything we told you they denied now in your face in the second hour.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  But now Paul Joseph Watson, I know he's just in France a few days ago. Are you still in France, Paul?
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  No, I'm in London now, Alex.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  You're back in London. Okay, my friend, take over. I want to ask you this question.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  Do you think there was election fraud? Is a lot of polls showed or neck and neck are ahead?
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  Or is this just French loving to go with trendiness, loving to go with the establishment, loving to go with the latest fashion,
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  loving to go with the Rothschild banker, loving to go with groveling to the EU dictatorship?
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  Was this them giving into the propaganda or was this a massive fraud or a mix of both? Paul Joseph Watson.
[13:04.000 --> 13:13.000]  Well, there's definitely questions about fraud, Alex. We had 500,000 French voters, expat voters who would normally be expected to vote Macron.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  In fact, vast majority did in this final runoff before the first round being sent, again, 500,000 double ballots.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  So they could have voted twice. They're more likely to vote for Macron. That was a big problem.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  The police said we're not going to investigate until after the election. Nobody cares.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  Then the other thing we had a video up yesterday which showed, again, people receiving ballots.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  They received the ballot papers with the name of the candidate on them and it was Macron Macron.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  There wasn't Macron Le Pen. So there were questions about fraud. So it could have happened.
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  But I think in the greater scheme of things, as you said, this was about the cowardice of some, some of the French people.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  We have to remember that there were 25% of French people didn't even vote or spoiled their ballots.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  So this is by no means a huge mandate that Macron has.
[14:02.000 --> 14:11.000]  The other thing why people voted for Macron instead of Le Pen is because probably mistakenly Le Pen came out in her platform
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  and said that she would immediately exit from the EU and revert back to the French Frank.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  Because of course, France is currently on the euro system, which was probably not the brightest idea to announce that straight away.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  Obviously to move towards it would be striking back against globalism.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  But the fact that that was in her platform put off a lot of the older voters in France because their pensions are denominated in euros.
[14:37.000 --> 14:48.000]  So they knew that if France switched back to the Frank, the French Frank, at least for a while, their savings, their pensions would be devalued at least in the short term.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  So it was kind of a somewhat selfish financial decision on their part.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  And this is why Macron had the least support amongst 18 to 24 year olds who mainly supported Le Pen.
[15:00.000 --> 15:12.000]  But he got the most support from over 65s, which tells you that this whole image that's been manufactured around Macron's campaign, this bright, fresh, young face, is complete BS.
[15:12.000 --> 15:21.000]  His supporters are over 65 in general when compared to Marine Le Pen, who has a youthful, energised, young movement behind her.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  And in fact, I met several of them on Friday, so she's going to be back in 2022.
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  The question is, will anything be left of France that's worth rescuing in 2022, given that they've had 21 jihadist attacks since Charlie Hebdo,
[15:36.000 --> 15:47.000]  given that they've had over 230 jihadist murders in that same time period and of course six massive jihadist attacks in Paris alone in the last three years,
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  but 90% of Parisians still voted for Emmanuel Macron, who again was sold on this line.
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  I think this is why a lot of French people fell for it. French people have never had a Barack Obama or a Tony Blair,
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.000]  you know, a contrived fake populist that the media can package and sell as a quote maverick outsider, as they did with Macron,
[16:11.000 --> 16:19.000]  without digging an inch beneath the surface, which if anyone did, they would find out he was a bureaucrat in the outgoing socialist government,
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  which got 6% of the vote, pathetically. He was a bureaucrat in the outgoing government for two years.
[16:26.000 --> 16:33.000]  He was a Bilderberg member, attended Bilderberg in Copenhagen in 2014. He was, of course, a Rothschild banker.
[16:33.000 --> 16:41.000]  He came from the very elitist school, which the elite in France use to groom future leaders of their country.
[16:41.000 --> 16:50.000]  You can go down the line, every single establishment checkmark, Emmanuel Macron has got it, but because French people have never had this phenomenon
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  where they are packaged and sold this fresh new face, a lot of them fell for it.
[16:56.000 --> 17:03.000]  Of course, now Americans are more wary to that post Obama, British people even more so, post Tony Blair,
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  who turned out to be who is now the most unpopular politician in Britain, yet he's still out there on the public stage.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  But France never had that. So a lot of them were cowardly, a lot of them fell for it, they do have.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  Again, not all of them, not even the majority of them. So I'm not laying it on the French people,
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  but there is this cowardice that's implicit within the mindset of the French, this fear of change.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  But in terms of old people, it was the fact that they were scared that their pensions would be devalued.
[17:32.000 --> 17:41.000]  And that's why many of them voted for Macron, who by the way, has been greeted with riots out on the streets of Paris and France
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  in major cities again today, not by Le Pen voters. I was going to ask the question,
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  you know, did you hear about all the Le Pen voters rioting across France last night?
[17:50.000 --> 17:57.000]  No, because it didn't happen, because only leftists throw violent temper tantrums when they don't win an election.
[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  Yet Macron won, and still these unionists, these left wingers are out trashing the streets,
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  starting fights with police officers on major, on major streets, major cities in France today.
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.000]  So even the election of this fake populist has failed to quell that.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  In the very hours afterwards, they were immediately out on the streets rioting.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  So French people, Macron supporters think they can stick their head in the sand, vote Macron,
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  hold their nose and think this is all going to go away. It's not going to go away.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  This is a guy who said, quote, there is no such thing as French culture.
[18:35.000 --> 18:42.000]  This is now the guy leading France, a country once celebrated globally for its culture.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Now says there is no French culture.
[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  Six months after a Muslim migrant mowed down, killed 84 people, injured hundreds more,
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  including children in Nice, he came out.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  Six months later and said we should celebrate Muslim immigration.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  Anyone who is against it is basically a hateful coward.
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  That's what he called 11 million Le Pen voters.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Who, by the way, are not far right extremists.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  Most of them are poor farmers left behind, forgotten by globalism,
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  forgotten by the very interest that Macron represents.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  Those are the people that he came out and called hateful cowards 11 million of them.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  So that's what the situation is in France going forward.
[19:28.000 --> 19:33.000]  We've got a guy who literally hates the gods of 11 million people,
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  a huge chunk of the population who voted for Marine Le Pen.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  Absolutely incredible and he's walking out to the EU anthem.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  He's basically hailing the new world order in front of a giant glass pyramid
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  with a red flashing light above it. Absolutely incredible.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  You're going to get more into it after the break.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live with me, Paul Joseph Watson.

[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include

[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  Is Hannity next?
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  The big media are at war with President Trump and his allies.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  David Horowitz reveals the truth in his new book, Big Agenda.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Big Agenda exposes Obama's secret plan to stop Trump.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Ann Coulter says arm yourself with Big Agenda.

[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  Back by popular demand, he'll be hosting the fourth hour tomorrow as well.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  Look at that image behind me if you're a TV viewer.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  That is from French news agency.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  You probably faded onto the screen in front of us, you can really see it clearly.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  A big giant black pyramid with an all-seeing eye right above his head,
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  built by François Mitterrand, designed by the former French president,
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  in homage to Lucifer.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  That is mainstream news.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  Luciferianism in your face, in Paris, where the Jacobins and communism
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  and all of the Illuminati systems come from.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  There it is in your face, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  Back to Paul Joseph Watson in London, England.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Yeah, we're going to go to a clip now.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  This is Nigel Farage and he's explaining why Marine Le Pen may need to ditch
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  the national front image to detoxify that whole brand and come back in five years time
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  with a better chance of winning the presidency.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Here's Nigel Farage.
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  Any surprise for you in the election of Macron?
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  Is there any surprise in the defeat by 32 points of Marine Le Pen?
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  No, I think we knew that Macron was going to win.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  I don't think the French are yet ready for Frexit in the way that we were last year
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  in our country.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  Maybe the one surprise is in the first round of this,
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  46.5% of voters opted for Eurosceptic candidates to the left, center and right.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  Le Pen getting 35% tonight.
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  Remarkably, 12% of those that turned up to vote dispoiled their ballot papers
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  and put them in the box.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  And I've never seen anything like that happen in a Western democracy.
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  I think the reason is, the reason I think is that the Front National has a bad history.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  Her father, you know, I'm afraid she's often judged by him.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  And I've been urging her now personally for five years.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  And by the way, I've spoken to her campaign team tonight.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  She doesn't intend to give up.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  What she needs to do is to get rid of that National Front brand to start again.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  And then all the people who have left and right could get round her in the second ballot next time round.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  And do you know something?
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  I think what Macron will give is five more years of failure,
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  five more years of uncontrolled immigration, five more years of failure with the Euro,
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  and I believe Le Pen, if she studies herself, can win this in 2022.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  That is Nigel Farage's take on the French election.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  Related to that, we have this story.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  France has National Front Party to change name after election loss.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  And again, the Western media, the English-speaking media always puts National Front
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  because there was a party in the 70s and 80s in Britain now defunct for 30 years
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  that was actually a right-wing racist party called the National Front.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's called Front National in France, but they always flip it around
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  because they want people to associate it with a party that's been defunct for 30 years to smear and demonise it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  So France has far-right National Front parties gearing up for a name change,
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  but not a makeover of its ideas after its decisive loss to centrist.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  Far left is socialist bureaucrat. That's who he really is, Emmanuel Macron.
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  In interviews Monday, the campaign director for Marine Le Pen, David Rashline said
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  the party founded by her father would get a new name as bait to pull in more supporters in France.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  So they're going to change the name, which is probably a good idea,
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  but it would also be a good idea to completely sever ties and prevent her father from having any kind of platform
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.000]  because he also sticks his big mouth in everything, ruins it for everyone time and time again
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  with his old fish comments. That needs to be clamped down on.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  But again, the question is, will there be anything worth rescuing in France in five years' time
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  given the situation that we've got right now?
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  Hillary Clinton has come out and praised Macron,
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.000]  and the headline Hillary Clinton ties herself to Macron's victory over Le Pen attacks the media.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  Clinton posted a tweet calling Macron's election a victory for the world
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  and a defeat to the hackers who released Macron's emails to the public shortly before the election.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  Again, she still bought her over imaginary hackers,
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  but then she turned the focus towards herself because she's a egomaniac claiming,
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  quote, the media says, I can't talk about that. Clinton is known to have staffers carefully crafted
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  and edit her tweets before posting.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  She said it was victory for Macron for France, for the EU and the world,
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  defeat to those interfering with democracy.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  Oh, apart from if your name's Barack Obama,
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  and then you can interfere with democracy on a regular basis.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  You can come out before Brexit and order the British people to vote for Remain
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  or they'd be at the back of the queue for a trade deal.
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  Well, you're not overseeing that trade deal now, are you, Obama?
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  Neither is Hillary Clinton, but she literally tweeted it was a victory.
[29:16.000 --> 29:23.000]  It was a defeat, sorry, for those interfering with democracy when Obama came out twice
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  and interfered with this election by endorsing Macron.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  Most notably, of course, two days before the actual voting itself.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  Now Hillary Clinton is whining about hackers. Oh, the hackers were defeated again.
[29:39.000 --> 29:45.000]  She still can't move beyond that lame, debunked narrative.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  Absolutely incredible. We'll be back. It's the Alex Jones Show Live. Don't go away.
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.000 --> 30:03.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  Despite Barack Obama and seemingly every major U.S. news network
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist,
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  the fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen as racist,
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  as Bernie Sanders has chimed in saying France rejected racism and xenophobia.
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of Vive Le Frans.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Even though it is not refuted that Le Pen was the nationalist candidate,
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  it's your hooray for France. Long live France as this election will likely mark the end of France
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  and it is a victory for the globalist European Union, not France.

[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.

[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include

[33:00.000 --> 33:09.000]  News. Analysis. Reports. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  Sweet dreams are made of these. Who am I to disagree?
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.000]  Go back on the Alex Jones Show Live, talking about Obama sticking his nose into everything.
[33:20.000 --> 33:24.000]  You know, we were no fans of George W. Bush, but he managed to shut his mouth
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  after he was out of office. That's not going to happen with Barack Obama.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  A couple of weeks ago, they were calling us conspiracy theorists for saying
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  that Obama was interfering in the Trump administration after he'd literally set up a war room
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  two miles from the White House to do exactly that.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  Oh, but you're a conspiracy theorist if you say Obama's interfering.
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  Reuters reports Obama voices fervent hope Congress will tread carefully on healthcare.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  So he came out again last night, stuck his nose in again.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  I mean, that would be okay, but don't then claim that Obama is not interfering in anything
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  when he clearly is on a regular basis. Absolutely incredible.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  InfowarsStore.com, we need your support more than ever, and DNA Force is about to sell out.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  It's the advanced formula designed to help energize mitochondrial function

[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  which has been selling like hotcakes for the past couple of weeks.
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  I think we're trying to get more in stock.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  Don't know if that's happened yet, but it certainly was in short supply.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  Last time I checked it is the high quality made in America premium T-shirt
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  with the most triggering slogan you could ever imagine,
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  along with my faith, which makes it a hundred times more triggering
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  to verified liberals on Twitter and everybody else.
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  The right kind of people that you really want to annoy.

[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  Now sticking with the French news just for a couple of minutes here,
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  then we'll move on to other news.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  What we also saw last night after Macron's victory was Syrians,
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.000]  Syrian migrants at his rallies, at his celebration rallies in France,
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  waving, not the Syrian flag, waving the rebel jihadist flag.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  Now let me explain the difference between the Syrian national flag
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  and the rebel jihadist flag because there are certain journalists
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  on Twitter who don't know the difference,
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  yet try and lecture me and claim I'm lying
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  and claim I'm fake news for pointing out the difference.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  In fact, let's throw up that tweet.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  I sent you the tweet before the show.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  We have a journalist called Richard Chambers tweeting after I drew
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  attention to the fact that Macron supporters were celebrating.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  There's his tweet.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  Now if you go and click on my original tweet there,
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  you can see if you click on the original tweet right there.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  This is the image that I posted on Twitter earlier today.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  You can see that is the rebel FSA flag.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  That is the opposition jihadist sympathizing group in Syria,
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  the ones who defected to the ones who gave all their weapons to ISIS.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  That is their flag.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  That is a Macron rally in the immediate aftermath of the French election.
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  Now you go back to his tweet, bearing in mind that this is not
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  the Syrian national flag, this is the FSA rebel flag.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  You go back to the journalist's tweet.
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  If you click back on the page there, you can see what he said.
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  He said this is, of course, the Syrian national flag.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Lie is going to lie.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  Well, Richard Chambers, it's not the Syrian national flag.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  If you scroll down, I actually explain what the difference is.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  On the left you see the Syrian national flag.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  That is the flag of the Syrian government currently in control in Syria
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  that controls Damascus.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  The flag on the right is the FSA opposition rebel flag,
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  not the official Syrian national flag.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  Even the United Nations on their own website says that it's not the Syrian national flag.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  So this guy is lying.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  He's literally putting out fake news while accusing me of lying
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  and putting out fake news.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  Of course, this was retweeted by a bunch of verified liberals,
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  as we call them on Twitter,
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  claiming they had the moral high ground.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  They're right. Oh, my God, I've been caught red-handed putting out fake news
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  by claiming that this flag, which is not the Syrian national flag,
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  is not the Syrian national flag.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'm lying by telling the truth.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  I mean, they claimed that the Syrian national flag,
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  that this was it, that this was the SNC flag,
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  even though the SNC, the Syrian national council,
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  is not even based in Syria.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  It's based in Istanbul,
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  and yet they're still claiming that this is the French national flag.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  And I point that out to him in the tweet,
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  as did hundreds and hundreds of other people.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  But again, is he going to delete the tweet?
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  Is he going to issue a retraction? No.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  It's going to stay up there because these people are liars.
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  They're putting out fake news while simultaneously accusing me of being a liar
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  and putting out fake news.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  Well, you know, hundreds of people have probably retweeted that by now.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  They can snigger about it.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Oh, my God, I've been coping out fake news.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  And they're the ones literally doing that.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  That is not the Syrian national flag.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  The Syrian national flag is red, white, and black.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  It's not green, white, and black.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  Okay, that's the rebel flag.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  Those are the moderates, you know, the people that behead Christians
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  and tear out hearts and eat them on camera.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  The moderates, yeah, those people.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  That's their flag, not the Syrian national flag.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Again, it's not the Syrian national flag.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Yet this guy is not going to retract.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  He's just going to leave it up there.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  Well, good luck to him because there are hundreds of people right now pointing out
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  that he's the one putting out fake news.
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.000]  Absolutely incredible the lengths that they will go to to deny what's going on.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  Let's stick to some more French news before we move on now.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  One third of French voters spoiled ballots or abstained.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  This is out of AFP.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  A third of French voters declined to choose between centrism.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Again, centrist.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Not a centrist.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  He's literally a bureaucrat in the far left socialist government
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  declined to choose between Macron and far right leader Marine Le Pen,
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  who is not even far right in many issues.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  She's actually left wing, especially economically,
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  but, you know, we don't do nuance to do it anymore.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  No, far right demonize racist fascist demonize.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  We don't do nuance anymore.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  We don't point out actual facts or dig an inch below the surface
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  because that doesn't fit our narrative.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  So a third either abstained or spoiled their ballots,
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  which is a record rate in nearly half a century.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  According to official results, more than 80% of votes counted.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  The abstention rate stood at nearly 25% the highest since 1969.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  In addition, they reported a record number of blank and invalid ballots
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  accounting for 9% of all registered voters
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  compared to 2% in the first round.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  So almost 10% of all registered voters in France
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  spoiled their ballots or just submitted it blank.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  So you want to try and claim that this Macron globalist has a mandate.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  10% of people who voted spoiled their ballots.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  Obviously they don't have to be Le Pen supporters
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  to be opposed to him and his agenda, which you see today.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  They're out on the streets again.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Not Le Pen supporters.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  Unionist left wingers are out on the streets.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  Major French cities rioting, attacking cops, burning stuff,
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  as they did before the election,
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.000]  as they will continue to do so because that is the new France.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  And the French people, at least enough of them,
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  have voted for a continuation of that situation.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  Good luck. Good luck, friends.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  I hope you're enjoying those.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  21G had its attacks in the past two and a half years.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Good luck with that.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  Infowars.com story video.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  Italian reporter attacked by migrants on live television.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  You can go and watch the video in the article.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  It's all in Italian, so I'll describe it.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  Shock video out of Italy shows a female reporter fleeing in panic
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  after being attacked by migrants on live television.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  So she goes down to the local train station there in Rome
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  to give a report on the situation.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  You see migrants sleeping on mattresses in the background,
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  as you see in many French cities now.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  She was assaulted almost immediately.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  So you hear the feed cut for the live broadcast.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  She's assaulted.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  The people in the studio begin to panic.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  They say, call the police. She comes back briefly
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  and says in Italian, we were attacked. We were attacked.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  Then this migrant tries to attack her and her cameraman again.
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  She says, what do you want? Are you crazy?
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  She lets out a loud scream and then the footage ends.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  Oh, my God, states the host of the show before again instructing
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  his production team to call the police.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  The migrant attempted to violently assault both Paracelle
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  and her cameraman, but both were rescued by a passing taxi driver
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  who bundled them to safety inside his car and called the police.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  They later identified the attacker as a 37-year-old
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  from the Ivory Coast with no document or residency permit
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  who authorities had ordered deported back in September last year.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  Of course, he's still in the country, not deported,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  nothing whatsoever has happened to him.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  Now he's free to attack and assault anyone else.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  Again, why are these migrants arriving in Italy
[43:55.000 --> 44:01.000]  because the EU and NGOs backed by big leftist conglomerates
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  are literally providing a C-taxi service
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  to go and pick up migrants 12 miles off the coast of Libya.
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  They literally get into contact with criminal people smugglers who say
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  we have a boatload of migrants ready.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  Many of them not even from Libya, none of them from Syria,
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  but most of them not even from Libya.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  They're from Eritrea, they're from Ivory Coast,
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  they're from these other countries,
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  none of which have a migrant crisis, none of which are being bombarded,
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  none of whom these people are fleeing war,
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  and almost none of whom are women and children.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  But they get on the phone to the criminal people smugglers,
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  they say we've got another boatload,
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  the EU, the NGOs literally sail all the way out
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  to 12 miles off the coast of Libya, pick them up, dump them in Italy.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  Nowhere for them to go, so they just sleep under the train station.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  And then it leads to situations like this
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  where they're physically violently attacking women.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  The process goes on and on and on.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  Gateway Pundit reports,
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  horror in Germany, woman breaks both legs after migrant hurls her out of a window
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  for refusing sex.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  An asylum seeker in Germany is accused of throwing a woman out of a window
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  and breaking both her legs, that's cultural enrichment,
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  after she refused to have sex with him.
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  Dawat, A, allegedly drank beer and vodka
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  at a refugee center in Benzheim before threatening a woman
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  identified only as turhat 26 with a broken bottle.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  The prosecution said he was furious because he wanted to have sex
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  and she refused him. Listen to this.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  When I kept saying no, the victim said,
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  he raised me up like a child, carried me to the window and dropped me.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  Dawat claimed he is being held for no reason
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  and that life has been unfair or poor baby.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  Life has been so unfair,
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  that means you can go rape women and throw them out of windows.
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  No, it doesn't. Not in a civilized society, thank you very much.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  But life has been unfair since he came to Germany in 2014.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  He previously sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  So it's not the first time it's happened again.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  You go and watch the videos, you go and talk to those migrants in Paris,
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  in other French cities, they believe they should be given apartment jobs,
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  welfare for life.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  Now, they find out that's not the reality
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  that they've been told by the people smugglers
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  and they think they have a genuine grievance
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  that allows them to go out and rape and kill women,
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  because that's reasonable.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  That's reasonable, isn't it?
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Life has been unfair.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  And again, Macron said,
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  celebrated the policy of imposing Muslim migrants
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  six months after the Neese attacks.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  It continues to get worse.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  We see these stories every single day.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  There's no end to it.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  With the summer months coming, it's only going to continue.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  Meanwhile, in America,
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  shock video, elderly woman attacked
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  Block Boy's Pool Party in Florida,
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  thrown into pool with her dogs.
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  And this was quite interesting,
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  because more people were concerned about the dogs
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  who were not thrown into the pool or assaulted,
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  but an elderly white woman was slammed to the ground,
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  then thrown into a pool along with her dogs on Saturday
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  after she politely asked a mob of partygoers
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  in South Florida to lower their music.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  Now, you can go to the article and watch the video.
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  Here it is.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  So he picks her up to throw her in the pool.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  Oh, but he slips.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  So they said, oh, that's okay.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  The guy who picked her up to assault her
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  and throw her in the pool didn't mean to body slam her.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  He just slipped.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Oh, that makes it okay then.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  No, that's fine.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  That was literally the response from people on Twitter.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  So when he slipped,
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  she cracked her head on the concrete,
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  concussed.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  She nearly drowned.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  Again, reverse the tables.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  This was a group of white people assaulting
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  an elderly black woman.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  It would be a national news story, and rightly so.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  This barely even a news story at all.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  They haven't caught the culprit.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  It's obviously some kind of hate crime.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  It's all over Twitter.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  Generally on Twitter, people were celebrating it
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  and saying how funny it was.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  And then you had the excuses.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Oh, he didn't mean to body slam her.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  He just slipped and cracked her head open.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  Oh, that's fine then.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Before dumping her in the swimming pool,
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  nearly drowning her.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  Oh, that's perfectly okay then again.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  Balls were reversed.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  It would be a national news story.
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  It's barely even a news story.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  Information Liberation reports
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  soon the white devils will be exterminated.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  DC ISIS sympathisers are arrested
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  buying AK-47 for race war.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  We've talked about this over and over again.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  We've seen it with the individual
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  who shot the Dallas cops.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Xavier Johnson, again, he wanted a race war.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  He hated white people.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  He was radicalized by this cutesy,
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  trendy anti-white racism
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  that the dominant leftist media
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  and cultural institutions have legitimized.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  It's creating actual fringe,
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  violent radical people
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  who are now actually sympathizing with ISIS.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Talk about it over and over again.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  ISIS training manual.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  ISIS propaganda manual they put out
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  saying the left shares most of our goals.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  Why don't we just start recruiting them
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  and turning them into violent jihadists?
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  This is what's happened in this case.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  A Muslim black nationalist and ISIS sympathizer
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  was busted by the FBI.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Last week in Washington, DC,
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  they were firing an AK-47
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  to allegedly attack white devils
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  and start a race war.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  I wonder why the national media
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  is ignoring this story.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  NBC Washington reports a DC resident
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  who sympathized with ISIS
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  bought an automatic weapon
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  that he wanted to use to start a race war.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Clark Galloway was arrested Thursday
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  after he arranged to buy an AK-47
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  from an FBI informant caught document to say.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  He posted on Facebook,
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  that soon the great killing will commence
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  and again he targeted white people.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  That was his motivation, his hatred for white people.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  He friended several hundred Islamic State
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  fighters and sympathizers, joined ISIS Facebook groups
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  and posted pro-ISIS propaganda.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  He had two Facebook accounts,
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  one related to his extremist racial views.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  Oh, he kept them separate
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and one related to his pro-ISIS views.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  This is a guy who was literally trying to be some pocket
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  violent revolutionary.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  Again, you see that fusion
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  between black militant groups and ISIS.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  Bearing in mind the ideological guru
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  behind Black Lives Matter is a convicted
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  cop killing terrorist.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  It all begins to make sense.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  We'll be back with the final segment of this hour.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  This is Michael David from Seattle.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  After ten weeks of taking Andrew 400,
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  That was eight years ago.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  I continued to take Andrew 400
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  and I've maintained my weight at no cost.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  I started taking Andrew 400
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  to increase my testosterone.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  and my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  I have more energy and I look and feel 20 years younger
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  I continue to take Andrew 400 and I've maintained my weight
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  at 172.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Gained muscle and energy.
[51:36.000 --> 52:02.000]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years,
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  to our modern diet of processed junk.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLife.com,
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  turmeric root, shaga mushroom,
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  and seven total primal superfoods
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  in a single great tasting formula.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  having to actually build civilization
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  that are our superior ancestors
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  but you used the bones for strength
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  and ForestLives.com today.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  have produced a high speed DVD and book
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  to show you how to drive in combat,
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  patrol and how to survive in combat.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  Skills you'll need when it hits the fan.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  Go to DrivenDVD.com
[53:42.000 --> 53:58.000]  Advertising your business with GCN is simple, effective and more affordable than you might think.
[53:58.000 --> 54:12.000]  From deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide,
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  with our London offices and the amazing Paul Joseph Watson,
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  follow him on Twitter at Prison Planet.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  I'm at Real Alex Jones.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Let me get more active on Twitter,
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  not just pushing our stories and videos out
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  but a lot of my original thought.
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  Let's go more, getting it loaded on my phone today
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  where I can interact personally
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  without even having a camera person there
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  as much as possible.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  So be sure and follow me at Real Alex Jones.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  We have gotten more of the super blue
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver back in.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  It's available, it's concentrated at InfoWarStore.com.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  Your purchase helps fund the operation.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  DNA Force is back in stock but for a moment in time
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  it's going to sell out at current sales rates today.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  Your purchase makes the broadcast possible
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  and we are also about to sell out of X2
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  and then Dr. Groups only got one more big run left
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  and if he doesn't get more of the Deep Earth crystals
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  that will be it for X2.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  I certainly hope that's not the case
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  but X2 is going to sell out the next 48 hours.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  It will be about two weeks till we get more in.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarZlife.com
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  or AAA-2533139.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  We also have 40% off the new MicroBreeze
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  with a negative ion generator
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  that just plugs into your cigarette lighter
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  and busts up so much garbage inside your car.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  It's like a little ozone generator basically for your car.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  That's available at InfoWarStore.com
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  when you sign up for the newsletter
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  at InfoWarZ.com.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  You get daily discounts of 40 to 50% off
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  every day on a different item
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  of the thousands of items that are available
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  at InfoWarStore.com.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  But what's most important is this.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  There is massive censorship taking place globally.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  InfoWarZ has been picked as the case point example.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  I want Paul to finish up the next four minutes
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  with his points.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I want him to come back and do five more minutes
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  with me at the start of the next hour
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  on where he sees this battle
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  the globalists are launching against free speech going.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  Paul, back to the points you were making.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  Yeah, I don't know if you're aware of this, Alex,
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  but of course we had the Homeland series recently
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  which was a direct attack on InfoWarZ.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  They literally created a character based around you.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  By the way, it had a terrible accent and voice.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  It was a miserable failure.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  In fact, I think it's the lowest rated
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  Homeland series ever or it was
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  for the first couple of episodes at least
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  because they had this big social justice turn.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  It actually used to be a good show.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  I used to watch it when it was actually good.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Now they didn't even have like Islamic terrorism.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  It's that PC.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  But this fake radio host who was based on you,
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  the whole setup InfoWarZ,
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  they actually had a plotline where
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  the traffic to his website was not real
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  and that it was all Russian bots
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  faking traffic,
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  not just tweets, but traffic
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  to the actual...
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Oh, and I guess Russia failed, didn't they, Paul?
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Russia failed.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  They were supposedly going to bring Le Pen in.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  The all-powerful Russians failed.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  Well, it's funny because
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  this radio host character turns out
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  to be working with the CIA as well.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  So they've literally taken everything
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  they could think of, thrown it
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  and hoped that something would stick.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  It's a complete abysmal failure.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  Again, lowest ratings for any theories.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  But again, you know, if we were all back
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  by Russian bots,
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  who's buying the products, Alex?
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Are we sending them all to Russia?
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  We have to have a real audience
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  if we have people buying real physical products, right?
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Even the Washington Post last week
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  had a headline, Religion and Guns
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  and said, we're pro-gun because of Russians.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Did you know it's Russia
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  that gave us the Second Amendment, Paul?
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  And as you see in the USA today,
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  they're now wearing hijabs
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  in solidarity against Trump.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  The hijab is now the new symbol of feminism.
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  The very first Arab feminist groups
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  back in Egypt in 1922
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  literally said,
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  the hijab is a symbol of oppression.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Let's cast it off. Let's get rid of it.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  They were Muslim Arab women
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  a hundred years ago.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  They were real feminists, okay?
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  People wearing it now are not real feminists.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  They're in with the Islamist, very fake news.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Cutting women's genitals off, keeping them as slaves,
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  not letting them drive cars,
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  executing them of another man rapes them.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  That is totally liberal
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  and you're a hate monger.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  You will be defeated in Fidel!
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  No!
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  You know, genital mutilation.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  It's genital cutting.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Shut your mouth, pig.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  Shut your mouth, pig.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  We'll be back in 70.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  You will submit.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  Are you ever belong to me now?
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  I will crush you.
[58:46.000 --> 59:10.000]  I love America.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  Thank you.
[59:46.000 --> 59:52.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[59:52.000 --> 59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  The Insider Watson will be defeated.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Oh, yes.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Yes, feminist, wear hoods on head, let us cut your genitals off.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  That's a fair time. Fairness doctrine.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  I'm gonna have a character called Habit that pops in occasionally
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  but we're going to blow you up in slave caravan.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  You like it. It's liberal.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  It's not quite a muslin accent.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  It's more like a weird Hungarian accent or something.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  Oh, mother!
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  What are we gonna put up with here?
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Father!
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  More of that fake voice.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  It's all fake.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Yeah, right.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  We're so real they don't know what to do about it.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  We're total maniacs.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  They don't care what the global speakers say or do.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  All right, Watson.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  I'm fake. Stephen Colbert is real.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Paul, where do you see the censorship going, this total war
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  that we're right in the middle of with our listeners?
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  I mean, a lot of victories for nationalism, big defeat for nationalism and populism
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  with Le Pen just recapping the state of the world right now, Paul.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Well, different European countries are different points of the journey.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Definitely, France is further behind.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Sweden Democrats are the most popular party in Sweden right now.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  They've got an election next year.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  We've got a German election coming up.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  That's probably a lost cause because the AFD is not very well organized
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  but generally because of just the mood in Germany.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  But again, that Swedish election next year is going to be big.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And, you know, we continue to battle forward with Brexit.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  Talking about fake, Alex.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Zero hedge has got a headline.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Facebook deletes tens of thousands of accounts ahead of UK general election.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Now, they did this before the French election,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  deleting 30,000 accounts right beforehand.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  And they say they're going to educate the public.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  They're taking out national newspaper print advertising campaign ads
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  to quote, educate the British public about fake news
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  as part of a concerted global effort to crack down on the false information epidemic
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  that's seen on his platform.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And let's not forget, Pusselby acts being sued by the French
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  because he got involved in their election saying how horrible Macron is
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  while Obama got involved in the election.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  So every globalist can get involved, but none of us can have opinions
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  according to the French.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  No, and of course, the Stanford University study found that quote,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  fake news had no effect whatsoever on the US presidential election.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  They never talk about that study, did they?
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Because again, the real agenda is censorship.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Yes, there is fake news. It's tiny.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  But then you look at the list of fake news websites.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  It's Breitbart, Info Wars, Daily Caller.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  It's all just conservative websites.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  There are some fake news sites that hardly anybody goes to.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  They're like Satire.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  So there's very few independent fake sites,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  but there are a ton of establishment ones.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Major movie production companies with 20th Century Fox
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  or was it Universal.com putting on all those fake news sites to attack Trump.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Comedy Central just thought out a new fake video of Trump
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  and people thought it was real.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  They're the ones constantly lying, saying,
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  WMDs are in Iraq.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  I mean, they're the real corporate fake news.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And that's at record levels, Paul.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Well, literally, I talked about it earlier, this mainstream hack.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Accused me of pointing out fake news for saying that the rebel flag
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  was being flown at Macron rallies.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  He claimed it was the Syrian national flag.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Literally fake news.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  The Syrian national flag is red, white, and black.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  The rebel flag is green, white, and black.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Those are the moderate rebels that behead people
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  and cut out their hearts and eat them.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Okay, that's not the Syrian national flag.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Literally putting out fake news and accusing me
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  of putting out fake news on Twitter.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And we see examples like that every day.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  So now Facebook is going to delete more accounts.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  They've got fake news flags so he can flag up fake news stories.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Oh, but not if you go on CNN.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Oh, and by the way, CNN's YouTube videos,
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  none of them have been restricted.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  None have been demonetized even though they're talking about ISIS.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  They can put ISIS terrorism in the headline.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  We can't.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  That's right.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  We're not allowed to discuss a debate
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  because we're not certified like CNN,
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  like that internal Google memo saying CNN is real.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And Ron Paul is not on Alex Jones.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Because it said, you may notice we're reporting some of the same stuff,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  but when they do it, it's okay.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  When we do it, it's not allowed, Paul.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  And people on YouTube are now getting community strikes
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  if they legitimately criticize and make fun of the young Turks.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  They're getting videos, whites and communities.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Well, the young Turks are in trouble.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Obviously their numbers are down admittedly
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  and the new movies come out.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  The promise showing what the young Turks originally did
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  in a situation in Turkey.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  So they're pretty upset.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Paul, great job. See you back tomorrow in the fourth hour.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  We'll be back.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  I'm Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  And for Infowars.com, the Trump Effect has been huge.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  Today we call it bone broth.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  in a single great tasting formula.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Caveman.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  that are our superior ancestors.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  but you used the bones for strength,
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  the ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  We've been sold out for months.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  Our one of a kind InfoWarsLife Biotrusillinium formula
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  This is the true selenium formula
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its core.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  is produced with synthetic selenium,
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  of 100% organic mustard seed,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  the effects of the essential trace mineral selenium
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  are well known.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  to DNA production and eyesight,
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Biotrusillinium is also the perfect supercharger
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  to survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  as both help support a healthy thyroid
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  and many other systems.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  of Biotrusillinium before we sell out again.

[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  to secure your selenium and other key products
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  that don't only help yourself and your family,

[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  A360WIN.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Resistance to tyrants
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  is obedience to God.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  Look on screen if you are a
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  TV viewer, radio listeners.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Go to my Twitter at realalexjones.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  You can see it.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  The globalist and their Luciferian system
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  is now
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  out in the open.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  That's a direct screenshot from
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Princeton News Agency Television
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  with Macron
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  standing in front of the
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  666 pieces of
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  paint glass
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  designed and commissioned by
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  François Mitterrand,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  the former French president back in the early 1990s,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  and he wrote in major magazines
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  that he channeled on a mountaintop
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  the design of the pyramid
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  to channel Lucifer
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  and have Lucifer reside
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  in Paris, France.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  The Illuminati
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  in your face.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  You might want to retweet that
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  from real Alex Jones.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Get it out to everybody you know.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  I want to get into
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  opening the borders even more
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  under globalism, their endgame.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  I want to get into the latest on
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Obamacare.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  Jack Pasobiac sued
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  by
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  Mr.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  New World Order
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Macron is going to be joining us
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  at the bottom of the hour.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  They're suing him for criticizing Macron
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  and saying he worked for the Rothschilds
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  in banking, which he did.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Isn't that just special?
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  This is the globalism
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  that we're facing
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  where you get sued
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  if you dare criticize any of their operations.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Of course it's a badge of honor
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  to say this thing happened to you.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  We all know what Mr.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Soros is up to right now with me.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  So that's all
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  coming up
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  at the bottom of the hour.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  But let's look into
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  what makes the globalist tick,
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  what makes them operate.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  They want to condition the public
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  to some new things societally
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  that's going to be happening.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  They'll tell them, oh, in 50 years
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  or 100 years or a thousand years
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  humans will split
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  into two different species.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Oh, in 100 years
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  there'll be a singularity and we're going to
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  transform into silicon-based life forms
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  but by then you'll be dead.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  That way
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  you feel like you're not
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  threatened but you're being conditioned
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  and tech insider
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  as a division of business insider
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  has come out
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  and explained how you're going to have
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  nanotech inside you changing your DNA
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  and how it's all going to be synthetic
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  and how you're going to merge
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  with machines and be immortal.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Now when I put out my film
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  in-game 10 years ago
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  The New York Times attacked it and said it was totally
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  delusional and that I believe the elites
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  were trying to be immortal
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  but first tear out the extermination
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  of the general population of the planet
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  that they were going to play God and genetically
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  re-engineer the entire world
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  and that they would introduce more chemicals
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  and more biologicals
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  to the vaccines
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  and other systems
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  so that
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  they could trigger genetic disorders
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  that
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  were predisposed
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  when you're bombarded with certain chemicals
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  or certain genetics or certain viruses
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  to be triggered then as disease
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  becomes epidemic
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  on every front
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  they will then have treatments
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  that allow you to live
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  but change fundamentally who you are
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  to survive and then make you a captive
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  of that breakaway technology
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  they're saying within a generation
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  90% of births are going to be cesarean
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  they're already trying to phase out
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  women breastfeeding their children
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  they knew 100 years ago
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  when they said go on formula
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  go to work women
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  don't hold your baby next to your skin
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  they already done psychological testing
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  in England, the United States and Germany
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  showing the children would have shrunken brains
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  low IQs
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  and be basically sociopathic
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  or zombie like
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  because they wouldn't have any real
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  empathy or human connection
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  that's why you walk around in public
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  and I don't care what color people are
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  they all look the same
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  most of them look like shrunken head
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  zombies
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  with no life in their eyes
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  just wandering around aimlessly
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  shuffling looking for somebody
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  to give them something
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  they're the walking dead
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  I say let the dead bury the dead
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  I love them I care about them
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  but you can't reach most of them
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  we've got to reach out to the people that still have the spark
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  of energy in their eyes
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  who are still alive
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  because the dead are all around us
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  and I realize that more people every day
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  are succumbing to basically the sleep state
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  the near consciousness state
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  and then once they're in that state
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  they're being programmed, they're being bombarded
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  they're being conditioned
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  they're being
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  directed to basically hate themselves
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  and hate everyone around them
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  so they can be prepared to just kind of roll over
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  as husk of former humans
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  and die falling to this alien system
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  that's being built
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  when I say alien system
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  computers are alien to this planet
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  they're a new system, a new form of
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  information
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  our viruses alive or dead, you can argue that
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  our computers alive or dead, you can argue that
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Google is alive
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  because billions of humans interface
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  with it as a giant neural
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  digital electrochemical network
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  interface
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  and that's Google's own admission
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  a over the horizon
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  system that can tell the future
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  and then manipulate human stimuli
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  on a mass scale to control the future
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  that's the big holy grail
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  but you can only do that
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  by getting the general public to subserve
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  to hand over their consciousness
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  to hand over their will
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  to the beast system
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  and that's what they've now done
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  they call themselves at the EU
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  at the IMF, at the World Bank
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  at the WTO
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  at the TPP
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  all the same people, they call it
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  or they call it
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  they call it a technocracy
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  what is a technocracy? a technological
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  computerized system of
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  total control run by an elite
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  of technocrats
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  an all seeing how
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  2000 computer
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  mapping human development
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  human systems
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  and using that data
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  to warp and destroy
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  and sacrifice humanity
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  on the altar of their synthetic
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  silicon god
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  but they sell it like it's fine
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  it's cute, see
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  don't warn somebody that they're going to try to microchip
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  the public to buy and sell 20 years ago
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  oh you're a cuckoo, you're crazy
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  even when it's in Pentagon documents
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  they don't want you to form the opinion that's dangerous
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  up front, so they say
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Alex Jones is crazy, he's evil, he's bad, it doesn't exist
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  then it starts coming on ABC
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  CBS, NBC
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  soon everyone will have a chip
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  it's for the better good, just submit
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  and then now, oh world government
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  is here, oh, we are going to penalize you
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  if you have more than one child
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  oh, most people are becoming sterile, don't worry
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  we have synthetic DNA
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  the government's going to let you have two daddies
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  because families are hurtful
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  don't say you're a mother or a father
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  don't say you're a mother or a father
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  on your entrance paperwork for your kindergartner
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  well the next step is there are no sexes
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  they're getting rid
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  of that because there will be no sexes
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  there's only people hooked into machines
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  into the big black pyramid of death
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  the technocracy
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  and so they come out, what humans will look like in a thousand years
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  oh, we'll be immortal
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  we'll be in machines, our consciousness will be in a machine
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  and I'm sure the people that let us do this
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  this big mainframe
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  it's going to be loving and let us have free will
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  because the very people that building it are all against free will
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  they're into pedophilia
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  they're into death, they're into war
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  they're into selfishness, they're into ego
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  they're into being total narcissist
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  while calling anybody that fights them a narcissist
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  but oh, I'm sure
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  in the process of this
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  we'll all be taken up to the big mothership
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  at childhood's end
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  and we'll all be happy
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  in one big giant togetherness
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  but during this reeducation
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  we've got to go live in big plastic sports stadiums
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  and there'll be no more money
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  it'll be the wonderful zeitgeist that the UN
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  and the New York Times are pushing
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  oh, it's going to be so wonderful
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  so we have the planopolis videos
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  that are shown to elementary school students in England
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  there's 10 different videos
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  guys, queue up mega-opolis
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  so the planopolis on YouTube
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  and oh, you get meat once a year on your birthday
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  and nobody has cars with the elite
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  and you're told what job you're going to have
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  and everything's tracked because of carbon being the big evil
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  not genetic engineering
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  not all the abominations against the planet
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  and the genome and God
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  none of that's an issue
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  not the human animal chimeras
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  none of that exists, even though it does exist
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  what really matters is
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  carbon dioxide, the plants breathe
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  let's tax that
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  because this is all about
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  the fallen evil spirit on this planet
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  this interdimensional parasite
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  wanting to be God
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  and so it needs to infect humanity
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  made in the image of God
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  humanity that's meant to slowly
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  through free will develop
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  into our next level
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  we have this
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  hijacker
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  that's come in and taken over the species
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  and is using it
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  because it doesn't have the creativity
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  to build this new twisted system
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  that it believes
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  is its escape
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  off this planet
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  now the media whenever I break that down says
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  I'm crazy, I'm nuts, what am I saying
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  they've built new silicon creations
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  they've built new animal
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  human hybrid
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  clones, that's admitted
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  they've merged hundreds of different species together
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  and put it in pharmacological crops
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  and put it into salmon and put it into monkeys
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  and put it into spider goats decades ago
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  and yes China
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  is planning a new megalopolis the size of New England
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  to test new solutions
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  kind of like the Pentagon admits that
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Disney World and Disneyland
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  or psychological warfare testing facilities
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  for the new planned cities
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  where everyone's a prisoner
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  with biometric ID codes
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  it's a dystopia because the people
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  running it are dystopic
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  the economy's been turned on in China and not here
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  that's how they can build mega cities in three years
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  we can't even pay off our debt because the elites
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  don't want us to and along comes Trump
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  saying he wants to do it
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  and they're fighting him like he's the devil incarnate
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  so now let me review
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  the video that's gotten five and a half million views
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  in two days
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  what humans will look like in a thousand years
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  oh what the elite want you to look like
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  in 50 years if you're one of them
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  these hateful greedy people
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  will keep hating and killing
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  until there's only two of them left
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  and then they'll end up trying to kill each other
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  for the great ultimate power
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  of being the only conscious creature
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  as Ray Kurzweil said he doesn't believe in God
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  yet
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  so they have these
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  TV
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  promotions out there
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  internet promotions where oh it shows
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  oh we're six seven inches higher than we were
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  100 years ago with oh
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  we had radio, we had TV and then we had iPhones
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  and then like a face sucker
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  it goes in your ear, it goes on your retina
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  it goes in your brain and next you know it
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  you have turned into a cyborg
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  and the media will talk about how cool you are
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and how amazing you are
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  and then you fully turn over whatever consciousness
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  you have left into that false reality
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  so that you can feel like you're a god
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  but you won't be a god
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  you'll be living a delusion
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  a great delusion
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  the elites met in the last 30 years
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  they met 17 years ago
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  and Bill Joy one of the owners of Sun Microsystem
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  said he met there, he talked with the elites
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  and the decision was give you low level
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  technology to entertain you to death
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  make you feel like you were transcendent
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  while the elite actually try to transcend
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  and then you'll finally just be exterminated
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  once the robots and computers are all in place
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  and once you've been entertained into a jellyfish
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  wally like existence
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  you can be pushed over more easily
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  you can also read why the future doesn't need us
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  but you can also read Revolution, flashmob
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  brain chips, a grim vision of the future
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  2007, 10 years ago
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  where the British Ministry of Defense
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  and the Pentagon basically said
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  the elites are going to move into compact
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  city states
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  everybody else is going to have their
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  resources turned off, the third world is going to be
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  allowed into what was left of the first world to crash it
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  once the first world has been crashed
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  they'll then have the middle class
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  get in agreement with the
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  biological weapons release
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  that'll wipe out most of the world population
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  but the injections
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  you're given and the nanotech
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  emulsions you're given, the drinks
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  and blood transfusions you're given
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  with nanotech to allow you to survive
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  the biological apocalypse
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  will enslave you completely as a binary
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  weapon to the globalist system
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  to be subservient and without
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  paying everything into their system, giving them
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  all your resources, submitting to them
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  totally and completely
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  they will then not give you the new upgrades
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  that are needed to be able to live into the future
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  and your journey towards absolute
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  total enslavement will be complete
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  once they insert you into the proto-matrix
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  artificial environment
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  that without it you'll die, just like traveling
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  to Mars you die without an artificial
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  oxygen and gravity environment
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  you will die on this planet
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  because the great goal is putting you
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  into a system to end your humanity
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  and make you totally subservient to them
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  like ancient Chinese emperors
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  and emperorses in their forbidden city
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  with three foot long toenails
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  and their feet bound so they couldn't even
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  walk with the ruling class
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  behind the throne telling you from birth
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  you are the supreme emperor
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  emperors you can't even wipe your own ass
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  but through trendiness
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  and culture and it being fun
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  and a grand faloon
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  and a willingness to be
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  giving up your own will
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  to be part of something quote successful
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  you will wave all of your human rights
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  never even knowing the system
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  that you were basically put into from birth
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  but no one's more
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  enslaved than the so called elite themselves
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  that believe they're part of this
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  that's why they have to bring down the borders
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  flood us with the third world populations
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  have PC's on the streets
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  have heroin injectors everywhere
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  have society breaking down
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  child porn being force fed to everybody
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  so that things are so ugly
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  you ask for virtual reality
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  the architecture is ugly
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  the culture is ugly you ask to be
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  part of one of the forest
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  or equatorial pacific redoubts
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  where you can sit back
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  and watch your technocrat parents
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  direct the destruction of the world
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  from their command base
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  why would anyone want to put up with this
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  because you look at the jellyfish like
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  followers injected with brain damage
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  and chemicals from birth fluoride
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  the vaccines the GMO
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  like zombies looking for stimulus
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  looking for entertainment not knowing real stimulus
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  is about human endeavor and human
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  empowerment and the human future
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  and transcending this great evil
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  this this this marooned
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  interdimensional attack
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  because they're building a false
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  synthetic chimera genetic
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  engineering beyond the island of dr.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  maroon nightmare the alien species
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  are already here the alien attack
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  is already here the huge dust clouds
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  flying around
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  like interstellar
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  the atmosphere already breaking down
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  holes in the atmosphere
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  from hundreds of nuclear tests
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  by the united states to try to destroy
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  the atmosphere to try to destroy the van
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  allen radiation belt to try to blow holes
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  in it blowing holes the scientists
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  just had to do it they said it was
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  religious to detonate huge hydrogen bombs
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  hundreds of them in the upper atmosphere
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  instead blowing holes in it and off
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  and then passing and then
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  geoengineering trying to destroy our atmosphere
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  we're up against major attack
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  this is a satanic invasion
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  you want to know what science fiction looks like baby
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  you're in it
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  and you can already see most of the public is already
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  falling to it and now they've got
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  new nano tech in the food and the water
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  and nano tech in the water and nano tech in the vaccines
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  but they need you to opt
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  in to go take it it's metaphysical
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  and you take the vaccine
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  they've caught the last few major flu vaccines
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  with nano tech in it
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  with artificially created viruses the top
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  virologists look at it and they say we don't know what it is
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  because it's so compressed but it's super
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  advanced technology and then that goes in
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  and literally reprograms the brain
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  and then that's why people are now zombie like
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  and they're only alive when they're watching tv
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  being programmed we're already
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  in the mass collapse
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  10s
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  of thousands of pharmacological
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  crops are planted everywhere
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  growing viruses growing live bacteria
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  growing chemicals they're blowing around everywhere
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  just mixing with everything they're using the plants
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  as the weapon delivery system
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  and the globalist are testing and all on us
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  they've got mitigating sciences they've developed
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  that they're testing on themselves
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  and the only reason they haven't killed everybody yet
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  is they still don't think they'd escape it
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  they still aren't sure
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  that they've got mitigating systems and they're worried
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  about nuclear war because there's a few
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  governments they don't completely control
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  like Russia and others
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  and Russia's got its own parallel plans along this direction
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  and so they're all in a race for the singularity
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  and they're afraid
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  that if they let
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  the cat out of the bag too soon and release the bioweapon
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  that there'll be other governments like
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Pakistan and Russia and people
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  go so crazy during this they're going to launch
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  nuclear weapons and then that could damage their
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  overall plan into the future
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  but you're already being murdered
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  you're already being killed and so why do I even sit
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  here and talk about
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  oh the French president with a giant black
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  pyramid behind him built by a Luciferian
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  why do we even talk
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  about of course there's giant child porn
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  and child kidnapping operations going on
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  of course I mean the very species
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  is being slaughtered being diseased
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  being attacked
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  the average westerner has almost a 90% sperm count
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  drop most women are now becoming infertile
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  it's all by design
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  breast cancer up 3,000%
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  pediatric cancer is over 10,000%
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  and it's all just normalized
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  it's all just no big deal it's all just accept it
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  just go along with it just give up your
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  consciousness just be delusional
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  just decide it's all okay it's going to be fun
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  just like
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  the elites say just let them have their future
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  let them tell you it's fun
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  let them tell you what humans will look like in a thousand years
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  let's go ahead and play part of this viral video
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  what humans will look like in a thousand years
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  oh listen he's non-threatening humans are still evolving
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  so where will evolution take us
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  in a thousand years
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  where will evolution
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  you can debate what type of evolution there is
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  you can debate what really happened on this planet
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  what seeded us here you can go through all those debates
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  but this is telling you what will evolution
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  look like oh it's just evolution
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  no the elite have taken control
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  of our biological development
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  and there are a bunch of child molesting devil
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  worshipers who've been promised by their god
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  if they destroy humanity
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  they'll be allowed to transcend
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  sounds like a science fiction book the alien spirit tells them
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  set this up I'll tell you how to build it
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  you've already got the technology in 8 in your brain
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  to build it
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  I'll direct you to build what I want
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  because I can't build it
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  because all I do is destroy
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  all I do is twist you build it
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  I'll direct exactly what I want
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  and then you kill everybody
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  and then I'll let you blast off the space
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  they actually say that in this video
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  but again oh
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  oh oh
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  it's so cute
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  it's so sweet it's so fun
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  it's a nice little nerdy non-threatening voice
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  oh let's see where the evolution is going right now
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  no discussion that humans build their own environment
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  humans have taken control of their own evolution
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  just forget that big human secret
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  that we're master builders
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  let the globalists be the architects
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  let Lucifer be the grand architect
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  let him direct it all
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  just sit down and let him run things
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  he'll take real good care of you
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  just put these handcuffs on and come down in this dungeon
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  and he'll love on you a little bit
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  the empire's on the run
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  the US meddling in the French election
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  despite Barack Obama and seemingly
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  every major US news network
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  endorsing Macron and labeling Le Pen
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  racist and extremist
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  the fake corporate news continues to push Le Pen
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  as racist as Bernie Sanders has chimed in
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  saying France rejected racism
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  and xenophobia but the cruelest irony
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  of all this is the victory cries
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  of Vive Le France
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  even though it is not refuted that Le Pen
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  was the nationalist candidate
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  they cheer hooray for France
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  as this election will likely mark
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  the end of France and it is a victory
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  for the globalist European Union
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  not France

[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  designed by Luciferian Francois Mitterrand
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  that was in the newspapers
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Francois won't even hide it
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  at the Louvre with a big red eye
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  glowing behind him
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  isn't that amazing
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  and joining us
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  is Jack Pozobiak
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  who does a great job as a journalist online
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  and as a researcher
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  citizensfortrump.com
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  he's been sued
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  and when he first was getting sued last week
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  people were like oh more fake news
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  we actually look at what Jack covers
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  it's also incredibly accurate
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  that's what the fake news calls him the fake news
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  but now they admitted it days later
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  Macron follows a lawsuit over cyber misinformation
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  Paris prosecutors open probe
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  into whether false news is being used to influence
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  voting in the presidential election
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  and that's the word is Germany and France and others
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  are not going to sue Facebook and Google and Twitter
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  they're going to sue yours truly
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  they're going to sue Jack Pozobiak
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  isn't that just darling
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  isn't that just sweet
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  so he joins us to break this down
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  and of course we all heard the Russians
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  and we heard that Pozobiak was a Russian agent
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  remember month or two ago they had congressional hearings
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  and other people working for the Russians
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  that were criminally investigating
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  are Alex Jones
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  he calls it info war
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  that's what the Russians call it too sir
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  information warfare has been around about 80 years that term
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  so nobody bought the website in 1997
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I thought we're an info war
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  against the globalist I'll call an info war
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  and of course now we know that we're pro-gun
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  because the Russians told us to be and we're pro-life
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  because the Russians told us to and we're pro-free market
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  not because it's a better political system
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  or economic system but because the Russians taught us
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  that's right
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  that's right
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  wow I didn't know my granddaddy
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  working on the farm, my other grandfather
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  working for the you know his lease house, the oil companies
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  I didn't know my whole family worked
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  for free market folks because of the Russians
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  I didn't know my family fought
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  communists when they were running Russia
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  I just didn't matter we're all Russian
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  agents now
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  Jack Pozobiak joins us
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  he's a writer, filmmaker, recovering political operative
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  and Jack was special projects director of citizens
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organization
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  originally from Philadelphia
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  Jack has worked for four presidential campaigns
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  as well as numerous candidates for Senate
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Congress and Governor, he's a veteran of the U.S. Navy
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  with multiple deployments overseas
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  and he's fluent in Mandarin Chinese
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  I was going to call him a Chinese
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  agent you know Hillary and the Democrats
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  are really on the communist Chinese payroll
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  but also on the Islamic payroll, look at this
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Hejib becomes symbol of resistance, feminism
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  in the age of Trump
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  so Jack
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  I wonder if they're going to drop their lawsuit
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  now I guess you probably kind of want it to illustrate
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  how they're anti-free speech
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  other folks are getting sued around here
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  but I mean wow what is all this signifying now
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  of course LePen going down in flames
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  we saw Macron come out not to the French
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  national anthem but he came out
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  in front of that giant black pyramid with the red eye
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  to the EU national anthem
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  and that pretty much says it all right there
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  about this is the candidate that the elites brought up
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  the elites got him in there
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  actually worked for the Rothschild Bank
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  he's a direct Rothschild agent
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  and we're now pulling stuff out of the Macron Leaks
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  which the French media of course
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  sold us not to look at
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  that the Macron Bank was actually funding
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  cocktail parties
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  glitzy spots for the Macron campaign
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  not even sure if that's legal
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  but all this money is going directly into him
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  at 39 years old we know that the guy
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  he's not really the one calling the shots there
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  he's just the guy on TV selling it to you
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  we're going to play some of this audio
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  I'll defend Europe
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  Macron snubs French national anthem
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  and walks out to EU song
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  we're going to play some of that here in a moment but
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  why so arrogant
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  I guess just cucking everybody
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  breaking their will throwing it in their face
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  that he's a Rothschild agent
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  and ensuing you
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  because you dare point it all out
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  I mean these people are so
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  and again Francois Mitterrand admittedly helped
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  design the Louvre pyramid
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  he was in the news
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  saying it was a temple delucifer
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  I mean you can't make this up it just gets
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  weirder and weirder to him with a big black
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  pyramid behind him at night
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  with the EU anthem calling for world
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  government I mean how do you make this up
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  that's exactly right Alex and it's a power play
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  you know after losing in Brexit
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  and after losing their candidate
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  in Hillary in 2016 against
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Trump now they're pushing out there
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  they have to show their hand a little bit more
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  but they're trying to remember the rest
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  to the rest of the world to remind them hey
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  we're the masters we're the ones in charge
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  and we're not going to go down without a fight
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  we still have so much power
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  we're still so strong here France
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Germany which has their elections later this year
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  they're not going to let those go because those
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  are the beating hearts of the EU
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  it's crazy absolutely
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  crazy why do you think
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  they're so arrogant just just again rubbing
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  our faces in it
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I think it's because they assume that the
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  people are going to be cowards I think
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  they assume that people are not going to see this
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  stuff to connect the dots and put it together
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  but that even if we do that they that people
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  won't do anything that people won't
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  organize that people won't form their own
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  political institutions that people will simply
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  read about it and then scroll on to the next thing
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  you know you were just talking about how there's
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  so much that goes on in our culture today
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  that's all about that sort of you know
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  surface level instant gratification
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  oh we're just going to go watch the next
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Netflix video we're going to go sit
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  and watch you know what's on TV
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  all day long like zombies rather than actually
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  get involved in the political process
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  and see what's going on to stop these people
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  that are trying to take over our world
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  and by the way I know the media will probably jump on
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  my Luciferian comment he's got a big
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  black pyramid behind him and Francois
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Mineron I was on the air back in the
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  you know mid 90s when he was retiring
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  I think he had cancer was dying he was
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  in the news saying I came up with the idea
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  of the pyramid and got it funded
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  666 pieces of pink glass
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  dedicated to Lucifer
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  I mean I challenged mainstream news
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  before they attacked me for that
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  look that up you cannot
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  make this stuff up and then
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  now we see the polls
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  where she was neck and neck or head
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  or a little bit behind
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  with the national front I guess they're changing
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  the name seeing and having the word nation
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  you know it's being dirty do you think
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  they stole the election from her there was some evidence
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  that went on but I don't see stealing
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  being able to give a landslide like this
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  or was this just the French
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  groveling to political correctness
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  we know the French love to be stylish
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  they love to be in the end crowd
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  yeah I think we have to remember that the
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  France the electorate there is not America
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  they haven't they don't have the history
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  of the American Revolution in 1776
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  and those ideals
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  that are instilled in our Constitution
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  that are actually still taught in some
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  quarters in the United States
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  the French especially after World War II
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  they very much changed their positions
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  they talked about pacifism
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  and now we're actually seeing in these Macron Leagues
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  not only do they want open borders
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  they're going to continue the open borders migration
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  policies but they're also going to start teaching
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  French children that Islam
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  has always been part of France
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  so they're not even going to teach them the history
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  of French actually knocking Islamic invaders
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  out of France and back
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  into Spain down to Morocco
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  they're actually going to teach them that Islam has always
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  been part of France and that we should always
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  be allowing these foreign invaders
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  to come into our lands that's right
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  the Islamic more invaders out of
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  North Africa and out of the Middle East
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  went all the way up to the edge of France
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  they went all the way into the
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  middle of Poland they went all the way
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  into the borders of Germany
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  and that's why Eastern Europe is the only place actually
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  standing up for the Islamic invasion
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  because they you know literally had
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  their great great great great grandparents
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  people slaughtered but notice the Clinton
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  is backed in the mid 90's
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  the attacks on Serbia when the UN
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  and the Muslims out of Albania
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  launched the attacks we gave
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  one third of Serbia to the Muslims
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  so this has been an ongoing theme
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  in the non radical Muslims
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  in Syria in Egypt in Libya
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  they get overthrown radical Muslims
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  no one can deny now that David Horowitz
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  who envisioned this 16 17 years ago
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  has been proven right now it's
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  admitted but looking at
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  2017 Merkel
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  with with Macron bowing
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  down to her in this bizarre photo
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  promising to bring in more Muslims
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  arresting people that criticize Islam
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  indicting Le Pen for criticizing Islam
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  this is insane national
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  suicide and the Muslims
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  just run around murdering and driving over people
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  and shooting and stabbing people
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  why are they doing that when Europe's
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  capitulating to them I mean where do you see all this going
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  and how is the EU's plan
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  to Islamify Europe going
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  it's going without a hitch at this point
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  I mean I suppose Brexit was
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  probably their first stumbling block
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  but now they're pushing back so at least the continent
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  of Europe will continue to be Islamified
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  what they essentially want Alex
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  is that they want these attacks
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  they want this violence they want this
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  going on in the streets and they're going to continue
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  to use that to push for their
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  opposition to push for more invasions
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  of Muslim lands which is going to create more
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  war is going to create more terrorism
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  it's not going to do anything to stop this because
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  it's because they know that as they
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  carry their invader armies across the world
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  it also carries all of their connections
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  to the financial institutions
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  and to multinational corporations that can now
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  get into those countries that they haven't had access
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  to in the past and by the way that's not your opinion
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  that's in the PNAC documents
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  by the Republicans the Democrats have their own documents
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  we've got
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  Leslie Clark who was part of the whole takeover
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  in Serbia admitting that was a plan
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  saying he thought it was bad ten years ago
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  and two different speeches he gave describing
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  the battle plan let's explain third
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  dimensional full spectrum dominance
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  Hegelian dialectic folks that don't understand it
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  you go in you put radical Muslims in
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  you back Saudi Arabia funding it
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  then you let them create their own terrorists
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  that are real terrorists that attack you
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  then you use that to say oh we can't
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  criticize Islam we've got to have sensitivity
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  training you're causing them to attack
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  here let's have the cuckold Stockholm syndrome
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  literally in Stockholm Sweden
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  women began five years ago
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  wearing her jibs in solidarity saying
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  please don't rape me please don't kill me
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  I'll submit to your bullying
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  please don't beat up our newspaper reporters
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  don't beat up our TV reporters like we just saw
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  in Rome last night them beating the woman up
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  the Islamists
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  because she dare go videotape them on the city street
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  this is the whole attitude
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  and so they get to take over
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  put radical Islam in have an excuse
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  some of these countries
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  Islamists are actually about to invade but blame it on
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  some random country like Iraq or Syria
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  then use those attacks to take our liberties
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  here domestically all the time
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  accelerating the Islamification
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  I'm not looking very much
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  closely at Eastern Europe as you mentioned
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  and flop right there what they're doing
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  they've actually especially
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  Poland has refused to take
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  a single Islamic migrant
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and the prime minister of Poland
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  Beate Zidlo she came out specifically
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  and said these migrants are linked with terrorism
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  and we will not accept a single one
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  the EU has pushed back and said
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  you have to accept that
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  thousands and thousands of these migrants
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  per month will find you
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  right are they going to find you they're going to cut off
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  they're going to cut off financial aid they're going to cut off the ability of them to travel
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  so it's very interesting
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  to see how Eastern Europe
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  and slov right is going to respond
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  to this and will we see an unraveling
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  of the EU with the east
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  siding potentially more with Russia
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  slovs in Serbia and
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  in Poland
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  and in Romania and in Hungary
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  and in Russia are the only people
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  will stand up because they were constantly
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  attacked the last 1400 years
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  continually by Muslims they're like are you kidding
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  and then 80% of them show up according
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  to even Interpol and their military aged men
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  on Facebook celebrating what they did
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  in Syria they just got their butts kicked
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  out Syria was the new homeland
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  of the Islamic invasion of the world
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  the spearhead into Turkey that's now shifted
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  to Caliphate oh we're non-radical
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  let me let Europe build highways to us
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  as soon as they got their people in
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  enough Turks in now
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  they've announced we're going to have
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  jihad submit to us
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Merkel says we will submit so the EU
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  is literally merging with Islam
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  opening the gates of Europe
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  having them spill in
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  for a checkmate against the west
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  full spectrum dominance
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  this is absolutely on record now it's
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  incredible and again
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  you're so calmly taking it
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  that I noticed that the psychological warfare
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  here first you say I've been sued
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  by France by the now president
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  of France when he was a candidate
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  they go oh shut up the Soviet
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  you know oh sure right
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  because they always do that then they come out and go
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  okay fine you have been sued you deserve to be shut down
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  so now here you
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  are being sued by the president of France
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  to me this shows how weak they are
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  they're the traders they're selling everybody
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  out they're the scum of the earth
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  they're standing in front of giant black pyramids
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  saying submit to them
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  so this is such a badge of honor
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  I'm so envious that you've been sued by the president
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  I've only been sued by George Soros's people
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  you'll get there one day Alex don't worry
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  so where does this how did you learn about the suit
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  and where is all this going
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  well we heard about it
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  when it was released
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  to the media by
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  French authorities as well as
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Macron we heard about it from our legal side
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  and the rebel media's legal team
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  is going to be pushing back against this and is absolutely
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  saying that you know we're
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  completely defended by the first amendment here
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  and there isn't anything we've done we're not hackers
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  we're not Russian agents
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  you're journalists and you're
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  journalists and you're absolutely kicking butt so they hate you
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  right
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  it's funny because the French
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  the French in the fourth
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  state back in the days of the French Revolution
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  you know when I was in journalism school
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  we studied that as something to be revered
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  it was journalism French journalism
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  hundreds of years ago that spoke truth
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  to power and I thought that that was the point
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  of real journalism well it turns out that now
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  the French journalists are the ones that are
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  in power and they're using that power
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  to strike down anyone who speaks truth
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  and notice how they turn this around they meet
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  with China the last few years Zuckerberg meets with
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  them Google meets with them Twitter meets
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  with them China says censor America
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  and Europe better and we'll let you in
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  but prove you can do it and here we're going to advise you
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  that Microsoft comes out with new operating
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  systems to help China censor
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  and they go you've been good we'll let you
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  in good you know good doggy
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  and so now all this
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  is happening and so
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  the French government the EU government comes out
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  the German government fires
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  former Stasi
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  to help start
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  tagging people to be arrested to
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  criticize Islam and then
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  the government of France comes after you
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  for telling the truth but oh it's because
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  you're fake news even though what you said
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  is true they don't dispute that and then
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  they're the good guys the little
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  old government coming after you the
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  giant evil dirty horrible Russian
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  back journalist when none of it's even
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  true I mean people this is outrageous
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  that they're trying to get away with this
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Jack you're absolutely right
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  and you know it reminds me
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  of talking about the French Revolution
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Robespierre back in the day Robespierre
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  the reign of terror in France it seems that
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Robespierre probably would have voted for
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Macron Robespierre would have been one of those
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  people who was in league with these
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  elites and then now the elites
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  instead of it just being the elite of France or the elite
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  of Europe it's spread to places like
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  China places like
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  places like parts of Africa and the Middle
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  East where they're getting their their toe hold
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  in and they're going to expanding it further and
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  further because they have the power of the internet as well
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  but what they didn't realize is the double
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  edge sort of it and so that outlets like
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  info wars and like rebel media can actually
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  get this truth out to the people and
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  that we can build our own platforms to get this truth
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  out beyond what they control that's right
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  and the rebel media citizens for trim.com
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  we are the true rebels we are the true
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  counterculture we're trying to bring back
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  what works freedom open societies
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  sovereignty religious freedom

[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  on to their own audiences to their own people

[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Jack Posobiak is our guest
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  I intro this whole piece
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  earlier talking about how the Louvre
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  was commissioned
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  and the basic design done by Francois Mitterrand
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  who was in the newspapers at the time
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  saying I love Lucifer I'm a Luciferian
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  we built this because
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I believe in Lucifer 666
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  and the crew
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  googled it and sure enough
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  found from the Encyclopedia Obscura
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  the Louvre pyramid
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  and you can read where
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  completed in 89 the largest of the structures
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  commonly referred to as the Louvre pyramid
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  now serves as the main entrance to the museum
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  and is one of the city's more notable landmarks
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  the structures Chinese American architect
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  claimed that the design was inspired by
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  a trellis he had seen at the adjunct
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  and that the Louvre pyramid
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  was in nowhere related to the monuments of Egypt
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  the Louvre pyramid raised controversy
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  in the 80s following the publication
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  of an official brochure
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  twice in the pages of the brochure
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  it was claimed that the structure was
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  formed of 666 individual
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  panes of glass the figure
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  was subsequently quoted on numerous newspapers
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  and became a widespread and then it goes on though
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  to have Francois Mitterrand saying
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  that indeed it is dedicated to the beast
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  revelations aside the notions that
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  the Louvre pyramid 666 panes is in fact
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  false it tries to claim an official statement
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  by the Louvre museum now where was the part
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  you showed me though where Francois Mitterrand said that himself
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  because I remember seeing his quotes he was asked
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  about it at the time let's scroll back down to the bottom
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  there it is they went on to
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  say that the pyramid is dedicated to a power
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  described in the book and the beast
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  in the book of Revelation entire structure
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  is based on the number six the point is
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  is that you can't get past all this craziness
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  now briefly getting back to
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  our guest Jack Misobiak
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  again get into when you learn you're being
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  sued and what you're planning to do and
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  what you think this bodes for journalists
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  absolutely Alex and
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  and actually just kind of hit on your piece there
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  there's a line in Ephesians where it says
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  it the war is not about
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  flesh and blood the war is about
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  is against the world rulers
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  of darkness and the spiritual
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  holes of wickedness and heavenly places and it's
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  it's right there it's biblical all of this
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  and so you know these lawsuits
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  with the French president now coming against me
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  it's very it's a headline for them
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  and we're going to push back with the full
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  force of our legal team here in the United States
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  and back in Canada with with behind
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  the first amendment so
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  the first amendment can protect journalists here in
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  the United States under the Trump administration
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  with AG sessions that I can't imagine
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  that is going to be able to protect anybody
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  they're going to try to find loopholes and they can't
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  get to us legally they're going to try to get to
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  us through the internet they're going to try to
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  de-platform us they're going to try to de-platform
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  our ISPs and that's why you saw in the
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  the final hours of the Barack Obama
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  administration him turning over
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  the power of internet providers to the
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  EU to the United Nations
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  wanting the world power to be able to come
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  in and take down even a website at dot com
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  and now they're doing it and now they're
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  doing it and he set up this office of the State Department
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  to do it as well and they're
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  moving forward just saying oh you're all Russian
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  agents with no proof and ever call us
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  to Congress nothing they just

[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  they don't want you to see find out why I
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  think that's the answer is people should celebrate
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  the fact that we're under so much attack and
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  realize the enemy is attacking what
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  they're afraid of yeah well

[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  they were about this massive leak
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  about the offshore island accounts that

[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  the new france president why is he suing
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  jack possobiac who reported on
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  the whistleblowers the leaks
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  the infos and just recap where folks
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  instead of mainstream media distortion on this
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  what's really happened
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  what's unfolding why they're suing you
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  why they're so upset and what we're learning about
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  reportedly the gay porn
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  the gay escorts the drugs and what's going on here
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  why this guy is such a little
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  darling of the establishment the youngest
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  france president ever
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  sure alex and so we saw
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  the macron gate last week
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  where it was revealed that he has these offshore bank
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  accounts in the cayman islands tax
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  evasion billions of dollars it was also then
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  revealed in these emails
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  that number one the macron campaign
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  was funding antifa was
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  behind the antifa riots in paris where
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  they were setting police officers on fire on
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  May 1st we're finding activities
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  where they've been they've been selling and
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  buying designer drugs
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  that they're saying they're for the boss this
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  this drug called mmc3
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  a sophisticated drug he's also
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  on the list essentially
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  of this this homosexual
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  cult sort of mailing
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  list that he's on so with the drugs
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  all that stuff and let's keep in mind
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  that macron himself is a victim of pedophilia
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  so we know from a very early age he
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  was involved in pedophilia himself
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  the victim of his own wife
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  his former high school teacher which was
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  then what vaulted him into the ross
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  child agency where the ross filed
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  bank was actually funding his
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  own campaign actual campaign
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  events these glitzy cocktail parties designer
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  drugs everywhere and me reporting
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  on all of this which has been verified as
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  themselves from themselves and wiki leaks to be true
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  has led them not in turn to say come
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  clean and say okay yes we did this but
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  no they're suing me in saying that the leaks are
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  false even though they're suing me for saying I
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  hacked their emails so I'm not sure which one it is
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  that's right they're saying you hacked their emails
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  or the Russians didn't gave it to you
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  but it's not accurate they're not saying it's
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  all fake they're saying it's not accurate
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  right and so they're trying to play this
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  this tightrope dance of saying well
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  the some of them aren't accurate but
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  some of them are accurate but you also
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  hacked this but you but you're they're also
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  fake and but of course nobody should
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  look at them and the media in France
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  just the same way the media in the United States during wiki
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  leaks said this they said if you
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  tweet or post or share anything
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  about the Macron leaks the French government
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  is going to come after you and they're going to come
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  and try to stop you and I think that right
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  there tells you just how scared they are of
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  what's in these documents well you're saying
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  there's thousands more
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  there's tens of thousands we literally
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  haven't had enough time possibly for our
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  researchers at rebel media or the people on
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  4chan to go through these things to translate
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  them and to make all the connections to find
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  what's out there they were using bitcoin to buy
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  designer drugs on the black market out in France
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  I mean it's it's crazy
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  now the story is
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  it's admitted with him and his older wife
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  that there's a lot of weird stuff going on
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  and that and that and that she did know
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  him back when she was married and all this
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  what's going on there
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  that's right so she was a high he was her
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  high school student
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  when he was 14 and 15
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  and then later and but it was stated that
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  that was in the relationship started but that
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  no sexual acts began until
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  he was of legal age in France which I believe
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  was 18
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  so that right there tells me something
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  very very fishy is going on
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  she has children that are older than him as a
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  matter of fact and it may be a way
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  that they found this guy very very young
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  and they were using that to essentially
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  you know turn him into a puppet turn him into
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  a marionette and now they're plying him with drugs
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  keeping him drugged up and getting him to do
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  whatever they want so yeah you've got the
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  article here got news or they're showing you
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  this stuff the way that they're controlling him
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  the same kind of of mind control they use for
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  the most part of the conversation that we see around
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  the world
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  now what is this designer drug
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  so this this MMC
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  three it's essentially a combination
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  of ecstasy
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  and crystal meth
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  but they made it in such a way that it's
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  synthetic that it actually gets around
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  most
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  government security screenings and gets around
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  most where you're trying to import it you can
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  synthesize it rather than have it have it to be
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  grown or make it in a laboratory so it's
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  illegal but there's easier ways for them to get
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  it in the EU and that's one of the things
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  that the elites are absolutely doing
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  well I tell you
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  it just never ends jack sobie
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  at citizensfortrump.com
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  thank you so much for joining us a great job
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  we'll follow this lawsuit
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  I bet they drop it quick now that he won
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  because they do not want you been able to

[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  things that mitigate or avoid
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  most toxic effects to themselves
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  the general public doesn't

[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  of a prelude

[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  Brazil
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  that's right the same one getting all the answers
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  for the debate and the questions
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  from CNN

[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  2016 what's happening with Donald
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Trump we'll then look at the proceeds
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  president and many of the victories he's
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  had but the media again openly
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  now admitting they're preparing in congress
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  a bipartisan move under the 25th
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  amendment to declare him insane
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  if he's insane we need more of it
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  but I guess in a kingdom of crazy people
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  the one sane person would be seen
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  as insane be teleported back to the Aztecs
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  when they were human sacrificing a thousand years ago
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  and said stop it they'd say you're crazy
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  or be teleported back to 1945
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  and Hitler's telling a bunch of people you'd say don't do
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  that he'd say you're crazy
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  so I guess we are crazy Roger Stone

[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  joins us in this huge firestorm

[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  they say for hacking his emails
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  but it's all fake
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  they say but it's real
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  so it's really thickening here in the plot
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  so joining us again is Roger Stone
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  with more bombshell exclusive
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  Roger thank you for giving us the exclusive today
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  first of all Alex
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  I want to join you in saluting my friend
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  Jack Posobiak
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  we call him jumping jack flash
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  in the movement he is
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  typical of the young
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  investigative journalists hungry for the truth
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  and just won't accept
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  the you know the pablum being
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  sped up by the mainstream media
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  Alex it is really
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  shocking because I was among those
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  who was a supporter
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  of Rex Tillerson at least
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  conceptually on paper I like
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  the idea of a
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  an outsider someone who wasn't
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  part of the foggy bottom culture
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  of the US State Department
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  the fact that
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  that Tillerson
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  has been heavily influenced
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  and mentored
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  really his patron
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  my learn is Condoleezza Rice
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  that is an extraordinary
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  development
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  evidently as Steve Bannon was
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  aware of this at the time
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  that Tillerson's name was put forward
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  but because they were so
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  desperate to have someone to stop
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  Mitt Romney Tillerson got
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  this job
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  I can tell you that the logs
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  downstairs at the State Department
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  show that whenever Tillerson is out of the
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  country which is for the
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  theory of state most of the time
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  well in those instances
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Condoleezza Rice is actually holding
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  meetings inside the State
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  Department with various
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  department heads
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  we also know
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  that she was instrumental
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  in the placement of a fellow named
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  Brian Hook
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  now Brian Hook is essentially
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  the key spokesperson
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  the first person Rex Tillerson
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  sees in the morning
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  the first person he sees at night
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  at State Department
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  and Mr. Hook is a hardcore never
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  Trumper
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  he was a co-signer of a letter
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  from the John Hay Initiative
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  trashing Donald Trump
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  this is a neo-conservative group
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  that
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  over 100 so-called Republican
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  foreign policy experts
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  co-side
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  attacking Trump's foreign policy
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  bona fides and capability
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  Mr. Hook
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  is now in the State Department
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  this boggles the mind
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  I am told that Mr.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Hook was pushed for this job
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  by Condoleezza Rice
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  largely because
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  she seeks to block
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  Mr. Hook she seeks to block
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  the appointment
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  of a
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  true patriot as
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  NATO Ambassador
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  Rick Grinnell
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  currently Rice
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  sees Grinnell as a future
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  Secretary of State
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  which she of course sees herself as
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  she wants a reprise
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  in Washington
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  this is very bad news
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  for the
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  interventionist
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  wing that elected Donald Trump
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  now the real problem
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  at the State Department Alex is that
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  Rice Priebus
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  the President's Chief of Staff
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  to tell the various
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  department heads let's start at State
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  this is going to be your Assistant Secretary
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  for this this gentleman is going to be
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  your Assistant Secretary that
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  this woman is going to be your General Counsel and so on
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  the Cabinet Officers
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  have this quaint idea that they are allowed
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  to choose their own people without White House
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  vetting and that is where you get
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  this this landing
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  party of neo-cons
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  we can show you
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  from the Washington Post by
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  scrolling on the State Department
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  positions I think we can
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  pull that up and I will
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  show you what you have here is a
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  stalemate meaning
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Priebus refuses to put
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  forward names the names
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  put forward let's just roll up
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  here to the state a little bit and you will see
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  what I mean the State Department
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  puts forward names that are
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  not politically suitable
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  i.e. anti-Trumpers
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  there we have 119
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  positions in State
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  let's go through the list here just
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  below that you will see
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  Legal Advisor no nominee
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Chief Financial Officer no nominee
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  Under Secretary for Management
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  no nominee Under Secretary for
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Arms Control no nominee
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  no nominee and so on
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  and so on and so forth
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  because the State
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Department puts forward
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  neo-cons and globalists unacceptable
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  to the White House
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  and let me just add this because
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  we're 110 days in
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  and admittedly it's come out
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  the State Department is in total rebellion
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  against Rex Tillerson and
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  other agencies are doing the same thing
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  they just totally ignore him nobody good comes forward
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  or they're all anti-Trumpers
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  and then they use the National Security
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Clearance stuff to have the FBI block
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  anybody that is good and so we're
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  wondering how this is happening
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  is Rex Tillerson a total
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  nincompoop or is he controlled
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  in that he's got Condi in there
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  knowingly sabotaging everything
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  or is he just doing this
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  you know try to be trendy
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  or try to be nice to the old bushes
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  you know is he a naive
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  nair-do-well because you look at this
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  we're 110 days in
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  and basically none of the top positions
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  that's kind of good it's showing at least
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  it's being blocked by somebody knows what's going on
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  but it's also bad because nothing's happened
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  in a sense let me be clear
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  the reason you have a large M
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  is the White House must make the nominations
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  not the departments they don't make
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  the nominations so the departments
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  are sending over their candidates
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  the White House are blocking them
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  no one is nominated stalemate
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  empty and the problem with that Alex
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  is the Obama
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  mice are in those positions
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  they continue to run the government
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  in all those so that's why it's not a stalemate
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  that's why them only giving them
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  never Trumpers keeps the Obama people in
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  and whose fault is this
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  let me explain this
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  this is the fault of rights previous
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  do you think
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  Hamilton Jordan or HR
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  Bob Haldeman or Andy
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Card or James A Baker the third
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  would have not gone
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  to the department head and said
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  this is the person you're nominating for this job
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  this is the person you're nominating for this job
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  this is the person we're nominating for this job
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  there is no sign off
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  it has never worked that way but someone
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  gave Rex the idea
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  that he could choose his own people
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  and let me point out to you the first one he wanted
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  was
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Neocon
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  a Neocon bad guy
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  Darth Vader for God's sakes
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  why don't we just get Richard Perle himself in here
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  this is an
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  absurdity I blame
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  rights for the
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  law jam
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  by the way this is throughout the government
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  we're just using state today as an example
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  so we're now documenting how Trump's been
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  sabotaged from within
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  and while we think it's just a stalemate it's not
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  the Obama people are in their beavering away as usual
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  running state department
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  with congressional hearings saying we're Russian agents
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  with no proof saying shut down the free press
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:59.000]  as they direct Google in a
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  jihad against the American resistance
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  not only that but
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  the idea
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  that we would have a
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  never Trump blocking a Trump
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  loyalist like Rick Grinnell
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  who's highly qualified
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  for that NATO post and who did more
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  surrogate speaking and traveling on behalf of the
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  Trump Pence ticket than
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  virtually any Republican I know
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  it's an intro
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  so all the real Americana
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  freedom caucus type patriots
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  none of them had actually got Trump elected
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  or even allowed anywhere near
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  the reins of power because they'd actually do what
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  they said they do
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  and we have
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  taken some Trump
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  transition documents that we have obtained
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  and determined a list of exactly
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  who Condoleezza Rice has recommended
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  for various positions
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  and now we are tracing where they are in the White House
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  personnel
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  process well when can we get Dr. Corsi to publish
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  this you know he'd be a great guy to do that
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  he would be an ideal
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  person for that story and I will consult
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  with him almost immediately
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  the other thing I wanted to touch on
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  is the growing role of Dr. Henry Kissinger
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  now the last
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  time I saw Dr. Kissinger was
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  when Arthur Schwartz and
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  Dr. Kissinger and I
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  dined at Cipriani in New York
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  he is amazing energy for a man
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  in his 90s
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  and I can report that
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  Kissinger recently carried a personal
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  message to the Chinese
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  from the President
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  this was after the
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  Chinese trip to Mar-Lago
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  I cannot tell you the contents
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  of that message I can only tell
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  you that this back channel
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  diplomacy is working
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  and we probably have a former relationship
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  between the two
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  heads of government the Chinese in America
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  than any time during the Obama
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  administration
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  alright so Trump is really pulling off some big coos
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  stay there Roger Stone let's come back

[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  resistance movement
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  in the media and so that's why we're under the most
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  attack. We've got great
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  non-GMO toothpaste

[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  so a new edition is going to be out
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  conservatism is the new counterculture
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  that's there, we're about to sell out of X2
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  it's going to be about 2 weeks till more comes in
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  and we may not have more at that point
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  because we're trying to get another source
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  of the deep earth crystals
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  these are amazing products

[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Roger Stone
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  for some this is probably dry-sounding news
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  okay they're blocking Trump
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  tell us something we don't know
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  it's outrageous, it's unprecedented
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  I've never heard of something like this
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  in modern times in government
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  and it shows that Trump's trying to block the bad guys
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  but again does he get the tactic
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  that then Obama's people
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  probably even worse end up staying in power
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  don't they get what's happening here
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  what does Trump need to do
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  well it is outrageous to me Alex
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  that this fellow like Brian Hook
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  an assistant secretary
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  for international organizations
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  and the Bush State Department
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  was a senior
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  foreign policy advisor to Mitt Romney
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  why is this man in
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  the Trump State Department
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  this is an outrage
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  and we will see
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  more of it if the logjam is not broken
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  the president
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  needs an aggressive strategy
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  to fill the second and third levels
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  of government the deputy secretaries
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  assistant secretaries
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  the counselors
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  the deputy councils and so on
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  we are way behind other presidents
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  in this regard now if
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  the president had appointed a chief of staff
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  like
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Ed Martin or
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  David Urban and any number of capable people
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  they would have had
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  a plan in place to select
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  vet and jam through their appointees
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  instead you have chaos
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  no one's told the secretaries
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  they don't make these choices
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  the White House won't assert itself
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  on the secretaries who must make
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  the choices it's organized
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  chaos and the beneficiary
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  is Barack Obama
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  and the leaks come out
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  of our intelligence services
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  happen because we have not replaced
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  the leakers
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  this is a giant problem
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  the president must confront
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  now some should argue the president's trying
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  to hire his opposition but they're only stabbing him
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  in the back that much more because they have to
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  kill the image of a nationalistic
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  leader they have to kill that image so other
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  countries don't follow suit does it trump
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  know that even if he tries to sell out
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  which I'm not saying he's doing they're going to destroy
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  him one way or the other the only way he wins
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  is defeating these people
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  I understand the cosmetics
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  of having some people in your administration
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  who worked for you in the election
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  Richard Nixon had Daniel Patrick
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  Moynihan a noted liberal
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  he read Moynihan's memos
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  then he read Pat Buchanan's memos
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  eviscerating Moynihan's
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  memos
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  I understand that symbol
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  that kind of symbolism
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  there should be a democrat
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  in this cabinet
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  former congressman Harold Ford Jr
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  very respected
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  on transportation issues
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  was more than willing to be in this
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  cabinet was passed over
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  for Mitch McConnell's wife
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  who was the longest serving
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  member of the Bush cabinet
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  Elaine Shaw
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  you tell me
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  absolutely
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  well about a minute and a half left here
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  Roger what else can we as listeners do
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  the president needs a hatchet man
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Alex he needs somebody
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  who understands who elected him
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  who opposed him
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  who our constituency out in the country
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  is that we have to keep intact and goes
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  through these departments and begins
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  firing people but sadly
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  most of the firings will have to stop
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  ultimately at the White House
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  you know the White House senior
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  staff level I can't find any
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  trumpites there I just can't
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  find them and whatever Steve
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Bannon is doing he was
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  not blocking Rex Tillerson
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  why does it why does it trump bring in
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  a Rand Paul and somebody like
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  a Pat Buchanan to just
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  give him the basic ropes Pat Buchanan
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  should be in that White House three or four days a week
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  just advising the president
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  well it's kind of ironic you say that
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Pat did that for Nixon then he came back
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  and did it for Reagan
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  and the president and Pat now
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  I'll just fight some old history get along
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  quite well
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  on the other hand
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  I don't think and I like Rand Paul
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  and I like a lot of what he's doing
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  the personality styles of the
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  two men will never never
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  mesh but
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  this can be done at the staff level
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  there are many people from
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  the campaign who are highly
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  capable
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  please work with Dr. Corsi or if you write an article
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  I want to put this out this is big news
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  it solves a lot of mysteries you got the exclusive documents
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  of what's happening inside the White House
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  that is so big thank you Roger Stone we'll talk to you soon
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  great to be here many thanks
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  you bet my friend alright ladies and gentlemen we'll be back
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  with Leanne McAdoo the whole transhumanist
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  movement telling you what your future is going to be
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  is if you don't have free will and a lot more
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  we're on the march the empires
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  on the run
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  and the French election despite Barack Obama
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  and seemingly every major US
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  news network endorsing Macron
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  and labeling Le Pen racist and extremist
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  the fake corporate news continues
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  to push Le Pen as racist as Bernie Sanders
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  has chimed in saying France rejected
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  racism and xenophobia but the
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  cruelest irony of all this is the
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  victory cries of Vive Le Frans
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  even though it is not refuted that
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  Le Pen was the nationalist
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  candidate they cheered her way for France
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  long live France as this election
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  will likely mark the end of France
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  and it is a victory for the globalist
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  European Union not France
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  for info wars.com this is Owen Schreuer

[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  like I'm having noticeable
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  difference I don't feel good
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  the nascent iodine is one of the ones that
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  was life changing for me
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  yeah I've actually have just run out of my
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  super female I had a few
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  bottles at my house and I've been taking it
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  again hitting the gym once again
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  very exciting feeling great
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  looking good so and I know my
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  hair is luxurious
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  once again so obviously the super
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  female is amazing I love it
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  nascent iodine is essential
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  survival shield x2 if there's one product
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  that I would say is life changing that I
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  would suggest it's nascent iodine
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  survival shield x2 it's got a 5 star
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  rating it's a win-win
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  infowarslife.com
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  There are a lot of great people
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  in the world that are
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  the new world
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  that are the new world
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  that are the new world
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  that are our superior ancestors
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  that are our superior ancestors and we need to do
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  everything we can to recapture them
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  everyone knew that you used all the parts
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  of the animal you use the meat for
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  sesadence the fat for cooking that you use
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  the bones for strength
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  for the outside structure full of
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  minerals and key cofactors to the marrow
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:59.120]  And this is a big part of it. I know you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and force live talk comedy
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:19.160]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:27.200]  The whole transhumanist movement the whole gender neutral movement is about saying you can't be man can't be woman
[2:33:27.200 --> 2:33:32.920]  That's the old-fashioned bad thing that hurts everybody's feelings on the cover of newsweek time magazine National Geographic
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:37.360]  There just can't be anybody that's quote normal because normals hateful
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:45.360]  So we've gone from being tolerant to you're not gonna be tolerated and then oh we're merging with machine body augmentation the CIA and others admit
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:51.080]  The plan to push this leon macadoo is here to discuss this with us and of course you wanted to come on today about this
[2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:55.280]  I separately saw mark dice video on info wars.com where he was showing the MTV
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:00.740]  Gender neutral awards. They don't call you mayoral or female now like best actress or best actor
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:06.520]  Targets getting rid of areas for boys and girls. It's one area. I mean this is massive engineering. Oh, yes
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:09.800]  So we'll talk to leon macadoo about that here in just a moment
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:14.980]  We don't have George Soros funding. We don't get government stimulus money like MSNBC
[2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:17.600]  We don't get funded by the multinationals
[2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:23.960]  We get funded by you buying great products and info or store.com the best water filtration systems gravity-fed
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:27.120]  Wide selections the great patriot apparel
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:32.120]  To then be able to meet like-minded people and also promote freedom out there when you're you know out and about the town
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:38.320]  Great supplements that the enemy demonizes all over the news. Oh my gosh, Alex Jones sells snake oil
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:44.200]  Then they cut the commercial and it's a serotonin reuptake inhibitor prozac ad that literally gives you brain
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:49.360]  You know embolisms and death, you know, all the rest is garbage as if bio PQQ is quack
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:55.120]  That's a hundred plus studies behind bio PQQ one of the ingredients in DNA force. By the way, it's about to sell out
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:34:59.880]  DNA force. I mean bio PQQ has been proven for nerve growth refactor
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:05.920]  Detoxifying the mitochondria in your cells. This is a drug in Japan. We have to buy it from the Japanese
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:07.920]  That's just one of the ingredients in it
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:15.040]  X to the good halogen look what it's done for so many people a super male vitality super female vitality read the rape reviews folks
[2:35:15.480 --> 2:35:20.440]  This is snake oil thinking about coming out with a multi-vitamin called snake bite or snake oil or something
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:26.600]  Well, it's just got everything in it, you know, the old days heroin was what the snake well was exactly drink heroin and no more pain
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:33.360]  Cocaine derivative or cocaine or heroin. Yeah, that's not what we're selling here. So that's the old this is just known
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:37.040]  I'm a big farmer selling. Let me just ask you land. What's super female do for you?
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.320]  Turn me into a goddess like overnight
[2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:44.480]  Yeah, it really it took a few days for it to kind of really
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:50.840]  Acclimate in my body and my cells, but yes, I just was like walking down the grocery store. I'll like wow
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:57.080]  And by the way, I didn't ever ask you to say that you're like man, this stuff really works. It really does
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:01.080]  It's concentrated. It's it's known herbs concentrated like an oil form
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:04.640]  It's it's available at info or short on that's how we fund this operation
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:11.420]  And we have the fluoride-free toothpaste is back in super blue with the colloidal silver is what turns a grayish blue real real
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:13.680]  Iodine's blue not red folks
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:17.360]  And then of course is the blue purple crystal and then of course has a colloidal silver in it
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:20.240]  That is back 33% off and so much more
[2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:26.680]  Info war store calm in four's life calm or triple a two five three three one three nine now
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:34.520]  Leon Macaduce here earlier in the broadcast. I began to get into this, but I want to talk about transhumanism
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:38.160]  Mm-hmm where they're saying oh your future is this oh evolution
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:42.760]  You're going to evolve, but it's the big corporations that are deciding how we're going to evolve
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:45.760]  We see that famous photo of Zuckerberg with all of his minions with
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:52.280]  Virtual reality goggles on sitting like you know hunchbacks while he walks bipedally in the real universe
[2:36:52.280 --> 2:36:59.320]  They're living in his world that he programmed. That's the holy grail. What humans will look like in a thousand years. We're reviewing
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:06.480]  Hey, this piece put out by inside tech put out by tech insider and again, it's like it's all fun
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:11.500]  It's all great. You'll be putting a big mainframe, right? It will control you it will know your future
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:15.240]  Now this sounds like being in hell doesn't it well Alex? There's a story out
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:21.200]  I think it's on Bloomberg, but it's definitely up on the drudge report where they're already saying what's the world gonna look like without jobs?
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:25.600]  Because we know this is going to happen very quickly. There's the automated takeover
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:31.600]  We will have hundreds of millions of people out of work and so they're saying that's in phase one, right?
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:33.280]  So they're saying well, what's that going to look like?
[2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:36.440]  Well, most people are going to be involved in virtual reality
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:42.920]  Most people are going to play video games all day and that's going to make their life in the VR world will be much more
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:45.840]  Exciting than the real world for them because they're you know
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  They're not going to have any meaning to their life and then they're this
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:52.680]  It's the Guardian they go on to talk about how well people are already
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:59.760]  You know for thousands of years have been playing in a virtual reality world with religion and basically saying religion like Islam and Christianity
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:05.520]  You're you're getting these imaginary points and you have these imaginary things that you have to do in order to
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:08.040]  Get to the next level which is heaven
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:12.000]  You know, so they're already kind of selling it as you know, you're already there
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:16.120]  So what's the matter if you just strap on a headset and live in a world of make-believe?
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:24.320]  Let's expand on that. It's their false world. They're creating so that's why they come out and say right realities already just a matrix
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:28.480]  We know there is some creature running it, but we're building new ones. We're going to be the new gods
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:31.240]  That's the heads of major banks. You name it or saying it
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:37.040]  So they've gone from denying all this to coming out and they're saying exactly what I and others decades ago told you
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:41.320]  They were trying to build because back then it was in their MIT white papers now. They're
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:45.520]  Using our mass movement to do it. So they're creating a real world
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:47.920]  That's ugly and where you don't have opportunities
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:54.720]  But then saying in the gulag archipelago of the gulag casino model a term coined by Max Kaiser
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:57.220]  We should get back on about this. He said that a decade ago
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:05.440]  You will then have to work in their VR and serve in their reality and become conditioned in this false reality simulator
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:09.600]  Right to where you accept this and this is how you get credits
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:14.040]  By diverting yourself and that's why the why the future doesn't need us written 17 years ago
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:18.800]  Bill Joyce said I went to this top globalist meeting and he said we decided just to kill everybody
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:23.320]  But we're going to divert them with games and let them have fun so that they lose their humanity
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:26.120]  So by the time we finally go ahead and buy a bio weapon them
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:30.840]  They would have already given up their humanity the articles why the future doesn't need us a wired magazine
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:33.440]  Again put out in 1999
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:40.720]  So you might want to go read that for yourself. This is what they're really building and I've been warning and warning and warning and warning
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:44.120]  And now they're officially going with the dystopic model
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:46.120]  Lee and Macadam. Well, yeah
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  And it's it's in is very much like them the movie the matrix where we're all just kind of plugged in and they're harnessing our energy
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:55.720]  Because it's not as if we're just going to be plugged into these virtual reality
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:01.440]  Machines and they just leave us. I mean we still have to be fed and bathed and things like that
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:06.560]  So what's going to happen? And eventually are we all going to be plugged into, you know
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:11.320]  One mainframe where they can just pull the plug and they say that in this piece again like oh, it's fun
[2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:17.480]  Non-threatening little nerd voice. It's really cool. This is the future. It's normal evolution. They don't say we've taken control of it
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:22.440]  We're getting rid of you and again all the metrics show the vaccines all of it
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:26.240]  Lowering our brain cells lowering our IQ people look like zombies
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:31.360]  Now in general public and I don't feel powerful if they all look like hell and then they all look like they're dead
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:38.480]  They're waddling around it scares me for my children in humanity to see the very essence being sucked out of people
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.960]  But you go to some fishing village in the middle of nowhere the kids are totally poor their eyes are totally alive
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:43.600]  They're awake
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:49.200]  But then in Brazil in places a few years after modern technology comes in farming and GMO
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:52.960]  Suddenly that their cancer rates way up. This is killing us by design
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:57.720]  It's being done by design and the globalists admit they're doing it. So let's critique. Well, Alex
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:05.040]  Just think about too. We hear all these stories every year many many stories of people in Asia who are like addicted to these
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:10.480]  Game game cafes where they just go and they play games all day until they die
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:14.080]  They play games so they die or or girls will go in there
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.560]  They'll give birth and drop the baby in the toilet and go right back to playing those games
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:22.000]  I mean that is how addictive they are and then imagine if they want to create a
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:27.680]  A communist gulag here in this country as well a total psychic attack. It's a total
[2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:31.360]  It's a total scientific attack
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:34.400]  It really is and that's the thing is our brains
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:41.640]  We basically are you know these super computers where we can download this information and then we're able to create it manifest it
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:48.280]  We're manifesting machines and they know that so they want to control the images so that they can manipulate us to build the thing
[2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:52.560]  They want absolutely and again, I don't say that you read top-levels writings
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:56.240]  They believe intergalactic beings across some space time continuum
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:42:01.760]  It's not even so much for another dimension, but using interdimensional communication and our brain is like the fifth sixth dimension
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:03.920]  That's a mathematically proven to communicate with us
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:07.680]  So our brains are so sophisticated that they actually lock into another dimension
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:12.120]  Especially when we're sleeping and then they're just programming us with what they want us to build
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:15.280]  Which is basically they believe like some type of intergalactic
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:19.080]  Galactic gate for them to actually get in now. I'm not saying this
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:24.920]  This is what Bill Joy and Ray Kurzweil and the globalist and the UN and all of them believe
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:33.280]  Mm-hmm, and you read their writings and then they're actually doing it and creating all these new genetic splice creatures that are alien parts human part animal
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:39.320]  Saying they're gonna be gods saying the singularity will happen. It's not in a thousand years. They believe by 2045
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:43.920]  This is here. They're already putting brain chips in troops so that the quote. They're not depressed
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:49.400]  They're already erasing memories in troops. They already had robot, you know cats in 1962
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:53.040]  CIA imagine where we are now exactly
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:58.400]  Well, I mean something you were talking about during the marathon broadcast the other day
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:04.000]  Just kind of made me think and I know people are already kind of talking about this type of stuff on the internet
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:09.920]  But even just getting us ready for a gender neutral society and a society where anyone can be whatever they want
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:16.800]  They can be a fluffy kitten person and that's how they identify. They're basically preparing us for that Star Trek reality
[2:43:16.800 --> 2:43:22.640]  Or or even Star Wars where there are all of these other kind of beings out there and it's just normal
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:23.880]  It's just completely normal
[2:43:23.880 --> 2:43:27.600]  There's anything in the false reality that they're creating that then you see that are worse
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:33.480]  So you don't even know what's going on in front of your face anymore real right? It's it's all make and that's why there's this new
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:37.840]  You were gonna give that if we play this clip. They have the of the gender neutral MTV awards
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:44.880]  So, I mean, it's just mind-blowing that we've got to this point where again gender even existing is bad
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:52.200]  They have to get rid of all human identity all human culture. Don't go to a Chico de Mayo thing if you're not Mexican
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:57.640]  Or even cultural appropriation. It's Indian culture. Mm-hmm. And then it's the big enemy
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:00.160]  Let's go ahead and start going to this piece here
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:04.480]  This is about five and a half million views in just two days. What humans will look like a thousand years
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:09.840]  Let's play this let's put it split screen and then we'll sit here and analyze this under fair use
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:16.720]  This is put out by tech insider how wonderful and how great this is just give up your evolution let other people direct it
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:20.400]  Here it is. What humans will look like in a thousand years. They're telling us
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.520]  Humans are still evolving. So where will evolution take us in a thousand?
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:29.400]  Humans are taking control of our environment. Yeah, because again now the elites have taken it from us. We're manifesting machines
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:36.280]  Over the last hundred tell us here you go in 1880 the average American male was five foot seven today
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:38.160]  He's five foot ten
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:44.240]  We may also merge with machines that can enhance our hearing eye sight health and much more
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:51.440]  It's all positive. They're hearing that let you record sounds generate white noise and even come with a built-in phone
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:53.400]  another
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:58.960]  Team out of the University of Oregon, which is developing bionic eyes that helped the blind to see
[2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:05.400]  See, that's not impossible to imagine that the technology could become a tool for seeing what we currently consider invisible
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:12.720]  Like different energies of light such as infrared and x-rays. There's all this cool fun stuff. That's that's the worm on the hook
[2:45:12.720 --> 2:45:18.000]  Right. This is the bait. Let's keep going. However. It's not just our outside appearance that will change
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:22.840]  Our genes will also evolve on microscopic levels to aid our survival
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:29.760]  It's called cancer for example an Oxford led study discovered a group of HIV infected children in South Africa living healthy lives
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:34.960]  It turns out they have a built-in defense against HIV. Oh without any upgrades
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.560]  It was it was always known that it was a bio weapon that mainly targets Africans in the northern Europeans can almost not get it
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:46.240]  That was none of the 80s. It was put in hepatitis shots given to gay men as vectors to spread it
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.120]  So again, we know all the human testing Tuskegee all of it here. They are oh now
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.840]  We're gonna take this DNA and then splice it into you. We have the answer for this man-made disease
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:00.440]  We've given you now. Let us put something in you, but just like the smartphones everything else
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:03.160]  It's gonna be built in with Trojan horses
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:06.800]  Everything they give you comes at the loss of something else. Here it is
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:09.440]  Well, also, too, this is making the argument that human beings
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:13.400]  beings are incredible and that our bodies are adaptable
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:17.760]  We don't need their machines to fix us and we know all the machines the calculators
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:22.360]  I'm not a troglodyte, but what they've given us is making us uglier stupider more unhealthy, right?
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.080]  So we know everything they've given us has been directed to make us weak. Everything they do is to make us subservient
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:32.760]  I watch adults just walk around all helpless and if you act helpless other people are nice to you like oh, you're helpless
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:36.240]  You're a super beta, too. Here. Let's all be helpless here. Let's go back to it
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:42.920]  for example an Oxford let's study discovered a group of HIV infected children in South Africa living healthy lives
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:48.800]  It turns out they have a built-in defense against HIV that prevents the virus from advancing to AIDS
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:53.120]  Good pause again. Yeah, it's called team up the site switch the HIV targets, but let's continue
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:58.120]  Being editing tools like CRISPR. We may eventually control our genes and DNA to the point
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:05.080]  CRISPR is right on the Cold Springs Harbor lab the human genome project at Cold Springs Harbor where eugenics came
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:07.960]  That set up Hitler and the Kaiser-Villiam Institute
[2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:10.720]  But you're not supposed to know any of that or the guy that ran it a few years ago
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:15.800]  Had to resign as he said blacks weren't human so people saying blacks aren't human are running it
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:21.600]  And but don't worry they want to manipulate your DNA with a synthetic system of the CRISPR. That's already mapping it and believe me
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:26.760]  This is 30 year old technology. Let's continue immune to disease and even reverse the effects of aging
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.760]  Another way to jump start the human evolution on a different path is to move some of us to Mars
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:41.280]  Mars receives 66% less sunlight than Earth which can mean humans on Mars will evolve larger pupils that can absorb more light in
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:43.380]  order to see and since Mars's
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:50.720]  Gravitational pull is only 38% of Earth's people born on Mars might actually be taller than anyone on Earth in
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:57.500]  Space the fluid that separates our vertebrae expands which led American aerospace engineer Robert Zubin
[2:47:57.500 --> 2:48:04.180]  Mars's low gravity could allow the human spine to elongate enough to add a few extra inches to our height
[2:48:04.900 --> 2:48:09.900]  However, not even a move to everybody wants to be taller. So they do surveys. They want to be taller
[2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:13.780]  They want better side they want to live longer. They go, you'll be taller. You'll be sexy. You'll be cool
[2:48:13.780 --> 2:48:15.780]  Take the chips take the chips. Let's keep going
[2:48:16.180 --> 2:48:21.340]  It's sparked the biggest change in human evolution that we may have coming through the next thousand years
[2:48:21.340 --> 2:48:28.100]  Immortality the path to immortality will likely require humans to download their consciousness into a machine
[2:48:28.540 --> 2:48:30.540]  Right now scientists and Italy
[2:48:31.060 --> 2:48:37.020]  Performing head transplants on animals to determine if you can transfer consciousness from one body to another
[2:48:37.380 --> 2:48:40.240]  They claim their next big medical experiments are so fun
[2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:45.860]  Whatever happens in the next thousand years whether we were that way you really have to get a sex change
[2:48:45.860 --> 2:48:47.360]  You could just do a head transplant
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:53.260]  The human race is always changing and the faster we change and branch off from earth the better chance
[2:48:53.260 --> 2:48:55.260]  We have of outrunning extinction
[2:48:57.380 --> 2:49:00.940]  Now NASA the US government was all involved in that they admitted to him in the credits
[2:49:01.140 --> 2:49:04.860]  Some positive things we got a branch out. We're always changing the only constant is change
[2:49:05.540 --> 2:49:10.420]  But then they come out and say we need to control all carbon control all humans because climate change first
[2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:14.340]  It was freezing then warming saying we did it now. They say oh just change
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:21.500]  We did we've got a stop-all change in tax carbon. So the overall message here is we're going to control human development
[2:49:21.500 --> 2:49:25.860]  Leon well, of course millions of us aren't going to make it to Mars hundreds of millions
[2:49:25.860 --> 2:49:29.460]  So who are going to be these lucky few that get to go colonize Mars?
[2:49:29.460 --> 2:49:34.300]  I mean, it's like we already know that their plans to wipe out the majority of the world
[2:49:34.300 --> 2:49:39.540]  They're just showing us that all the robots replacing use fun take the vaccine. I know you're having trouble breathing now
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:42.900]  Let us give the newborn baby shots. Oh another one died. Oh liberal
[2:49:42.900 --> 2:49:49.540]  Oh, I mean, this is just their whole deal, right? It's and I don't you know, I as well. I'm not a troglodyte, and I don't
[2:50:04.860 --> 2:50:08.260]  We're about to kill you for the earth, but your brain will be transferred this computer look
[2:50:08.260 --> 2:50:10.260]  They're all happy in there
[2:50:10.260 --> 2:50:12.260]  Totally false
[2:50:12.340 --> 2:50:15.780]  Well, that's the thing. It's like they trust us at Facebook what dumb efforts
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:21.420]  Sorry, what why are people so afraid of dying and going on to the next?
[2:50:21.420 --> 2:50:25.020]  I mean, it's like it's we all die and so they well, they're trying to be God
[2:50:25.020 --> 2:50:27.820]  They say God doesn't exist, but we're creating it in the machine
[2:50:28.340 --> 2:50:33.500]  We'll trap you forever inside of our supercomputers and harness your consciousness. Oh, that's like hell
[2:50:34.420 --> 2:50:39.860]  Exactly where you never die in a freaking computer. So great. I get to live in a sim
[2:50:39.860 --> 2:50:45.220]  It won't even be that it'll be a bunch of the it'll be like an imprint be like the photo of a giraffe not the giraffe
[2:50:45.220 --> 2:50:47.740]  Right, they'll say look they're all in there. They're alive
[2:50:48.020 --> 2:50:52.980]  And it'll be a bunch of stuff catalog what you said stuff like Siri or something like why we have a tall it is
[2:50:52.980 --> 2:50:58.660]  It's all a load of manure. We shall return on the other side with Leon Macadoo
[2:50:59.500 --> 2:51:06.540]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it
[2:51:06.540 --> 2:51:11.060]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea
[2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:17.260]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure
[2:51:17.500 --> 2:51:24.580]  Leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack when the chaos from any one of these threats arises
[2:51:24.580 --> 2:51:31.180]  The government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance

[2:54:11.060 --> 2:54:16.340]  I'm gonna do five minutes the next hour and then who's doing fourth hour today. It's David night David nine
[2:54:16.340 --> 2:54:20.100]  He's got a special guest. I know joining him. I got to a lot of news. I didn't get to a lot of news
[2:54:20.620 --> 2:54:26.780]  But Lee and just you got a stack of news here. We're now. Oh, we don't have male and female awards the MTV
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:30.180]  We just have awards and again, they're getting rid of the boys and girls sections
[2:54:30.180 --> 2:54:34.100]  This is an assault on the gender on children on life
[2:54:34.100 --> 2:54:41.820]  What better way to stop having children Bill Nye the science guys re-edited his shows right where you don't even you know
[2:54:41.820 --> 2:54:44.420]  Have thing about chromosomes and xy and xx
[2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:51.100]  I mean they mean business folks and they chemically manipulate the water and the food and they say oh you're anti-gay or anti-trans
[2:54:51.180 --> 2:54:57.700]  When they're artificially in doing it who can deny it's a total rollout who could deny it's like an alien attack on the species
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:01.860]  Right science fiction, but where aliens come and they teach you it's cool not to reproduce
[2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:03.860]  Yeah, I mean this is crazy
[2:55:03.860 --> 2:55:05.860]  Well, I get the whole gender spectrum thing
[2:55:05.860 --> 2:55:13.620]  But they they never want to talk about why you know why that might happen why a child washed in its mother's womb might have a
[2:55:13.620 --> 2:55:18.060]  Certain amount of estrogen or testosterone and why it's all kind of jacked up these days
[2:55:18.060 --> 2:55:21.820]  They don't ever want to talk about the the root cause of why that potentially
[2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:27.780]  Why a why a young boy could be washed with less testosterone in the womb so he has more effeminate
[2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:31.660]  And that's in all the studies that's incontrovertible, and that's like natural
[2:55:31.660 --> 2:55:34.660]  But are they are they looking at why moms are are they on?
[2:55:35.420 --> 2:55:41.340]  Pharmaceutical drugs while they're pregnant. I'm sure there's a lot of that going on or are we getting tons of estrogen?
[2:55:42.100 --> 2:55:44.100]  Blastered at us or estrogen mimicers
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:47.860]  So they don't ever want to talk about that kind of stuff. So it's like I don't want to
[2:55:48.780 --> 2:55:50.220]  Then they say go with it
[2:55:50.220 --> 2:55:56.620]  Yeah, I mean people went looking to the gay frog thing and found it's in thousands of big studies that frogs are going extinct all over
[2:55:56.620 --> 2:56:03.580]  Because just just at regime in the water at like, you know one parts per whatever is turning the frogs gay
[2:56:03.580 --> 2:56:06.500]  Mm-hmm, they make a joke about it. No the frogs are dead
[2:56:07.300 --> 2:56:10.980]  Right. Oh you're getting gay people. They're doing it on purpose
[2:56:11.300 --> 2:56:16.860]  Well, and that's why I don't I don't like to just flat out demonize and like point fingers that you you you
[2:56:16.860 --> 2:56:22.860]  You know, I don't like to do that because there is an assault on the human race and we know especially here in the west
[2:56:22.860 --> 2:56:26.700]  We are we've been a science experiment. No one else gets these
[2:56:27.140 --> 2:56:33.100]  GMO foods and bombarded with all the plastics and things in their foods because we're you know, we're so civilized
[2:56:33.100 --> 2:56:38.860]  We're the west we don't even eat real food. We eat food for robots basically because essentially we are a
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:43.660]  Science experiment, but what we can see with the social programming going on with the young kids
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:50.180]  I have officially turned into one of those crotchety old people who gets I just I can't stand the young ins these days
[2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:54.820]  It's pedophilia to target children and sexualize them even if you claim it's liberal
[2:56:54.820 --> 2:56:58.980]  That's really what it is. It's the whole you in Nambla agenda. Well, very interesting
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:03.820]  So we we we've been reporting about how Miley Cyrus just went super crazy and she was being really
[2:57:04.580 --> 2:57:06.300]  scandalous and like her last
[2:57:06.300 --> 2:57:11.860]  Tour she had she was wearing all these like prosthetic sexual organs and gyrating on stage
[2:57:12.100 --> 2:57:18.420]  Well now she's come around and said, you know what maybe wearing those nipple pasties wasn't the best way to get out
[2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:21.300]  The vote for Hilary Clinton. So she's changing her tune
[2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:23.860]  She's gonna be back to normal good girl again
[2:57:23.860 --> 2:57:30.460]  But it's all a setup because what it is is about targeting the youth and now she wants to go say oh, I'm normal again guys
[2:57:30.460 --> 2:57:34.780]  You can try my shit and the parents back in to pay your kids again
[2:57:34.980 --> 2:57:41.060]  Exactly and that's what's going on at the MTV Awards. We had Maxine waters. Okay, 78 year-olds
[2:57:41.060 --> 2:57:45.940]  She's been in Congress for a quarter century longer than most of the MTV viewing audience
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:50.660]  She comes out to give the award. She got a standing ovation
[2:57:50.660 --> 2:57:56.060]  I'm sure none of these kids even know who she is and by the way, she's like her district sucks
[2:57:56.060 --> 2:57:58.500]  So what has she actually done for her people?
[2:57:59.580 --> 2:58:07.660]  But she went to present the award for the best fight against the system. This is a new case if she's not the establishment
[2:58:07.660 --> 2:58:09.660]  It's establishment Hollywood
[2:58:09.660 --> 2:58:16.700]  I think I'm claiming they're the resistance they are against humans against life against America against freedom
[2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:24.020]  They are literally a demonic satanic force of mad scientist hell bent look at this
[2:58:25.140 --> 2:58:29.380]  For a year or so the FBI taking control the biggest pedophile site in the world called
[2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:36.660]  Playpin off and now they've got 1,500 child porn and pedophiles caught in their sights. We'll be right back
[2:58:36.660 --> 2:58:42.980]  Right back. We'll do five more minutes and then David Knight's coming in. So everybody tune in info wars.com forward slash show
[2:58:42.980 --> 2:58:45.460]  Don't let him stop the transmission. You're unstoppable
[2:58:49.900 --> 2:58:57.380]  Info Wars has partnered with defender body armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced highly tested body armor from infowarstore.com
[2:58:58.020 --> 2:59:03.060]  Defender body armor to certify to protect against all handgun rounds even armor piercing FN
[2:59:03.060 --> 2:59:06.580]  5.7 pistol rounds the secret to defender body armor
[2:59:06.580 --> 2:59:12.940]  It's his proprietary process and technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor
[2:59:13.020 --> 2:59:17.980]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight
[2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:21.980]  Oliatholene defender armor is also super compact and lightweight
[2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:28.020]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor
[2:59:28.020 --> 2:59:35.600]  It works defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized
[2:59:35.820 --> 2:59:40.580]  NIJ ballistic laboratory defender body armor is now available through infowarstore.com

[2:59:48.500 --> 2:59:54.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:02.740 --> 3:00:08.140]  The threat is real a scientific technocracy calling in world government ally with radicalism
[3:00:08.140 --> 3:00:17.700]  The forces are now attacking any sovereign nation that there stands against it. This is the front line
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:29.460]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[3:00:32.260 --> 3:00:36.140]  They've a night is all geared up with a ton of research to come in here
[3:00:36.140 --> 3:00:39.460]  The knock-em-dead leon macadam
[3:00:41.260 --> 3:00:46.620]  You I'd call you libertarian, but a real progressive when I first met you four and a half years ago
[3:00:47.180 --> 3:00:52.220]  And he's been quite a journey for you because they've become so much more out in the open. I used to
[3:00:53.020 --> 3:00:56.260]  Not even really criticize Islam. I didn't used to get into this whole tranny thing
[3:00:56.260 --> 3:01:02.540]  I thought it was some liberal obsession now. I can see how it hooks into the transhumanism all this screw it up little kids targeting
[3:01:02.540 --> 3:01:07.860]  I mean, this is so creepy. And as you said, you just can't handle it anymore. It's so clear
[3:01:07.860 --> 3:01:12.020]  It's so anti-human not the trannies themselves. That's just one part of this overall
[3:01:12.660 --> 3:01:18.700]  Confusion they're involved in. Yeah, well, I mean even you know, I just noticed how tired I am a lot
[3:01:18.700 --> 3:01:24.060]  And it's like it's like constant triggering and it's like an assault on our adrenal glands
[3:01:24.060 --> 3:01:30.900]  And most people don't even realize they have adrenal fatigue and they can't deal with the day-to-day because we're constantly in that fight or flight
[3:01:30.900 --> 3:01:36.380]  Um stage of our life. We're just constant anxiety. And so I can imagine these young kids
[3:01:36.380 --> 3:01:38.940]  But but just social media in general
[3:01:39.060 --> 3:01:44.980]  It's just a constant bombardment of imagery and reinforcement of certain this and you know
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:49.580]  People will target you and the good news is we're starting to defeat them. That's why they're trying to censor us
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:54.900]  Oh, yeah, Manatee has to whether you like Trump or not. That was an overthrow of the establishment. They tried to beat him
[3:01:54.900 --> 3:02:01.020]  Mm-hmm, right. And that's what and that's why we're seeing them pushing back so hard against this awakening
[3:02:01.660 --> 3:02:06.940]  But why they are targeting the young people for instance the Democrats their new big thing is they keep
[3:02:07.380 --> 3:02:13.540]  Dropping f-bombs at all of their town halls and all of their like that's cool. We're so cool. We cuss kids. We're just like you
[3:02:14.660 --> 3:02:21.500]  Maxine waters my millennials stay woke, you know, it's just that's their new thing is they want to act like they're the cool kids
[3:02:21.500 --> 3:02:26.580]  You know, we're the ones that when they're super twisted old globalist absolutely creepy
[3:02:26.580 --> 3:02:33.500]  Perfect example of the hypocrisy that we're constantly having to point out Samantha Bee who loves to you know poke fun at you as well
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:34.620]  Alex
[3:02:34.620 --> 3:02:36.620]  She's this Trump resistor
[3:02:37.100 --> 3:02:43.820]  Well, it turns out her husband is like very vocally opposed to more integration in their local public school
[3:02:43.820 --> 3:02:49.060]  So it's all these wealthy rich people there on the Upper West Side and now
[3:02:49.060 --> 3:02:54.260]  In the New York's Upper West Side so now their school is going to be moved over one block
[3:02:54.260 --> 3:02:58.380]  Which means it's going to put it in a brand-new neighborhood that's next to public housing
[3:02:58.380 --> 3:03:04.940]  And so they're all watching shows rated how the people that want all the radical Muslims them and stuff live in the widest areas in the world
[3:03:05.140 --> 3:03:08.780]  Exactly and these are these people who are constantly calling everyone a racist
[3:03:09.700 --> 3:03:13.900]  Xenophobic document Camelon article for folks. This is out of Breitbart
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:20.340]  And so, you know, they're the ones constantly calling everyone racist xenophobic. How dare you let the refugees in
[3:03:20.340 --> 3:03:22.140]  I never heard
[3:03:22.140 --> 3:03:26.220]  I got around Democrats and liberals and they're like she really closed the door and start saying racist stuff
[3:03:26.220 --> 3:03:31.540]  I'm like, dude, I'm not into that. Right. Well, and then her husband has the audacity to come out and say
[3:03:33.700 --> 3:03:38.180]  Opposition should not be interpreted as racist just because we don't want our school to
[3:03:38.180 --> 3:03:41.700]  Not want any black people around me, but I or Hispanics
[3:03:41.700 --> 3:03:48.100]  But I want but I want you to pay for everyone's free babies to portray any opposition as classes or races
[3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:52.940]  It's as bad as it can get. That's all your wife does on her show all day long
[3:03:52.940 --> 3:03:56.820]  It's trying to say anything that any Republican does is racist or classes
[3:03:56.820 --> 3:04:03.620]  But then when you point out that that's exactly what they themselves are guilty of he's right stop talking to the media
[3:04:03.620 --> 3:04:09.740]  There's there'd be no story if you just wouldn't talk to them about the opposition. I'm very well done and expanding on that Leanne
[3:04:10.700 --> 3:04:15.860]  They know full well, they're not gonna be around all this class where they're creating exactly and and we're getting rid of the
[3:04:15.860 --> 3:04:22.620]  Establishment Republicans that are weird blue blood elitist, but the freedom Congress is actually trying to make everybody wealthy and independent and free
[3:04:22.620 --> 3:04:24.620]  That's what is true
[3:04:25.100 --> 3:04:26.260]  anti-racism
[3:04:26.260 --> 3:04:32.860]  Is the great unifier of prosperity and culture of freedom, but they want to distort everything and keep these young kids
[3:04:32.860 --> 3:04:36.300]  Divided. Yeah, exactly. They want them desperate where they never get in relationships
[3:04:36.300 --> 3:04:39.700]  They never get around men or women they get real insecure they can be told
[3:04:39.700 --> 3:04:44.300]  Oh, you don't have any sex and there's a bunch of other bots that have no sex and then now here
[3:04:44.300 --> 3:04:46.300]  We all do you know really bizarre stuff together
[3:04:46.300 --> 3:04:50.420]  So what you're getting into is a bunch of perverts that are betas that have actually created a new
[3:04:50.620 --> 3:04:57.980]  Super pervert beta command base to try to then recruit all our kids for their pedophile operation because super betas are pedophiles folks
[3:04:57.980 --> 3:05:06.700]  While the Trump effect on relationships according to the Washington examiner is causing breakups Trump effect on the Democrats and liberals is

[3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:38.660]  And you're likely to hear a belligerent rant involving many curses

[3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:30.100]  It's Alex Jones
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:32.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight your host on this fourth hour
[3:08:33.220 --> 3:08:40.100]  We have a lot of breaking news. Of course, we've had Governor Abbott here in Texas to sign a law that will not allow
[3:08:40.500 --> 3:08:44.540]  Sanctuary for criminal sheriffs and it began really here in
[3:08:45.180 --> 3:08:49.940]  Austin with our sheriff who just got reelected Sally Hernandez. We'll talk about that in a moment
[3:08:49.940 --> 3:08:54.260]  We'll also talk about at the bottom of the hour going to talk to author George Neumeyer
[3:08:54.260 --> 3:08:57.060]  Who has written a book called the political pope?
[3:08:57.060 --> 3:09:02.260]  I thought it would be interesting to talk about the back-and-forth within the Catholic Church
[3:09:02.900 --> 3:09:10.460]  About the Pope's politics and how active he is in politics as we see all this discussion about the Johnson amendment
[3:09:10.900 --> 3:09:15.620]  You know, it's kind of interesting. Nobody is saying that the Catholic Church ought to lose any
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:19.780]  tax deductions because of the Pope's political activism
[3:09:20.060 --> 3:09:23.780]  But there are people within Protestant churches as well who are saying well
[3:09:23.780 --> 3:09:26.940]  Maybe we don't want to have that kind of discussion in these churches
[3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:29.060]  I think that the churches ought to be able to have their own
[3:09:29.700 --> 3:09:32.860]  Discussion as to make their own decision as we're not going to be political or not
[3:09:32.860 --> 3:09:34.300]  Anyway, we're going to talk to him at the bottom of the hour
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:38.340]  We're going to put a perspective on this on the Catholic side and of course as the
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:42.200]  Protestant side is talking a great deal about the Johnson amendment
[3:09:42.200 --> 3:09:45.720]  It provides an interesting context for that before I get to that
[3:09:45.720 --> 3:09:46.760]  I just want to say real quickly
[3:09:46.760 --> 3:09:49.680]  Thank you so much for all your support that you've given us over the last week
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:56.200]  Especially through the 30-hour broadcasts that we did and a reminder that we do have super blue fluoride free toothpaste one of my
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:09:59.640]  Two favorite supplements that's now back in stock 9.95

[3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:11.400]  Make everything so simple for our operation here because we would know what is coming down the line
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:17.120]  We know what demand is going to be we wouldn't be running in and out of some of the more popular products so quickly
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:24.440]  So just consider auto ship you get a 10% discount if you sign up for more than $50 at a time on auto ship
[3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:26.120]  You get free shipping as well
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:31.280]  So think about that that helps to make sure that you never run out of the supplements that you want on a daily basis
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:34.160]  And I guarantee you if you try this toothpaste
[3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:37.800]  You're going to want to have that as your as your
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:43.360]  Toothpaste because I have tried a lot of different toothpaste. I've tried a lot of different fluoride free toothpaste
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:49.280]  And I haven't found anything with fluoride or without that leaves my mouth feeling as fresh as this does
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:52.240]  How many toothpaste are you going to get with nano silver in it?
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:53.040]  All right
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:10:59.080]  I want to go and course you can find all that at infowarstore.com and that is 33% off retail right now
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:03.960]  And of course you can also sign up for auto ship. Let's talk about what's going on here in Texas with the governor's bill
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:08.000]  Texas governor Greg Abbott said today that law enforcement and other officials
[3:11:08.640 --> 3:11:17.080]  Implementing sanctuary policies where we that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will be now subject to the stiffest penalties in America
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:22.160]  And we have to understand right here in here in Travis County
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:26.160]  This is really where it's come to a head. I attended a meeting
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:29.120]  of the I
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:35.420]  Guess it was let's see. What was the organization they had it was an initiative that was started by George Bush
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:38.120]  where they would tell the
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:41.520]  Immigration officials if they had criminals that they had arrested and
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:49.320]  There was a Democrat sheriff at the time a black man and he was getting ripped apart by the Democrat Party
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:51.800]  Because he was turning over criminals
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:58.360]  To immigration and we've seen the same thing happen in California as soon as Trump was elected. We had all these
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:04.800]  Amnesty groups that were saying we need to hide these lists of gang members
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:06.800]  from
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:09.320]  Donald Trump because he would deport them and
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:14.200]  Because he might get somebody who wasn't a gang member who was actually put on that list by mistake
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:18.160]  So we want to hide and protect even the gang members so that we don't have somebody
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:22.120]  Deported by accident who just happens to be only a
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:27.480]  Foreign citizen who is criminally trespassing in the United States. That's their only crime. So let's not
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:35.720]  Deport those people. Let's leave them here and let's even leave known gang members here because we know that that's what Donald Trump wants
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:40.760]  To do is to deport them and of course what we have here in Texas. I think is is very needed
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:47.160]  There's been a lot of pushback. We've had Democrat legislators as well as the news media here in Texas pushing back against this
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:51.680]  Characterizing it as something that is not going to fly. That's not legal and of course
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:57.560]  Dallas Morning News is right at the center of that a Democrat state representative said that this law is unconstitutional
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:04.320]  Because states are preempted by federal law in the area of immigration and are not permitted to conduct their own investigation
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:06.880]  That's not what they're doing. What they're doing is
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:15.740]  Inquiring about their immigration status and turning them over to the federal officials of people at the meeting that I went to here in Travis County before this
[3:13:15.740 --> 3:13:18.020]  A black sheriff was defeated
[3:13:18.020 --> 3:13:22.100]  I don't know if he was defeated or if he just decided that he wasn't going to run for re-election because he wasn't going to make it and
[3:13:22.620 --> 3:13:27.900]  This is the first term of Sally Hernandez the woman who replaced him
[3:13:28.740 --> 3:13:32.700]  Course a Democrat, but when I was at that meeting, they were just in sense that anyone
[3:13:33.060 --> 3:13:40.580]  Who had committed any crime of any nature would be ever turned over to immigration authorities. They'd be reported to be investigated and
[3:13:40.580 --> 3:13:47.780]  And Governor Abbott addressed this he told Breitbart, Texas. This is their article here that the
[3:13:48.300 --> 3:13:49.820]  Dallas Morning News
[3:13:49.820 --> 3:13:55.740]  Directly misstated what the legal status of the law out was out of the US Supreme Court in the Arizona decision
[3:13:55.740 --> 3:14:01.660]  He said the so-called controversial part of this law is what some label as the show me your papers component
[3:14:01.780 --> 3:14:06.300]  He said what everyone seems to get wrong is they think the provision was stricken down in the Arizona law
[3:14:06.300 --> 3:14:11.340]  He said to the contrary the provision in the Arizona law is stricter than in the Texas law
[3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:16.340]  The Arizona law required law enforcement to ask for papers. That's not the case here in Texas
[3:14:16.340 --> 3:14:22.620]  He said but despite the difference and the fact that the Arizona law was stricter the Arizona law was upheld by every
[3:14:22.940 --> 3:14:26.100]  US Supreme Court justice including the liberals
[3:14:26.420 --> 3:14:32.900]  The so-called controversial part of this law has been ruled on by the US Supreme Court and upheld with even the liberal justices
[3:14:33.300 --> 3:14:34.980]  upholding that law and
[3:14:34.980 --> 3:14:39.220]  They said the police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person that they detain
[3:14:39.300 --> 3:14:45.380]  So that part of it hasn't changed what has changed is that you had people like Sally Hernandez and remember when she
[3:14:45.860 --> 3:14:48.920]  first took office. She was one of the most
[3:14:50.700 --> 3:14:51.900]  Activist
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:58.300]  Sheriffs in the country and she said I'm not going to report people to immigration unless they've committed three crimes
[3:14:58.300 --> 3:15:03.140]  She had three crimes and then a little while after that somebody said you know what we've got this guy here
[3:15:03.140 --> 3:15:10.620]  Who's been arrested? He's an illegal alien and he's had multiple sexual assault offenses including some against children and
[3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:15.980]  You're not reporting him. That's not on your list of three crimes. Oh, well, okay
[3:15:15.980 --> 3:15:21.580]  I will not report for four crimes. Okay, it's kind of like the the Spanish Inquisition with Monty Python
[3:15:21.580 --> 3:15:24.060]  You know, nobody expects the Hispanic Inquisition
[3:15:24.060 --> 3:15:27.300]  So it's like now there are four crimes now that now there's five now there's six
[3:15:27.300 --> 3:15:31.980]  Well, it's like why don't you report them in the first place and let immigration sort this out?
[3:15:31.980 --> 3:15:40.460]  And as the governor pointed out the Kate Steinley who was killed in San Francisco who was murdered was an illegal alien or
[3:15:40.740 --> 3:15:48.420]  A foreign citizen criminally trespassing in America. Let's put it that way who was released from a jail here in Texas
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:50.780]  So he's released from a jail here in Texas
[3:15:50.780 --> 3:15:56.060]  He goes to San Francisco and he kills this woman for no reason at all Kate Steinley who became a
[3:15:56.060 --> 3:16:03.100]  Centerpiece of the Trump campaign. He said this law makes Texan safer because it prevents the types of policies that California has
[3:16:03.500 --> 3:16:07.360]  That lead to the tragic murder led to the tragic murder of Kate Steinley
[3:16:07.740 --> 3:16:12.420]  He said it prevents the types of policies that were adopted by the Travis County Sheriff here
[3:16:12.660 --> 3:16:19.580]  Who had policies that released back out on the street people are either accused of or even convicted of dangerous crimes?
[3:16:19.580 --> 3:16:27.340]  And at the same time this is happening. We've got a sheriff in Long Island Suffolk County, where my wife is from but took to the airwaves
[3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:29.140]  yesterday
[3:16:29.140 --> 3:16:31.820]  criticizing Obama's immigration policies why because they have
[3:16:32.180 --> 3:16:36.780]  MS-13 hacking people with machetes same thing that's happening in Maryland
[3:16:36.780 --> 3:16:43.300]  This is a gang that is El Salvadoran in nature and it really began in LA
[3:16:43.300 --> 3:16:51.140]  But now it has spread from the southwestern United States to the northeastern. It's spread all the way across the country very heavy in the Maryland
[3:16:51.140 --> 3:16:54.500]  Area Maryland is proud of the fact that they have a lot of sanctuary cities
[3:16:54.500 --> 3:16:59.700]  They're going to try to become the first sanctuary state, but it's also happening in Long Island
[3:17:00.500 --> 3:17:08.820]  The sheriff in Long Island blamed Obama for the recent rash of murders that have been linked to MS-13 gang activities across Long Island
[3:17:08.820 --> 3:17:15.420]  And he applauded Attorney General Jeff Sessions for saying that he's going to address MS-13
[3:17:15.420 --> 3:17:21.820]  This is what the sheriff on Long Island said. He said in the community of Britwood where there is a big El Salvadoran population
[3:17:21.860 --> 3:17:25.820]  We have had over the last nine months or so 11 bodies that have
[3:17:26.260 --> 3:17:31.780]  Turned up. He said the victims many of whom were high schoolers who were Hispanic folks. This isn't a
[3:17:31.780 --> 3:17:39.460]  Racial issue here. This is a gang war issue many of these people came to this country because they wanted to escape stuff like
[3:17:40.100 --> 3:17:44.620]  MS-13 and because we have open borders MS-13 just follows them across and
[3:17:45.380 --> 3:17:50.380]  They're going to be killing and they're not going to be paying attention to just killing Hispanic people
[3:17:50.580 --> 3:17:53.020]  They're going to be equal opportunity murders
[3:17:53.700 --> 3:17:59.860]  But right now they're focused primarily on the community in which they live because these are people who are either in a rival gang
[3:17:59.860 --> 3:18:04.060]  Or who are not in their gang or who are part of their gang and they didn't do what they wanted them to do
[3:18:04.060 --> 3:18:08.700]  So that's why this is centered on that right now, but we want to see that happening with anybody
[3:18:08.700 --> 3:18:17.020]  I mean do you why is it the immigration advocates don't have any compassion for Hispanic migrants who come here and are victims of MS-13?
[3:18:17.660 --> 3:18:23.100]  He said they've been targeted for refusing to join the game or for defecting from its ranks
[3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:26.180]  He said a large portion of MS-13 gang members are here illegally
[3:18:26.180 --> 3:18:32.980]  They arrive in this country through guess what the unaccompanied minor program. They're dreamers. They're dreamers who came here
[3:18:33.900 --> 3:18:36.260]  under Obama's relaxed rules and
[3:18:36.860 --> 3:18:43.740]  As we said before, you know the people who are coming here and they're saying these are minors turning up people like glenn beck showing up
[3:18:43.740 --> 3:18:47.420]  At the border with teddy bears for MS-13 members
[3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:50.580]  They seriously folks. Do you really think?
[3:18:50.580 --> 3:18:58.620]  That eight-year-olds are making the trip across the border across Mexico across Central America by themselves as
[3:18:59.420 --> 3:19:01.060]  unaccompanied minors
[3:19:01.060 --> 3:19:03.140]  That whole thing isn't is a lie
[3:19:03.780 --> 3:19:05.780]  It's an absurd lie
[3:19:05.860 --> 3:19:11.260]  These people that glenn beck and others are showing up handing out teddy bears to these people if they need teddy bears
[3:19:11.260 --> 3:19:13.980]  They didn't come here unaccompanied. No, they came here
[3:19:13.980 --> 3:19:17.100]  The border is controlled as we've talked to people a Breitbart
[3:19:17.100 --> 3:19:22.420]  A reporter who's part of the border project that they have he said the border has controls on it
[3:19:22.420 --> 3:19:25.860]  It's not a completely open border the people who control it are the gang members
[3:19:26.460 --> 3:19:29.500]  And of course the gang members themselves are young
[3:19:30.380 --> 3:19:33.460]  Strapling characters who come here for a free education
[3:19:33.620 --> 3:19:42.500]  But they're gonna give us an education an education and gang warfare as a sheriff said the MS-13 mantra is kill rape and control
[3:19:42.500 --> 3:19:47.540]  That's what they're about folks. We got to stop it. All right. Stay with us when we come back
[3:19:47.540 --> 3:19:53.580]  I'm gonna talk about the second amendment getting shot in the back by some gun manufacturers. Stay with us. We'll be right back

[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:47.600]  Let's take a look real quickly at this story that is shaped up
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:49.360]  last couple of weeks
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:50.960]  There's been a lot of talk
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:56.800]  In the gun community about what happened in Illinois and I think it's very illustrative of what happens with our rights in general
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:25:59.440]  I'm going to talk about this more tonight on the nightly news
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:03.440]  But here it is in a nutshell because I have some other stuff. I want to talk about as well. Basically
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:05.680]  you have the
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:08.480]  state government in Illinois not friendly to the second amendment
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:16.080]  They want to do things to shut down gun shows in Illinois. So they came out a came up with a scheme to essentially
[3:26:16.720 --> 3:26:23.920]  Require you to be a federal firearms licensed to sell more than nine firearms a year or to buy
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:27.120]  Buy or sell more than nine firearms a year
[3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:31.600]  Well, that created a problem for two of the gun manufacturers that are in that state
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:34.400]  Springfield and rock river arms
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:39.120]  And of course springfield armory is a very old gun company
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:45.600]  Um started in the 1800s actually out of massachusetts. They went out of business in the 1960s, but they were bought
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:48.160]  by a couple of brothers in
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:53.200]  Illinois and relocated into Illinois. So you've got a couple of gun manufacturers in
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:59.760]  Illinois and they actually created an organization called the Illinois firearms manufacturers association
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:06.800]  This group has a lobbyist because of course you need to kind of protect your back if you're dealing with firearms in Illinois of all places
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:12.560]  Unfortunately, what happened was as they were pushing this bill through the state legislature
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:18.480]  Their lobbyist for the Illinois firearms manufacturers their lobbyists cut a deal
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:21.360]  Cut a deal with the democrats
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:26.080]  And got an exclusion for the firearms people and then went from opposition to neutral
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:30.400]  And then it passed the senate by one vote. We don't know what's going to happen yet in the house
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:32.640]  I don't believe that vote has been held yet in the house
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:39.360]  But after that happened both these organizations came out to distance themselves and said we had no idea that this was happening
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:41.040]  We're in the firearms business
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:43.280]  We hired a lobbyist because we don't do that type of thing
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:47.520]  So they distanced themselves from it as a matter of fact rock river arms actually said
[3:27:48.080 --> 3:27:51.680]  We have dropped out of the Illinois firearms manufacturers association
[3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:56.800]  Which means that there's now only one company that's involved there because if you look at their filing
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:27:58.880]  you had
[3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:00.880]  Of the five people in the organization
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:07.120]  Two of them were the president ceo brothers of one of these country companies and the other two were
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:10.160]  brothers of the other
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:13.360]  Firearm companies so two of them were from springfield two of them were from rock river
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:15.440]  These are the ceos of these companies
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:20.480]  And the fifth person was the paid lobbyist and they said they had no idea what he was doing that he was cutting a deal
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:22.480]  To get them on the outside
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:28.160]  So that's the problem that we see and it isn't just this particular situation in illinois and it isn't just the second amendment
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:31.520]  This is the way lobbying works. It's lobbying 101
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.920]  You have people who can afford to get legislation crafted
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:40.400]  To help them get their own tax deductions or to exempt them from the laws
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:43.440]  And these laws are put on their competition
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:47.200]  Or it's put on other people and they really don't care they buy their way out
[3:28:47.200 --> 3:28:53.120]  They buy their protection. That's why they hire the lobbyists. That's the corruption. That's the way the swamp works
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:59.200]  Whether it's in illinois or whether it's in washington dc. That's how we lose our freedoms through that particular process
[3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:03.600]  Very shameful. We'll talk about that a little bit more tonight on the nightly news, but I want to take a look now at the
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:06.240]  Streisand effect
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:08.720]  Barbara Streisand she was very upset
[3:29:08.800 --> 3:29:12.880]  In the days before we had google earth where you could look at any particular location
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:17.600]  She was upset because somebody published some pictures of her house and she made a big stink out of it all of a sudden
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:19.920]  It got so popular
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:23.200]  Everybody was publishing pictures of her house. That's the Streisand effect
[3:29:23.680 --> 3:29:26.480]  So we have Barbara Streisand in new york talking about
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:29.600]  Hillary Clinton if only Hillary Clinton had been president
[3:29:30.160 --> 3:29:34.400]  And when I look at this it's like now that's the Streisand effect as disappointed as we may be
[3:29:34.880 --> 3:29:39.200]  In many of the things that donald trump has done or has failed to do like failed to repeal obamacare
[3:29:39.200 --> 3:29:43.840]  Yes, they are moving in the right direction with that but as we're disappointed think about the Streisand effect
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:49.840]  She just reminded us all that hillary clinton is not president and we can really be happy about that
[3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:52.400]  The empires on the run
[3:29:52.880 --> 3:29:55.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.920 --> 3:30:06.240]  The anthropogenic globalists have won the french presidential election with macron becoming the youngest french president ever
[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:10.080]  Macron won in a landslide thanks to many simply voting against lapin
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:17.200]  Macron was elected despite mere hours before the election leak documents revealed macron would cater to islam and tifa the eu
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:19.920]  As well as his own personal offshore bank accounts
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:27.520]  There will be no investigating into the us meddling in the french election despite barack obama and seemingly every major us news network
[3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:35.680]  Endorsing macron and labeling lapin racist and extremist the fake corporate news continues to push lapin as racist as bernie sanders has chimed in
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:38.480]  Saying france rejected racism and xenophobia
[3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:43.040]  But the cruelest irony of all this is the victory cries of vive la france
[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:47.360]  Even though it is not refuted that lapin was the nationalist candidate
[3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:52.800]  They cheer hooray for france long live france as this election will likely mark the end of france
[3:30:52.880 --> 3:30:59.360]  And it is a victory for the globalist european union not france for info wars dot com. This is oan shroyer

[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:15.760]  And now your host david knight
[3:33:19.120 --> 3:33:23.600]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and joining us now is author george newmire
[3:33:23.840 --> 3:33:27.600]  He writes at spectator.org, but he also has a book out that just come out
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:34.160]  The political pope how pope frances is delighting the liberal left and abandoning conservatives
[3:33:34.240 --> 3:33:38.480]  I think it's very interesting to talk about this subject because of course at the end of last week
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:40.560]  We just had an executive order from donald trump
[3:33:40.560 --> 3:33:46.160]  Talking about how he wanted the johnson amendment to not be enforced against churches
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:50.080]  And of course if you don't know what the johnson amendment is that is the irs
[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:54.400]  regulation essentially that would say that for for uh
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.000]  Tax deductible or for 501c3 corporations, which many churches are to get their tax deduction
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:02.880]  But they cannot talk about politics and so that
[3:34:03.680 --> 3:34:08.800]  classification lumping churches together with just uh tax exempt organizations
[3:34:08.800 --> 3:34:14.720]  Is kind of confusing to start with and there's now been a back and forth within conservative
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:20.240]  Churches and Protestant churches as to whether or not they even want their churches to be involved with us
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:22.000]  Many of them say well, we don't want to see this happen
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:25.920]  Well, they don't have to talk about politics the pope doesn't have to talk about politics
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:29.760]  They could stick to the subject people can decide which church they want to go to
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:32.160]  I think we ought to my
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:35.200]  Feeling on this is that we ought to get the irs out of it, but I want to hear what
[3:34:35.200 --> 3:34:41.520]  Uh, george newmeyer says about this but also about the politics of the pope because he has not been
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:45.920]  Silent at all about what he wants to see happen and it is a real
[3:34:47.440 --> 3:34:51.920]  180 from what we have seen in the catholic church as you point out possibly the most
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:55.920]  Liberal pope that we have ever had. Thank you for joining us george newmeyer
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:35:00.480]  Thank you for having me. Uh, give us a little bit of a uh
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:07.760]  A sense of of what you're concerned about here in this uh, this book the political pope tell us some of the things that you're concerned about with the
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:12.800]  Pope that he's gotten involved in of course we've reported on this, but uh, let's just go over some of the more
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:17.200]  Obvious things that this pope who's promoted a globalist agenda has done
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:22.160]  Well, yeah, as you point out, uh, the church has gone from
[3:35:22.800 --> 3:35:26.000]  An anti-communist pope in john paul II
[3:35:26.640 --> 3:35:28.640]  To now a pope who's flirting
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:33.840]  Uh, with communism and uh, francis has become the darling of the global left
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:37.120]  by aggressively pushing, uh
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:40.400]  Open borders, uh, socialism
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:44.480]  Uh gun control, uh, pacifism of various kinds
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:48.800]  Uh, he's clamoring for the elimination of lifetime imprisonment
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:53.200]  Which is a position so part of the left that the u.s. Democrats don't even take it
[3:35:53.840 --> 3:35:57.520]  so on issue after issue, uh, he is, uh
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:04.960]  But enlisting the church in the causes of the global left and that's having a tremendously divisive effect on the church
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:09.600]  And it's having a very bad effect on our politics because it's making it easier
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:13.440]  for the democrats, uh, to present themselves
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:22.000]  As uh as being in line with religion when really they're not everybody knows that the democrats have become a godless party
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:24.320]  That is in favor of abortion
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:30.400]  And that is not interested in any, uh in giving religion any role within public life
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:32.960]  It's uh, the democrats are the party of secularism
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:39.360]  And so it is perverse that the pope would be enlisting would make would be making it easier
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:42.320]  Uh for the democrats to be successful in politics
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:46.160]  And as you pointed out in your, uh press release here, you say that, uh
[3:36:46.800 --> 3:36:51.280]  Radical academic cornell cornell west has said pope francis is a gift from heaven
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:56.640]  Who we got uh and they're right up on your book on amazon you point out that we've had uh tom hayden who was
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:01.440]  Uh, uh, jane fonda's husband very radical. He said the
[3:37:02.240 --> 3:37:07.840]  Selection of uh pope francis was more miraculous than the rise of barack obama in 2008
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:09.920]  They're very happy with what he's doing
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:14.400]  The globalists are very happy with what he's doing and if you look at the tenets of globalism
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:17.360]  From economics that he's pushing a very
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:22.800]  Very radical socialism a communism if you will also pushing climate change
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:28.320]  Uh, he's not uh speaking ex-cathedra. He's not speaking from the chair when he talks about science
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:31.280]  He's not speaking from the chair when he speaks about economics
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:35.840]  And that's the concern that many people in the catholic church have with him as well, isn't it?
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:43.440]  Yeah, he's really turned the vatican into almost like an annex of green peas in the sierra club
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:48.240]  Uh, you know the vatican is now crawling with radical environmentalists
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:50.800]  chevres sacks, nihomie kline
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:58.480]  al gore, uh bill de blasio, bernie sanders all of these uh extreme environmentalists show up at the vatican
[3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:02.480]  And they promote the the rawest forms of climate change
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:06.640]  Uh activism in fact as I discussed in the book there is this really
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:08.800]  outrageous
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:10.800]  Use of st. peters basilica
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:16.960]  Uh, it was used uh as a backdrop for a climate change propaganda film
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:25.440]  So the facade of st. peters basilica was actually used as a movie screen for a uh a al gore style propaganda film
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:31.520]  With and I detail that in the book and so that's very characteristic of this of this vatican
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:34.720]  And of course, he's also had when he did his climate encyclical
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:37.040]  that he put out that that
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:42.240]  For many people did not realize if they're not involved in the catholic church many people
[3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:46.320]  Real don't realize that that's not something that is an official pronouncement
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:52.800]  Nevertheless, it was being sold that way by the media and the people who were working with him as speech writers and preparing that
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:39:00.960]  Were radical population reductionists people who are calling to uh have the population the worldwide population reduced
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:06.480]  Uh by 90 to 95 percent. These are the types of people that he's got there. So a radical reversal
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:11.840]  On things like birth control because now these are the same people who have been pushing not only
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.880]  Abortion, but they've been pushing sink one child policies in china and elsewhere
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:19.040]  So he's pushing for radical
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:24.720]  Depopulation of the earth, which is a a head spinning reversal for a pope to be involved in
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:30.160]  That's right. And you may recall that a few years back. He actually told catholics
[3:39:30.960 --> 3:39:38.800]  To quote unquote not breathe like rabbits. Yeah, and that that was very indicative of his mindset and as you point out
[3:39:39.040 --> 3:39:44.480]  Uh, these population control advocates are showing up at the vatican in great numbers
[3:39:44.880 --> 3:39:49.200]  And one of the the recent ones who showed up was paul airlock who you may recall
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:55.200]  Was one of the loudest opponents for for not only birth control but compulsory abortion abortions
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:40:02.640]  In the 1960s in the 1970s, and he was received he received an invitation to speak at the vatican just a month or so ago
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:06.080]  Let me ask you this because we're talking about the johnson amendment
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:12.000]  And there's been a lot of back and forth uh within Protestant denominations as to uh, whether or not they went to the baptist
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:17.360]  Official southern baptists have said we don't want our churches talking about politics
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:20.960]  So we like the johnson amendment to me. It seems like people ought to be able to talk about it
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:23.840]  Whether or not they want to that's something they should be able to make up their mind
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:28.480]  If you don't want to go to that church you go to a different church. It doesn't talk about politics if some churches might want to
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:36.480]  Uh, make the connections in your everyday life or to candidates who support abortion or who fight against abortion or people who
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:40.240]  Support slavery for example if we go back to the 19th century
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:44.880]  We had william wilber force and many christians there who were leading the fight against slavery
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:50.240]  So there are moral issues that have political dimensions to them and I would even go farther
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:56.560]  I would even say that my politics is informed by my morality and if we divorce ourselves from that
[3:40:57.040 --> 3:41:00.160]  Then we're into this kind of pragmatic machiavellian
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:04.720]  Henry Kissinger real politic that has absolutely no moral principles
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:06.640]  I don't think we want to be led by people like that
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:11.920]  And so I don't really have a problem with talking about those with making a connection between
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:18.240]  Uh, the way that we are to live in our life as christians and the politics that that fall out of that
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:20.240]  But there's some people who just don't want to see that happening
[3:41:20.320 --> 3:41:27.360]  What is happening in the catholic church when you have such a politicized pope that is uh making all these pronouncements about
[3:41:28.240 --> 3:41:35.360]  Depopulation of the earth climate change and so forth and pushing for socialism. What is the the pushback within the church?
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:42.640]  Well conservative catholics welcome trump's proposal because they want priests to be able to endorse pro-life republicans
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:46.560]  And they want it. They want priests to you know say that uh, the
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:53.840]  Democrat who's supporting gay marriage or whatever is unacceptable. And so they're uh, actually cheering trump's proposal
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:42:01.280]  Ironically the the the priests and the bishops who don't like the proposal are the uh, the very left wing ones
[3:42:01.280 --> 3:42:05.280]  Who uh, who are talking politics all the time in the worst sense of the word?
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:09.840]  You know, they're they're often getting involved in politics when it doesn't involve church teaching
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:14.880]  But when it does involve church teaching like the abortion issues, they don't want to talk politics
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:19.200]  Or they don't want the church to be to be taking a position. And so they've uh,
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:22.240]  They've made some snide remarks about trump's proposal
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:27.280]  But I would say that the orthodox and the traditional and the conservative catholics are very happy to hear
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:34.640]  that uh, trump is willing to protect priests who defend pro-life uh, republicans and and uh, traditional family types
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:37.760]  And you know, we've seen that type of thing happen as well in
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:43.760]  Protestant churches. It's it's very common to see black Protestant churches bring in people like jesse jackson
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:50.640]  And that would be under the johnson amendment. That would be a no-no because you would be directly tying this to a political candidate
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:52.640]  In other words, they're saying well, you can talk about broad
[3:42:52.640 --> 3:42:58.480]  Principles, but you can't talk about a specific candidate yet. They give it a pass when it happens with democrats
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:02.080]  Just like you're talking about they give it a pass when it happens on the liberal side
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:06.480]  And I'm sure they would not like to see a situation where you have a conservative
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:09.440]  priest talking about a local election
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:16.000]  Uh, they would much rather just leave it with the political pope who's going to talk about things in a broader context
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:19.200]  And shut up everybody that is downstream who might be applying this
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:22.000]  Uh, some conservative principles to a local election
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:26.960]  That's right. Yeah, they they uh, they they would prefer that uh,
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:31.360]  Pope Francis being the sole spokesman for the catholic church because he's
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:37.120]  A non-stop chatterbox and voice box for the global left and for the democratic party
[3:43:37.840 --> 3:43:42.000]  But uh, you know, as you're pointing out just being just because you're religious
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:46.080]  Shouldn't mean that you lose your right to free speech and uh,
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:54.080]  And the very fact that this law was in enacted was a reflection of the secularism of the 1960s, which was very anti-religious
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:43:58.640]  Yeah, and of course, we always hear about the separation of church and state
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:02.880]  It's taken at it. That's not in the Declaration of Independence. It's certainly not in the constitution
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:08.960]  It's in a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to uh, some baptists in Connecticut because they were concerned
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:13.200]  They had believed we talked about a lot of false information about elections
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:20.000]  Of course at the time, uh, there was all this information from his opponent John Adams saying that Thomas Jefferson was going to confiscate everybody's
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:23.360]  Bibles, so they literally had people burying their bibles in the backyard and he was
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:28.960]  Writing to them to reassure them that he wasn't going to mess with them. He said there's a wall that separates us from you
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:34.160]  And that wall in his opinion was a wall around the government's actions
[3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:39.840]  But what we have seen beginning in the 1960s was the supreme court put that wall around the churches
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:43.440]  Around Christians and said you better stay within this wall
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:47.360]  You can walk around freely within this wall, but you better not get out of that
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:53.360]  You better not talk about or freely exercise your religion in public because we're going to shut that down and they do that
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:59.600]  And have been doing that ever since the 1960s when they incorporated separation of church and state, a phrase that is not in the constitution
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:03.600]  Uh, let me ask you. You one of your other books is uh, no higher power
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:06.480]  Obama's war on religious freedom
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:11.760]  What is the political activism of this pope doing in the catholic church?
[3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:17.440]  Is there something of a civil war within the catholic church because we've got obama declaring war on religious freedom?
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:24.000]  Is there a civil war within the catholic church between liberals and conservatives and what what can if anything can they do about
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:26.480]  This liberal political pope
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  There is there is a very intense civil war going on within the church between liberals and conservatives
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:38.160]  Uh, and there's a growing number of catholics including bishops and cardinals
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:43.520]  Who are voicing their objections to the to the liberal direction of this pontificate?
[3:45:44.160 --> 3:45:52.000]  In fact four cardinals have filed an official, uh, request that uh, that pope francis change his very liberal position on the issue of
[3:45:52.720 --> 3:45:54.720]  Communion for the divorced and remarried
[3:45:55.760 --> 3:45:57.760]  He he's in favor of communism
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:05.040]  On the issue of uh communion for the divorced and remarried, uh, he he's in favor of communion for the divorced and remarried
[3:46:05.040 --> 3:46:10.560]  And so these four cardinals have sent him a letter saying that that position is not in conformity with church teaching
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:16.880]  And that he needs to give up that position or at the very least they're seeking clarification on his position
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:24.000]  And they've said that if he doesn't respond to their questions that they're going to move towards a formal correction of him
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:29.520]  So that's an indication that the uh, this civil war within the church is really heating up
[3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:33.920]  And I predict over the next, uh, you know for the remaining years of his pontificate
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:37.760]  It's going to become even more visible and even more dramatic
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:42.800]  Let me ask you about that you say they they might move towards a formal correction. Well, how does that how does that look?
[3:46:42.800 --> 3:46:43.600]  I'm not a catholic
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:46.720]  So I I don't understand. I mean they're not going to be able to impeach him
[3:46:46.720 --> 3:46:50.560]  Are they going to say that on this specific issue the majority of us disagree with a pope therefore?
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:52.560]  He's wrong on this that
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:56.320]  The the cardinals are free to stand up and declare
[3:46:56.960 --> 3:46:58.960]  That what the pope has said on this matter
[3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:04.880]  Is incompatible with church teaching there is nothing that prevents them from making that declaration
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:11.200]  The issue becomes uh, what happens at that point if if a pope were to say in response to that
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:14.640]  Well, I don't care. I don't care that I'm violating church teaching here
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:19.040]  Well, that that puts the cardinals into a very very awkward spot a position
[3:47:19.040 --> 3:47:21.360]  Which they've never been in in the history of the church
[3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:26.080]  And there there's a different schools of thought on what they could do at that point
[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:32.960]  But the consensus view amongst theologians over the centuries has been that if a pope commits a
[3:47:33.600 --> 3:47:35.600]  Commits himself to formal heresy
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:39.280]  He there both he thereby self vacates the seat of
[3:47:40.400 --> 3:47:47.200]  Peter and then at that point the cardinals could declare the seat empty and then move to an to elect a new pope
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:54.880]  Oh, wow, that's very interesting because what we see always is the people like macron when they are identified as globalists as
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:47:57.920]  Internationalists they are always identified in the press as
[3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:05.040]  Centrists as moderates. They're never identified as extremists or as hardliners
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:11.440]  And yet we see increasingly that the people who are promoting globalism whether it's political leaders or whether it's a religious leader like the pope
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:17.040]  They are always there. They're never identified as an extremist or a radical or a hardliner
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:20.960]  Even though their policies are very extreme radical hardline and creating
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:25.440]  unprecedented division and institutions that have been around a long time like the catholic church
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:29.280]  I think when we look at the ability of people to
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:33.280]  Connect their religious beliefs with their political beliefs
[3:48:33.280 --> 3:48:34.960]  I think we need to go back to
[3:48:34.960 --> 3:48:39.040]  Somebody who is kind of common to both Catholics and to Protestants to Augustine
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:42.480]  We go back to Augustine and we look at his just war theory
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:50.560]  And we understand that it was something that informed Christian thought that you would have a very deliberate set of criteria
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:54.560]  Before you go to war you would have to say this is going to first of all
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:49:00.720]  We've had innocent people attacked by aggression. We if we go to war we can save innocent life
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:04.240]  And we're going to lose a lot more innocent life if we do nothing
[3:49:04.240 --> 3:49:12.720]  So you had these set of criteria and that really kind of was the basis of the laws that we had in the west and the basis of our
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:16.320]  Debate before we have a declaration of war in the united states
[3:49:16.320 --> 3:49:21.840]  I think it's very important to have those types of things people don't realize the moral foundations of our legal code
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:27.760]  Whether you're talking about christianity or judias and what it there are moral foundations that this that we are now
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:33.760]  Severing that we no longer care about we no longer have a discussion as to whether or not a war is justified
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:38.240]  We just have war and so I think it's very important that we have these types of discussions
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:41.200]  Your comment on on that sir
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:49.920]  Well, uh, yeah, you know acquiesce saint thomas acquiesce and uh, saint augustin are the classical
[3:49:50.800 --> 3:49:52.800]  uh exponents of the just war
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:50:01.120]  theory and uh interestingly this pope is moving to get rid of that tradition. He's set up a commission
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:03.760]  to look at uh changing
[3:50:04.400 --> 3:50:09.760]  The the just war tradition is articulated by acquiesce and and augustin
[3:50:10.320 --> 3:50:11.760]  so um
[3:50:11.760 --> 3:50:13.520]  That's uh, that's another
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:14.880]  disturbing
[3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:21.680]  Development within this pontificate is that there's just no appreciation of the enormous contribution that saint thomas acquiesce
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:23.680]  and saint augustin made
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:26.880]  Not only to the church, but to western civilization
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:30.080]  Yeah, and we look at those foundations of western civilization
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:35.840]  That are based on moral considerations and those foundations are being destroyed and what's being put in their place
[3:50:36.320 --> 3:50:38.320]  the policies of globalism
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:45.200]  The policies of socialism that have resulted in hundreds of millions of people killed in the 20th century alone
[3:50:45.280 --> 3:50:49.200]  That's what's now being embraced by this pope and as you point out at the beginning of the interview
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:55.360]  It was rejected by the previous pope. He rejected communism and socialism now those values are being embraced
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:50:58.000]  Population controls being embraced. It was to be right back
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:01.440]  Investments and securities involves the risk of loss
[3:51:01.520 --> 3:51:07.680]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities a successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities
[3:51:07.760 --> 3:51:11.520]  Thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did
[3:51:11.600 --> 3:51:13.760]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision
[3:51:13.840 --> 3:51:16.960]  They were locked into low returns faced potential tax consequences
[3:51:16.960 --> 3:51:20.080]  And that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties
[3:51:20.160 --> 3:51:24.240]  They were stuck and so was their money suddenly their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger
[3:51:24.320 --> 3:51:28.800]  But it didn't have to happen to them and it doesn't have to happen to you. You can avoid the annuity trap

[3:55:42.080 --> 3:55:47.360]  So thank you for your support. Let's go back to uh, uh, George new mire and again as we were talking
[3:55:47.440 --> 3:55:49.760]  He's has pointed out in his um
[3:55:50.640 --> 3:55:57.120]  In his book that this pope has told atheists not to convert. He loves secularized europe. He has praised the koran
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:04.720]  Uh, he has brought in science advisors who advocate zero by depopulation not zero population growth
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:09.840]  But depopulation of the earth. So this is a radical reversal of what we've seen
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:14.160]  We had a pope prior to that that fought against communism. He lived in a communist country
[3:56:14.160 --> 3:56:20.720]  He did not want to see that for people. So he he fought against that now this pope frances is embracing that
[3:56:21.440 --> 3:56:24.000]  Your final comments in this segment mr. New mire
[3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:31.200]  Yeah, your audience might find my book of interest because I detail the communists and socialist influences
[3:56:31.920 --> 3:56:35.840]  On pope frances. I look I go back and I look at his time in argentina
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:41.600]  Which was a deeply socialist country that left a very deep impression on his thinking and explains
[3:56:41.840 --> 3:56:43.840]  Uh, much of his agenda
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:51.280]  Uh, you your readers might also, uh, your audience might also be interested in the uh, the pope's
[3:56:52.400 --> 3:56:54.400]  attempt to commit the church to
[3:56:54.800 --> 3:56:55.760]  uh
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:59.920]  world government to a certain extent in the environmental and cyclical the dot to see
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:07.120]  There are several paragraphs in which he talks about the promotion of international institutions and the promotion of
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:13.760]  of world government and the the view expressed in that document is that international
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:17.440]  institutions are better at directing global policy than
[3:57:18.320 --> 3:57:22.560]  individual countries are and that explains that that explains why
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:25.440]  uh
[3:57:25.440 --> 3:57:33.600]  World government appeals to to uh, a liberal life frances is that he thinks that individual nations and nationalism
[3:57:34.080 --> 3:57:35.840]  are an impediment
[3:57:35.840 --> 3:57:40.160]  To the global left's agenda and he thinks that if the u.n. Is making more decisions
