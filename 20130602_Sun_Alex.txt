[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.480]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.360 --> 00:17.400]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:21.800 --> 00:24.760]  We are go ladies and gentlemen we are
[00:24.760 --> 00:30.520]  Broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday the second day of June
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.560]  2013
[00:35.600 --> 00:42.160]  We will find out very very soon by tonight in the next few hours whether they're going to let me get on an airplane
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.560]  From Dallas, Texas and fly to England they've not put any blocks on it yet
[00:48.560 --> 00:56.160]  But we will find out very very soon and Lord willing I will be in Britannia. I will be in the United Kingdom
[00:56.800 --> 00:58.800]  New World Order command base
[00:59.120 --> 01:06.440]  Alpha Delta I will be there tomorrow and the real Bilderberg coverage really does start now
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.960]  Because they are trying to restrict free speech. They're involved in all sorts of shenanigans
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.200]  I'm going to talk about that after the break and also just want to go over some of the crazy headlines
[01:16.200 --> 01:23.560]  And they get crazier every week how much nuttier and out of control corporations and bureaucracies and governments and
[01:24.080 --> 01:27.760]  Individuals be as the collective insanity intensifies
[01:28.440 --> 01:31.920]  We will look at that coming up
[01:32.440 --> 01:40.400]  After this quick break, and we're also going to look at something. I covered earlier in the week, and that is Bill O'Reilly
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.840]  a cutting in a video clip of me ranting out of context
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.640]  And saying that it is hate speech and then going along with
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.120]  Facebook calling for censorship we're going to look at that as well, and then we'll also try to look at something
[01:58.120 --> 02:00.400]  I covered on Friday, but I think it's still pertinent
[02:01.640 --> 02:07.460]  You know was announced earlier this year that France is set to ban the words mother and father because they're hurtful to people
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.920]  That's London Telegraph
[02:09.920 --> 02:11.920]  one of our reporters
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.640]  Did a report Gigi Arnetta did a report?
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.800]  Breaking down the fact that the Justice Department the same ones that ran fast and furious
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.440]  the same ones that
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.840]  are involved in so many other forms of corruption the IRS persecution the
[02:29.320 --> 02:36.960]  Harassment of the media the going after whistleblowers going after the press the authoritarians that poses liberals and give themselves peace prizes
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.160]  And that fund al-qaeda
[02:39.160 --> 02:40.840]  Overseas all the rest of it
[02:40.840 --> 02:47.180]  They're now saying and I'm reading from the LBGT inclusion at work the seven habits of highly effective managers
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.520]  to use inclusive language do not
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.040]  Use words like husband or wife because that might
[02:55.360 --> 03:00.920]  Offend somebody if you use that term and of course the state now is announcing in Europe that they will be the new parent
[03:00.920 --> 03:03.880]  so now you're only allowed to call parents not father or mother but
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.480]  Parent and then I have articles out of England where the same thing is going on again people on infowars.com
[03:09.760 --> 03:13.080]  Are questioning going hey my daughter's gay?
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.160]  You know what are you against them listen? It's not about that. It's about all these TV shows targeting under
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.960]  you know ten-year-olds with
[03:23.660 --> 03:25.760]  how to have sex how to
[03:27.120 --> 03:33.160]  Become a transvestite how to whatever there is no business of the government or anybody else or the media
[03:33.160 --> 03:39.440]  Involves in this and this is done to confuse gender roles and break down the family
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.280]  This is an attack on the family, but if you don't go along with that attack
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.720]  Why you hate people which I do not hate any of these people like I wish none of this was going on
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.280]  So I didn't have to even address it and and it's so brazen how they sell this authoritarianism
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.080]  packaged in the name of inclusion
[03:56.080 --> 04:02.800]  Packaged in the name of tolerance and so it gets a lot of real liberals and Thomas Jefferson types
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.160]  To go along with all of this
[04:05.600 --> 04:06.560]  Thinking oh well
[04:06.560 --> 04:12.480]  It's just about inclusion when that's not what it is okay from the top the documents are public
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.960]  I cover my film endgame blueprint for global enslavement and in the expanded extras that are online
[04:17.960 --> 04:24.320]  That the major universities on record said we're going to encourage with chemicals and things people not knowing their gender
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.320]  And we're going to encourage homosexuality
[04:26.480 --> 04:29.520]  And things so people don't have kids they want you alone
[04:29.880 --> 04:37.040]  By yourself a human resource to be basically euthanized at age 55. That's their plan. That's what globalist healthcare is about
[04:37.040 --> 05:04.880]  A little over a year ago. I began to do a lot of research into why even though
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.340]  I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.440]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[05:16.680 --> 05:22.840]  Depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[05:23.120 --> 05:25.120]  Fight off cancer and be healthy
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.420]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[05:30.420 --> 05:36.420]  Young Jeavity the Young Jeavity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that
[05:36.620 --> 05:40.100]  You don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost
[05:40.580 --> 05:42.580]  37 pounds in two months
[05:43.140 --> 05:50.220]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals. I need check it out for yourself. It's incredible go to info wars team com today
[05:50.220 --> 05:57.240]  And order your first canister of beyond tangy tangerine complete multivitamin mineral complex dietary supplement
[05:57.240 --> 06:04.940]  That's info wars team com from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones
[06:11.100 --> 06:17.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this special worldwide broadcast. It is Sunday the second day of June
[06:19.180 --> 06:23.100]  2013 I am your host Alex Jones and in the next few hours
[06:23.100 --> 06:30.400]  We will find out whether or not I'm allowed to get on an international flight that I've booked to fly to the United Kingdom
[06:31.020 --> 06:32.580]  to cover
[06:32.580 --> 06:34.580]  150 members of royalty
[06:34.940 --> 06:37.340]  and government the new royalty
[06:37.980 --> 06:44.180]  They've been trying to meet in secret since 1954 when it was founded by a bunch of Nazis after World War two
[06:44.460 --> 06:48.380]  We will find out whether or not I'm able to go to England to cover Bilderberg
[06:48.380 --> 06:55.740]  2013 I say that because thousands of people including our own Michael Savage here in the United States talk show host
[06:56.060 --> 06:58.540]  Have been banned from going into England
[06:59.180 --> 07:01.180]  If you basically don't support
[07:01.620 --> 07:04.140]  communism world government destruction of the family
[07:05.060 --> 07:11.700]  If you don't think of the family itself as an abhorrent fraud if you don't want a hundred percent taxation
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.960]  You were blocked from flying into England
[07:13.960 --> 07:20.880]  Some of the time we'll we'll see what happens with this and I want to cover that first for hit some other news
[07:21.080 --> 07:24.300]  Then I'm gonna get into Bill O'Reilly last week. He attacked me
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.640]  He talked about hate speech and Facebook banning hate speech
[07:27.640 --> 07:32.400]  Which is a Soviet term and then played a clip of me talking out of context that even makes sense
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.400]  Ranting about the New World Order killing people and hoping they don't come after me basically
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.720]  And then he just cut that in and just some piece about sexual harassment online and hate speech
[07:44.720 --> 07:46.720]  But I don't even talk about stuff like that
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.880]  so just really bizarre to see News Corp that is being harassed by the White House and
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.940]  Having their free speech violated and their sources arrested for just reporting news
[07:57.560 --> 08:00.160]  Having Bill O'Reilly who I know people inside Fox
[08:00.160 --> 08:06.040]  He basically is Roger Ailes now Roger Ailes is kind of old and and reportedly has some health problems
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.200]  And so like Bill O'Reilly's like the boss of News Corp at least in the Fox Division. What is he doing?
[08:11.720 --> 08:14.020]  Constantly every few weeks. There's some new attack
[08:14.760 --> 08:20.240]  It's like Rachel Maddow saying that I said the tornado was sent by Obama a few weeks ago that hit
[08:20.800 --> 08:23.000]  Oklahoma City suburb of Moore I
[08:23.680 --> 08:25.680]  Didn't say that
[08:25.920 --> 08:29.380]  I'm on record not saying and I said a caller said did the government do this?
[08:29.380 --> 08:31.600]  I think they did a caller from Oklahoma City
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.680]  I said no, but there is big weather modification programs and weather warfare programs and who knows if it's screwing the weather up
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.540]  But you know hurricanes are actually you know in a decade low right now
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.880]  Tornadoes are in a 60-year low. That's USA Today
[08:45.880 --> 08:51.080]  Just type it in and I said it's probably a real tornado, and then that turns into Rachel Maddow saying
[08:51.080 --> 09:00.360]  Rachel Maddow saying that I say Obama sent the tornado
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.400]  That's the type of garbage we're talking about you have to ask yourself. Why are they doing this?
[09:07.400 --> 09:11.280]  Why is CNN MSNBC Fox News the New York Times?
[09:12.920 --> 09:16.360]  Bloomberg you I mean you name it Nightline coming after
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  Alejandro Jones
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.900]  That's me in case you didn't know that's Spanish. I'm showing off in a Spanish
[09:22.900 --> 09:29.440]  It's Alexander's Alejandro, but the point is I'm under attack. Why is that because I'm real I?
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.040]  Believe in the Constitution Bill of Rights. I know how the globalist operate
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.740]  I've got their number, and we are growing exponentially and they can look
[09:38.880 --> 09:44.800]  at a graph and they can see where we're going they can see that
[09:44.800 --> 09:49.380]  We're on the march the Empire is on the run
[09:50.380 --> 09:56.940]  Now speaking of that here are the articles up on info Wars calm and the live coverage of Bilderberg 2013 it officially kicks off
[09:56.940 --> 10:00.940]  This Thursday, but if I get into England I have reporters to reporters in England already
[10:00.940 --> 10:01.980]  They're gonna be there so regardless
[10:01.980 --> 10:07.020]  We're gonna have live coverage, but if I get in I'm gonna be there on the ground with members of the British Parliament
[10:08.140 --> 10:09.940]  members of the EU Parliament
[10:09.940 --> 10:16.300]  Oh, yes, the UK Independence Party the fastest-growing party there our listeners. They're like Ron Paul type folks
[10:16.300 --> 10:22.480]  They are they are aware of what's going on Lord Moncton Nigel Farage so many others. They're going to be
[10:23.060 --> 10:25.980]  They're covering it. They're in the Parliament talking about it
[10:26.620 --> 10:29.640]  So many exciting things are happening, and I've had the police
[10:30.500 --> 10:37.580]  head captain over security call me and basically admit that Bilderberg's running things and that saying that he's a listener, but that
[10:37.580 --> 10:42.940]  This private security firm has been put in charge and all the rest of this is going on
[10:42.940 --> 10:47.460]  And that they want to support our First Amendment writer over there. They call it press, right?
[10:48.440 --> 10:54.740]  You know to cover this, but at the same time. They're saying no pedestrians around the multi-thousand acre compound
[10:54.780 --> 10:57.380]  but this Grove Hotel is that where they're meeting and
[10:58.940 --> 11:03.620]  Again for years. They've said this whole thing is non existent and
[11:03.620 --> 11:10.740]  And doesn't exist, but now they're forced to admit it exists, and we have articles up on info Wars calm of the official
[11:12.020 --> 11:14.700]  County and the city of the county of
[11:16.220 --> 11:17.860]  Hertfordshire and
[11:17.860 --> 11:22.280]  The city of Watford with the official Bilderberg seal and letterhead
[11:22.820 --> 11:28.380]  Where they are basically in control of the whole area so this globalist mafia that the New York Times says doesn't exist
[11:28.460 --> 11:31.480]  That's coming to town and now it's in the Daily Mail is in the BBC
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.480]  they're all being forced to report on it because info wars calm and then
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.360]  Rogerport calm and world net daily calm and others ran the blockade in the last decade
[11:41.140 --> 11:43.760]  Exposing that this really does exist and covering it all
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.480]  So now we're forcing the dinosaur kleptocratic
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.960]  Supporting media to cover this but still begrudgingly and we've got the maps on info wars calm
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.040]  And we have a special page info wars calm forward slash
[11:58.040 --> 12:05.800]  Bilderberg and if your public school educated like I am and have trouble with that just in fours calm forward slash big or
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.680]  Big or if you've drunk too much fluoride and taken too many vaccines. You're totally brain damaged like I am
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.040]  We just have Bilderberg calm. I'm sorry a separate site
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.280]  We have info wars calm forward slash B
[12:18.280 --> 12:25.480]  Just the letter B and George Arwell said freedom was the capacity to say 2 plus 2 equals 4
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.960]  Now that's too advanced for us. It's the freedom is the
[12:30.960 --> 12:37.000]  Understanding and the capacity to go to info wars calm forward slash the letter B
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.580]  Not the numeral, but the letter B

[12:48.960 --> 12:50.960]  Bodacious as bodacious start with the B
[12:50.960 --> 12:57.520]  B is in B is in possum. Wait, that's a P. The point is it's info wars
[12:58.440 --> 13:00.940]  calm forward slash
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.140]  Big sis no, that's not a URL info wars calm forward slash B or
[13:09.660 --> 13:11.660]  forward slash big or forward slash
[13:11.920 --> 13:14.580]  Bilderberg we're gonna have live video feeds
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.920]  They're free for everybody on the ground in England with about ten different
[13:18.920 --> 13:21.000]  reporters as it turns out
[13:21.840 --> 13:26.400]  We actually don't just have two reporters in the UK full-time paid salary. We've got auxiliary reporters
[13:26.560 --> 13:28.320]  So I said we got about ten people there
[13:28.320 --> 13:29.520]  I think it's gonna be more
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.320]  More than ten people the point is is that you're gonna have thousands of people
[13:33.560 --> 13:38.600]  Converging on this thing and it's in the middle of the countryside and the police have put out an order saying
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.600]  No one is allowed to walk on the sidewalk and citizens in the area
[13:43.600 --> 13:51.040]  People that live there and pay the taxes they have to show ID to walk down the street with their dog in a rural area
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.820]  And the Brits love to walk in order to drive their car. So it's martial law
[13:55.400 --> 13:57.400]  Coming to Watford England
[13:57.760 --> 14:01.960]  Northwest of London out in the middle of nowhere beautiful rolling countryside
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.560]  Martial law because a bunch of war criminals and globalists who've been indicted before
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.160]  Kissinger one time didn't go to build a burg beating ten years ago in London because
[14:11.160 --> 14:15.640]  P no, she had been arrested when he went in there, you know the former Chilean dictator
[14:16.640 --> 14:23.520]  Was the conspiracy third surely doesn't exist. I choose to ignore your information just by just by saying you're stupid
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.660]  That's just some of what's gonna be going on. So this is historic. This is big as an info wars comm
[14:30.240 --> 14:32.240]  forward slash B
[14:32.240 --> 14:39.080]  Not BEE but enforce comm forward slash B. Alright, I'm kind of word-playing that forever. That was not done on purpose
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.440]  I'm out of control. Here's some of the other news up on info wars comm
[14:43.280 --> 14:45.920]  From Forbes. I want to apologize
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.820]  I said Obamacare according to Reuters was going to double the price of the average insurance policy in 2013
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.920]  In some areas it's it's it's a hundred and forty six percent increase
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.420]  Because the foreign banks that only insurance companies wrote it. So, of course it does that is they make you buy a product now
[15:02.420 --> 15:04.420]  It's gonna go up in California
[15:04.420 --> 15:10.740]  Obamacare or I should say obama nation care to increase individual health care insurance premiums by
[15:11.660 --> 15:13.660]  one hundred and
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.660]  46
[15:20.060 --> 15:24.580]  And weighing in on this side of the arena is big sis spymaster
[15:24.580 --> 15:30.100]  But you call her a liberal and Obama's bombing more countries and funding al-qaeda to attack Syria now
[15:30.100 --> 15:36.420]  That's okay because you got a peace prize and Americans have only rebuilt less than half of their wealth
[15:36.540 --> 15:41.820]  Lost in the recession study says you believe we're even out of that but don't worry all over the country. The federal government is
[15:43.180 --> 15:48.300]  Canceling fireworks displays because they fund those locally your local government can't fund things
[15:48.300 --> 15:52.700]  The government has to run that the federal government. So that's basically that we'll be back with bill
[15:52.700 --> 15:58.900]  O'Reilly, he says shut down free speech. He agrees with Facebook. We'll be right back now
[16:00.620 --> 16:06.300]  Is the perfect time to spring clean your body with supernatural silver a non-toxic
[16:06.820 --> 16:13.420]  Disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally it helps the immune system by killing the bacteria
[16:13.820 --> 16:21.420]  Viruses and mold that cause disease this helps to reduce the workload of your already overworked immune system and allows the immune system
[16:21.420 --> 16:24.180]  To refocus its energy and recharge
[16:24.900 --> 16:30.620]  Supernatural silver can help combat over 300 different conditions and it has the ability to kill over

[21:26.300 --> 21:33.420]  But can anything be done to stop the hatred which is directly linked into the IRS tea party scandal
[21:33.580 --> 21:35.580]  We'll have a factor investigation
[21:35.620 --> 21:43.660]  This is a guy who put caller ID on his radio show that was unpopular and failed and if someone disagreed with him

[22:29.620 --> 22:33.700]  but still I mean you're jealous you your radio show failed and
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.140]  He gets up there and agrees we should shut down hate speech
[22:38.540 --> 22:43.440]  Which is anybody criticizing the corrupt media and government and all these old fake?

[22:54.540 --> 23:01.460]  Their ratings are all dropping our ratings are going up, and they know that and they're upset and so they're circling the wagons

[23:23.340 --> 23:27.260]  Neocons attacking Matt Drudge and Drudge report calm because Matt Drudge
[23:27.260 --> 23:33.020]  It was the past the present and the future because he likes Liberty he likes the truth
[23:33.020 --> 23:38.980]  He likes the racy reality of standing up to tyranny. He's the future
[23:38.980 --> 23:45.820]  He's independent. You're the past. I'm independent. I'm the future. You're the past the wave of the future
[23:46.140 --> 23:52.860]  And you know we're the wave of the future, and you don't like the wave of the future
[23:53.700 --> 23:58.340]  You know you're stayed in a joke. I mean somebody calls in and attacks me and
[23:59.060 --> 24:01.060]  says I disagree with you I
[24:01.780 --> 24:07.420]  Don't run and try to hook up caller ID and then and then have private security go to the person's house
[24:07.420 --> 24:13.460]  I don't sit here and get in female employees at my office and call them up every night going
[24:13.460 --> 24:16.700]  I'll give you a raise if you come over here and have sex with me
[24:18.100 --> 24:25.380]  That's what Bill O'Reilly settled on out of court. I mean he's a bully perv you want to start a fight with me punk
[24:25.740 --> 24:28.820]  Huh you punk you think you can shove me around?
[24:28.820 --> 24:35.980]  You're a coward, and that's why you'll take me out of context and call for Facebook to censor
[24:37.420 --> 24:40.140]  Myself and others you want to use me as the poster boy of
[24:40.700 --> 24:47.180]  Your censorship of your attempt to extinguish the fire of Liberty. Thank you for throwing me in that briar patch pal
[24:47.740 --> 24:49.740]  You're a coward punk
[24:50.620 --> 24:53.860]  Excuse me. I got a lot of news to cover, but I'm gonna get to that later
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.780]  I've had enough of it
[24:56.780 --> 25:00.700]  O'Reilly has three million viewers and
[25:01.580 --> 25:03.580]  That's been dropping
[25:03.580 --> 25:05.180]  this guy
[25:05.180 --> 25:12.100]  thinks if he ignores us that that that that's how he suppresses the Liberty movement and
[25:12.780 --> 25:16.300]  Then if he just occasionally plays clips out of context
[25:16.300 --> 25:24.060]  He'll inoculate his audience into disliking us when all you did was send your moderately sized audience over to us bill
[25:24.060 --> 25:30.140]  and by the way some of the liberal sites posted it and that most the conservatives and the liberals and
[25:31.220 --> 25:38.540]  Libertarians when I was reading the comments unified and defended me only you could unify people
[25:40.020 --> 25:47.780]  Only you bill O'Reilly, so thanks a lot you actually do have someone of an audience from posing as a as a conservative
[25:47.780 --> 25:54.780]  And so thank you for sending us your audience just reminding them
[25:54.780 --> 25:59.940]  We're here so they come over to info wars calm and prison planet calm, and I know it hurts you to do it
[25:59.940 --> 26:01.940]  Yeah, you got you've got
[26:01.980 --> 26:04.140]  Glenn Beck saying I'm a spooky fascist
[26:05.740 --> 26:07.380]  And a liar
[26:07.380 --> 26:11.920]  With no evidence you've got bill O'Reilly saying I'm hate speech and need to be shut down
[26:12.060 --> 26:15.140]  You've got Rachel Maddow saying it's time to not give him attention
[26:15.140 --> 26:21.500]  It's time to not listen to him. Please Republican stop giving him power
[26:24.260 --> 26:29.220]  She had a big graphic up there with my face saying twisted
[26:30.500 --> 26:34.740]  I'm a twisted. Maybe I am twisted. That's why I could see all your crap
[26:36.180 --> 26:42.500]  If I'm twisted thank the maker that I'm twisted Thank Jehovah, I'm twisted
[26:42.500 --> 26:46.740]  Thank you, Shua. I'm twisted. Thank Jesus Christ
[26:47.500 --> 26:54.180]  My lord the Savior that I'm twisted if I'm twisted Lord. Give me more twisting twist me up
[26:54.740 --> 26:56.740]  It's just that
[26:56.940 --> 26:58.940]  The reason you have the entire
[27:00.540 --> 27:02.540]  Parade of
[27:02.620 --> 27:04.620]  narcissistic sellout
[27:05.060 --> 27:12.180]  Cozied up to different arms of the establishment different heads of the high Hydra there to co-op the Liberty Movement and these people realize
[27:12.180 --> 27:17.240]  They're losing control of the narrative. That's why they're all panicking. They're sick of hearing about info Wars calm
[27:17.340 --> 27:21.780]  They're sick of hearing about drugs report calm. They're sick. I mean Glenn Beck smart
[27:21.780 --> 27:26.940]  He's gone to become the leader libertarians, and well. You know what what I was like 10 years ago on the radio I
[27:27.460 --> 27:31.940]  Mean you know he at least gets where the market set. I'll take a mercenary like that any day
[27:31.940 --> 27:35.300]  He's better than his old buddy O'Reilly these two were supposedly best buddies
[27:35.300 --> 27:37.620]  I've seen back back on O'Reilly a few months ago
[27:37.620 --> 27:44.260]  I was being mean to him and Beck was turning red and laughing back at him. I mean these guys aren't even nice to each other
[27:44.260 --> 27:46.460]  How could you travel all over the country with somebody?
[27:46.700 --> 27:52.980]  Say you're great buddies with them and then sit there and snipe at each other because Fox and News Corp ordered them to
[27:53.780 --> 27:58.220]  Against Glenn Beck. They have no honor. There is no honor among thieves as it said
[27:58.860 --> 28:03.420]  And they're trying to steal your mind. They're trying to steal a real restoration a
[28:03.420 --> 28:10.220]  Revolution against tyranny they want to shut it off down a black hole. They don't like the fact that in foe
[28:10.740 --> 28:12.340]  Wars
[28:12.340 --> 28:16.140]  They hate that dot-com is setting the agenda
[28:17.020 --> 28:19.300]  More and more not setting a baloney
[28:20.300 --> 28:23.660]  Division agenda a distraction agenda a divide-and-conquer agenda
[28:23.940 --> 28:30.540]  They're mad because we are unifying Liberty lovers of every race color creed gender ethnicity
[28:31.780 --> 28:32.980]  sexual
[28:32.980 --> 28:34.700]  persuasion
[28:34.700 --> 28:38.900]  Whatever around freedom. That's why they don't like us
[28:39.020 --> 28:45.500]  That's why they're attacking and we're giving people hope that we can beat the globalist and we can create justice
[28:45.500 --> 28:52.740]  And then we can have a future together and that's why they're scared because we carry the light of liberty in our hearts and souls
[28:53.140 --> 28:58.700]  We come to defeat the new world order and all the enemies are showing themselves

[32:09.540 --> 32:10.540]  And that's food
[32:10.540 --> 32:18.540]  We thought the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it

[33:36.540 --> 33:40.540]  One of them that I know is true is that life is an adventure
[33:40.540 --> 33:48.540]  The only way your life is not an adventure is if all you're doing is watching mainstream television that is designed to literally lower your perception
[33:48.540 --> 33:52.540]  Lower your IQ, lower your event horizon
[33:52.540 --> 34:01.540]  I am here for better or worse cause none of us are perfect to get you to open your mind and expand your horizons
[34:01.540 --> 34:02.540]  That is my goal
[34:02.540 --> 34:06.540]  I believe in empowering humanity and the animating contest of liberty
[34:06.540 --> 34:13.540]  And somebody else who believes in that is my old compadre, media analyst Mark Dice
[34:13.540 --> 34:23.540]  And we're gonna talk to him right now, right now about what he did last week on Veterans Day asking people about Veterans Day in California
[34:23.540 --> 34:25.540]  And almost none of them even knew what it was
[34:25.540 --> 34:27.540]  This is bizarre
[34:27.540 --> 34:29.540]  So Mark, tell us your take on this
[34:29.540 --> 34:33.540]  I wanna hear just a few minutes of this
[34:33.540 --> 34:35.540]  The full clip is up on infowars.com
[34:35.540 --> 34:38.540]  It's on Mark's YouTube and Facebook
[34:38.540 --> 34:40.540]  But I mean this is six minutes long
[34:40.540 --> 34:46.540]  And in the middle it gets to people that go, I don't care about anybody but me
[34:46.540 --> 34:50.540]  And they smile at him like that's their possession
[34:50.540 --> 34:52.540]  Like that's their armor
[34:52.540 --> 34:55.540]  And you will have your bank account taken
[34:55.540 --> 34:57.540]  You will be injected with cancer viruses
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.540]  You will be destroyed you maggot
[34:59.540 --> 35:02.540]  And these are the people that will vote to take our guns
[35:02.540 --> 35:06.540]  These are the people that will vote to take our money and give it to them
[35:06.540 --> 35:08.540]  The globalists take 90%
[35:08.540 --> 35:10.540]  They give 10% to the unwashed mass
[35:10.540 --> 35:13.540]  Who themselves are just as immoral
[35:13.540 --> 35:16.540]  In fact they're more immoral than the new world order
[35:16.540 --> 35:19.540]  Cause the new world order knows what they're doing is evil
[35:19.540 --> 35:23.540]  And disdains you and is killing you in plain view
[35:23.540 --> 35:27.540]  And then you're loving it and wanting to rob virtuous people
[35:27.540 --> 35:30.540]  You are the scum of the earth
[35:30.540 --> 35:31.540]  Let's go to the club
[35:31.540 --> 35:33.540]  What is Memorial Day for?
[35:33.540 --> 35:35.540]  Umm
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.540]  What is Memorial Day for?
[35:37.540 --> 35:39.540]  What's Memorial Day for?
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.540]  Umm
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.540]  Wow
[35:43.540 --> 35:45.540]  I never really thought about it
[35:45.540 --> 35:47.540]  Umm
[35:47.540 --> 35:49.540]  This guy's just ignorant
[35:49.540 --> 35:51.540]  Memorial Day
[35:51.540 --> 35:53.540]  I don't know
[35:53.540 --> 35:55.540]  These people will not
[35:55.540 --> 35:56.540]  What is Memorial Day for?
[35:56.540 --> 35:57.540]  Take a gold coin
[35:57.540 --> 35:59.540]  I don't know, I'm not sure
[35:59.540 --> 36:00.540]  Exchange for a dollar
[36:00.540 --> 36:02.540]  Are you going to be barbecuing and celebrating?
[36:02.540 --> 36:04.540]  Yeah, with my buddies
[36:04.540 --> 36:06.540]  But you don't know what you're celebrating about
[36:06.540 --> 36:08.540]  No
[36:08.540 --> 36:09.540]  It's fun to be ignorant
[36:09.540 --> 36:10.540]  I don't even know
[36:10.540 --> 36:11.540]  Don't even know
[36:11.540 --> 36:12.540]  No
[36:12.540 --> 36:14.540]  I don't know what Memorial Day is, man
[36:14.540 --> 36:17.540]  It's the big holiday, it's like the kick off to summer
[36:17.540 --> 36:20.540]  When you barbeque and get drunk and stuff
[36:20.540 --> 36:22.540]  I don't think people from Chicago celebrate that thing, man
[36:22.540 --> 36:24.540]  They don't celebrate Memorial Day?
[36:24.540 --> 36:26.540]  No, they're all ruthless, dude
[36:26.540 --> 36:28.540]  Yeah, it's ruthless to be an idiot
[36:28.540 --> 36:29.540]  Yeah, I think so
[36:29.540 --> 36:30.540]  Soft-centered punk
[36:30.540 --> 36:31.540]  Definitely, man
[36:31.540 --> 36:32.540]  You know what I'm talking about, right?
[36:32.540 --> 36:33.540]  No
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.540]  You don't know what Memorial Day is?
[36:34.540 --> 36:35.540]  No, I'm pretty drunk
[36:35.540 --> 36:37.540]  The only way I know it's memorial is because I don't have work
[36:37.540 --> 36:39.540]  And that's all I care about, dude
[36:39.540 --> 36:41.540]  So you don't care about anything else?
[36:41.540 --> 36:42.540]  No
[36:42.540 --> 36:43.540]  Just not working on Memorial Day?
[36:43.540 --> 36:44.540]  Exactly
[36:44.540 --> 36:48.540]  Nothing else matters that the reason for the day
[36:48.540 --> 36:49.540]  No
[36:49.540 --> 36:51.540]  All the...
[36:51.540 --> 36:52.540]  No
[36:52.540 --> 36:53.540]  You don't even know what it means, dude?
[36:53.540 --> 36:54.540]  I really don't care, yeah
[36:54.540 --> 36:55.540]  You don't care at all?
[36:55.540 --> 36:56.540]  I'm going to go over there
[36:56.540 --> 36:57.540]  Okay, zombie
[36:57.540 --> 37:00.540]  Memorial Day weekend, the day when we kind of
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.540]  Oh, that's enough
[37:01.540 --> 37:02.540]  I have a birthday
[37:02.540 --> 37:03.540]  It goes on and on
[37:03.540 --> 37:05.540]  I want to go to Mark Deist, media analyst, author
[37:05.540 --> 37:11.540]  Mark, I haven't talked to you since a few weeks ago
[37:11.540 --> 37:13.540]  But I would guess it's like all your other videos
[37:13.540 --> 37:15.540]  You really show what you found
[37:15.540 --> 37:17.540]  You didn't go edit this, correct?
[37:17.540 --> 37:19.540]  Because you say that's your policy
[37:19.540 --> 37:20.540]  Or am I wrong?
[37:20.540 --> 37:23.540]  I mean, how shocking is this that they tell you
[37:23.540 --> 37:26.540]  I am proud that I only care about myself
[37:26.540 --> 37:29.540]  Don't they know that then no one's going to care about them?
[37:29.540 --> 37:31.540]  No one's going to come to their aid
[37:31.540 --> 37:34.540]  There's no humanity, no camaraderie
[37:34.540 --> 37:39.540]  No fealty, no kinship
[37:39.540 --> 37:42.540]  These people are not alive
[37:42.540 --> 37:44.540]  And the New World Order is already killing them
[37:44.540 --> 37:47.540]  And no one's going to care about them
[37:47.540 --> 37:50.540]  As they're dying from the hydrofluorosolic acid
[37:50.540 --> 37:52.540]  This video's seven minutes long
[37:52.540 --> 37:54.540]  It could have been 13 minutes long
[37:54.540 --> 37:56.540]  I had to leave a lot of people out
[37:56.540 --> 37:58.540]  Because it just gets redundant
[37:58.540 --> 38:00.540]  Even at seven minutes it's too long
[38:00.540 --> 38:02.540]  But what's even worse than them not knowing
[38:02.540 --> 38:04.540]  Is them not caring
[38:04.540 --> 38:08.540]  You can just see the absolute shameful selfishness
[38:08.540 --> 38:13.540]  That these ignorant, illuminati brainwashed buffoons
[38:13.540 --> 38:17.540]  Have become victims of, essentially
[38:17.540 --> 38:19.540]  And I'm glad that I got to work with your crew a few weeks ago
[38:19.540 --> 38:21.540]  They came out to Oceanside
[38:21.540 --> 38:23.540]  We shot a petition video
[38:23.540 --> 38:25.540]  And I showed them
[38:25.540 --> 38:27.540]  And I'm glad that they got to see it for their own eyes
[38:27.540 --> 38:30.540]  That these videos can be shot in minutes
[38:30.540 --> 38:32.540]  I mean it takes me longer to find a parking spot
[38:32.540 --> 38:35.540]  And walk to the beach and get my camera set up
[38:35.540 --> 38:38.540]  Than it does to actually shoot these videos
[38:38.540 --> 38:41.540]  And I don't know if this is just Southern California
[38:41.540 --> 38:44.540]  Maybe the zombie plague is sort of focused here
[38:44.540 --> 38:46.540]  But I have a sneaking suspicion
[38:46.540 --> 38:48.540]  Just judging from the comments and the video
[38:48.540 --> 38:49.540]  And the feedback that I get
[38:49.540 --> 38:52.540]  That these kinds of people are all over the country
[38:52.540 --> 38:54.540]  If not the world
[38:54.540 --> 38:57.540]  Mark, what about the lady? I was telling the guys to queue up the part
[38:57.540 --> 38:59.540]  Where the woman in pink
[38:59.540 --> 39:00.540]  Is, you know, you start saying
[39:00.540 --> 39:03.540]  You know, this is a memorial day for the surfers that have died
[39:03.540 --> 39:04.540]  And the woman's like, oh yes
[39:04.540 --> 39:07.540]  I knew some of the surfers in Hawaii
[39:07.540 --> 39:09.540]  And it's just so creepy
[39:09.540 --> 39:11.540]  To make this sport popular
[39:11.540 --> 39:13.540]  Yeah, I insinuated
[39:13.540 --> 39:15.540]  Different reasons for Memorial Day
[39:15.540 --> 39:18.540]  That was to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence
[39:18.540 --> 39:21.540]  And I'm just name dropping people that have nothing to do with it
[39:21.540 --> 39:23.540]  John Wilkes Booth, Jack Lemmon
[39:23.540 --> 39:25.540]  I think I added out the point when I mentioned
[39:25.540 --> 39:27.540]  Jesse Ventura being a founding father
[39:27.540 --> 39:29.540]  And these pictures go
[39:29.540 --> 39:31.540]  It goes right over their heads
[39:31.540 --> 39:33.540]  And some of the people in the feedback
[39:33.540 --> 39:35.540]  And in the emails, the tweets that I've gotten
[39:35.540 --> 39:37.540]  Think that I'm the ignorant one
[39:37.540 --> 39:39.540]  Because they just didn't get it
[39:39.540 --> 39:41.540]  And they thought that I believed that Memorial Day
[39:41.540 --> 39:43.540]  Was to celebrate the surfers
[39:43.540 --> 39:45.540]  Or was to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence
[39:45.540 --> 39:46.540]  Yeah, they don't get satire
[39:46.540 --> 39:48.540]  But expanding on this
[39:48.540 --> 39:50.540]  Whenever you're talking to these people
[39:50.540 --> 39:52.540]  Whenever you're sitting there
[39:52.540 --> 39:54.540]  You say to the one arrogant punk
[39:54.540 --> 39:57.540]  Hey zombie, what did he say when you said zombie to his face?
[39:57.540 --> 39:59.540]  He just walked away like a little coward
[39:59.540 --> 40:01.540]  And this was the kid that just said
[40:01.540 --> 40:03.540]  I just don't care what it's for
[40:03.540 --> 40:05.540]  Nothing matters, I just got the day off man
[40:05.540 --> 40:07.540]  Let's just go and get drunk and party
[40:07.540 --> 40:09.540]  And you've seen some of these videos that I've done over the weeks
[40:09.540 --> 40:12.540]  And each week I try to just push the envelope further
[40:12.540 --> 40:14.540]  And further and further
[40:14.540 --> 40:16.540]  There's only one crazy idea that I had
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.540]  That people wouldn't go along with
[40:18.540 --> 40:20.540]  And a couple people did, it just took too long
[40:20.540 --> 40:22.540]  These videos can be shot in 20 minutes man
[40:22.540 --> 40:26.540]  Society has lost touch with reality so much
[40:26.540 --> 40:28.540]  I don't know if you're aware
[40:28.540 --> 40:31.540]  Animal Planet aired a show over the weekend
[40:31.540 --> 40:33.540]  About mermaids
[40:33.540 --> 40:36.540]  A science fiction, science fantasy mockumentary
[40:36.540 --> 40:38.540]  Titled mermaids a body found
[40:38.540 --> 40:40.540]  And people took to Twitter
[40:40.540 --> 40:42.540]  Countless people took to Twitter
[40:42.540 --> 40:44.540]  And thought that a body of a mermaid was found
[40:44.540 --> 40:48.540]  They just couldn't tell the fake cheesy actors and reenactments
[40:48.540 --> 40:50.540]  On an Animal Planet show
[40:50.540 --> 40:52.540]  About mermaids
[40:52.540 --> 40:54.540]  That's how out of touch
[40:54.540 --> 40:56.540]  You know the reason for this
[40:56.540 --> 40:58.540]  Is because people don't want to know
[40:58.540 --> 41:02.540]  The brain will categorize and prioritize information
[41:02.540 --> 41:04.540]  If you want to remember something
[41:04.540 --> 41:06.540]  Your brain will put a priority on that
[41:06.540 --> 41:08.540]  You meet a beautiful girl
[41:08.540 --> 41:10.540]  Hey oh that's Jennifer
[41:10.540 --> 41:12.540]  I need to remember that
[41:12.540 --> 41:14.540]  So your brain will remember
[41:14.540 --> 41:16.540]  These people don't want to remember
[41:16.540 --> 41:18.540]  When information sits in their short term memory
[41:18.540 --> 41:20.540]  It gets discarded
[41:20.540 --> 41:22.540]  It's a culture of
[41:22.540 --> 41:24.540]  Loving ignorance
[41:24.540 --> 41:26.540]  These celebrity worshipping
[41:26.540 --> 41:28.540]  Absolute scumbags that we see
[41:28.540 --> 41:30.540]  Now parading the whole other issue
[41:30.540 --> 41:32.540]  Posing as Illuminati members themselves
[41:32.540 --> 41:34.540]  Yeah we're going to talk about that coming up
[41:34.540 --> 41:36.540]  We'll put this on screen for infowars.com readers
[41:36.540 --> 41:38.540]  We have your video posted
[41:38.540 --> 41:41.540]  General public believes mermaid mockumentary was real
[41:41.540 --> 41:43.540]  And here's my issue
[41:43.540 --> 41:45.540]  I'm not going to join the global list
[41:45.540 --> 41:47.540]  Of nerve gas and bioweapon these zombies
[41:47.540 --> 41:49.540]  A lot of them are brain damaged from that
[41:49.540 --> 41:51.540]  They've been brought up by the television to be like this
[41:51.540 --> 41:55.540]  But they do not have a right to take my guns
[41:55.540 --> 41:57.540]  And team up with the government to take my money
[41:57.540 --> 41:59.540]  So they can sit around on their fat butts
[41:59.540 --> 42:01.540]  And that's the thing
[42:01.540 --> 42:03.540]  These people are dangerous
[42:03.540 --> 42:05.540]  I mean how many questionnaires have you done
[42:05.540 --> 42:07.540]  Where they say arrest gun owners
[42:07.540 --> 42:09.540]  Put us in FEMA camps
[42:09.540 --> 42:11.540]  All I needed to do for much of the audience
[42:11.540 --> 42:13.540]  May be familiar for those who aren't
[42:13.540 --> 42:15.540]  Can repeal the second amendment
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.540]  Confiscate all guns
[42:17.540 --> 42:19.540]  Door to door using the military
[42:19.540 --> 42:21.540]  Since we have lists of all the registered weapons
[42:21.540 --> 42:23.540]  All I needed to do was mention
[42:23.540 --> 42:25.540]  The key words
[42:25.540 --> 42:27.540]  Will you support Obama and sign our petition
[42:27.540 --> 42:29.540]  That's why you said we want a Nazi takeover
[42:29.540 --> 42:31.540]  Of America, fascism for Obama
[42:31.540 --> 42:33.540]  And what did they say
[42:33.540 --> 42:35.540]  Sounded good it just goes right over their head
[42:35.540 --> 42:37.540]  Anything to support Obama
[42:37.540 --> 42:39.540]  And then the guy goes yeah we want the Nazis
[42:39.540 --> 42:41.540]  To take over and confiscate the guns
[42:41.540 --> 42:43.540]  Tell me buddy I understand
[42:43.540 --> 42:45.540]  You could say we're going to put babies
[42:45.540 --> 42:47.540]  In wood shippers for Obama
[42:47.540 --> 42:49.540]  They'd say sure
[42:49.540 --> 42:51.540]  Mark Dies is our guest
[42:51.540 --> 42:53.540]  And we've gone out in Austin and they're almost as bad
[42:53.540 --> 42:55.540]  If you go to the trendy liberal areas
[42:55.540 --> 42:57.540]  These are not liberals

[45:09.540 --> 45:16.540]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover

[47:20.540 --> 47:28.540]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule

[48:24.540 --> 48:28.540]  The State Department random 200 that was declassified a few years ago
[48:28.540 --> 48:34.540]  Luke Rudowski of We Are Change, one of my most successful proteges
[48:34.540 --> 48:37.540]  Goes around confronting these globalist constantly
[48:37.540 --> 48:43.540]  He was able to get into this event and talk to the former Secretary of State
[48:43.540 --> 48:47.540]  Who has been indicted as a war criminal in many different countries
[48:47.540 --> 48:50.540]  So we're going to talk to Luke Rudowski right now about that
[48:52.540 --> 48:54.540]  I want to bring Luke Rudowski up here
[48:54.540 --> 48:58.540]  Let's play this clip of him, just a short clip, we already played it last hour, the whole thing
[48:58.540 --> 49:03.540]  Confronting Harry Kissinger when he was getting this freedom award, here it is
[49:04.540 --> 49:07.540]  Hi Mr. Kissinger, it's a pleasure, how are you doing?
[49:07.540 --> 49:15.540]  I just wanted to know, what did you mean when you said illegal we do immediately, unconstitutional takes a little longer, the WikiLeaks document
[49:15.540 --> 49:17.540]  What did you mean by that?
[49:17.540 --> 49:19.540]  Okay, come on
[49:19.540 --> 49:21.540]  No, no, no, I mean it came out, WikiLeaks
[49:21.540 --> 49:23.540]  Yeah, I mean there's a lot of stuff on it, isn't there?
[49:23.540 --> 49:25.540]  Do you know the agenda of the Bilderberg?
[49:25.540 --> 49:27.540]  What are you doing this for?
[49:27.540 --> 49:30.540]  I'm here covering this event, just wanted to talk to you
[49:30.540 --> 49:36.540]  We Are Change, and we want to know maybe what the agenda of the Bilderberg group meeting is going to be in a couple of days, do you know?
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.540]  Come on, get lost, please
[49:38.540 --> 49:44.540]  How does it feel winning the freedom award when you're wanted as a mass murderer
[49:44.540 --> 49:49.540]  And wanted in many countries and butchered millions of people
[49:49.540 --> 49:51.540]  How does it feel?
[49:51.540 --> 49:53.540]  You know it's a lie
[49:53.540 --> 49:56.540]  You self-serving coward, get lost
[49:56.540 --> 49:59.540]  I'm not a coward, you know this freedom award's a lie
[49:59.540 --> 50:01.540]  And you're wanted for mass murder in different countries
[50:01.540 --> 50:03.540]  You know it's a lie
[50:06.540 --> 50:12.540]  Good job Luke, that's wearechange.org and he's with us right now joining us from Washington DC
[50:12.540 --> 50:22.540]  Luke, you know what Henry Kissinger's grave and his coffin are called, they're called the latrine
[50:22.540 --> 50:26.540]  And I love how he calls you a coward when he's a coward
[50:26.540 --> 50:28.540]  He calls you self-serving when he's self-serving
[50:28.540 --> 50:36.540]  This is a known criminal dirtbag that said cut food off the third world to starve and cause wars
[50:36.540 --> 50:41.540]  This is a war criminal, Luke Rudowski, we salute you for what you've done
[50:41.540 --> 50:46.540]  Yeah it seems like he's bringing out his qualities onto me
[50:46.540 --> 50:51.540]  Last, the other time I confronted him, he called me a sick person and that I should go to hell
[50:51.540 --> 50:53.540]  Which is pretty interesting coming from that perspective
[50:53.540 --> 50:58.540]  But Kissinger, I think he already knows who I am, we got him a third time
[50:58.540 --> 51:04.540]  We actually made a video detailing every step of the way of how we're actually able to do this on our YouTube channel
[51:04.540 --> 51:07.540]  You just go to youtube.com forward slash wearechange
[51:07.540 --> 51:14.540]  You can see the behind the scenes shenanigans that go on with these people like David Petraeus, David Cobe and Henry Kissinger
[51:14.540 --> 51:21.540]  Making up fake awards so they could kiss each other and pat each other on the back and promote themselves and empower themselves
[51:21.540 --> 51:27.540]  It was pretty much a side show, it's a fake award that they're giving to each other, it just shows how delusional these people are
[51:27.540 --> 51:35.540]  And the award was called the Intrepid Freedom Award, it was given to Henry Kissinger for so-called promoting democracy
[51:35.540 --> 51:38.540]  I mean it just doesn't get any more Aurelian than it is
[51:38.540 --> 51:44.540]  No but that's like Obama being given a peace prize, all it did was totally discredit the peace prize
[51:44.540 --> 51:49.540]  Yeah but this is not even like the peace prize, this is like a made up award that they just paid up
[51:49.540 --> 51:55.540]  And so we were able to go in there, the press relations people were extremely stringent
[51:55.540 --> 52:01.540]  They told us, they were always with us, they were always watching us, they told us no interviews, you can't ask any questions
[52:01.540 --> 52:07.540]  You're just here to take pictures and videos, and that's sad because that just shows you what journalism has become
[52:07.540 --> 52:08.540]  There were other journalists there
[52:08.540 --> 52:15.540]  It's not journalism, you repeat what comes out of Henry Kissinger's proboscis
[52:15.540 --> 52:22.540]  Yeah mainstream media has become public relations for the establishment, for the elite
[52:22.540 --> 52:30.540]  They're not there asking hard legitimate questions, they're not even trying to find a way to actually go around the different rules and security that they set up
[52:30.540 --> 52:39.540]  They're just complying with this advocacy and what we're trying to change here at We Are Change is the whole perspective of how we should act
[52:39.540 --> 52:41.540]  We should act like we are the mainstream media
[52:41.540 --> 52:51.540]  Yeah people shouldn't act sycophantic towards these war criminals and citizen journalism is what scares them
[52:51.540 --> 52:56.540]  And people out there listening will call me up and go, is it alright if I reference one of your articles in my book?
[52:56.540 --> 53:00.540]  And I'm like, number one, that's just referencing, you have a right to do that
[53:00.540 --> 53:06.540]  Or Alex, I want you to help me plan going to city council and asking questions, just do it
[53:06.540 --> 53:11.540]  It's like the Nike slogan, just stop using Chinese sweatshop labor, Foxconn
[53:11.540 --> 53:15.540]  But to be serious, we've got to simply take action
[53:15.540 --> 53:18.540]  Luke, what else do we not see that's going on behind the scenes?
[53:18.540 --> 53:32.540]  I mean what was it like being close to Henry Kissinger because I've heard of smell-o-vision, but I almost like smelled the smell of like a dead animal
[53:32.540 --> 53:40.540]  When looking at Kissinger up close and he looked also like he was in like a meatloaf that had been left outside for a week
[53:40.540 --> 53:51.540]  I mean he reeked of failure and of like the maw of hell's tongue lapping out to embrace him in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno
[53:51.540 --> 53:55.540]  Someone said on YouTube that he looks like Mr. Potato Head
[53:55.540 --> 54:00.540]  And I do have to say there is a very good comparison if you put up the two pictures next to each other
[54:00.540 --> 54:03.540]  It's super Mr. Mass Murdered
[54:03.540 --> 54:04.540]  I'm sorry
[54:04.540 --> 54:10.540]  It was definitely surreal because everybody was just kissing up to him, everybody was just saying how great of a person he was
[54:10.540 --> 54:15.540]  You know when I walked up to him everybody was afraid even to just come up and talk to him
[54:15.540 --> 54:22.540]  He had food all over his shirt, he couldn't even eat right which is pretty telling
[54:22.540 --> 54:26.540]  He's a degenerate slob literally going to hell, sorry
[54:26.540 --> 54:31.540]  Yeah, I mean what was really interesting is the amount of control the press relations people really had
[54:31.540 --> 54:34.540]  I mean it was just sickening being there
[54:34.540 --> 54:38.540]  But at the end of the day they didn't have control because you just ran their blockade and got the question in
[54:38.540 --> 54:42.540]  Exactly, and if there's a will there's a way and that's what I want to tell people out there
[54:42.540 --> 54:45.540]  You know don't ask for permission, just go out there, go do it
[54:45.540 --> 54:51.540]  What I'm working on right now is talking to certain individuals and I'm trying to teach them every aspect of journalism
[54:51.540 --> 54:53.540]  Every aspect of covering these events
[54:53.540 --> 54:58.540]  And I'm trying to prop up as many individual people as I can and if people want to get involved
[54:58.540 --> 55:02.540]  I'm also going to be traveling through Europe, if we could build up some journalists there that would be amazing
[55:02.540 --> 55:06.540]  But people could hit me up on my Twitter, just Luke at We Are Change on Twitter
[55:06.540 --> 55:10.540]  And then I want to get in contact with as many individuals as I can
[55:10.540 --> 55:16.540]  So I could actually sit down one on one with them, teach them how to be the change that they want to see in this world
[55:16.540 --> 55:20.540]  Teach them how to do real journalism and prop them up and push them up
[55:20.540 --> 55:24.540]  And hopefully there won't be just two or three people asking hard questions
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.540]  We'll be able to totally take over the mainstream
[55:26.540 --> 55:30.540]  Everywhere these globalists go, we've got to be there confronting them
[55:30.540 --> 55:34.540]  And as the mainstream media rots away and turns into bones like the dinosaurs
[55:34.540 --> 55:38.540]  We are rising and that's why we're at this critical historical juncture
[55:38.540 --> 55:42.540]  Because there is a big dumbed down mass that's getting more divorced from reality
[55:42.540 --> 55:45.540]  But there's also a mass getting more informed every day
[55:45.540 --> 55:48.540]  Take the IRS scandal, all these other scandals
[55:48.540 --> 55:51.540]  Our credibility is just shooting straight up right now
[55:51.540 --> 55:54.540]  Luke, are you seeing the awakening I'm seeing?
[55:54.540 --> 55:56.540]  I definitely am
[55:56.540 --> 56:01.540]  And the potential of anything that could happen is right within our grasp
[56:01.540 --> 56:03.540]  It's right within our hands
[56:03.540 --> 56:06.540]  It's just up to all of us to not be afraid to be who we really are
[56:06.540 --> 56:09.540]  To speak our mind, to stand up and to take action
[56:09.540 --> 56:12.540]  And if we all do that, all at once, there's nothing that could stop it
[56:12.540 --> 56:14.540]  We are already shaming the media
[56:14.540 --> 56:18.540]  We are already becoming the new mainstream media
[56:18.540 --> 56:20.540]  But we have to keep it up, we have to do more
[56:20.540 --> 56:22.540]  We have to have other individuals to step up
[56:22.540 --> 56:27.540]  And by the way, people always think tyrannies are invincible until they finally fall
[56:27.540 --> 56:29.540]  It's not the end of the world
[56:29.540 --> 56:31.540]  This new world order is not destined to take over
[56:31.540 --> 56:35.540]  It can be blocked, it can be postponed, it can be defeated
[56:35.540 --> 56:37.540]  Like Nineveh and its hundred year reprieve
[56:37.540 --> 56:40.540]  We have a job to do this
[56:40.540 --> 56:43.540]  Luke and Mark Dice, we will both talk to you soon
[56:43.540 --> 56:48.540]  And Luke, I'm going to be seeing you at Bilderberg 2013 there in Watford
[56:48.540 --> 56:50.540]  I definitely will be there
[56:50.540 --> 56:54.540]  We're going to be all over Europe, so definitely check out all of our updates
[56:54.540 --> 56:56.540]  We're going to be doing a lot of work
[56:56.540 --> 56:59.540]  Alright, great job Luke, great job Mark Dice
[56:59.540 --> 57:03.540]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break here and start the second hour
[57:03.540 --> 57:06.540]  So kickoff is here in just a few minutes after the news
[57:06.540 --> 57:11.540]  And we're going to return with an in-depth interview with one of the smartest guys I know out there
[57:11.540 --> 57:14.540]  Joel Skousen, the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief
[57:14.540 --> 57:21.540]  Probably heard of his famous uncle, Cleon Skousen, who wrote The Naked Communist and The Naked Capitalist
[57:21.540 --> 57:26.540]  And this interview, I'm really looking forward to this coming up in the next hour on all the scandals
[57:26.540 --> 57:28.540]  Are they real? Are they manufactured?
[57:28.540 --> 57:34.540]  Is the IRS scandal and is the phone tapping scandal of journalists and persecution of whistleblowers
[57:34.540 --> 57:37.540]  Is that a distraction from Benghazi's gate?
[57:37.540 --> 57:45.540]  We'll find out about that and a lot more with Joel Skousen in studio in the second hour, just minutes away
[57:45.540 --> 58:13.540]  I'm Alex Jones
[58:15.540 --> 58:17.540]  All in one filter element
[58:17.540 --> 58:20.540]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates
[58:20.540 --> 58:23.540]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water
[58:23.540 --> 58:29.540]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides
[58:29.540 --> 58:33.540]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine
[58:33.540 --> 58:38.540]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands
[58:38.540 --> 58:41.540]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate
[58:41.540 --> 58:49.540]  Get your Pro Pure with the new Pro One filter today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[58:49.540 --> 58:53.540]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action
[58:53.540 --> 58:55.540]  Tyranny is here
[58:55.540 --> 58:59.540]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[58:59.540 --> 59:01.540]  It really says that the state is God
[59:01.540 --> 59:07.540]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth
[59:07.540 --> 59:13.540]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide
[59:13.540 --> 59:19.540]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state
[59:19.540 --> 59:24.540]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[59:24.540 --> 59:28.540]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship
[59:28.540 --> 59:34.540]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[59:34.540 --> 59:37.540]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[59:37.540 --> 59:39.540]  The police state isn't coming
[59:39.540 --> 59:40.540]  It's here

[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:24.540]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.540]  That sounds like the ravings of a fascist
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.540]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.540]  Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.540]  I'd love to see that
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.540]  In uniform
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:43.540]  I need my living off the evening news
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.540]  Just give me something, something I can use
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.540]  People love it when you lose
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.540]  They love dirty laundry
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:59.540]  Alex Jones is using this so he can be more popular and more people will talk about it
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.540]  Well I could have been an actor but I wound up here
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:08.540]  I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.540]  Come and whisper in my ear
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.540]  Give us dirty laundry
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.540]  Hate speech, now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540]  But can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.540]  And yes, the conspiracy theory about the government having too many bullets is nuts
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.540]  But it's not out of nowhere
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:33.540]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories that seduce Republicans
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:37.540]  It's an internet talk show called Infowars
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:42.540]  Because the bubble headed bleach blonde comes on inside
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.540]  She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.540]  It's interesting when people die
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.540]  Give us dirty laundry
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.540]  In every tragedy the Infowars Alex Jones world thinks they see a conspiracy
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.540]  Monday's devastating record-breaking tornado in Moore, Oklahoma
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.540]  Killed two dozen people and flattened a community
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540]  Just devastating, devastating, right?
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.540]  But now, I'm not kidding
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:14.540]  These same conspiracy theory folks are peddling the idea that the tornado was a conspiracy as well
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.540]  Seriously, the tornado was a conspiracy
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.540]  I've seen these Infowars people on and off
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.540]  And I kind of have been ignoring them doing a good job doing that
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:31.540]  And to me, the Infowars, whatever that show is, has become the Westboro Baptist Church of Journalism
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:37.540]  And I think these people are un-American and unpatriotic and they're hysterics
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.540]  False flag
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:45.540]  And by false flag, he means a cloak and dagger, super extra, double top secret, black ops operation
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:50.540]  That the government carries out in such a way as to make it look like the operation was done by somebody else
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.540]  He means the US government bombed Boston
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.540]  I think it's an overreaction, but also you're making some very serious allegations against the US government
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:06.540]  Organizers of the March Against Monsanto event said that more than 2 million people in 52 countries worldwide
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.540]  Assembled in protest of the dangers of genetically modified foods
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:17.540]  Now you'd think that something that garnered this much support worldwide would be covered in detail in the mainstream media
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.540]  But you'd be wrong
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:26.540]  Admittedly, many local news outlets gave the event a small blurb in the online edition of their papers at 10 o'clock at night on Saturday
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.540]  But there was a virtual blackout of the event in the mainstream media
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:38.540]  Even though this was a huge global event with hundreds if not thousands of protesters marching down the busiest streets in major cities worldwide
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:43.540]  The good news is that even though this march didn't garner much mainstream media coverage
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:49.540]  The event itself grew beyond what even the event organizer was expecting through the power of social media
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:53.540]  When Tammy Kanal created the March Against Monsanto Facebook page three months ago
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.540]  She said she would have considered it a success if even 3,000 people had joined
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.540]  Instead, an incredible number of people responded and turned out to rally
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:09.540]  Showing the power of social networking and the ability of the little guy to mobilize en masse
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.540]  People captured video of the event and uploaded it immediately to YouTube or Ustream
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:18.540]  Anti-Monsanto related hashtags continue to pour over the Twitter feeds
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:24.540]  And the official Facebook page now has 157,000 likes and it's growing
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.540]  This is how ideas and movements are spread in the modern age
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:33.540]  That is why it is so important for us to fight to maintain a free and open internet
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:40.540]  Even corrupt Monsanto execs and their paid off politicians cannot stop the power of the sleeping giant once it awakens
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:47.540]  Now here at Infowars we're going to continue to keep corrupt companies like Monsanto and other biotech giants in check
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:54.540]  So visit Infowars.com slash show for a variety of ways to share any of our anti-GMO stories and more
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:59.540]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and this has been an Infowars Nightly News Alert
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:06.540]  There's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the serious concern for all of us
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:13.540]  Alex Jones has warned you for years to get the most important supply you can for your liberty, freedom and security
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.540]  And that's food
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.540]  We thought the danger was drought or food diverted to our gas tanks
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.540]  Or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance to afford it
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.540]  Or our food being sold to other countries
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.540]  And here's the most effective way you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.540]  Government regulation
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:37.540]  The do-it-yourself public services of many LDS Mormon food storage canneries can no longer be provided
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.540]  This along with the recent private gardening and farming regulations
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.540]  And additional government control of food supplies and resources
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.540]  Says food is the ultimate priority
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:52.540]  e Foods Direct will provide free shipping on all food orders until further notice
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:59.540]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:24.540]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.540]  We're now into hour number three, thank you so much for joining us
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.540]  It is the 20th day of May 2013
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:36.540]  I am your host Alex Jones and we're gonna have Joel Skalzen who's in studio with us on for I think about an hour
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.540]  Special interview tonight, we'll see how long it goes
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.540]  On strategic relocation
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.540]  What does that really mean?
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.540]  Government strategically locates
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.540]  Corporations strategically locate
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:51.540]  I notice in his book, it's the best research I've seen out there in the film we produced
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540]  Strategic relocation that
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.540]  Where he's saying live is where the globalists are moving in many cases
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.540]  But he picks areas alternate to that but still close by
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.540]  And where I live
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:07.540]  Which I separately did my own research and later found he'd also recommended
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.540]  The whole country of Austin
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:12.540]  Is one of the few safer areas in a whole constellation of problems
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.540]  And that's basic mammals trying to pick a place that they think is safe
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.540]  They act like being prepared and being ready is kooky or weird
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.540]  That is an instinct of moronicness
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.540]  Or kind of an anti-instinct they try to drum into you
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.540]  But that's tonight, Nightly News
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.540]  7 o'clock this evening
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.540]  He also just survived, we'll talk about that at the end of the hour
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.540]  A harrowing plane crash they said was one in a million
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.540]  To survive, much less be unscathed
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.540]  Talk about guardian angels, so we're glad to have you here Joel
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.540]  In person and he flew on a commercial aircraft to get here
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:50.540]  He of course is a former Marine Corps, was it Captain or more in the Marines
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.540]  Carrier pilot, naval pilot
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.540]  So interesting individual, we're going to have Joel Skousen
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.540]  To cover the latest developments on the IRS
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.540]  The spying on the reporters
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.540]  And where he thinks that's going politically
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.540]  And is this a chilling effect or are they trying to divert off of Benghazi
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:12.540]  I think they hope that at first, but this is actually capturing people's imagination
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.540]  You know, how do you pray, what is your pro-life
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.540]  They told pro-life groups, you've got to go out and 50% of the time be pro-abortion
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:22.540]  Government can't do that, they can't tell you what your first amendment is
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.540]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.540]  Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540]  That's how the first amendment begins
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.540]  Then it's the freedom of the press, freedom to assemble
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.540]  So that's all the info we're going to be going over on that front
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.540]  And then how that ties into Benghazi
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.540]  And of course Joel Skousen is also the editor in chief
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.540]  Over at worldaffairsbrief.com
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.540]  And I think has some of the most, from my research
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.540]  And I'm obsessed with this stuff folks
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.540]  So I tend to know what I'm talking about a little bit
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.540]  Says some of the best piercing analysis out there
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.540]  And so he joins us to break all this down
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.540]  Joel Skousen, good to have you here with us
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.540]  It's good to be with you Alex
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.540]  I really, you know when we talk about news
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.540]  We've got a lot of facts out there
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.540]  But it is the analysis that makes your stuff valuable
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.540]  That makes my stuff valuable
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.540]  Because we never get all the news
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.540]  This is a conspiracy of omission
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.540]  Of what's true and what's false
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.540]  You just have a lot of stuff missing
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.540]  So let's toss the puzzle back together
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:21.540]  You've had a couple weeks now to ruminate
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.540]  You've got a new report out at worldaffairsbrief.com right now
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.540]  You've had some time to sit back and look at Benghazi
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540]  You were on right after it happened
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.540]  Your analysis has turned out to be dead on
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.540]  Same analysis basically of Colonel Shaffer
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.540]  Same analysis of some of our other guests
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.540]  I want to recap that coming up
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.540]  But looking at IRSgate, looking at Spygate
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.540]  Looking at Intimidationgate
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.540]  What's really going on here?
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.540]  First of all it's important to remember
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.540]  I was reviewing just this morning
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.540]  The church committee hearings
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.540]  About the CIA
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.540]  Where a lot was revealed about the CIA
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.540]  And in that Walter Mondale came out and said directly
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.540]  Now we've got evidence here
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.540]  That the IRS has been targeting individuals
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.540]  That the government views as hostile to their point of view
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.540]  And that they're subjecting them to yearly audits
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540]  One after another
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.540]  Now he didn't specify who they are
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.540]  But I happen to know
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.540]  When I was chairman of the conservative national committee
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.540]  I talked to Bunker Hunt
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540]  And I talked to a lot of the other funders
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.540]  Of various conservative and Christian points
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.540]  And they were all being audited every year
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540]  We now know that that was targeted
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.540]  That was clear back in the 80s
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540]  When that was going on
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.540]  It's still going on
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.540]  So now we have a cover-up
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.540]  About the fact that this has been going on
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.540]  The press isn't focusing on that
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.540]  What they're focusing on is the fact that the president fired somebody
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.540]  Who was in fact going to resign
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.540]  And was going to in fact be leaving
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.540]  Steve Miller, the acting IRS chief
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.540]  Had nothing to do with this
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540]  So a total cynical fraud
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]  A total cynical fraud
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]  But it's even worse
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.540]  You have Joseph Grant
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:00.540]  Who was just put in the place of Susan Ingram
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.540]  Who was in fact in charge of this division
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.540]  Over tax exempt groups
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.540]  He was just put in to replace her
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.540]  A graduate stepped up
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.540]  And he had to step down as a second one
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.540]  Because it wasn't enough to fire Steve Hall
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.540]  And Susan Hall Ingram now
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.540]  Is in charge of the IRS tax policy
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540]  For Obamacare
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.540]  Of sticking it to those of us
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.540]  Who don't have insurance by choice
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.540]  Because we don't like the medical establishment system
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.540]  And now the woman that ordered all this illegal spying and harassment
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.540]  She's the head of the Obamacare division
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:36.540]  With our records
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:40.540]  I mean it's clear they plan to use the IRS as their Gestapo
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.540]  That's right
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.540]  And Lois Lerner who's the actual on-hands
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.540]  In daily charge of the division
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.540]  Was not fired
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.540]  And Steve certainly has to know about this
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.540]  But it goes beyond as I say the Obamacare
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]  So that brings up the case
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:55.540]  It goes beyond the IRS
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.540]  Currently it goes beyond the Obama administration
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.540]  It was going on during the Bush administration
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.540]  The Clinton administration
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.540]  And clear back on
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.540]  Even during the Reagan administration
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:04.540]  The IRS was targeting people
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.540]  We have a runaway dark side of government
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.540]  We have legitimate CIA and dark side CIA
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.540]  We have legitimate FBI and dark side CIA
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.540]  And in the IRS
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.540]  We have legitimate honest people doing IRS work
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.540]  And we have dark side IRS
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.540]  And they aren't allowed to know what the other is doing
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.540]  Via compartmentalization
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]  Exactly
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.540]  And so I don't expect to see any change
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.540]  There's going to be some you know congressional investigations
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.540]  As in Benghazi
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.540]  They're not going to go after the real problem
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540]  Which is who gave
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.540]  I mean look at the treasury inspector general
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540]  Comes out with a report
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.540]  That this was a managerial problem
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.540]  That somehow these magically appeared
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.540]  These criteria which were incorrect
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.540]  And they ended up targeting magically
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.540]  Without any human intervention
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.540]  Some 500 conservative groups
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.540]  Well I've even seen
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.540]  Rachel Maddow and people say
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.540]  We need to go after these groups
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.540]  Look at their tax exemption
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.540]  Media Matters put a memo out three years ago
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.540]  Saying we're going to infiltrate media groups
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.540]  And destroy them
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.540]  That's why it's encouraging
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540]  The head of the RNC said
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.540]  Obama is running a guerrilla war
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.540]  He said this over the weekend on Fox
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.540]  Against conservatives
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]  That's absolutely true
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540]  It is a guerrilla war
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.540]  They deny what they're doing
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.540]  While they do it
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.540]  Of course they ordered it
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540]  From fast and furious to this
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.540]  Well in the Cincinnati
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.540]  IRS person said anonymously
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.540]  Without giving his name
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.540]  That everything that we do at the IRS
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.540]  Comes down from the very top
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.540]  Well of course it does
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.540]  Yes
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.540]  It's just like the DEA
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.540]  When they cover up for
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.540]  Drugs that are imported from Mexico
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.540]  And they refuse to let
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.540]  The snooping dogs go in
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]  After trucks that are sealed in Mexico
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.540]  They say orders come from Washington
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.540]  So that's what happens
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.540]  But the Treasury was covering up for this today
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.540]  On their IRS investigation
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.540]  They said
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]  We interviewed every official
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.540]  We could talk to
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.540]  And they assured us
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.540]  That no one outside of the IRS
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.540]  Had any influence on this tax policy
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.540]  But that's not the issue
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.540]  Alex
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.540]  About who outside the IRS
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.540]  They're assuming
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540]  That if it's political interference
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.540]  With the IRS
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540]  It has to be from some
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.540]  Politician outside the agency
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.540]  This has been going on
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.540]  From within the agency
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.540]  For decades
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.540]  Well I know for a fact
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.540]  That they use food trucks
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540]  With packaged food
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540]  Out of Mexico
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.540]  With the cocaine
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540]  Hidden in it
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540]  And one time
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540]  The state police stopped
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.540]  The truck
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.540]  Found three tons of cocaine
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.540]  And were ordered
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.540]  To turn it over
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.540]  And then they deliver it
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.540]  And then it's brought in
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.540]  To a major grocery store chain
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.540]  And distributed it out
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.540]  And it's just well known
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.540]  And then the cops
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.540]  Want to pull me over
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.540]  Because I have drugs in my car
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.540]  I mean this is ridiculous
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.540]  Yeah
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.540]  So there is a dark side
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.540]  Of every portion of government
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.540]  In terms of enforcement
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.540]  And it's starting to get out
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540]  More and more
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.540]  But when it gets out
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540]  And this is what we're seeing
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.540]  It's going to be the big thing
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.540]  We're going to have to discuss
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.540]  Is whether or not
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.540]  They're going to take down
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540]  Obama over these things
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.540]  Because there's four major
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.540]  Scandals now
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.540]  That have piled up
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.540]  That's what I want to ask you
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.540]  Why did the scandals come out now
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.540]  From your intel
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540]  And your analysis
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.540]  What does this signify
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.540]  And where is it going
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.540]  It is hard to tell
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.540]  In the AP scandal for example
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.540]  Of the news
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.540]  I know how this happened
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.540]  Now I want to be very very clear
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.540]  With your listeners
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.540]  That the government surveils
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.540]  Every form of communication
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.540]  They don't listen to it all
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.540]  They record it all
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.540]  They record it all
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540]  It's all digitally recorded
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540]  And then they go back
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.540]  When they want to
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.540]  That's right
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:20.540]  They go back
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540]  Actually they're sifting
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540]  They have computers
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540]  Going through sifting
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.540]  And picking out keywords
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.540]  And compartmentalizing
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540]  They have basic compartments
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.540]  For enemies
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.540]  They have compartments
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.540]  For allies
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]  They spy on Israel
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540]  They spy on France
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.540]  They spy on Britain
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.540]  They don't like to say that
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.540]  But they do that
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.540]  And those allies
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540]  To a certain extent
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540]  Spy on us as well
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.540]  But they also have compartments
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.540]  For dissidents
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.540]  And those are divided
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.540]  Into right and left

[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.540]  Are people like you and I
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540]  And followers who believe
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.540]  In the constitution
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]  Those are considered
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.540]  Future domestic enemies
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.540]  And they've now bled over
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.540]  And admitted their
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.540]  Total obsession
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.540]  Is on us

[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.580]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance

[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:58.820]  to get into the other scandals, Benghazi, IRS, all of it. And you know, I guess Joel
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:03.460]  hasn't said what he thinks yet. He says he's not sure, but I agree with him that they're
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:07.820]  certainly going to use these leaks coming out because they're now saying it to, you
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.820]  know what?
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:14.300]  Let's just get rid of warrants, period. We're trying to keep you safe. But you read Glenn
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.420]  Greenwald and the London Guardian and others, they're pointing out that people they're arresting
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:26.140]  like Stephen Kim talked to the Fox News chief, Washington bureau chief, just publicly. He
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:29.980]  went there, talked to him. Hey, you're the State Department person on this. What do you
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.260]  think Kim Jong-un might detonate more nukes to threaten people as underground tests?
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.620]  Yeah, we don't have any proof of that, but that's kind of what we think. Well, you're
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.620]  arrested. And then now they're saying that, well, I tell you what, we might go after the
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:50.660]  Fox reporter for this. I mean, this is really just the brazen criminality of these people
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.860]  now where they're saying, look, you don't even criticize anything or we'll come after
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:55.860]  you.
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:59.340]  But look at this, the impeachment option, Representative Jason Chaffetz, does anybody
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:05.740]  pronounce it? Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, says President Barack Obama may face impeachment
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:10.100]  over his administration's response to the Benghazi attack. Yeah, they've been caught
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:15.180]  lying there and the situation rooms all saw the drones, all saw the stand down.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:20.620]  They know that, NATO knows that, and so that's what they're really scared of. But Joel, getting
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.580]  back now to what you've been trying to say in that last short segment, you were talking
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:28.740]  about how they're gonna try to pass stuff on the back of this. You've got the floor,
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:34.460]  get into the IRS stuff, the AP stuff, where you think it's going and then finally, Benghazi
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:39.780]  and where you think the new world order is right now and what good people in government
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:45.220]  but just in the general public can do to really push these people back.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.500]  Well, my two examples that I started out with were torture and the surveillance, domestic
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.320]  surveillance got caught up in terrorism. And they were admitted, the government through
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.940]  the leaks that I think they caused, admitted both that they were doing torture, even though
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:03.320]  they tried to downplay it as something and that they were surveilling in a limited way
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.500]  that was going beyond the law.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.300]  And they tried to justify with Congress so that they had predictable hacks in Congress
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:15.540]  to introduce immediately legislation allowing this expansion of torture, expansion of enhanced
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:23.260]  interrogation. And so there was this scenario where the government is using purposeful leaks,
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.660]  and I don't believe the government ever allows any leaks that they don't want out because
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:27.780]  they surveil everything.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:30.860]  They can find out anything, they don't need to go to court to ever find out who a reporter's
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:36.180]  sources are, they surveil everything. But this appears, my first impression is that
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:41.000]  both the IRS leak is an inadvertent leak. And the reason I say that it's been going
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  on for decades.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.700]  I agree with you, so you agree with me then? Yes, but the reason that I feel that is that
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:53.340]  Obama came out and the scriptwriters wrote in, but we must give the due respect to the
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:57.340]  IRS. I know they're very powerful, but we must not limit their power. In other words,
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:02.020]  he's trying to forestall anything in Congress that would limit the power of the IRS.
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:07.860]  That means they're trying to protect the IRS, not expand its authority, don't do anything
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:15.860]  to stop. So I think that was inadvertent. I think the AP was inadvertent because it didn't
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:23.300]  appear to come from a direct government source. And it's not something I don't think they
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300]  can expand.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.000]  That is, they cannot expand and say, well, the press isn't gonna have the same rights
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.460]  that they are.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.820]  What does the phenomenon mean, though? Because I've argued with you, well, not really argue,
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.740]  but talk to you about this. When you're saying, look, a lot of these leaks are fake or there's
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:40.420]  no way these people have real sources. I'm finding government people are mad and don't
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420]  care anymore.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.100]  And we're getting to the point where they're just willing to leak stuff. And okay, go
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:47.360]  ahead and put me in jail for exposing you're a dirty crook.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.580]  The problem with this is that after the AP leak, the AP reporter said universally, nobody
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:55.180]  wants to talk to us anymore. So it is shutting down whistleblower, and that may be-
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.180]  Chilling effect.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:00.740]  It's a chilling effect. Nobody dares talk to you because everybody realizes, every whistleblower
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.780]  now realizes that the press is being bugged. Now, we knew it before.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:10.820]  You know what the answer is, mail it to people. Mail it to infowars.com, mail it to Drudge,
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.780]  get a other address or no address or whatever, and then get it to people.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.900]  Isn't this interesting? I tell my clients to, if they're worried about privacy. Look,
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:23.900]  everything you tell me in a conversation about your consultation is gonna be recorded. Everything
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:27.540]  is going to be talked about. Either you gotta fly me out there to talk about your private
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.660]  situation, or you gotta mail it to me.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:35.340]  Isn't that ironic that the snail mail is now the safest? Because it requires a human being
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.700]  to intervene in every letter that they open.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.000]  And they've got the private offices at all the places where they take it, but still they're
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.180]  lazy and won't do it. And they don't know what to do with the intelligence. So the answer
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.180]  is go back to snail mail.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:49.740]  But if you go to snail mail and you introduce and you open it up, you've got to photocopy,
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.780]  you've got to scan it. I mean, it's a tremendous costly process. And the government's under
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:58.540]  sequester. Even the CIA, who has black budget type of thing, doesn't want to put a lot of
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]  money in.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:04.100]  Well, how does France communicate with itself? It has the pneumatic tubes. That's the right
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.500]  term, the pressure tubes. And that's under their sewers, how the government sends its
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.180]  info knowing that's gonna be hard to scan with satellite.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:16.500]  No, that's right. And it's physical. I mean, anything digital just isn't safe anymore.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.260]  That doesn't mean that you shouldn't. You shouldn't stop all communication.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:24.260]  Yeah, well, then they say, well, what do you have to hide? Well, why is government so secret?
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.900]  Because you're a criminal government that wants to use, who I've really been told by
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.780]  high level sources they spy on is inventors and people.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.860]  I mean, the poor folks get everything stolen. I mean, and American companies, why are they
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:39.100]  trying to shut down American companies? They do everything they can.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:43.980]  That's a hard question, Alex. I think they want us dependent on China more. They wanna
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:50.100]  drive people overseas. They want us so that when this, and my theory is that they're setting
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.140]  us up for eventual nuclear war.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.340]  That's when the real curtain comes down. They can justify anything at that time. They wanna
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.260]  make sure that we don't have any ability to respond to the war so they can say you've
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.980]  got to go to a militarized new world order.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:08.140]  It's globally that we've got to fight this next war. We don't wanna have America rejuvenated
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.140]  as if-
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:14.100]  Exactly, I wanna get to Benghazi with you. But the army has come out and said we don't
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:18.620]  need the president for authorization to quell civil disturbances. Is that so they can start
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:22.980]  doing it routinely like they already are and not have it be a big presidential deal?
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:27.060]  But then there's the issue of, they're already saying the military is under NATO. Is this
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:33.100]  like some type of weird, quasi-announcement of a military industrial complex, pure coup?
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:34.780]  Or what do you think's behind that?
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:40.740]  NATO is to become the militarized order of the global globalist. And that's why everything
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.820]  from Eisenhower on was to get France, DeKalb didn't wanna be part of NATO, didn't wanna
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:50.860]  supply troops, to twist his arm to get Adenauer to reform the German troops and things.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:55.900]  But it was because NATO is gonna be the military arm of the new world order. And they are gonna
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:00.160]  cut off the communist nations that are part of the United Nations, reform, call it the
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.920]  League of Democracies or some more innocuous name. So to get American support after they've
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.220]  been nuked or after various military cities have been nuked. I do not believe that the
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.940]  Russians and Chinese are gonna nuke everything in the United States. They don't wanna be
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.820]  looked as the bully of the world. They're taking down the bully of the world, but they
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.820]  want blackmail.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:22.920]  All right, folks, we'll be back with more of this very serious interview with Joel Scowles
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.940]  in the World Affairs Brief. But first off, I wanna tell you something that's incredibly
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:33.020]  original and true. And I also have a bridge to sell you. And I also have some oceanfront

[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.060]  the term, don't touch that dial. We'll be right back after these important messages.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.800]  And if you believe that, you believe Obama and Eric Holder and big sis did not run fast
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.940]  and furious to blame the Second Amendment. And you also believe that they did not send
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:57.580]  the IRS to persecute the Tea Party. Okay, so I invented the term. I coined it. Don't
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.700]  touch that dial. We'll be back.

[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:05.340]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:09.980]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:14.220]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:19.620]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.940]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:30.480]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:11.060]  Mystic Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:18.900]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation. It's me, Alex Jones, right
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:24.260]  here broadcasting on Sunday and playing some of the most powerful excerpts of the broadcast
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:32.380]  last few weeks. Here is more of Joel Skalzen on what's really going on on our planet. But
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.340]  I mean, are the Chinese gonna really be manipulated into that, the Russians?
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:42.940]  Well they want to take down. You see, they've always had this philosophy that we are superior
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.820]  to the West. We're going to have to take them down a little bit. They don't want to destroy
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:50.580]  the West. They know the West is the engine of ingenuity. They depend on that for all
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:55.460]  their military, but they want to control it, not just have to spy on it. That's why they
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.360]  want to nuke the military of the US.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.660]  The US wants its own military nuke because it drives Americans into accepting a new world
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.380]  order, a militarized new world order. But the Russians and Chinese don't want to destroy
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.620]  either Europe or America totally. They want to decapitate the military. They want to take
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:17.380]  down the US socially with an EMP strike, which will happen about 20 minutes before the actual
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:22.580]  nuclear strike on American military targets and communication targets.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:28.740]  And then they'll issue a blackmail notice, give up. And everyone will be acceptable to
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:33.200]  that, literally, in the sense that, what is there now that the military? But our leaders
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.540]  will come out of their bunkers and say, no, no, the Russians and Chinese deceived us.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:42.900]  And finally, they'll have the gumption to say, we need to fight. And everything the
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:47.060]  US puts out about China now is pacifistic. No, it's not a problem.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:51.180]  And they know that everybody will line up, and then the secret weapons roll out. And
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:56.220]  it's the real deal, and we take over the world. But now it's a fascist Anglo-American eugenics-based
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:35:01.100]  new world order. That's right. And all of this is leading up that we're talking about.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.580]  We're seeing the preparation for martial law. We're seeing the preparation for camps that
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.580]  are being established.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.260]  And for 20-year wars, I mean, they're long hauling.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:14.020]  That's right. Seed bunkers, underground bases. But I am resisting the call that this is imminent
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:19.180]  because they're very smart that we're dealing with. This is preparatory. And when it is
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:23.540]  unleashed, they've got to have a proper excuse, or they convince the whole world that the
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.300]  government is tyrannical.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:30.620]  But if they do it under the cover of war after this nuclear weapon strike comes, then nobody
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:35.540]  questions martial law. Nobody questions any of this. Just like in Boston, the people laid
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:40.020]  down and let people strip them of their rights, take them out of the house, and throw them
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.020]  to the ground without any-
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:44.660]  Sure, you know it came out in the 60s that the Russians wanted to nuke China with the
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:49.340]  US. And then the US said no, because it already really made a deal with the Communist Chinese,
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.060]  kind of like helping put Mao in power.
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:56.220]  I mean, it seems like the globalists have kind of got a double game, though. I mean,
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.520]  they're moving to China, they're investing there, they're doing everything they can.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.980]  But is that really to trick them? Cuz they're just giving America to the Chinese.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:10.660]  Well, a lot of people, there is this conflict within theoretical how globalism operates.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:14.100]  One side says, because of the Rowan Gaither quotes to Norman Dodd that we're trying to
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:20.300]  seamlessly join the US with the American Republic, is that the globalists control the Russians
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.300]  and the Chinese, and therefore-
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.700]  Sure, that's the Carnegie plan.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:26.100]  Yeah, there's not gonna be war, but it's not true. In fact, Rowan Gaither was lying to
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:30.080]  Norman Dodd. He never would have admitted the real thing. This was a cover excuse to
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.740]  explain to them in some rational way. In fact, Rowan Gaither of the Ford Foundation had invited
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.780]  the investigator to come and get an interview.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.080]  That's right, Ford Foundation.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:44.020]  It wasn't that he was responding to a subpoena. He invited him to come and give him the propaganda
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.340]  that we're trying to peacefully merge the two countries. But in fact, the globalists
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:53.700]  don't control the Russians. They're trying to induce them by giving them aid, giving
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:57.140]  them trade, and the Russians and Chinese are skittish.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.700]  They're deathly afraid that we've got secret weapons systems they don't now know about
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:01.700]  and they're afraid to-
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:04.700]  Well, I've talked to Bob Bowman and many others, they can talk about what's been accidentally
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:10.340]  leaked in debates and things. They had the Star Wars program in the 70s and Shabo drones
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:13.420]  in orbit and just everything else. I mean, it's-
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:17.260]  That's right, and that's why the Chinese are really working on anti-satellite.
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:18.980]  That's right, that's their main program.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:22.980]  They're still eight to ten years out about having the confidence to strike the West and
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:27.380]  that's why I don't think it's imminent. But they don't control the Chinese. They're gonna
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.620]  make a deal with the Chinese, in my opinion, when the Russians and Chinese in a temporary
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:37.020]  alliance strike the West. And when we start this new world order war, this great new patriotic
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.660]  war that they'll try to get in one enthusiastic about prosecuting, then I think they'll make
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:46.000]  a deal with China to attack Russia's rear.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.860]  Just as China and Russia, or China, I'm sorry, Russia and Hitler went after one another.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:57.140]  And we used Russia knowing that they would be a predator and gave them aid and trade,
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:01.420]  I think will lure China in with that same thing. And the globalists want that because
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:05.580]  you see after the war, instead of like World War II where they gave sovereignty back to
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.540]  the US and all the countries wanted to be independent again, they'll have this great
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:15.020]  new enemy, China, that they built up and say, now we can't disband the military new world
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:18.140]  order army because we've got this great threat.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:22.060]  And so that's why I think the one thing that will be different in World War III is we won't
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.060]  get sovereignty.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.520]  And they're enticing the Chinese, not just all the deep water ports in the Caribbean
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.420]  and the West Coast and the East Coast and not just the big Mexican ports, but they're
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:37.540]  giving them just the entire infrastructure. I saw a number 98% of rare earth minerals,
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:39.620]  it was like 90% five years ago.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.400]  They're just enticing, just come, come, just to ever, here, have it all. And I always look
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.420]  at it as just a globalist hatred of America, hatred of Christians, really the spirit of
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.460]  evil that animates them. And I'd warn the globalist, the Anglo Americans, I don't think
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:56.980]  you're gonna get away with this.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.060]  I don't think it's gonna turn out the way they think, cuz they've got all these thousands
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:05.340]  of bio labs just randomly splicing genetics. I don't think they're in control like they
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.740]  think they are. I think there's gonna be catastrophes they don't even control.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:12.780]  There will be a loss of control once this nuclear war starts, probably for at least
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:18.580]  a year and a half, maybe two years. That's the time for America to reform in the liberty
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:22.780]  movement. And that's why strategic relocation is so important because you can't do it like
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:23.780]  we're now.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.660]  We've spread out all over the United States. Everybody's alone, everybody feels alone.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:33.780]  Somehow, and I think it's through the instrumentality of war, the Lord is gonna drive people together,
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:38.140]  drive people out of the big cities. It won't mean a job to keep you there anymore, no excuse
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.100]  not to relocate.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:44.020]  Just that if you didn't do it prior to that, you're gonna be out on the roads with masses
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.900]  of people like in Germany fleeing from the Russians. That's not what you're-
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:50.380]  And by the way, they say it's kooky to get ready and geared up. All government's doing
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.020]  is gearing up, acting like it's the end of the world.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.860]  It's underground bunkers. This is not against terror that they're preparing. They know there's
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.860]  a nuclear war.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.820]  And they know when they emerge, their enemy's gonna be the liberty movement. They're preparing
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.700]  the giant cadres, no longer secret armies for war with us.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.060]  That's right. And I think-
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:09.060]  And they're not gonna, and of course, not gonna make a deal with us to stop this cuz
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.060]  they hate us.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:14.060]  Yeah, that's right. There's no deal to make. They know that this is gonna be an absolute
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:17.660]  separation between good and evil. Well, I take it back. There's an awful lot of dumbed
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:21.900]  down people who will be dumbed down because of the false patriotism of this war.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.060]  They won't realize this is a global-
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.580]  Well, they'll be cannon fodder.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.120]  They'll be cannon fodder and they'll join the military. And that's why I don't recommend
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.640]  any more of our boys and girls go into the military. Not only because of the deadly vaccines
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.800]  that you're required to take, but because you're not fighting to save America's liberties.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.960]  Even though they tell you that, you're not fighting for democracy in Syria or Iran. You're
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.980]  fighting for a globalist agenda that the US government is-
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.380]  Well, that was my next question. I wanna get into Benghazi. Joel Scouser's our guest. Isn't
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:54.060]  it an overload point, though, where they're in the Washington Post and the London Telegraph
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:59.940]  going the bin Laden brigade is leading, Al-Qaeda is doing a great job fighting Assad, he's
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:00.940]  got the oil.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:05.620]  And I'm like, and then when you fly, they treat you like you're bin Laden. I mean, how
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:12.100]  do they get away with this otherworldly absurdistness that's now going on where our government runs
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:15.220]  Al-Qaeda publicly? I just-
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:19.620]  Well, we know that government has always had their fingers on Al-Qaeda. They started Al-Qaeda
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:24.400]  essentially as funding it through the Saudis. They've used the Pakistani ISI as well to
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.940]  fund another branch of Al-Qaeda. And even though there's a lot of legitimate terrorists
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:32.820]  who hate the United States that we have bred, as Ron Paul correctly stated, nevertheless,
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.860]  the top levels are directed.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:40.540]  That's why in 9-11, yes, there were terrorists, but they were known to the United States military-
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.540]  Rejected.
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.260]  And they were protected, they were trained, they'd been on CIA bases before.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:49.700]  I talked to the head of the US embassy visa section, they were ordered a lot of men.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:54.180]  That's right, and they got aircraft training and large aircraft in Saudi Arabia. They didn't
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:58.940]  get it at the flying sessions, that was a cover story. So as to shield the Saudis from
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.820]  somebody had to train those people in-
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.940]  And we don't attack Saudi Arabia, we attack Iraq.
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:09.700]  Well, Saudi Arabia, we have this incestuous relationship with Saudi Arabia, we have promised
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:15.100]  them protection. They're a very corrupt regime, they claim to be Islamists, fundamentalists
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:20.900]  with their form of Sharia law there, but they aren't. They're pedophiles, they are-
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.940]  Well, I mean, it's a Wahhabist death cult. And if you expand on that, I guess, why did
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:29.860]  the British choose them? I guess those are the worst of the Muslims?
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:35.340]  Well, it's because they had the biggest oil first, and they made a deal. Basically, yeah,
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:39.820]  you can nationalize it, but you've got to make sure that you supply us, and you use
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.060]  dollars, and they will continue to do so.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:46.380]  Sure, but I mean, and of course, I guess they could use the Wahhabist to take over all of
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:50.980]  the Sunnis, and then use that in a war against the Shiites. It's just all divide and conquer
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:51.980]  crap.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:52.980]  Yeah.

[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.340]  your liberty, freedom and security and that's food. We thought the danger was drought or
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:21.880]  food diverted to our gas tanks or food so expensive that we'd all need financial assistance
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.720]  to afford it or our food being sold to other countries. But here's the most effective way
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.980]  you'll lose your liberty and security without a fight. Government regulation. The do-it-yourself

[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.820]  here at infoawards.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:55.580]  Federal agents, we are armed.
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:01.580]  By the way, this is breaking news at infoawards.com. Adam Kokesh should be charged with assaulting
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:05.940]  a federal officer. So they come up while he's giving a speech, grab him, he puts his hands
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:10.380]  up, slam to the ground and then charge him. Carved before the horse, why were they arresting
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:13.940]  him to begin with? And then how did he assault him, which he clearly didn't. They're gonna
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:17.540]  have trouble making that case, but the video and everything else. Joel, go ahead.
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:21.520]  Yeah, the thing that I observed and he did correctly, he wasn't smoking marijuana. If
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.700]  they were going to arrest anyone, they had to arrest the ones that were violating the
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:30.380]  law of the park and arrest them. He was merely the spokesman. They were clearly going after
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:34.700]  him and took him down. They've got video, I don't think they're gonna be able to make
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:37.180]  this stick if they allow in court.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:40.300]  And that's the big question, whether or not they'll allow any of that evidence to come
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:49.620]  in from the private hands. But I'm not in favor of irritating the government on illegal
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:53.660]  acts and you have to be very careful when you do to appear very, very innocent. You
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:49:00.020]  don't go around calling the police criminals, even if they're in a criminal act. But I think
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.540]  that we need to support the fact that we've got a First Amendment right that has been
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:03.540]  violated here.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:09.740]  I know that's your position, Alex, but I still think Adam needs to be very careful about
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:11.500]  how he approaches these acts.
[01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:16.100]  I agree, even the Washington Post kind of dished a bunch of dirt on him, not real dirt,
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.620]  but saying he's a provocateur. But admit it, well, it looks like his rights were violated.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:23.720]  I mean, even they had to admit that. And people better get, if you don't support other people's
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.380]  rights, you're gonna lose yours. It's so elementary. Now, you were telling me during the break,
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:31.100]  cuz you were in some of the biggest conservative organizations in the country, Joel, about
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.620]  back when you were in Washington in the 80s.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:37.520]  Tell people what happened. I mean, to let people know, we don't say this to scare you.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.680]  We do this to show you how illegal the government is. I mean, how it's been, it's out of control.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.380]  Tell people what happened to you when they get back into this AP thing.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.540]  This happened as chairman of the Conservative National Committee and I had an office in
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:54.080]  Washington DC and I was in communication with several of the liberty groups in El Salvador
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:02.040]  and Guatemala. And there was this young army major, reserve major, who was trying to influence
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.980]  the conservative groups and I didn't trust him.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:11.540]  And so I warned in a telephone call, my compatriots down there in El Salvador that he's coming
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:16.580]  down to visit, but you better not trust him and why I thought so. Within 15 minutes, that
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:22.740]  guy was standing in front of my desk saying, don't you ever talk about me to anyone on
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.740]  the telephone.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:25.580]  He was in your building. He was from the military.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:26.580]  That's right.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.900]  So they were listening right then. He drove right over.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.940]  That's exactly right. So this was echelon. This is a satellite system that's surveilling
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:40.020]  any overseas communications, etc. And of course, this was purely domestic. This was my telephone
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:44.460]  and my rights were violated. They didn't have a warrant. Of course, this happened instantaneously.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:49.140]  You know they didn't go before a judge, but it just told me right then, they surveil everything
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.140]  now.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.500]  Someone came out last week and said they know the cloakroom's bugged. And he's like, is
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:59.860]  that impeachable? Does that rise to the level of impeachment? I mean, it's obviously a violation
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:04.020]  of the fourth, fifth amendment. And it's obviously a violation of the tenth amendment.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:09.140]  It's a violation of the states, the separation of powers. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:15.380]  Yeah, well, the surveillance has gotten much worse even since my experience in 1983 because
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:19.700]  they were just doing telephones and the echelon system was only doing things that were wirelessly
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:23.940]  being transmitted around the world. But now they've got everything digitally. We have
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:32.700]  whistleblowers from the NSA talking about the ISP systems that the FBI has installed
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:38.780]  in every major node in the Internet so that every email, every digital cell phone, telephone
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:40.260]  call is being recorded.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:44.640]  And all your web history, everything and that was all in the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:50.100]  But we were called conspiracy theorists to talk about saying the Statue of Liberty exists.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.540]  I mean, we're talking about known facts. It's like Gibbs was told, say the drone program
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.500]  doesn't exist overseas. And he's like, but it's been public for years. Just say it doesn't
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.660]  exist. And the press played along with that.
[01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:06.100]  And the press better get, folks, if you go along with this purge, it's over. My answer
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:11.660]  is everybody needs to start whistleblowing in a swarm attack, which they're not gonna
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:12.660]  be able to handle.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:17.460]  And we have to remember that the government itself covers all these leaks. In other words,
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:21.780]  there's no way that anybody leaks to the reporters. Many times they have prosecuted people during
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:26.700]  the Cheney Bush administration for trying to get their sources. Well, they know who
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:30.380]  the sources are, but they can't admit that they know who the source is because they know
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.380]  they'd be able.
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:37.100]  So they go to court. They try to get the courts and the courts always lay down and do what
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:42.900]  the government wants. It's very, very interesting. But the leaks about government torture, the
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:47.100]  leaks about government surveillance were done, in my opinion, on purpose back in the Bush-Cheney
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.100]  administration.
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:49.100]  Yeah, to scare everybody.
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:54.100]  Well, not just to scare. What they did is give Congress an excuse to then react to it
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:57.860]  and say, well, we'd better give them some more authority to surveil. In other words,
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:00.260]  we leak a mistake. We say, we've got a-
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.660]  Because they're illegally doing it. How about we just get rid of the law? That's what the
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:08.780]  New York Times said that last week. The answers, just get rid of any of it, yeah. We'll shove
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.460]  a microphone down your throat. Stay there. Let's come back, long segment coming up. You're
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.660]  right, cuz that's exactly what they're saying.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:19.080]  It's like, we committed a murder? We better legalize the murder then. Stay with us. World
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:24.620]  Affairs Brief Editor is in studio with us. He's Joel Skalzen. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:33.260]  Joel, Benghazi, we'll talk more about it tonight on the Nightly News. But I mean, Benghazi,
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:37.100]  what's at the core of that? Well, the core is covering up for the stand down. But let
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:41.860]  me go back to the actual thing. We have an arms trading going on where they had captured
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:45.300]  a lot of arms in the takedown of the Libyan government.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:51.580]  They were funneling those arms to the Syrian Free Army, which is now the hottest, and as
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:57.940]  we know, calls themselves the bin Laden Brigade. Supposedly our enemies, but we're arming them.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:02.860]  And this was top secret. There are competitors, however, who wanted those arms for their own
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:08.240]  purposes in Libya, and they attacked the embassy. I do not believe in the blind, chic thing
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:13.740]  that James Lyon, the admiral who was present there, has been fed as the reason that that
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.740]  was really going down.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:21.780]  The story is that Obama is like an October surprise. Obama's advisors were gonna make
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:26.520]  him popular by having him get involved in getting the release of a hostage, which was
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:32.900]  to be this ambassador. And they were going to basically let these al-Qaeda people capture
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:39.020]  the ambassador. Then they were gonna negotiate, and they were gonna get the blind, chic released,
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:40.300]  which the government could have done any time.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.300]  Do you believe that or not believe it?
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.660]  No, I do not believe it. The reason I don't believe it is because it would have been very
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:51.300]  easy and less lethal to set it up so the ambassador on the way to this annex was captured.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:55.100]  Well, of course, and too much could go wrong. What do you really think happened? I think
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:58.140]  they were transferring missiles, they wanted to cover it up.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:04.240]  That's right. And they knew that if the ambassador survived, there would be a congressional investigation
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.740]  on this. And this guy was apparently, even though he was knowledgeable of what he was
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:11.860]  doing, he was taking orders, a good yes man to the government, he would have talked.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:16.580]  So they decided to let him die, let everybody die. And that's why there was a stand down
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:23.380]  order, don't let any reinforcements. Unfortunately, about 30 people survived, wounded from that,
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:25.960]  who didn't die in that, and they could have talked as well.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.260]  That's the only reason to explain why they took him to Walter Reed, after Germany, to
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:34.500]  Walter Reed Army Medical Center and kept them in Comunecado. Meaning that they aren't allowed
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:39.660]  to talk to the press, even your family- Well, exactly, but I watched Hicks and others,
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:43.460]  they were freaked out, they were angry, those were real testimonies.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.380]  Those weren't the witnesses that I'm talking about.
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:50.100]  No, I understand, there's others. Those are mild whistleblowers, and Greg Hicks did a
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:54.860]  good job talking about the stand down. But you'll notice that he says, I don't know who
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:57.460]  issued the order to General, it wasn't General Hamm.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:00.500]  Yeah, so where are the 30 people? You never hear that in the press.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:04.180]  No, no, that's right, the 30 people are still in Comunecado, they're not coming before,
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:08.140]  and Congress is not demanding that they come before them. They know what was going on.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:12.820]  My goodness, I knew that, and it's just hiding in plain view, but hadn't covered it.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:16.100]  See, a lot of people thought, well, Greg Hicks and others are the whistleblowers. No, they
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.020]  aren't, they're mild whistleblowers. They aren't the ones that are really trying to
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.140]  keep away who were there during the attack.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:32.700]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of our little experiment here tonight.
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:35.620]  If you've been upset by some of the things we've covered, I would just say take more
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:40.380]  shots, more vaccines. A government that's been caught doing secret experiments on thousands
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:44.260]  of people, including foster children, is totally trustworthy.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:47.180]  Shooting black men up with syphilis and letting them die, it's spreaded over 45 years with
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:51.460]  Tuskegee. It's a loving government, so take all your vaccines, drink your hydrofluorosolicic
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:55.780]  acid, drink your fluoride water. Trust the system, remember it loves you, remember it
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.980]  cares about you, and support the government's preparations to take private bank accounts
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:02.300]  and pension funds, as they've done in Europe.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:06.340]  I just want to say I agree with Homeland Security, I think they're here to keep us safe, and
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:10.240]  I love tyranny. I thought I would bring some of the fairness doctrine, since they're trying
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:15.180]  to get that back into law, that I would just give some equal time here. I love tyranny,
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:21.020]  and I'll see you back tomorrow from England, 11 a.m. Central, at Infowars.com. Alex Jones
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:31.020]  signing off to Infinity, Tyranny, and QE3, and beyond!
