[00:00.000 --> 00:12.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.880 --> 00:35.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.720 --> 00:42.080]  well today's transmission is gonna be quite a challenge because this news is
[00:42.080 --> 00:48.000]  all so important I have got to be able to somehow go over all of it and we've
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.520]  got two actually three amazing guests one in studio
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.740]  Lyndon LaRouche is going to be joining us to discuss the moves to begin
[00:57.740 --> 01:01.560]  impeachment of Obama that's been going on for more than two weeks and has gotten
[01:01.560 --> 01:08.560]  basically zero coverage we are also gonna have author of dishonest money
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.380]  financing the road to ruin Joseph Plummer excellent book on the private
[01:13.380 --> 01:18.680]  federal deserve and it's a short book but you can't put it down great for
[01:18.680 --> 01:22.440]  newbies out there that don't understand how the new world or operates but folks
[01:22.440 --> 01:25.480]  would have researched a lot as well and you can always learn something new
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.480]  excellent book endorsed by G. over Griffin by Joseph Plummer available at
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.200]  infowars.com I should add if you want to support us and the author on the
[01:34.200 --> 01:40.680]  online video bookstore there and Kurt Nemo is gonna pop in as well because
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.400]  he's got an article out problem reaction solution anonymous promises to take
[01:45.400 --> 01:51.480]  down the internet now it's come out that some of the main hacker groups that
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.840]  have gotten in trouble are actually working for the feds no kidding and
[01:56.840 --> 02:04.320]  what they're doing is they hang out a name like anonymous and then good people
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.760]  do stuff under anonymous name bad people do things idiots do things under the
[02:08.760 --> 02:15.040]  name but that way you can demonize all of hacking and all of online activism
[02:15.040 --> 02:24.560]  under the name and under the larger rubric of anonymous and so I want to get
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.720]  them in here to talk about the evidence that a lot of these hacking groups
[02:28.720 --> 02:31.560]  working for the government and now say we're gonna shut down the internet which
[02:31.560 --> 02:36.920]  is exactly what cyber command said a few years ago they said they could attack
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.640]  the web themselves that's how arrogant they are like we're not reading what
[02:39.640 --> 02:43.560]  generals are saying as a pretext to then take control of the web then we saw
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.880]  Israel and the US that is the interest that run our countries launching a
[02:48.880 --> 02:58.240]  attack an attack on the web and on infrastructures but predominantly on the
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.200]  nuclear systems of Iran with the Stuxnet and then coming out and saying we need
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.760]  to take over the internet because of Stuxnet to protect it of course of course
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.720]  and the internet now is the wired infrastructure of the economy of the
[03:15.720 --> 03:20.880]  world of communication so controlling it is paramount in the globalist
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.440]  paradigm and they want to get everybody addicted to it when it's open and free
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.160]  and now they're going to try to phase in the end of the internet as we know it
[03:29.160 --> 03:34.760]  and I'm going to cover that the end of the internet as we know it if you let
[03:34.760 --> 03:42.960]  them coming up today a krypton reports new Samsung TV has built in HD camera
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.040]  microphones face and speech recognition yeah just like the connect of
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.280]  Microsoft that came out a few years ago everything is a two-way AI connection
[03:53.280 --> 03:56.800]  system and it's been like that for a long time with hidden microphones and
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.720]  cameras and people find them and it's like oh yeah right and then you get the
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.560]  actual specs that Tivo remember four years ago the Super Bowl announced oh

[04:27.200 --> 04:32.560]  their minions just prepared to just do it in mass where so many of them spy on
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.920]  you that it just becomes accepted and that's why the CIA director came out
[04:37.920 --> 04:40.960]  last week and said we're watching everything you do in your house all the

[08:37.240 --> 08:46.400]  day of March 2012 hard to believe we're about to end the third month in 2012 here
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.800]  and I am predicting we're all still going to be here at least most of us
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.440]  after 2012 and I predict the mainstream media the corporate dinosaur
[08:56.440 --> 09:03.400]  prostitute decepticon new world order types will claim that I said the world
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.840]  was going to end on 2012 never said that I've always had the view it's a hoax a
[09:08.840 --> 09:14.480]  fraud a false self-fulfilling prophecy so that people think oh it's the end of
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.240]  the world anyways why should I get politically involved now I do predict
[09:19.240 --> 09:24.400]  2012 is going to be tumultuous and I'm going to be doing some special reports
[09:24.400 --> 09:30.400]  on info wars nightly news in the near future on 2012 in fact I'm going to mark
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.360]  that down as I keep intending to do that and I haven't yet so 2012 another
[09:35.360 --> 09:40.600]  program note last week I interviewed Billy Corrigan of the smashing pumpkins
[09:40.600 --> 09:46.040]  in studio in the TV studio and it's ready to air tonight and I said a few days
[09:46.040 --> 09:49.280]  ago I would air it tonight there's even some news articles out there saying
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.280]  Alex Jones is gonna air this big exclusively Corrigan interview tonight
[09:52.280 --> 09:57.920]  about the new world order you name it the nature of consciousness he he he
[09:57.920 --> 10:05.640]  hasn't done something like this ever he did a talk with the sex pistols lead
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.280]  guy a few years ago that's been watched millions of times have been very
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.000]  popular how about the Illuminati new world order stuff like that this is in
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.680]  depth for over an hour and this morning I noticed there were news articles about
[10:19.680 --> 10:23.880]  the interview coming up tonight and I thought you know what this disrespectful
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.960]  to Billy Corrigan that I did a promo video for Dave Mustaine and then that
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.240]  interview ended up being in hundreds of publications and you talked about a lot
[10:34.240 --> 10:41.040]  of important issues I need to do a trailer for the Billy Corrigan interview
[10:41.040 --> 10:50.040]  so I'm rescheduling it to Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday and tonight we will
[10:50.040 --> 10:58.660]  put out a promo trailer for the Billy Corrigan interview but I will air it
[10:58.660 --> 11:04.440]  Monday but I just I always have these incredible guests incredible breaking
[11:04.440 --> 11:10.560]  news incredible information and then never even promoted properly so that it
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.920]  actually gets seen so people understand how important it is so that is going to
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.760]  happen Monday so you'll have an extended nightly news Monday we're gonna be back
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.280]  with you know new shows every day Monday we went eight months with info
[11:25.280 --> 11:28.880]  Wars nightly news I was intending internally to go two months and then take
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.440]  a pit stop or hiatus while we tune things this is beta testing deciding what
[11:33.440 --> 11:36.840]  type of news show will it be 30 minutes will it be an hour how are we gonna set
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.200]  the segments up what are the graphics gonna look like what's our main thrust
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.400]  gonna be what you've seen is simply the training wheels and the last two weeks
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.960]  we've just been doing new graphics working on a big announcement that I'm
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.400]  gonna have either today or tomorrow well that is a promotional contest video
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.600]  where we put out the rules and announce hey we're hiring a male reporter and a
[12:01.600 --> 12:08.000]  female reporter on top of the great crew we've built the skeletal genesis of
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.680]  this operation and now I'm looking to get two more reporters slash anchors in
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.400]  here and so we're about to launch that I've got a bunch of other stuff coming
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.160]  up next week so that's why I did this two-week pit stop that's over this
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.760]  weekend and I'll be back Monday with the nightly news and I've decided I'm gonna
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.800]  do the nightly news three nights a week and then we'll have Aaron Dykes Paul
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.560]  Watson or Rob do do it we're also gonna get John bound to do it somebody does a
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.920]  great job with the package reports special reports you've seen him doing
[12:39.920 --> 12:43.800]  very thought-provoking really impressed with all the work they're doing now
[12:43.800 --> 12:47.960]  because I'm trying to move this in the direction of you don't hear or see Alex
[12:47.960 --> 12:52.720]  Jones all the time and there's a lot of reasons for that a it needs to be about
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.800]  the information not about the cult of personality B I need to spend time you
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.920]  know at least a few days a week with my family but C and this is most important
[13:01.920 --> 13:07.520]  I'm better when I can cool my afterburners I'm better when I can pull in
[13:07.520 --> 13:14.280]  and get new tires get new you know fuel get a quick oil change and and because
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.840]  people seen it when I've taken off a week before which I've only done maybe five
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.920]  six times you know a solid week off in the 17 years I've been on air I come
[13:22.920 --> 13:30.200]  back and people are like wow what is going on here and whereas I get so wound
[13:30.200 --> 13:35.000]  up all the time and I'm thinking about this constantly that I almost basically
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  spent out of control and so it's my goal to have you know other people at least
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.720]  once a week and I'll still do the show six days a week so I'll be on myself five
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.480]  days a week but my goal is to have it where once a week we have a guest host
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.640]  on the radio and twice a week we have one of the other anchors or reporters
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.960]  do the nightly news and then as I develop more reporters than people I
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.360]  intend to segue them into doing the nightly news and then there's other
[14:05.360 --> 14:12.280]  issues as well where I've already got all these TV stations and cable systems
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.840]  and then a national cable channel in England that I looked it up has millions
[14:16.840 --> 14:20.200]  of viewers in the end the two hours were on every Sunday I went look the
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.920]  numbers 250 300,000 viewers in the UK and that's not giant but that's big I
[14:25.920 --> 14:31.520]  can't even handle now the emails and calls from media wanting to pick up the
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.360]  show and wanting to not have to download it off prisonplanet.tv and it's in
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.040]  high quality so they can air it on television but I've got to then research
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.440]  the systems the uploading news file sharing will I get satellite I mean it's
[14:44.440 --> 14:52.000]  just a big big enchilada to cook it's a big nut to crack it's it's personnel
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.040]  it's looking at finances it's trying to figure out I didn't mean to give you a
[14:57.040 --> 14:59.920]  report here right to start the show of what I've been thinking but I mean you're
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.600]  you're seeing a public meeting here you're being told more than my crews
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.240]  been told because I'm constantly thinking about what I want to do what my
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.680]  plans are and so here I am telling everybody first because I'm just
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.720]  codifying here on air decisions I've already made and what we're planning to
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.560]  do and I want to give you this report to we couldn't have done any of this if it
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.600]  wasn't for you the listeners the activists the freedom lovers over the
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.200]  years that have stood with us against mainstream media demonization and
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.000]  government attacks who've stood with us under incredible Cointel Pro and
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.880]  globalist internet sock puppets attacking us and globalist Pentagon
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.200]  systems attacking us and trying to lie about us and dirty tricks and the cast
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.400]  Sunstein cognitive dissonance model of them posing as alternative media and
[15:48.400 --> 15:53.480]  posing as conspiracy theorist and and posing as patriots and savaging us up
[15:53.480 --> 15:59.440]  one side and down the other it's never upset me because I know I'm doing the
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.920]  right thing I know I'm truthful I know I'm credible I know I'm for real that
[16:03.920 --> 16:07.920]  doesn't mean I don't make mistakes and I'm I'm a human my work is like dirty rags
[16:07.920 --> 16:13.080]  before the creator but my heart is good and I'm for real and the idea that Alex
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.680]  Jones is real the idea that you're real you know you're a patriot you know that
[16:17.680 --> 16:24.760]  you love liberty you know that you love freedom that basic fact that that that
[16:24.760 --> 16:31.880]  basic realization and understanding is what is truly going to change our
[16:31.880 --> 16:38.320]  society in the final equation that's what it's going to take is is you
[16:38.320 --> 16:44.440]  realizing that you're a leader and that you have power and that you count and
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.560]  that you're valuable and that you know you're good and so you can take action
[16:50.560 --> 16:55.560]  against the tyrants you can take action against the globalist you can take
[16:55.560 --> 17:00.560]  action against tyranny and corruption and oppression everywhere you see it and
[17:00.560 --> 17:05.360]  you can help people change their tire and you can educate a police officer and
[17:05.360 --> 17:09.440]  you can help an old lady across the street and you cannot get in petty
[17:09.440 --> 17:12.680]  fights with your family because the system has trained everybody through
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.600]  television and culture to do it you could stick together as a family and work
[17:16.600 --> 17:21.440]  things out if it's one degree a month that you make things better it doesn't
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.240]  matter it's that tribal understanding that it's not just me against the world
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.720]  it's all of us that love freedom against the technocrats the criminal
[17:30.720 --> 17:37.880]  structures the corrupt systems that's what we're talking about here and it's
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.360]  not buying into the Cointel pro Cass Sunstein White House system which was
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.920]  going on long before Cass Sunstein he just wrote public policy papers about
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.920]  we've got a fund in our funding thousands of operatives to go out and get
[17:51.920 --> 17:55.440]  people in fighting because the mainstream media has no credibility we've
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.160]  got to pose as anti-establishment to get these people tearing each other apart
[17:59.160 --> 18:05.160]  and we couldn't have done any of this if you weren't sophisticated enough when
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.600]  the whole system through everything they had at us and it boomeranged around and
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.000]  actually helped create a bigger buzz about this radio show all these attacks
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.080]  were turned into good we turned it into energy you turned into energy people
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.120]  actually came here and found out what we really do found out who we really are
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.720]  no matter how they edited what I said no matter the camera angles they used to
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.760]  deceive people no matter the dirty tricks you know they've done when I'm at the
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.840]  Texas Capitol or somewhere else with camera angles or with Michelle Malkin
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.400]  with camera angles claiming I was saying killer or all the other things that
[18:42.400 --> 18:46.240]  they've done it's backfired on them because you were sophisticated enough
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.200]  to know what was happening and I just am horrified to think what the next attacks
[18:51.200 --> 18:55.120]  are going to be like because these systems haven't worked but bottom line the
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.120]  message has been sent the information is out there we also couldn't have done
[18:59.120 --> 19:02.960]  this without your prayers and we couldn't have done it without the AM and FM
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.240]  affiliate owners managers program directors who have heard me for years
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.040]  talk about this and have now seen it come true and have had the courage to
[19:13.040 --> 19:18.720]  put me on the air and then now we have the success of the ratings I mean I'm
[19:18.720 --> 19:23.680]  number one in most demographics in Austin number two in the key demographic of
[19:23.680 --> 19:31.960]  what is it 18 to 54 on KLBJ that's on radio period music everything we are in
[19:31.960 --> 19:36.000]  places like Orlando number one we're number one in many many areas number
[19:36.000 --> 19:45.240]  one and that is a example of how popular liberty is and now I see thousands of
[19:45.240 --> 19:49.360]  other writers and talk show hosts duplicating our research and expanding
[19:49.360 --> 19:53.640]  on it and making it even more powerful and I know that even if they kill me
[19:53.640 --> 19:59.680]  the message has now been transmitted and we've had devastating victories against

[24:39.920 --> 24:42.920]  that the globalists do in their own documents that have leaked over the
[24:42.920 --> 24:48.560]  years is create confusion in the public get everybody following false
[24:48.560 --> 24:54.600]  narratives about Mitt Romney versus Barack Obama that's a controlled game
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.280]  that's a controlled some that's why they've been shutting Ron Paul out through
[24:59.280 --> 25:06.520]  a long list of frauds but when all of us stop playing along and get outside this
[25:06.520 --> 25:11.480]  giant Truman show this Alice in Wonderland that they've created and
[25:11.480 --> 25:17.800]  start studying what's going on behind the facade listen you don't have to
[25:17.800 --> 25:22.160]  believe everything I say I want you to go check it out and find out nine times
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.400]  out of ten it's worse than I'm even saying if I'm guilty of anything it's
[25:27.400 --> 25:33.960]  holding back sometimes if you want to be honest a lot of people say oh this guy
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.720]  he's a fear monger that's one of their memes they put out you know this couldn't
[25:38.720 --> 25:48.560]  be true it's true and then some what I'm trying to get you to do is to go and
[25:48.560 --> 25:53.280]  test the boundaries of what you've been taught and what you believe and to go see
[25:53.280 --> 26:01.000]  if there's any hidden doorways in your world view and I think as soon as you
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.240]  look you'll find they're not hidden at all and you're gonna open those doorways
[26:05.240 --> 26:11.920]  to a wider world and then you're gonna find more doorways to a wider world and
[26:11.920 --> 26:21.480]  still more and more that is the majesty that is the mystery that is the magic of
[26:21.480 --> 26:29.480]  life and creativity and the electric creation around us I mean spring is
[26:29.480 --> 26:41.000]  such a exhilarating time with all the little flowers and the life and the
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.640]  clear night skies you can feel it resonating with your soul and then you
[26:50.640 --> 26:56.640]  go watch television or you go see a football game and it might be exciting
[26:56.640 --> 27:03.000]  at one level but it doesn't feed the soul it doesn't satisfy it doesn't
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.360]  deliver the goods we've got more electronics more entertainment more
[27:09.360 --> 27:15.200]  carnival distractions than humans have ever had and in every major study people
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.240]  are less satisfied there's more porn there's more topless bars there's more
[27:21.240 --> 27:29.080]  sex there's more drugs there's more of everything and people are not satisfied
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.080]  you know who's satisfied people that truly do serve humanity people that
[27:38.080 --> 27:47.960]  truly engage in exploration dangerous exploration humans are meant to be
[27:47.960 --> 27:52.840]  challenged and the globalists have created all these artificial avenues
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.600]  warfare that's what some of our best people do join the military because
[27:56.600 --> 27:59.440]  they're instinctively seeking the challenge but it's working for the
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.720]  globalist in the final equation there's some good done but overall it's for an
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.960]  evil overall mission that's why so many join police because they're looking for
[28:09.960 --> 28:13.640]  adventure and excitement and challenge and they want to show that they've got
[28:13.640 --> 28:19.160]  it not to others but to themselves the problem is those directing it from on
[28:19.160 --> 28:26.760]  high are slowly but surely twisting that mission it is the wanderlust it is the
[28:26.760 --> 28:32.720]  spirit of exploration that empowers humanity now we've got Lyndon LaRouche
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.800]  coming up with some bombshell info and impeachment of Obama and his inside
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.560]  sources Joseph Plummer author of dishonest money is going to be joining us
[28:40.560 --> 28:44.160]  for 30 minutes and Kurt Nemo for about 20 minutes as well on some big news
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.240]  problem reaction solution anonymous promises to take down the internet of
[28:48.240 --> 28:51.720]  course the government will have some oh it's anonymous it it took it down now
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.520]  we're going to blame the general public and people are like hey anonymous does
[28:55.520 --> 29:00.800]  good work some people under that name anonymous but it's Taylor made to blame
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.520]  the whole when it's completely anonymous just like Occupy Wall Street was set up
[29:05.520 --> 29:09.120]  and pushed by globalist good people showed up because it was a nebulous
[29:09.120 --> 29:13.280]  calling for going after corruption Wall Street and then George Soros and the
[29:13.280 --> 29:19.040]  White House could come in and take it over that failed so then they under a
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.640]  homeland security sweep SWAT team them nationwide and single night and started
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.040]  arresting them and now charging them with felonies because they couldn't co-opt
[29:28.040 --> 29:32.240]  it they wanted a plastic revolution like the ones they've stimulated the
[29:32.240 --> 29:37.920]  Middle East but not to bring liberty and freedom but to bring al-Qaeda rule and
[29:37.920 --> 29:41.840]  here it wasn't to bring going after the insiders on Wall Street engaged in
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.640]  corporate crony fraud it was to give those crony fraud people more power
[29:46.640 --> 29:53.000]  we'll be back with key news stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the

[34:31.440 --> 34:37.440]  actually saying as first reported by info wars.com and the old days they
[34:37.440 --> 34:44.040]  never give us credit for anything but we've become a major news source and we
[34:44.040 --> 34:48.840]  already knocked the door down in many respects four or five years ago but I
[34:48.840 --> 34:53.120]  tell you the drudge report drudge report.com the biggest news aggregator in
[34:53.120 --> 34:59.480]  the world the number one driver of news traffic on the planet linking us the
[34:59.480 --> 35:02.440]  last five years and accelerating that because we break more and more news
[35:02.440 --> 35:10.440]  that's pertinent has really also super energized info wars.com and prison
[35:10.440 --> 35:19.720]  planet.com as as the names in hardcore avant-garde risky and by risky I mean
[35:19.720 --> 35:25.480]  risky to the establishment information and that's why it's so important that
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.040]  all of you realize that we're not going to have this free web forever if the
[35:29.040 --> 35:32.440]  globalists keep moving in this direction so we need to a fight to keep the web
[35:32.440 --> 35:39.360]  open and free freer it's not totally free now that's a and b use it like it's
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.600]  not going to be here and those those two things go together it's use it or lose
[35:45.600 --> 35:50.080]  it and I've got some internet news I've got it get to here in a moment I haven't
[35:50.080 --> 35:54.840]  even begun getting into all of the news information come on in I see you guys
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.560]  stacked up there with some breaking news let's see what this is Turkish
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.920]  government goes for gold seeks to transfer private gold holdings in the
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.680]  bank system yeah I saw that and a bunch of other governments are moving in that
[36:07.680 --> 36:13.560]  direction. Obama's put a joke out saying if I told you I'd have to kill you you
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.600]  know we've got some of that Sarkozy's now saying visiting hate or terror
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.760]  websites will be punished yeah they're going to use this of these sad deaths
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.000]  over there to take free speech and I've got to tell you right now this whole
[36:27.000 --> 36:35.160]  thing has all the hallmarks of a staged event so now visiting websites that they
[36:35.160 --> 36:38.520]  say are hateful by the way they listen for wars.com or prisonblood.com many
[36:38.520 --> 36:44.120]  European nations as hate you will be punished for the site you visit you know
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.760]  they were watching this guy for years turns out he was being controlled by
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.400]  French intelligence he was allowed to do what he did bare minimum they might
[36:51.400 --> 36:54.680]  have just killed some innocent guy up there and thrown him out the window I
[36:54.680 --> 36:58.520]  mean who knows they've been caught doing this before but now you know by the way
[36:58.520 --> 37:02.800]  they're acting and boy he wants to get reelected doesn't he and of course here's
[37:02.800 --> 37:08.120]  the headline financial times Sarkozy stands to gain most from arrest no
[37:08.120 --> 37:13.160]  kidding. Remember Obama man if we could just have a new Oklahoma City I'd get
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.640]  reelected all those memos advising him ball up a bunch of kids they love to
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.880]  kill kids I kept telling you the false flag could come here or in Europe. I'm
[37:22.880 --> 37:31.440]  gonna get to that report in a moment I'm gonna get to that report in a moment let
[37:31.440 --> 37:40.520]  me go ahead now and just start getting into the internet news here new Samsung
[37:40.520 --> 37:46.160]  TVs have built-in HD camera microphones face and speech recognition they're
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.640]  basically connects that would cost a hundred thousand dollars for that from
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.920]  any other proprietary system but cost a couple hundred bucks they face scan you
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.000]  they voice print you they've got cameras all over them new cars have cameras on
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.120]  the front and the back for your safety schools everywhere admitting they're
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.520]  watching children at home on their laptops now when this first started
[38:06.520 --> 38:10.320]  breaking four or five years ago people said Alex there's not schools in
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.600]  Pennsylvania and California watching kids on their laptops I even had the
[38:14.600 --> 38:19.520]  mainstream articles where the schools were admitting it and trying to hide it
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.160]  in plain view and people would call me and talk to a husband laugh now as soon
[38:24.160 --> 38:27.320]  as it became a big national story they're like well what's wrong with watching
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.480]  kids at home you know why did they go from saying it's horrible and denying it
[38:31.480 --> 38:38.720]  to saying oh it's good because before it was proven to them they were saying oh
[38:38.720 --> 38:41.840]  there's no way that's happening as soon as it was announced they're so scared
[38:41.840 --> 38:46.760]  they immediately make a decision to accept it it's like play acting there
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.240]  they're playing along oh okay well then it's okay because it would be too scary
[38:51.240 --> 38:54.680]  to think you're living in a society doing that see that's how the split second
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.880]  thing works and I've been there with media people saying I can show you
[38:58.880 --> 39:01.880]  government documents and clips where they're announcing world government out
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.560]  of the financial crisis and then it's staged I can show you their admissions
[39:05.560 --> 39:09.000]  and video there go that doesn't exist you're crazy oh sure I show it they go
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.800]  well okay let's go get lunch but wait a minute well that doesn't matter we're
[39:13.800 --> 39:20.120]  not going to report on that you know Nightline was here and I've gotten
[39:20.120 --> 39:25.240]  literally hundreds of Twitter's and emails and I've seen comments without
[39:25.240 --> 39:33.520]  even looking going Jones has done it now he says that the CIA director says our
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.160]  appliances are watching and listening to us and actually read his quotes on air
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.920]  it's in hundreds of publications and Pete in fact keep up that Fox News clip
[39:43.920 --> 39:52.240]  for me on that thank you but still people can't believe it yeah the headline on
[39:52.240 --> 40:00.720]  the video is CIA spy on you through your refrigerator now I called Paul Watson
[40:00.720 --> 40:03.880]  about this last weekend I said do reports on this place and he said well I got
[40:03.880 --> 40:07.320]  all this other stuff I'm working on he said you know we reported on that six
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.760]  seven years ago and again last year Alex and I said I know I know he goes we got
[40:12.760 --> 40:16.000]  the press releases from Google admitting six years ago they're watching
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.400]  everybody over the cameras and microphones and that their NSA I know
[40:19.400 --> 40:23.720]  but now they're admitting the former head of DARPA runs it okay yeah I'll do a
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.640]  report never did I'm not mad at him but you know for us we're so acclimated
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.000]  because we already know we're telling the truth that when it's admitted I
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.880]  mentioned it and people go oh that's crazier than him saying that the plastic
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.520]  lining is an estrogen memory and feminizes men and then hundreds of
[40:41.520 --> 40:46.320]  George Soros connected groups came out in a meme in organized attack and said I
[40:46.320 --> 40:49.600]  was insane and I do talk shows to this day and they go you're the crazy guy
[40:49.600 --> 40:54.040]  thinks that juice boxes make us gay and I said what I said was here's all the
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.160]  government documents how they chose this type of plastic to feminize men and by
[40:58.160 --> 41:04.440]  the way the big part of the report was give you breast cancer give you breast
[41:04.440 --> 41:08.960]  cancer and prostate cancer you need to be concerned about that and they're like
[41:08.960 --> 41:13.600]  shut up homophobe and I'm like listen it's it's causing the frogs and fish to
[41:13.600 --> 41:17.520]  be hemaphrodites this is a planned program it's it's running off into this
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.760]  into the likes of streams they just go shut up homophobe and I'm like listen
[41:21.760 --> 41:25.480]  it's not about that these chemicals are giving you cancer shut up like the
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.200]  Coney guy no no so so that's what's going on and this is the type of
[41:31.200 --> 41:37.360]  invincible ignorance that that we deal with all the new TVs everything you
[41:37.360 --> 41:41.240]  won't be able to buy a cell phone that isn't a smartphone you won't be able to
[41:41.240 --> 41:45.280]  buy a TV or a computer that doesn't track you two-way and they're wired under
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.600]  federal regulations and global regulations where you cannot deactivate it
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.640]  when your phone and computer is off they are designed under global regulations
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.680]  on record to turn on and watch you you're like well I just will unplug it you
[42:00.680 --> 42:06.280]  have to unplug it physically because not just the computer router the cable the
[42:06.280 --> 42:10.960]  power cord has data over power line and then I get emails saying prove it hey
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.280]  if you're too dumb to know about data over power line in place for 20 years
[42:14.280 --> 42:19.480]  I'm okay just because you're ignorant like the guy that came from me in the
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.520]  pizza place 10 years ago and tried and poked me in the back and said you're a
[42:22.520 --> 42:27.240]  liar about goats that are part spider he said I went to biology in the 70s at
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.760]  UT and I didn't even argue I said whatever you want to just get out of my
[42:29.760 --> 42:37.760]  face again I don't have time to sit here and play games with you I don't have
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.280]  time to sit here and have people go oh that's too extreme it's 2012 all this
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.720]  is going on chemical and biological weapons are added to your food and
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.840]  water on record and now they are publicly admitting they're doing it
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.440]  because we've been exposing them their psychological warfare chiefs have now
[42:55.440 --> 43:02.040]  moved to the model of hiding in plain view now for over a week and a half it's
[43:02.040 --> 43:05.240]  gonna be two weeks almost now I've been reporting on this betray us thing and
[43:05.240 --> 43:08.600]  now it's coming out in the news I was listening to BBC this morning driving in
[43:08.600 --> 43:12.360]  and they were on there and they were doing a show about how they use
[43:12.360 --> 43:17.560]  connects to watch cricket players and soccer players to train them better
[43:17.560 --> 43:21.120]  because it's a body scan and I knew it was coming at the end of the report I
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.440]  knew it they said soon we'll just implant chips and all the players and I knew
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.600]  that was next in the report because I know the script it's repeated it's a
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.480]  talking point and I was sitting there driving in the car my dad was calling me
[43:34.480 --> 43:36.880]  and I said I'm not going to answer that right now I have to wait till the end of
[43:36.880 --> 43:43.080]  the report and I was waiting and oh anybody listen to BBC they'll air it
[43:43.080 --> 43:46.200]  again and again today the answer is getting plantable chips soon you're
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.440]  gonna be on the team you're gonna have an implantable chip see they phase it in
[43:50.440 --> 43:53.960]  first it's Google goggles you're gonna wear you know it and then it's 3D
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.640]  interfaces and then it's apparatus you wear it it'll be the cool thing to do
[43:57.640 --> 44:01.720]  and I've got Department of Defense documents from 1970s saying how they
[44:01.720 --> 44:06.640]  would roll it out as stylish and cool and for people in prison and for people
[44:06.640 --> 44:11.320]  with degenerative disorders and it's all gonna sound great and it would be
[44:11.320 --> 44:17.560]  good if it didn't have Trojan horses built in so the globalist in their own
[44:17.560 --> 44:22.920]  words say they're forcing an artificial evolution I call it a D evolution
[44:22.920 --> 44:25.760]  because all these systems are meant to control if the globalist do everything
[44:25.760 --> 44:28.960]  they can to dumb us down and poison us do you think they're gonna give us all
[44:28.960 --> 44:33.000]  these technologies that are gonna empower us no early on they let us use a
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.040]  freer internet to get addicted now that the wires are all going into place
[44:37.040 --> 44:41.840]  they're saying now it's not gonna be free now you're gonna go to jail if you
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.320]  visit the sites we say or hate and at public schools and universities in the
[44:46.320 --> 44:52.440]  US and worldwide the software they pay for blocks info wars in prison planet as
[44:52.440 --> 44:59.480]  hate and hacking and you never even know it exists now I'm a problem because I've
[44:59.480 --> 45:02.560]  broken through at every level of media they're not just going to be able to
[45:02.560 --> 45:09.560]  censor me and shut me down but here it is NSA boss's agency does not monitor
[45:09.560 --> 45:13.680]  your email total lie they've been caught lying over and over again because in
[45:13.680 --> 45:18.160]  their own DARPA meetings that are public they admit everything is run through but
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.360]  see they've got subgroups like total information awareness that that I was on
[45:23.360 --> 45:27.960]  RT the other day they were saying this new group it was set up in 2001 by
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.120]  Admiral Poindexter then when it got exposed they moved it to a private group
[45:31.120 --> 45:34.720]  so it's true they actually have subcontractors that reach your email
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.280]  that's just like whenever they they had a TV pieces on the grocery store
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.840]  locally years ago going we thumb scan you now when you come through and by your
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.920]  groceries but don't worry it's not it's not a image of your finger it's some
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.600]  zeros and ones well technically it is zeros and ones that they create an
[45:51.600 --> 45:56.000]  algorithm from but it is an image of your finger so it's all these games and
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.520]  so now the NSA director is in there before Congress in front of the
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.360]  congressman that thinks that islands will capsize if there's too many troops
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.200]  on them I'm not kidding and he says no we don't spy on people because it's
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.920]  illegal meanwhile though they've got the head of the CIA remember just 10 years
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.760]  ago they said the NSA didn't exist remember that I would get calls 15 years
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.640]  ago saying Alex there's no such thing as the NSA and echelon quit lying if that
[46:21.640 --> 46:25.480]  was in all the congressional documents the public said it doesn't exist because
[46:25.480 --> 46:32.080]  you don't do that in America now we've got all this happening NSA bosses agency
[46:32.080 --> 46:40.320]  does not monitor your email and Easter bunnies are real superman's real next
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.240]  again and Obama loves us and holder doesn't want our guns he just wrote
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.600]  public letters saying totally ban them and brainwash the public but but he's a
[46:48.600 --> 46:56.680]  nice man you see when when you're not aware of the brainwashing and believe
[46:56.680 --> 46:59.820]  the lie that oh it doesn't exist that's a conspiracy theory the government's
[46:59.820 --> 47:04.760]  but benevolent loves me you're just wide open to this all I'm saying is open
[47:04.760 --> 47:08.880]  the blinds look outside in the wider world you are being manipulated you are
[47:08.880 --> 47:15.000]  being targeted and you better start looking into it because once you do look
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  into it you're gonna find out Alex Jones has been telling you the truth the
[47:19.000 --> 47:26.680]  whole truth and nothing but it okay it's just my my verbal skills cannot
[47:26.680 --> 47:33.080]  enunciate it cannot orate and cannot transmit to you the full spectrum
[47:33.080 --> 47:38.080]  magnitude of the scientific dictatorship but you can go read the wire
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.280]  magazine article with the quotes from the in cutel CIA Google controlling
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.720]  system that's who that is we'll spy on you through your dishwasher and he goes
[47:47.720 --> 47:54.120]  on in the quotes saying it's transformational all devices are already
[47:54.120 --> 47:59.720]  having it built in to watch and listen to you and he went on to say privacy is
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.280]  not what it used to be you know just basically just accept it that they're
[48:04.280 --> 48:06.960]  gonna do it I mean I've read the quotes on air over and over again meanwhile I
[48:06.960 --> 48:16.480]  still have people thinking I'm making this up okay I mean I mean here's another
[48:16.480 --> 48:19.440]  wire magazine article the NSA is building the country's biggest spy
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.880]  center watch what you say see that's why Petraeus has come out and said all this
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.680]  they want you scared they want those of you that are intellectual and informed
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.120]  or at least know how to tie your shoes and know this is classical tyranny to
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.000]  get scared well you better be scared of getting scared you better be scared of
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.680]  giving any of these guys because in thousands of their documents once this
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.080]  electronic panopticon technocratic systems in place what they're gonna do is
[48:46.080 --> 48:53.360]  release bio weapons and say terrorists did it and kill everybody oh yeah that's
[48:53.360 --> 48:56.240]  why I'm not worried about them killing me that's why I'll get on air and read
[48:56.240 --> 49:00.920]  public documents that the government is a bunch of narcotic trafficking murderers
[49:00.920 --> 49:04.120]  because I want my kids to make it and I want their kids and your kids to make it
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.000]  I'm doing what a man does when there's no chance for our people if we don't fight
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.680]  these guys I'm doing all I can do it isn't about me selling out to a system
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.920]  that plans on killing everybody do you understand that that plans on getting
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.160]  rid of all of our speech staging false flag terror attacks and banning it
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.640]  sarcosis saying you'll be arrested if you visit info wars.com because I know in
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.560]  France I've confirmed because Paul Watson's parents live there when he goes
[49:33.560 --> 49:37.920]  to visit all the time info wars is blocked and listed there train stations
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.040]  in England block us and we're listed as hate every time the media is here they
[49:43.040 --> 49:46.760]  say are you worried about exposing the stuff's gonna cause violence that's the
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.680]  new meme that that's how they're coming after us. Take us out to break with just
[49:52.680 --> 49:56.000]  a minute of Fox News admitting the the systems I'm gonna come back and get into
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.280]  the attack on free speech here's that clip from Fox News taking us out to
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.960]  break. Well security at home now and questions about whether the CIA could
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.440]  spy on people through their refrigerators there's there's I know
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.840]  there's this report out from Wired magazine's national security blog that
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.680]  says the CIA director David Petraeus recently spoke about smart technology in
[50:15.680 --> 50:19.160]  our homes technology that connects a television or an oven to the internet
[50:19.160 --> 50:24.320]  it's all supposed to make our lives easier but director Petraeus says spies
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.080]  could use that technology to keep an eye on people without their knowledge. Let's
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.920]  take this to the judge Fox News senior judicial analyst judge Andrew Napolitano
[50:31.920 --> 50:37.120]  is with us I mean that's enough. The full clip is up on info wars.com this is a
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.800]  week after we covered it and I get these emails and things you know still
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.040]  not knowing this is going on and they quite frankly kind of soft-pedal on
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.720]  Petraeus what a great guy is. Petraeus said we're using this on you and we're
[50:49.720 --> 50:53.720]  going to use it and you have no fourth amendment. Go read the stinking quotes
[50:53.720 --> 51:01.720]  Petraeus is a piece of New World Order traitorous anti-american trash. A little
[51:01.720 --> 51:06.400]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[51:06.400 --> 51:09.920]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[51:09.920 --> 51:13.960]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[51:13.960 --> 51:17.440]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[51:17.440 --> 51:22.080]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.520]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy. I then
[51:26.520 --> 51:31.280]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[54:08.840 --> 54:14.880]  what's in my stacks of news Illinois House kills audio recording bill
[54:14.880 --> 54:20.240]  Illinois House killed a bill Wednesday that would have allowed citizens to make
[54:20.240 --> 54:25.040]  audio recordings of police officers in public places well it's already on a
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.960]  record that there's no perception of privacy in public that's why the
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.240]  government can record and videotape so why aren't the police being charged with
[54:33.240 --> 54:37.800]  that again they're misapplying a law that doesn't even cover it the state
[54:37.800 --> 54:42.880]  house tries to pass a law saying stop putting people in jail for this and it
[54:42.880 --> 54:49.520]  gets killed that's like communist China I mean this is off the charts oh here's
[54:49.520 --> 54:52.760]  another one I got a report I want to go over later all over the United States
[54:52.760 --> 54:57.520]  they're banning giving food to the homeless including canned food they're
[54:57.520 --> 55:02.320]  telling food banks you can't do it anymore only the government can do this
[55:02.320 --> 55:10.280]  Bloomberg's come out and said no no more food banking they want you on
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.520]  government food stamps in the system period I mean Stalin is the only guy
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.360]  that did stuff like this they're going after farmers everywhere I mean folks
[55:20.360 --> 55:27.000]  we got bad guys running things and it's bigger than Obama it's global and the
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.080]  entire top brass of the military that's not speaking out they're involved in
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.920]  treason because the the UN has announced through its agents Obama and
[55:35.920 --> 55:39.600]  others and Secretary of Defense Cohen a Secretary of Defense it was the whole
[55:39.600 --> 55:44.160]  Secretary of Defense a Secretary of Defense Panetta that they take UN
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.600]  orders and that is treason so they've announced the coup a bill's been
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.040]  introduced to start impeachment hadn't gotten the coverage they're announcing
[55:52.040 --> 55:55.080]  hey we're watching without warrants listening to you yeah we're shipping the
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.520]  opium in from Afghanistan what you're gonna do about it that's in the LA
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.320]  Times the government was dealing drugs under Fast and Furious that's been out
[56:03.320 --> 56:10.320]  for over a year that's been out since last February we broke it that whole
[56:10.320 --> 56:13.480]  thing about selling guns and tracking them out of gun shops that's the ATF
[56:13.480 --> 56:17.520]  release that hoping to make the story about that not the drug dealing and all
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.080]  of it mafia runs this country they don't run all the media yet here's
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.680]  Sarkozy Sarkozy visiting hate and terror websites will be punished notice hate
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.800]  they taught of terror president Sarkozy addressed has spoken strongly against
[56:32.800 --> 56:36.880]  extremism which is criticizing big government but urged his countrymen not
[56:36.880 --> 56:42.800]  to stigmatize Muslims yeah yeah bring in Muslims at record rates again they're
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.920]  really saying the Muslims of the terror they're gonna use this against
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.920]  everybody after a 32-hour siege it results in the death I said they'd
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.560]  probably die yesterday just like in Spain turned out the government did do
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.440]  that that's even the Spanish papers they blow it up they go kill a few pats
[56:57.440 --> 57:00.440]  these blow them up in an apartment building same thing here blow them up
[57:00.440 --> 57:07.640]  throw his body out the window Sarkozy has proposed a raft of new anti-terror
[57:07.640 --> 57:13.720]  measures and he basically went on to say they're gonna restrict free speech
[57:13.720 --> 57:18.800]  because it's ideological indoctrination and forced recruitment and guess what
[57:18.800 --> 57:24.600]  they've talked about nationalist groups in France that want sovereignty the ones
[57:24.600 --> 57:27.200]  that actually and again I'm not attacking Muslims here but I'm saying
[57:27.200 --> 57:30.880]  from that position the groups that actually want to control sovereignty
[57:30.880 --> 57:36.280]  they're gonna get shut down you gotta love how this works here it is
[57:36.280 --> 57:41.560]  Sarkozy stands to gain most from arrest financial times of London analysis
[57:41.560 --> 57:47.640]  report woman warned French police over to lose shooter years before killings and
[57:47.640 --> 57:50.720]  then with the reports that he was in a prison and allowed to escape in Afghanistan
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.000]  and on a watch list of course was he just a useful idiot patsy nut they
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.080]  allowed to do it that's bare minimum like the underwear bomber who the US
[57:58.080 --> 58:02.720]  government got on the plane and again they're saying he's not connected to any
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.880]  real al-Qaeda because it's never real it's some useful idiot who believes the
[58:06.880 --> 58:12.480]  ideology and it's basically a copycat copycatting ADL grandson head Adam
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.400]  Gadan head of al-Qaeda on the news saying he's gonna kill everybody uploaded
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.840]  in US government video format with the US government bug next to the al-Qaeda bug
[58:20.840 --> 58:26.480]  the government uploads these things so you got the Jewish commanders of al-Qaeda
[58:26.480 --> 58:33.560]  up there commanding this guy I just I can't handle it anymore it's all gonna
[58:33.560 --> 58:37.120]  be used to take our speech and of course I told you how this case went in
[58:37.120 --> 58:41.320]  standard deal intelligence
[58:43.160 --> 58:49.760]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[58:58.560 --> 59:03.160]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[59:03.160 --> 59:12.400]  there's a place down in Tennessee when they make blue diamond gusset jeans they
[59:12.400 --> 59:21.520]  so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit and put a diamond
[59:21.520 --> 59:28.760]  gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond gussets got it

[59:53.600 --> 01:00:01.120]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:13.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.160]  Alex Jones
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:31.720]  Marine Le Pen in all the polls was set to beat Nicholas Sarkozy in France they
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.480]  can't have nationalist over there and so magically this extremist kills some
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.200]  poor children and paratroopers Sarkozy says they're gonna start arresting people
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:47.080]  for their speech banning visiting sites like info wars.com that is being
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.240]  reported all across Europe he's given a speech just hours ago and oh notice that
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.400]  the from the socialist ban we had Dominic Strauss Kahn 10 points ahead and
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.280]  he got caught with the prostitute turned out that was all fake in hindsight and a
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.560]  total setup and they admitted French intelligence under Sarkozy was running
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.080]  all of that this is another intelligence op I'm gonna cover it after
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.120]  Lyndon LaRouche leaves us at the start of the next hour Kurt Nemo's gonna be in
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:26.200]  studio with us wow that is incredible Lyndon LaRouche of course does not need
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.360]  to really be introduced he has been a perennial presidential candidate to
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.480]  inject issues his analysis of the Anglo-American banking cartel has been
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:39.040]  the most accurate I've seen out there and other interesting minds like
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.720]  Webster Tarpley have spun out of that group and I agree with their analysis I
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.080]  don't always agree with their solutions but I respect their work and he's one
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.000]  of the greatest political living minds out there and he's been he's also one of
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.600]  the one of the most articulate and sharp people I know who's approaching 90
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.400]  Lyndon LaRouche thank you for joining us sir how old are you now I will be 90
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.960]  in September wow I've never seen Skype this clear it looks like high-def
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.200]  television sir looks like I can reach through the television we're about to
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.800]  come back in the official you know launch some stations don't carry the
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.040]  short segment but but tell us on your radar screen I know the moved in Peach
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.080]  Obama these executive orders what are you gonna brief us on sir on the other
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.800]  side of the break I can tell you where we're we're in the worst crisis in the
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.480]  history of civilization right now especially in the transatlantic region
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.200]  but it extends of course into the Asian region as well so we're on the verge of
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.800]  what threatens to be soon world war three but not just world war three
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.040]  salmon ucchia world war three and that is what our military leaders who are
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.440]  responsible ones are concerned about they may not be telling this whole story
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.120]  and that's that's right on their part not to I'm more free to tell what the
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.320]  whole story is but once you start playing around with salmon ucchia weapons
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.160]  like the Ohio class submarines which can do that job is one of the few
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.320]  capabilities on this planet that can do that kind of job every nation many
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.320]  nations have these capabilities now but a salmon ucchia war actually is one from
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.440]  which civilization could never recover and therefore stopping this president
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.880]  the United States president and stopping the British who are the chief
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:38.400]  perpetrator Sarkozy is just one of the added features of this these people are
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.000]  threatening humanity with extinction and that's what we have to see and that's
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.360]  what we have to stop well said London with all of this happening I know you
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.160]  guys have also put out some emergency alerts on the fact that a move towards
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.880]  impeachment has begun also we see wartime executive orders being activated by
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.360]  Obama all of this leans towards that there could be some type of attempt to
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.280]  stay in office it's gonna be an attempt to set up a world dictatorship and this
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.320]  year and if Obama remains in office I believe will be all the victims of it
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.520]  unbelievable I've never heard you speak like this and so much of what you said
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:27.560]  unfortunately has come true with prophetic accuracy we're gonna go to
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:34.000]  break Lenin LaRouche is our guest LaRouche pack.com LaRouche pub.com are
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.040]  two of the websites and we're gonna break down thermal nuclear war now the
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.800]  attempt to set up a world dictatorship through the banking cartel with Lenin
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.680]  LaRouche in the next hour and then we're gonna get into all these other events
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.520]  that are taking place stay with us I'm Alex Jones with prisonplanet.tv
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.040]  where we're streaming video of this syndicated radio transmission stay
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:02.320]  with us we'll be right back we're also on XM channel 166 a little over a year
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.840]  ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.800]  meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.920]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.920]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.760]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.160]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.920]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jeviti the young

[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:13.800]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:19.360]  that's right we are in the Republic of the United States it's been captured by
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.720]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan the big private mega banks out of Europe that have
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:30.800]  created a black hole of over a thousand trillion dollars that they have induced
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.640]  the paid-off trader politicians in Europe England and the United States to
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.640]  sign us on to even the Economist magazine the Financial Times of London
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:47.920]  admit that it's a banker coup over Europe and that the debt is their
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.760]  fraudulent debt but then they say that's a good thing because they're
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.760]  technocrats and they know best so now open-world government buying for private
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.520]  banks is admitted where our president is telling Congress that he can launch
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.280]  wars without congressional approval and then he can get that authority from NATO
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.840]  itself and Anglo-American banking front all of this is happening it's all out
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.640]  on the open now and I've from so many historians that I've talked to people
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.800]  like Lenin LaRouche and countless others they've said that when the system
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.240]  unclokes itself that means it's getting ready to launch a new war and that
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:32.440]  they're unfreezing society and we're going into a rapid period of change the
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:40.680]  question is what does that change mean now Lenin LaRouche has put out alerts at
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.280]  LaRouche PAC calm breaking down the fact one of the few media outlets that
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.760]  covered two weeks ago that legislation have been introduced that if Obama
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.640]  launches wars without congressional approval that impeachment would be
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.520]  triggered because it violates article one section a clause 11 they've also put
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:04.680]  out reports that we've confirmed obviously that Obama has activated
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:11.560]  nuclear war COG doctrine that can only be used when we're under major attack in
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.520]  peacetime to take control of the economy so the major war footing is being
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.160]  prepared all of this happening while we see the activity around Iran proxy wars
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.520]  in Syria Lenin LaRouche who former CIA director called the best private
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.560]  intelligence in the world of former head of the National Security Council said
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:39.200]  something similar joins us he has incredible sources in government to be
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.520]  able to tell us exactly where we are currently geopolitically Lenin LaRouche
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.320]  thank you for joining us you've got the floor please brief us on where the
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.240]  white stands right now we're on the verge in the near future of a threatened
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.280]  thermonuclear war it would be launched essentially by the United States under
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.720]  Obama but we actually the direction would come from the British because
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.120]  Obama is not really that bright he's simply a stooge for the British
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.200]  essentially and that's why things happen the way they do now what what the
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:22.320]  threat is the only war that's threatened is the to induce the United States
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:30.480]  under the reign of Obama as a British stooge to launch a thermonuclear war with
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.320]  Russia China India and other countries largely in the Asia region the
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.440]  intention is to do it soon it was actually the intention to do this last
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:47.880]  year shortly after the killing of Libya's president Gaddafi but our people
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.520]  are patriots and people in some other countries combined forces to postpone
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:12:00.440]  the intention to launch that war the war is still being pushed it's not been
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:08.280]  brought through and Russia and China and India are taking steps to try to
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.920]  minimize this problem but the danger here is very few people understand it I
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.080]  know that our leaving military figures do understand it but they don't want to
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.920]  say it publicly because the effect would be to panic people I can because
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.880]  they're government I am not government even though I have my ties into our
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.640]  government which there but I can say it what you're looking at you're looking
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.240]  at one day it could possibly be the Israeli launching of an attack on Iran
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.840]  could start it because a trick a set of alliances would then go clicking into
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.600]  action and you it's very soon be at the threat of a thermonuclear war now that
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.480]  the characteristic of a thermonuclear war when full-scale weapons say the Ohio
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:04.120]  class submarines and the Pacific or the south south region of waters unleashes
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:10.800]  at their full-scale attack of their capacity their fire capacity then Russia
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.160]  and China in particular will not in the minute they the signal of that launch has
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.240]  occurred from the hands of Britain and the United States then they'll take an
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.960]  action now the result of that which is very few people understand is that when
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:33.160]  you unleash a thermonuclear war you have to go all the way your your objective is
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.640]  such because of the capable the effects of thermonuclear weapons systems you go
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.320]  for a kill a total kill with the first shot but as much as you've got but it
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:48.000]  immediately Russia for example in this case or China would have to immediately
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.400]  respond with their full thermonuclear kill capability now this kind of process
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:01.400]  leads into a threatened extermination of the human species what does it do well
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:08.920]  that that depth our explosion will have side effects which will make the planet
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.480]  essentially uninhabitable food stuffs will essentially disappear because a
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.760]  source of them will be crippled and it could be the extinction of the human
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.720]  species that's how far it can go now those who are responsible in our
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:29.000]  military circles know this and I don't ask them to say it I can say it the
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.320]  facts are there and I would hope people just look in the direction to
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:40.600]  recognize the only way I can see that now we can have an assured avoidance of a
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:46.000]  thermonuclear war this year or very soon after it and more likely this year would
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.080]  be to remove Obama from office on grounds of his mental incompetence and he
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.560]  is mentally incompetence the evidence is there remove him from office and that
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.520]  would mean that our government would no longer be under the compulsion of a
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.360]  British agent Obama to launch this war and without the United States
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.720]  participation in such a thermonuclear launch which no other nation really has
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.600]  then you cannot have this war but and that's the only solution
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.960]  all right linden if we have new listeners out there or people who are not
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.080]  informed the BBC and others reported in December that the Chinese president said
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.840]  prepare for war with the United States because the United States was moving its
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:42.920]  main task forces into that area of the Pacific and also into Australia and so
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.560]  I just want to back up everything you're saying the former head of the
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.040]  Mossad that Netanyahu basically dismissed last year has said it would be a
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:56.440]  catastrophe and would probably lead to a major multi-theater war Russia has now
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.640]  as you know you said months ago but now was admitted yesterday not just sent in
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:08.400]  missile ships with nukes to dock there in the Mediterranean at ports in Syria
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.080]  but they've sent in special forces we also have India that's normally at odds
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.640]  with China lining up in the last two months this has gotten really no
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.000]  attention here in the US it's all over the Asian and European news has lined up
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.880]  with China Pakistan has even gotten closer to China and Russia and of course
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:37.920]  Pakistan had big problems with Russia Russia is is is deploying their mobile
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.240]  launchers openly saying that this could lead to nuclear war we saw Cheney
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.960]  launch the 888 attack into Georgia and they were landing NATO troops until the
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.880]  Russians sent in nukes and went on TV their chairman of joint chiefs said
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.480]  we're preparing to launch nuclear weapons at theater forces and the United
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.360]  States pulled out then it shows a level of insane brinksmanship by the Anglo
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.120]  American elite and I see Admiral Mullen and Fox Fallon before him all saying
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.680]  don't do it don't do it holding him back now they put Dempsey in who military
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.240]  officers I've talked to high-level say is someone who will do whatever he's
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.320]  told and it's not too intelligent I know you have high-level sources how close is
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.960]  this now because I see Netanyahu saying looks like he's gonna get the green
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.080]  light here pretty soon well it's all depends on Obama and the dumb Americans
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.560]  who continue to support Obama and unfortunately we don't have anything on
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.040]  the Republican side we have Republicans who could be qualified to replace Obama
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.080]  but they're not running right now unfortunately and we have some Democrats
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.520]  who also could do the right job but they are not running or they're just
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:52.640]  keeping that behind the scenes but the point is unless we remove Obama from
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:18:01.400]  office very soon I don't see that there's much possibility of avoiding a
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:07.160]  thermonuclear war there will be our options but they're not clearly defined
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.680]  options there too many catches in the whole process sir my question is and I
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.840]  want you to elaborate on your deep understanding of this and your prediction
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.920]  of it coming to this head what does the elite think they're gonna do if they
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.280]  start a nuclear war and their first strike and getting to knock out all
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.600]  them forces of Russia and China they'll never get them all well the point is the
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.480]  there people who are called elites most of them have just been dumped to the
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.360]  rank of bums most of the people who were involved for example Wall Street the
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:45.480]  entire shebang is bankrupt the whole US system is bankrupt you can't save it in
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.960]  this present form the only thing you can do is you can go through a reform and
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:55.000]  reform means cancel most of this debt which is not worth anything never will
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.280]  be worth anything and go through first Glass-Steagall if you don't go through
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.880]  Glass-Steagall in the United States and other nations as in Europe but are
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.720]  thinking in the same direction if you don't cancel the gambling money and go
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.520]  back to the saying that that money which is legally money under our system under
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.040]  our Constitution yes we can we can defend that we will defend it but that
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.600]  money which is gambling money is not going to be defended but under Glass-Steagall
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.080]  as Franklin Roosevelt determined I'd stay there sir we've got to go to break I
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.600]  want to come back and get more into this gambling money and for new listeners
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.000]  the bankers created over a thousand trillion in garbage they had it
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.800]  certified as real that's the debt now hanging over us so they hold us hostage
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:46.840]  and have us shine ourselves over to pay off their debt which is fraudulent and
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:52.760]  is not our debt so he's saying write it off get rid of it Ron Paul says that it's
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.960]  us or them we'll be right back these mad men want to start a giant war they
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:06.080]  admit that folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our

[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.840]  Lenin LaRouche is our guest for the rest of the hour trying to get to be a video
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:27.640]  skype from the east coast and let me tell you I have never seen skype look this
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.720]  good it looks like high-def television if you're listening on the radio you can
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:36.540]  also go to prisonplanet.tv and watch mr. LaRouche right there from his research
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:40.800]  center sir when you first got on that short little segment you said they're
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.240]  attempting to establish and I want you to go over this in your own words a global
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.360]  dictatorship that's what PNAC of course called for and and speak to that and the
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:57.080]  madness of these people I understand that they are inbred they're entitled many of
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:03.360]  them are addled by decadence and and I see other elites actually warning of
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.760]  this at a record level you're not the only one saying this they're people in
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.040]  the system as you know so speak to their goals speak to how they think they'll
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.180]  execute this final takeover and then speak to what some of your inside
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:21.200]  sources are telling you they've got to be horrified well the fact of the matter
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.040]  is we have only one real problem that is a central problem that's called the
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.760]  British Empire now the British Empire still exists it it's essentially not
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.840]  it's a monarchy yes but the real character of the British Empire is it's a
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.720]  it's a monetary system and it's an evolution from the original Roman Empire
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.840]  from the Byzantine Empire which collapsed from the Crusader system which
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.360]  also collapsed and now if this was created as a new Venetian system in
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.760]  its time which became the British Empire but the essence this thing is a
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:02.360]  monetary system and the capital of the monetary system of the world today
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.280]  largely as a result of the corruption of the United States and it's we are
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.720]  destruction of our own Constitution essentially the British Empire does really
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.800]  act as the center of the control over this planet sure it's a British Empire
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:23.000]  model of crony capitalist insider money changer manipulation it's not
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.080]  capitalism it's gangsterism well it is but what it is actually is it's evil
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:33.440]  it's like the Roman Empire and we've got a president of the United States who
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:41.040]  thinks like one of the Roman emperors but the the thing is is the system which
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:47.520]  they this process has tried to control has reached the point that as wars have
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.360]  gone on the methods of killing in warfare have been improved we've now
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.040]  reached the stage that if you want to conduct a serious war on a global scale
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.440]  you have to use the available weapons which are thermonuclear weapons so we
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.800]  have a small group of people most of Wall Street their crowns they're not
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.080]  really serious people but they're all tied to this British monarchy system
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:19.120]  which is a monetary system which and not all the people are not in on it it's a
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.280]  very small number but they are to controlling the world so now here's what
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.320]  we have we've reached the point the existing system we came out of World
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:34.440]  War two is with a victory Truman was a disaster and we began to go down
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.120]  Eisenhower was fairly good in terms of defending on all issues and saved us
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:46.320]  Kennedy's an excellent job as president but they killed him and then they killed
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.040]  his brother now the result of killing both Kennedy's brothers number one we
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.160]  got World War two or rather the not not just war or two we got the breakdown
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.060]  system the inter-China war it would never have happened if Jack Kennedy had
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:05.440]  not been assassinated Vietnam yes and that went on for about ten years when
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.600]  you take the whole effectively inter-China war the result was that
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.640]  everyone was scared because the cover-up of the assassination of Kennedy who did
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:24.360]  it scared everybody we then we got into a system of more wars and for example
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.720]  more what more British wars that wars in Asia and we had this build-up of a
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.520]  permanent system of warfare and now they've run out of people to conquer
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.520]  they've run up to China they've run up to Pakistan they've run up to Russia and
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.480]  the Russians and Chinese aren't gonna back off no but this Russia is the key
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:48.640]  figure in this thing because Russia has the intellectual military ups outlook
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.400]  which is very crucial in this kind of thing and Russia is really a leading
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:00.480]  space science nation and we're going into space science mankind is if we
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.720]  survive this nonsense we go into but the problem we are now at that point the
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.720]  British Empire is doomed it can no longer function on this planet in the
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.840]  way it has function it can only function by destroying all my almost
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.600]  everybody else or getting them to destroy each other so that's the
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:24.000]  situation we face and both many of us know this we know the fact but their
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.200]  reasons why various people don't talk about like our official military leaders
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.320]  who do know this but they don't want to go through all the details there's good
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.880]  reasons for that I speak freely stay there we got a long segment coming up
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.960]  let's let's let's look at it from their perspective though how they think they'll
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.840]  play us off against each other in a nuclear war that type of divide and
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:49.840]  conquer madness this isn't like it's two pygmy tribes are playing off against
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:55.760]  each other we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.320]  why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that was still starving and my
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.660]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.120]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.680]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.580]  talking to one of the greatest living political analysts and that's Lenin
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:29.920]  LaRouche and he looks like he's about 75 he's about to be 90 here in a few

[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:12.200]  freedom is popular not having wars is popular most of the brass even current
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.600]  have said don't have war we saw a big Washington Post page size ad last
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.480]  weekend and it ran a weekend before that with all these former top generals
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:27.640]  saying do not attack Iran you've got most of the Israeli leadership saying
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.280]  don't do it but then there's this controlled media here in the US acting
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.800]  like you're a traitor to America or that you hate Israel if you don't want
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:43.920]  this attack on Iran it just goes from bad to worse and we have the West driving
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.360]  Pakistan and the arms of China we've got all these preparations and when Lenin
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:54.560]  LaRouche talks about Wall Street being bombs they have been so insulated like
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:58.960]  Caligula or Nero with unlimited power and fraud that they've gotten delusional
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.200]  as Bernie Madoff said he said look I'm just doing what everybody else does and
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.920]  that's true and I'm not saying he's a good guy he just wasn't as insider as
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.800]  others he was the creator of the Nasdaq I mean he was upper echelon but I
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:19.480]  remember a few weeks ago a top executive at Goldman Sachs Greg Smith and you know
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:27.480]  he was one of their top managers slash presidents he came out and said they
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:31.080]  called people scum they call them idiots they talk about ripping them off they
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:37.640]  call them Muppets this is basically a criminal enterprise and he said I can't
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:44.040]  be part of this anymore and we've had another managing director Nomi Prince
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:48.280]  who left nine years ago she's talked wrote books about how this was gonna
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.160]  happen they knew all this they said in motion something that they knew would be
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.240]  too big to fail or would destroy the whole economy but it's so big it is
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.480]  destroying it they're the fraudsters they're conquered Europe through fraud
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.880]  all they're having is success waving nuclear weapons around but Russia is
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.920]  saying we're not gonna go along with this and I get emails from people saying
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.800]  you're for Russia you're a traitor folks my family came over here on the Mayflower
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.960]  I know Linda LaRouge's family goes way back to start of this country in
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.840]  Quakers I'm an American as it gets it's not pro America to let a bunch of foreign
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.360]  megabanks run us into the ground and start giant wars that could lead most
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.960]  analysts say Linda LaRouge isn't fair mongering here many analysts are saying
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.520]  this could easily lead to World War three Google it the top brass keeps
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:44.320]  saying don't do it don't do it don't do it and the bankers who are so crazy the
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.880]  you've seen the emails from Goldman Sachs you're going oh let's sell some
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:54.440]  bleeping you know what to our customers ripping old ladies off they are I've
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.720]  been around some of these Wall Street guys a guy that was high level in it
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:03.760]  worked with George Soros his son was Max Kaiser and he said that they saw the
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.040]  clients has come and and they told him if you don't have a bunch of lawsuits
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.200]  against you for stealing you're not doing your job now get in there and steal
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:17.080]  these are people who run the aircraft carriers the spy satellites they run
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.120]  America you look at it they call the shots and where do they come out of the
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.000]  city of London within London and they're dangerous their hubris filled their mad
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.800]  dogs I wouldn't be surprised they don't make their horses consulate like
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.600]  Caligula this has happened before what do we do Linda LaRouge with the madness
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.440]  of these people and their crazy puppet who's on vacation half the month and
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.880]  and you know running around guzzling alcohol on television every day what do
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.600]  we do about a mad imperial elite you got two things one thing you have to have
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:55.000]  people with guts number two we do have solutions that are available to us if we
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.520]  want to choose them which means you have to mobilize the American people to
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.040]  recognize not what's wrong that's important to consider but when you see
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:13.600]  how wrong it is you have to say wait a minute what then is right now we could
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:19.560]  solve this problem if we could get the right person in as president during
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:26.080]  these months right now first of all Glass-Steagall kill off the speculation
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.960]  yes they're going to go bankrupt but they're already are bankrupt so you're
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.200]  not taking anything away from them that they have it that's theirs they've been
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.440]  taking it from you so what you have to do you have to get Glass-Steagall first
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.480]  that has to be done almost immediately that would stop the bleeding but it
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.360]  wouldn't solve the problem we have to go to another step we have to tell Andrew
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:57.000]  Jackson made a terrible mistake when he canceled the original system constitutional
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  system of banking of the United States and if we go back to that kind of system
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.680]  today which is by a declaration of government but he was afraid it would
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.200]  be taken over by private interest but instead we got the thing that's even
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:17.560]  worse we got a foreign central bank oh he was no Jackson was a part of the
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:23.640]  international interest ripping us off really yeah he was yeah you take his his
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.200]  successor and you took it the guy who really created him there's the British
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.040]  spy who did more of the dirty work against the United States in those
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.400]  early days than anyone else but so that you had a ripoff of the United States the
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.680]  principles of Alexander Hamilton on banking on national banking that
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:51.120]  principle on federal credit that principle applied now to supplement Glass-Steagall
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:57.720]  would in itself and by itself lead to a cessation of this inflation and Lincoln
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.000]  did that so did Kennedy started it that's right and when they killed Kennedy
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.800]  and got by with it and then killed his brother Bob and brought in you know whom
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.920]  we started on the road all the way down we've been going sliding down ever
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.960]  since and therefore if we would return to those principles which are our
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:22.680]  Constitution or act the actual Constitution our actual intention and
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.120]  we do it today or start doing it today in terms of getting these bums who are
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:33.080]  not qualified for president you can't do this kind of job get them all but that's
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.560]  common sense to get Glass-Steagall back in place they're not even really
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.800]  discussing it a few Congress people have tried and then they've gotten run out of
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.240]  office like Dennis Kosinich let me ask you this because you put out alerts over
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.160]  LaRouche PAC comm and then your executive alert system the folks can sign up
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:55.040]  for online that's indispensable a little Rouge again as our guest why are they
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.960]  racing to tell Congress they don't control war anymore which is obvious
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:08.200]  treason why are they openly announcing to everybody that Obama is activating a
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:12.080]  nationalization of the economy which isn't even nationalization because foreign
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.880]  banks are running it so it's a foreign corporate takeover receivership like the
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:21.920]  austerity we see in Europe we're going under that same system what is their
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:28.000]  plan why are they moving all of this into high gear they want to eliminate the
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  memory of the United States and we don't have people in so far who have had the
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.800]  guts and the position to throw Obama out of office if Obama is not thrown out of
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.840]  office you better kiss the United States goodbye where you still have the
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.480]  chance wow so let me be clear because I know some of the same interests are
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.360]  behind Romney that are behind him and more and more now Romney is the presumptive
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:59.800]  you know person there I doesn't if he doesn't figure is very important except
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.280]  as a nuisance in my record okay so you're saying they're gonna give it to
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.800]  Obama you have well they don't care what they want to do is destroy the United
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.360]  States if they destroy the United States then the only obstacles to
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:18.160]  destruction of the set planet lie in Russia China India and so forth which
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:23.360]  are major powers and their own right but we if the United States goes and we're
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.400]  about to go if the if the dictatorship the fascist dictatorship by by this
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.560]  president we have now if that's allowed to continue you're not going to have a
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.240]  United States unit probably not going to have a world well I think you just said
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.040]  you put your finger on it and I want you to elaborate please sir they have the
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.480]  head of the CIA come out and say yeah we're spying on you without warrants two
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.480]  weeks ago a week and a half ago we have government openly announcing that we're
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:54.680]  run by foreign powers and the Congress is vestigial or ceremonial openly we
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:00.880]  have just a flaunting of corruption now you'll banning protest arresting people
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.880]  for filming I mean the system has put the message out drive them into
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:10.920]  submission and you're saying that's to fully break us and make a clean break
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.160]  with freedom this is like Adolf Hitler you know you go into the picture of how
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:21.080]  Adolf Hitler came to power he was treated originally as a joke by most
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:26.480]  Germans until he took his measures and started assassinating people and put
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:32.160]  him in the prisons and then he that took over and he was run by the British at
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.720]  that time Hitler was a British creation I want you to elaborate as people think
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.680]  that's a joke that's why the deputy fear flew over with the treaty parachuted
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.160]  out they locked him up for life and those documents have come out that they
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.960]  set him up in intelligence he thought he was gonna have an alliance with with
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.520]  England a deal to go into France they would then team up and take out the
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.880]  Russians then and this is why that he wouldn't bomb the British cities he kept
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.680]  saying we have a deal the king was a Nazi he had to advocate see people don't
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.760]  know this history please elaborate on that well just take the case of the guy
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.640]  who created Hitler by saving him from bankruptcy
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:18.640]  Prescott Bush the father of George HW Bush and the grandfather of the George
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:25.400]  W. Bush these people they were I don't think Prescott Bush was clever I don't
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.440]  think that George HW Bush was particularly intelligent that was at the
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:35.560]  irony of mating putting him in charge of the CIA was a very bad joke against the
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.320]  human species and the drunken son the dope addict as the president for two
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:47.520]  terms it was not much help either so we do have these inside jobs who whose
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.040]  function is not to lead the world but whose function is to make a mess of
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.800]  everything that should be done is that why they I mean Nixon wasn't a good guy
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.320]  overall but they went after him to weaken the idea of a real president no he
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.680]  wasn't a real president what do you take the case you say why was we
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:12.600]  understand why the oligarchy ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy one of
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.520]  the reasons was to prevent him from stopping us from going into long wars
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:24.000]  in Asia but then why did they kill Bobby his brother later well Bob Kennedy
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.840]  Robert Kennedy was about to get win the Democratic nomination for president and
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:36.640]  by killing him they cleared the way for Nixon and Nixon was simply a dumb bunny
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:42.120]  bad news no I know that but why did they didn't set him up they set him up they
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  set him up because they wanted to get look what you got you got after that
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:52.480]  with a little adjustment you got Connor Connor was the living joke of American
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:58.240]  history and he had the trilateral crew in their total New World Order agents
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:04.080]  okay so so so so so this oligarchy really thinks because that's their plan
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.040]  they're even selling oh nuclear wars are doable now I see that in defense
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:12.520]  publications let's have a nuclear war I mean cook some hot dogs you know on it
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:18.720]  nuclear war is not on the table anymore some a nuclear war and people will talk
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.160]  about nuclear war we're talking about some a nuclear war right thermal excuse
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.560]  me much more powerful yeah we're not but it's only that is qualitative you're
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.720]  talking to a completely different kind of universal chemistry I mean you can be
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:37.360]  understood in general and we can go to matter and I matter systems but before
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.600]  going to add I matter matter and I matter systems we're now at the point of
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.960]  thermonuclear weapons and the thermonuclear weapon capability which is
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:52.040]  represented best in terms of best quality with best ability is by what is by
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.800]  the Ohio class and systems submarine systems but if you start using that
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.400]  remember if you put you're trying to put Russia and China and India against the
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.720]  United States in particular what are you setting up these are new
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:12.240]  thermonuclear powers which means that the one who wants to start the war as a
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:17.480]  thermonuclear talk is gonna go throw everything they can at a first shot at
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:24.600]  the target of nations and in a couple of seconds later then Russia China and
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.440]  India are going to know that that's happened in that direction and they're
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:34.440]  gonna return the favor now what does the planet gonna look like after you get
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:38.920]  that kind of thermonuclear warfare exchange going on you're not gonna have
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.200]  food because you're gonna be killing off the means on which and you're gonna
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:49.520]  create weather conditions just that simple set of it you're willing to do it
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.640]  because they have a fantasy of reducing the population and then emerging from
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  their bunkers a few years later it's worse it's worse what they're doing now
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.040]  there the British are operating as the British is the British monarchy is the
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:07.120]  center of this nobody else Obama's simply a British puppet anyway but the
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.400]  British monarchy is that they think of themselves as an empire they think of
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.400]  themselves as an empire in the Christian the Roman Empire is called the
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.640]  oligarchical system and this group is now operating on the basis that they can
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:24.520]  be they are dead if they if they try to function on a normal basis they're
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:28.960]  finished that there's no chance one so how are they going to survive if they
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.720]  can destroy the United States destroy Russia China and so forth without
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.240]  getting too much damage done to themselves they can make they can regain
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:44.080]  their empire otherwise they don't give it to him and the British monarchy doesn't
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.520]  care who lives or dies it just cares on one thing that there will never be a
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:55.080]  ruling force on this planet to support to take the role away from the British
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.600]  Empire well have you also noticed that betray us and others are getting all
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.400]  these foreign knighthoods that it's in the Constitution that that's illegal
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.840]  they're there they're entering an agreement and being part of an
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:10.320]  organization of a foreign government they're just flaunting the usurpation of
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.360]  our country I guess trying to set the legal precedent by possessing us
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.920]  possession is nine-tenths of the law well you look at the look at the Bush
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:24.520]  family George HW Bush he was one of the first to get these one of these nice
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:30.760]  appointments as a British subject and it went on to become president of the
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.720]  United States who's working for whom what's incredible people don't know that
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.840]  you get this patronage you get houses money all sorts of stuff with that I
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.600]  mean it's an open payoff this is the way the system works at born George Bush
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.560]  HW Bush is really nothing I mean as a man is nothing in terms of the standard

[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:12.280]  better it's our final segment with Lenin LaRouche and LaRouchePak.com I really
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:17.280]  appreciate him joining us once a month or so and with his commentary and
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.600]  unfortunately I have to agree with everything he's saying I want to talk a
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.400]  little bit about how we do hopefully get rid of this globalist puppet Obama but
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.720]  there's a giant campaign they're talking about having criminal charges
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.320]  against Limbaugh for making fun of somebody who wanted thousands of dollars
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.880]  of condoms but meanwhile Robert De Niro can make fun of anybody he wants
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:42.440]  including you know presidential candidates wives they're trying to get him
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.840]  off the air I know some behind-the-scenes stuff affiliates that
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:48.960]  we're on they also have Limbaugh we've never seen such an attack and I agree
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.320]  with this article out of the Associated Press radio campaign next step
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.760]  against Rush Limbaugh and it goes on to break down that it is an attempt to
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:06.120]  shut down free speech and we have Sarkozy saying visiting hate sites and my
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:10.000]  site gets listed as hate I've seen a little LaRouche demonized by the Southern
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.680]  Property Law Center and ADL and others as hate I mean this is just a mild-mannered
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.080]  state you know statesmen talking about issues they they are really getting
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.200]  ready to go out for free speech what's your take on that I mean even if I
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.000]  disagree with a lot of what Limbaugh says we've got a stand for his free
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.240]  speech because if they can bring him down they're openly saying this is gonna
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.640]  be a new reign of terror to kick people off of radio and TV I think they kill
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.760]  Breitbart he had stuff that was gonna destroy Obama anybody that tries to
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:44.400]  bring down Obama is in deep trouble yeah that's true but you have to have the
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.000]  guts to do it then you take a case like Limbaugh well we you people like me we
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:56.760]  know what Limbaugh is we also know that if he if they can use him as a target
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:02.680]  for persecution of this type that's being done then we all lose our freedom
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:08.400]  and so therefore you let the guys who've got the kooky ideas and so forth let
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.440]  them speak and get the truth out instead I'm concerned about getting across the
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.960]  truth about what will save this nation and I'm not too much that much
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:24.200]  concerned about people a little bit funny it's the what's net what's needed for
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.960]  example we need Glass-Steagall now and you will never get it unless Obama's
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:34.760]  removed otherwise it's a popular conception we need other things we need
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:38.840]  to go to a credit system in order to look for example we got one of the
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.240]  greatest water crisis the United States has ever experienced and it hits most of
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:50.400]  these lands from the Pacific toward the West now we we've got a project called
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:55.640]  the WAPA it would take 30 years to complete it by the original design it's
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.360]  been redesigned for modern conditions now and other things this program even
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:06.160]  when it begins to be developed will be a restoration of the management of our
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:09.840]  water system and would be the restoration of our ability to grow
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.560]  That's right the British system admits they're destroying our entire damn
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.840]  infrastructure everything and people shouldn't forget you are credited with
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:21.440]  the original brainchild idea which they took from you but it's on record that
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:25.200]  Reagan read your reports and that's where he got the idea and that's on that
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.360]  that's in the Washington Post you had the brainchild of Star Wars but not as
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:36.040]  an offensive system as a way to share and then end war because it was it cut
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.400]  nuclear weapons out of the equation that's right because we had we can do it
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.280]  again today we still have this thing we have problems in the solar system which
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:50.000]  are very dangerous for us over the coming period we have the beginnings of
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.040]  the technology needed to overcome many of these problems for example we could be
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.960]  hit by a giant rock of a certain size they coming by us all the time if one
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.480]  of them clobbered us in the vicinity of the North Pole everybody in this
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:10.040]  planet this nation would be dead but we have the means of technologies now
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:15.160]  which we can put to work which will enable us to prevent such things from
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.360]  happening Wow little Rouge I know you're a busy man but maybe you can come back

[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:42.760]  speech how the government is using hacker groups as a pretext to shut down
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:46.120]  freedom on the web the name of protecting it we got to take the freedom away
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.560]  to protect it because the stock stand which the government launched that's
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:54.160]  coming up and we're also gonna get into Nicholas Sarkozy saying go to hate
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.640]  sites we're gonna arrest you and then this whole thing is a stage that will
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.920]  cover more of that after the break but I wanted to talk to you first about Rush
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:07.720]  Limbaugh Kurt Rush Limbaugh made some mild statements compared to what Robert
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:13.720]  De Niro said about Mitt Romney's wife and others you know racist comments you
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:15.760]  know he's making the joke about a woman who wants thousands of dollars in
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.360]  condoms and saying man you're a you know such and such and whether that's
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.800]  untasteful or not I wouldn't say something like that that's his free
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:27.040]  speech media matters whose memos got leaked as you know a year ago so we're
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:32.000]  gonna infiltrate media alternative media Fox Rush you name it and destroy
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.040]  them from within that's espionage that's criminal sabotage and it's George
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:41.080]  Soros financing it there and I'm on their radar and I've always said this
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:44.320]  when Glenn Beck's behind the scenes doing stuff to us and other things I said
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:48.320]  look guys you better watch out because the globalists are gonna blow stuff up
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.280]  and blame it on us and then the memos came out where these White House
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:55.320]  advisors said have an Oklahoma blaming on the libertarian right wing and people
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.240]  say well don't defend Limbaugh you know he's not a real patriot whatever the
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:02.480]  globalists see him in the same box they're coming after it's all it's like
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.040]  Breitbart there was evidence of him killing him he was going after Obama
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:09.720]  didn't mean I agree with all he's doing there's evidence of him killing him the
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:13.640]  point is the system is now ready to get rid of the fake right that they've been
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.440]  playing patty cake with things are moving fast as you heard Lyndon LaRouche
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.720]  say who you could call a classic American liberal system you know he's
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.640]  certainly not a Republican now we're about to go to break here but Kurt your
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.560]  view on them openly saying they want to destroy Rush Limbaugh I mean this is so
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.920]  authoritarian well they obviously set him up to come after us or come after the
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.680]  alternative media I mean he's he's you know he doesn't pose the threat to the
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:43.360]  system he's absolutely right in their ballpark actually when it comes down to
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.480]  it part of the false right left paradigm but if they can take him down they can
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:50.760]  take him down they can set a precedent to go after anybody they want to and
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.960]  notice our cozy singer us people that visit sites they don't like well so cozy
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:57.320]  I mean France is a totally different deal they don't have a bill of rights in
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:02.120]  a constitution like we do that's an interesting thing the whole thing with
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.400]  what's going on in France is very interesting they're now saying this guy
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:10.800]  this guy they killed this supposed the supposed terrorist is is a lone wolf
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:16.080]  which it's always the lone wolf always goes to a training camp always protected
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.400]  always a known and then dies yesterday I said over and over again I said watch
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:24.960]  him die like I even said before he was in the apartment I said watch him die in
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:29.320]  a fake apartment blast right same day the same thing in Spain Kurt yes
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:33.840]  absolutely with the Barcelona stuff yeah we need to do a report Madrid's it was
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.000]  Madrid we need to do a flashback on that yes now the main reason I want to get

[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.440]  operatives well we saw when the FBI supposedly busted
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:59.280]  Sabu which was his name for the supposed leader of Lusek that he was an FBI
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.640]  informant he said he's an operative and he was given orders to his his fellows
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.320]  there to engage this behavior and that came out in court documents but they
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.640]  still burn their minions though absolutely absolutely it does not pay to
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.360]  work for these guys you end up dead or in prison I mean why would even if you
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:20.920]  were immoral why would you want to work with a group that almost always burns

[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:10.000]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network you know
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.800]  I just got an idea and I don't care if it draws down the iron attacks of the
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:22.800]  globalist Ted Anderson advertised some of my DVDs on Rush Limbaugh before and the
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:29.280]  ad campaign barely paid for itself but the mission was to get the films out and
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.000]  I know his advertising is gonna be a lot cheaper now that this happened I'm gonna
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.640]  advertise on Rush Limbaugh not my show because they won't want that I'm gonna
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:42.200]  advertise a book a film whatever I'm gonna do a big advertising buy on Rush
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:48.600]  Limbaugh and then we'll educate his kind of neocon adult audience and so it's a
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:53.360]  win-win-win but I'm not gonna let media matters do this and I know we've got
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.680]  some big people out there listening in fact I may even tell some of my sponsors
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.960]  they should go advertise over there because I mean we've got to keep him
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:05.800]  on air now that George Soros and the globalist are openly trying to shut him
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:08.880]  down because they're bragging that they want to shut down all the libertarian
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:13.240]  conservative radio and and web freedom I mean they're saying that's their mission
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:17.440]  and even if I totally disagree with Limbaugh I mean I mean he could be Keith
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:20.400]  Oberman that they were trying to get him off the only time I say take somebody
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:24.800]  off air is if they're saying take my liberties if Limbaugh said you'll ban
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.480]  my guns and trying to take my see it is when people try to take your freedom
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.640]  that's when they're the enemy when they've got a view about some larger
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:37.360]  general issue my point is boycotts are fine but when you look at it not being a
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.840]  real grassroots group but George Soros I mean this is despicable well didn't
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:44.720]  they just it was yesterday they introduced a bill in California that's
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:47.960]  that's related to Limbaugh didn't they oh yeah they're people teach bill or
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.640]  something they're talking about making it criminal I mean that's what they want
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:55.040]  right that's what they want I mean I've had these groups because everybody knows
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:58.720]  I don't cover racial stuff on my show and I'm for everybody I actually get
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.800]  criticized by some because they get mad at the whole multicultural deal they go
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.440]  Alex you know that's really a racist move and I'm like I know but I'm trying to
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:08.960]  get everybody to have freedom here I've had groups go into this before and try
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:12.440]  to manufacture what I've said and I've had to get on the phone with affiliates
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.480]  and say have you heard it I mean they'll take anything and turn it into
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.720]  something they're out there after us to I mean look I mean I'm on media matters
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.920]  every week Limbaugh is on there every day I mean George and they pose as a
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.320]  non-partisan group and it's come out Kurt they're run by the White House well
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.720]  this eventually go to the Supreme let me say that again the White House is trying
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:35.200]  to kick Rush Limbaugh off the air that's why I'm against it go ahead but
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.440]  this will go to the Supreme Court obviously but in the meantime what it
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:42.120]  was do be a chilling effect on Clear Channel and no well it's not gonna
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.240]  chill me I'll tell you right now and and let me tell Clear Channel and local
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:49.160]  radio stations that I know carry a show that aren't Clear Channel owned and I've
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:52.160]  told program directors because they're like man this is scary they're even
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.280]  coming after us I go you better stand up against this to these thugs trying to
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:02.480]  destroy our First Amendment I'm serious I mean people are like some radio
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.280]  insiders are like hey Alex more stations are gonna dump Limbaugh and put you on
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:10.280]  I'm like I don't want that I'm on up against Limbaugh I found out that
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.120]  Huckabee's kind of pleased and they're advertising to try to get people to throw
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.840]  him off and put Huckabee on that's despicable Huckabee who said he likes
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.280]  Obama and he's a good Christian man a month or two ago he knows which way it's
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:25.520]  going he said give me Limbaugh spot I love Obama I love Obama give me Limbaugh
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.480]  spot what was Limbaugh I don't listen to Limbaugh so I don't know but what does
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.400]  his take on Romney we did was he a four against Romney he was back and forth but
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.280]  he he kind of like Gennrich yeah right right hey but here's my issue I know I
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.560]  made you come in today talk about your story and it's kind of like your good
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.480]  egg big man you just kind of add little points what about have you in her full
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:49.480]  time Kurt how would you like to be a co-host now all right all right tell us
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:55.320]  about your big report it's important well today I wrote a report on Lucic and
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:01.040]  anonymous anonymous is threatening to take down the internet on April 1st no
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:07.120]  March 31st by attacking the DNS servers which are the domain domain but the
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:10.680]  Pentagon what has a bill to take that over right now they'll they'll keep it
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:16.800]  safe right oh oh but the whole point is is these groups are ridiculous they are
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.640]  supposedly political but they don't do anything that's really political they're
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:26.520]  a joke I mean the very name Lucic is a take on lolol laughing out loud
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.080]  laughing out loud security is the actual name of the group what does that mean
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:34.360]  doesn't mean anything so politically they're nothing with their non-starters
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.520]  well they do this stuff they say they try to brand hacking as it's just fun
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.560]  direct things to laugh you know to get the lutz or whatever right but the truth
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.880]  is that's government trying to take it over and make hacking look bad so they
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.040]  call it anonymous anonymous does some good stuff just random people and then
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:55.440]  they demonize it with their own operatives have you proven our FBI
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.920]  right I think they have a lot of useful idiots working for them too that
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:02.320]  actually believe this is some kind of political thing or or the fun aspect
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:07.200]  you're talking about yeah but it's not it's it's a total I think it's total you
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.320]  know psi up just to demonize hackers well your report goes over that what do
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:15.560]  you make a portray us saying yeah we're using all your appliances to watch him
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.160]  that's scary yeah that was that word report that came out earlier in the
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.600]  week yeah I mean he gave a speech and brag and people thought it was a joke
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.800]  kind of like when the big bioethicist group said let's start killing little
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:28.040]  kids even though they're healthy everybody's like that that's a joke right
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:32.280]  they're like no we're gonna kill them but then I'm bad for reporting occur right
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.280]  well this whole thing they want to put these support this so-called smart
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.240]  technology and everything washing machines televisions the whole nine
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:41.520]  years it's just part of the surveillance grid and then the data goes over your
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.720]  power line so there's no looking enough to a connection isn't that great by the
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:49.640]  way I want to do a report on all this smart technology I've begged Watson
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:53.200]  because people think I'm joking about the government with grants when police
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:56.280]  departments get homeless security grants they go yeah here's this smart lightbulb
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:00.080]  by the way here's a grant for computers and the light bulb flickers and
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:04.400]  interfaces with a sensor and programs the computer remotely right and when I say
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.240]  that people think I'm joking it's been in the Associated Press but no one
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.440]  believes it yeah and these in these drone projects they're they're giving
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:14.760]  police departments they're all financed by the Department of Homeland Security
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.520]  it's just total integration of the federal government and local police and
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.960]  then it's a hidden tax when you pay for a smartphone or you pay for a dishwasher
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  the it's getting where you can't even buy the old ones they don't have the tech
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:30.280]  in them so it breaks there's gonna be a big business and keeping the old stuff
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.600]  running or they have regulations now okay I have that places can't fix it I
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:39.520]  mean this is a gen 21 you pay in the cost of the item for all the backdoors and
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:44.000]  I saw an article in Wired again and one in CNET where all the backdoors is why
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.400]  the iPhones and droids drain so fast I had a droid and had to get rid of it
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.200]  because it would be charge an hour because all the spy stuff in the back
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.600]  well now they're encouraging you to put all your data on their on their servers
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.000]  iCloud business and stuff yeah the cloud yeah so so I get in this it's not really
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.880]  a cloud it's more like a sewage tank get in the sewage tank right that doesn't
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.440]  sound so fun hey let's get into your report I mean we said a yesterday false
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:15.000]  flag break down what happened with this Mohammed character over there I mean
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.560]  this is the classic earmarks well there was a report yesterday that he was being
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.840]  followed by French intelligence which is basically means that he's being handled
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:31.240]  by just like Muhammad and the so-called hijackers in Florida were being
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:36.440]  followed by the federal government and the FBI and the CIA the same thing was
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.680]  going on in France there he was totally handled by them and obviously the guy
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:45.400]  probably did think he was some kind of al-Qaeda you know big wig going out
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:50.440]  doing a lone wolf thing for his jihad but notice always the same thing a lone
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.720]  wolf being handled by government informants we know intelligence was all
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.160]  around him he thought some of his friends were in French and you know we're
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:00.560]  all kind of really French intelligence that's all being confirmed now he's a
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.000]  lone wolf last guy that tries to beat Sarkozy 10 points ahead gets set up by
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.280]  French intelligence with a hooker claiming he raped her now it turned out
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:13.960]  that wasn't true now you've got Le Pen's daughter set to win now
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.280]  Sarkozy gets looked like a hero he's getting a bump in the polls and he's
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.520]  saying he's gonna shut down nationalist sides that are supporting Le Pen
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:25.400]  right absolutely well you the whole thing is a set up to I mean look the
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.960]  election French elections are coming up Le Pen was growing in the in the polls
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:33.880]  and so they just pulled up a false flag and by the way that's just not us
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.420]  saying that here's the financial times of London Sarkozy stands to gain most
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:43.680]  from what happened and remember I said he'll be a lone wolf he would have been
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.640]  trained at a camp or released from a camp all that's been confirmed you'll
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.000]  learn that intelligence was following him for years you'll learn that people
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.920]  warned the police turns out that's in the news today right turns out and he'll
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:17:01.120]  die he'll die which remember what happened in Spain remember what happened on
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:05.320]  the 333 remember how it came out later they just blew up some people in an
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.800]  apartment said that was al-Qaeda and it turned out the police had done it right
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.120]  right absolutely I mean that came out in the Spanish news so it's always the same
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.800]  memo pretty much well of course they can't have this guy walking around
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:20.600]  talking and divulging things that are they're going to be used against the
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.400]  government in France I mean so obviously he had to die well I was looking at all
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:26.960]  the photos of the French cops and watching the news you know all these
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.000]  regular cop types out there and you saw the guys in the black mask right ski
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.760]  man's you notice those weren't even special forces type I looked at those
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.680]  were criminal eyes the guys they brought in to blow up whoever was in there I
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.600]  mean that's probably the guys that were doing the shoot they had our bands it's
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.080]  a police on it so yeah they were with the police I mean they look like something
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.720]  on a central casting for gangsters they absolutely I'm just saying you could
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:50.800]  even see them next to the regular cops I'm telling you that those weren't even
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:54.920]  special operations people they were just criminals right right well it's
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.040]  interesting like I said the timing we need to look at the timing it was right
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:02.280]  before an election why didn't this happen hey we said day one that the
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.960]  Dominique Straut con was set up turned out run by Sarkozy Sarkozy screwed up
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.080]  and announced it before anybody even knew and then it turned out it was that
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:13.080]  he was under surveillance by Sarkozy right he wasn't following the script
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:19.040]  correctly I mean he said look Sarkozy is running a coup against France he's not
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.440]  even born there he's a foreign operative yep what is it with these foreign
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:28.080]  operatives I don't know but he's he's basically on the world government
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:33.400]  agenda they're pushing at him and Merkel and in Germany and Cameron and the whole
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:38.640]  crew and Obama they're all they're all just pushing the world government agenda
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:42.480]  why can't America have an American president and why can't France have a
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:46.000]  French president well obviously they're trying to tell us something I mean if
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.640]  you put Obama in there they can't even verify that he's an American a naturalized
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:52.480]  American they're trying to tell us something what are they trying to tell us
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.680]  oh well I said that you know it doesn't matter our Constitution doesn't that's
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:59.960]  what he became the head of the U.N. a few years ago violating article one section
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:04.040]  nine it is the head of the Security Council totally illegal well I mean look
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:07.040]  at how they have the Pentagon come to Congress and say you don't run jack squat
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.720]  you're right they're just saying that's the way it is a betray us is like your
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.520]  toaster is watching you haha we don't need warrants anymore and when Fox News
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:18.200]  covers it they're like he's a great man we don't know what he means by that he
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.160]  said there's no more Fourth Amendment he said we don't consider that violation
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.480]  anymore next those shove microphones down our throats and say that we don't
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.720]  consider this in violation of privacy courts are ruling with the seventh
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:33.680]  circuit they can pull you over grab your phone out of warrant download it so
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:36.360]  timing is everything it's the same thing with these activist groups we've got
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.920]  major cybersecurity legislation in Congress right now and anonymous is
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.080]  going to attack and so they're running this this little side show of these so
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.320]  called hacktivists doing all these funny things in the CIA and Sony and these big
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:54.040]  corporations and it's meaningless and it's just propaganda Nemo you are an

[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:07.040]  existence so at this point he's got some delegates he'll go to the convention

[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:23.760]  something I guess if I hope he doesn't lean over and kiss the holy ring of Lord
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:28.040]  Romney no good no I don't think he'll do that he's got too much yeah I don't think

[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:19.440]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:11.160]  a lot of gravity-fed filters out there and up of the years I have bought a lot
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:16.760]  of them and stored them and also use them in my operation and at home and when
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:22.480]  I'm on the road we've got a show propure on the road model which is just amazing
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:25.600]  because the water goes through it quicker because the gravity-fed filters
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:29.920]  much bigger it has colloidal silver impregnated in it now it's just the top
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.880]  of the line it's the best there is it's better than anything else I've ever used
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:39.040]  and it's got the best fluoride filters it's got it all info wars dot com and
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:44.680]  we're running a special that we're starting today because it's already

[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.240]  having trouble keeping them in supply they just manufactured a bunch of new
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:37.720]  ones they've been selling out these are so popular because when you compare the
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:42.240]  stainless steel the filters everything to the other leading brands and we have a
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.040]  breakdown by the way to the leading competitor it just there's no comparison
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:53.760]  and that's all at info wars dot com there on the water page as well in the
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:36:00.000]  preparedness area now some of the other news that I've got here Israel says
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.680]  threat of strike on Iran is working and that the threat of military strike on
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:08.400]  Iran is preventing the Islamic Republic from taking the final steps for
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:14.760]  developing a nuclear bomb well then please don't attack them also there are
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.880]  reports here of oil prices at $200 a barrel
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:23.480]  analysts are saying that's what's coming that's CNBC boy that happens what
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:27.920]  Lindsey Williams right also threat of refinery strike could push gas prices
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.960]  higher also CNBC and we have another report here they've killed it in the
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:38.200]  statehouse in Illinois a bill saying you can't arrest people from filming
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:44.200]  police well it's first amendment how do the cops film you it just shows man
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:47.520]  especially in Illinois now we have police officers in Illinois that call
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:51.320]  and stuff they're not all bad but the system is bad I mean that is a
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:57.760]  tyrannical government right there but what is at the head of this tyrannical
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:01.880]  government we tend to get so close to the problem and we know it's the private
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:05.240]  Federal Reserve the big six banks that own it the same system in Europe that's
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:09.440]  the problem the top of the food chain is Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.840]  Wells Fargo City Bank Bank of England to a certain extent and all those
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:17.760]  subsidiaries they're the ones that have the power to create the money for
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:20.720]  themselves they're the ones that want to get us into debt if you've got unlimited
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.840]  money how do you get property getting people into debt shutting off the
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:29.320]  regular economy so you're the only one with money they're the problem and we
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.200]  get so close to it we know that we forget others don't people finally know
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:36.960]  the Federal Reserve is private and Bernanke's having to send out bureaucrats
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:41.040]  everywhere to tell everyone and hiring famous people to be pitchmen for the
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:44.720]  Federal Reserve they're in trouble once you start identifying the power
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:48.880]  structure instead of the puppets it's game over and that's why I'm promoting
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:52.800]  and selling the book dishonest money financing the road to ruin at Joseph
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:58.400]  Plummer available at info wars.com and it's an excellent book Joe how did you
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:02.200]  awaken to this and you know describe as you do in the book exactly what
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.840]  dishonest money means and how if you don't get back to honest money nothing
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.040]  is ever gonna get fixed in this country striking at the root with dishonest
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:15.240]  money Joseph Plummer thanks for joining us great to be with you Alex and it's
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:17.960]  really nice to be able to thank you personally for all the great work you've
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:23.920]  been doing over the past nearly 20 years now as far as how I first heard
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:30.360]  about the Federal Reserve system that was probably an organization called give
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:36.000]  me liberty I believe Bob Schultz I think is when I first even heard the term
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.680]  Federal Reserve and it shows how it's a chain reaction so the last 10 years and
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:43.920]  now here you are writing a popular book it just shows how we can all do
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:48.120]  something exactly I had never heard of it of course because you certainly don't
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:51.720]  hear about it much in the mainstream media and you certainly don't hear about
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.720]  it much in the indoctrination centers so what is this Federal Reserve what's
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.240]  so bad about it and when I first started digging into it I realized that it
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.200]  everything that was available was just needlessly convoluted I started to
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:11.120]  suspect that it was intentionally being made more complicated than it needed to
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.920]  be and so after literally years and years and years of research you finally
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:21.320]  start on earth basically what it is and I think that the best way to frame it is
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:26.560]  to think of our current monetary system as literally a weapon of war that's
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.440]  exactly what it is because if people think of warfare they know warfare is
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.160]  meant to weaken the target but they think generally in terms of tanks and
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.920]  bullets and guns and things like that they don't think of other forms of
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.760]  warfare that accomplish the exact same thing and often in a way that's much
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:51.440]  better because you can't hide the aggression of tanks and bullets and
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:56.560]  guns but for instance psychological warfare is very effective at weakening
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:00.960]  targets but people may or not be aware of the fact that they're being
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:06.360]  subjected to psychological warfare. Economic warfare is something that these
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:12.560]  people have perfected and they have weakened nation after nation using the
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:16.160]  current monetary system this current fraudulent monetary system which you
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:20.040]  know so much about because you cover it but unfortunately other people don't
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:24.440]  even know what the term monetary system means and they certainly don't
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:28.840]  understand that there are different kinds of money some which are completely
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:34.560]  dishonest to basically summarize dishonest money unearned money unearned
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:39.320]  fraudulent money not money in the sense that you think of money like you have to
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:44.400]  provide a product or service if you want money and other people do too they
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:49.560]  simply create the money out of thin air and then worse than the power that would
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.520]  go with being able to simply create money out of thin air and spend it into
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:57.000]  existence they could buy up whatever they wanted worse than that they loan it
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:04.320]  into existence so they have they create this inescapable crushing debt and with
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:08.680]  that they of course they expand their power and and gain control and the goal
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:14.520]  is as you already know to establish a one-world monetary system and use that
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:23.280]  to create their global technocracy utopia how's that for an awful no no I'm
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:29.400]  just sitting back listening here go over why it's important for people to read
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:32.320]  this book even if you think you know about the Federal Reserve it's good to
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.640]  really refresh yourself on it to really understand this is the problem this is
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:39.880]  the enemy this is where all the globalist power comes from not just
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:44.120]  here but worldwide and then it's important to warn others or they're
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.640]  gonna think oh it's that darn Obama or it's that darn you know Bush or Romney or
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.880]  whoever instead of hey that's just rearranging chairs on the Titanic exactly
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:59.200]  I'll go back to the warfare analogy what do you do when you're engaged in war
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:02.920]  what is one of the first things that you want to do you want to cut the supply
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:09.480]  lines and this is the supply line this is the inexhaustible source of financing
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:14.400]  any organization or individual if they want to do something has to have the
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:20.080]  money to do it and there are limits to how much money the government can take
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:26.280]  through taxation so this provides a covert means for financing it's still
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:30.320]  taxation it's still the exact same thing if the guy if you have $10,000 and the
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:36.600]  government takes $3,000 of your money it's reduced your purchasing power by 30
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:41.720]  percent but the same thing happens if you have $10,000 and the government through
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.460]  an inflationary policy reduces the purchasing power of your money by 30
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:50.720]  percent it's the same thing the only difference is most people are unaware of
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.440]  of what's going on and what's happening they can't quite put their finger on it
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:43:00.000]  and this really is the root of our problem all of these things that the
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.880]  government is doing and again you've done such an excellent job of covering
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:11.480]  these things from injecting pregnant women with plutonium and just every
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:18.600]  horribly corrupt overtly criminal thing that the government engages in it has to
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:23.280]  have money to do these things and the Federal Reserve System is supplying
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:29.480]  these people this endless supply of money at our expense and they don't care
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.880]  what the money is for because ultimately in the end it's about weakening
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:39.120]  national sovereignty creating enormous debt weakening national sovereignty and
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.800]  then eventually once that's been achieved when when they finally do destroy
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:47.520]  the dollar and bring the United States to its knees financially they will be
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:51.760]  able to sell this you know one world currency one world global system that
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:58.320]  they've been working on for a hundred years now well you're right now Joe
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:04.320]  there's other ways they engage in this as well and one of the big ones is they'll
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.640]  give their own private banks the money at zero percent interest and then loan it
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.840]  back to us or worse they'll create all these other financial derivatives
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:17.800]  financial counterfeits outside of the fractional reserve banking system they
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:22.040]  control where for every dollar they have in there they loan out 10 or more they
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.480]  then threaten to bring down the whole system because they've created fraud
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:32.600]  have the media they own never report that hold everyone hostage and then get
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:39.640]  bailed out but because we bail them out we're then in debt to them so it's it's
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:45.800]  just so over-the-top ridiculous that people can't seem to get it because it's
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:54.360]  so ridiculous it's pretty brazen and sophisticated and I guess if you want to
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:45:00.080]  call it this I don't really consider it genius but it's a very ingenious system
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:06.120]  for transferring wealth and power away from the people who have rightfully
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:09.960]  earned it into the pockets of the people who have created this credit
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:14.040]  right and it's worse than that in fact the guys can just search engine this
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:18.720]  search engine Ben Bernanke says raise taxes or European Central Bank says
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:23.960]  raise taxes they're always saying raise taxes because they get the money in
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:28.040]  bailouts and funding they run the government that's why they have Warren
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.360]  Buffett who's basically exempt from taxes going oh I don't pay much and then
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:37.280]  his plan is raise middle-class taxes not his own I mean it's these rich pigs
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:42.560]  ripping us off running the government they're not capitalist and they blame
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:46.680]  capitalism for what they've done when it's just insider fraud and then they
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:51.000]  want to tax me and my neighbors and blue collar workers are having their taxes
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:57.440]  raised I mean it's so diabolical it's so parasitic it's so ridiculous and I
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:03.080]  want the con to end it's so obvious if we can just educate people it's over and
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:06.720]  it's a big presence he said last year and again his new book that came out two
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:10.160]  months ago I refuse to buy it at the bookstore I did go to the first chapter
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.920]  it's on that he wrote five points that face the global elite and the first one
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:19.240]  is that the people are waking up to us not our puppets so Hillary said they're
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:23.800]  losing the info war so I'm telling you folks this is coffin nails this is a
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:28.000]  stake in the vampire's heart but we're gonna have to use it on you know that's
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.200]  why your book is so important and a lot of these books on the fellow reserve were
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:34.960]  500 pages long and very technical and I don't want to say yours is yours is very
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:40.360]  well-written and it's technical as well but it's simple it's simple and that's
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:45.040]  why also promote American dream you know that we sell at a very low price at
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.480]  infowars.com because it's a 30-minute film cartoon style that anybody will
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:53.760]  watch about the fellow reserve I think this complements it very very well well
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:57.480]  I appreciate that that was the whole point of writing this book is that I
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:03.280]  just could not find anything it wasn't like I really wanted to tackle this
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:08.520]  topic it's a really ugly dry topic but I tried the best I could to make it as
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:14.120]  entertaining and simple to understand as I could and based on the feedback to
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:19.440]  this point I it's it's it's received good feedback from people who understand
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:24.760]  it and most importantly from the people who had no idea how it operates the
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.720]  systems being used against them that was really the target audience but again
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.080]  people who do understand it it's good you know I lay out all these examples of
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:36.720]  how they they're transferring the wealth how they benefit from the system now
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:39.800]  you've got it all in there but but let me just add this I should have said to
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:43.000]  you've had a lot of really successful things you were doing that you gave up
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.760]  to do this Joe Plummer is an entrepreneur civic-minded writer in 98 he published
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:51.600]  stopdrinking.com now located at how to stopdrinking.org to counter the
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:55.520]  commonly accepted disease theory of alcohol and drug addiction in 2003 he
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:59.600]  sold a successful consumer watchdog site fairbet.org I remember that site and
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.040]  began focusing full-time on corruption in government in 2004 he published
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:09.760]  stopthelie.com to expose government abuse and propaganda in 09 after six
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:13.720]  years of research he published dishonest money financing the road to ruin
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:17.200]  dishonest money explains how the elite are using our fraudulent monetary system
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:21.160]  to weaken the United States and usher in an unelected unaccountable world
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:27.120]  government the book has received great reviews and again this is it it's either
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:31.200]  us or them these it's not just like we have foreign con artist bankers that
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:36.160]  took over they happen to be eugenicist on top of it they happen to be really
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:40.960]  nasty and they've taken the world over by fraud and now they don't want us here
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:46.000]  I mean you find out they're the ones financing the anti-family the garbage in
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.680]  the vaccines the UN the land grabs it's them they're the bad guys they're the
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:55.480]  bad guys what did you think of this big Goldman Sachs exec quitting and saying
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:59.560]  we're trying to hurt our customers we call them scum we call them muppets this
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.120]  is a criminal group it's it's good you know it's interesting that you brought
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:08.760]  up all that other stuff because I'm covering all that in my next book do
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.600]  you genesis angle and a lot of other things and I'm going a step further with
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:16.960]  this honest money I try to take what is a fairly intimidating topic to most
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:21.960]  people and and really reduce it to the most simple form and and when you do
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:25.480]  that it really isn't that complicated so I want to encourage people please if
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:28.840]  nothing else to to learn about the Federal Reserve System because this
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.320]  really is like I said this is the funding mechanism that we do not
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.680]  currently control and we can yell and scream and raise our fists about what
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:39.600]  they're doing but until we can cut off the money they're going to keep doing
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:42.800]  whatever they want they can keep confiscating the money from us via
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:47.000]  inflation and through to a lesser degree even though people don't realize that
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.760]  through the taxation system we're going to have real problems but in the next
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:57.720]  book I took I took the same the same concept of trying to reach out past the
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:04.040]  choir and I wrote this is this is factual fiction and we haven't talked
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:08.560]  about this but I think you'll like the lead characters name is Alex and his
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:13.640]  last name is Watson and and yes you better believe that's a hat-tip to you
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:16.840]  yourself and of course Paul for all the work they've been doing oh that's
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:20.720]  exciting I can't wait to read that one and listen good smart folks like you
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:25.920]  writing books and doing this it makes us all safer we need there to be hundreds
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:29.320]  of thousands of Alex Joneses and Paul Watson's and they're there they're
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.800]  people like Joe Plummer I mean you guys are really kicking some behind in I
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.280]  want to talk a little bit more about some of the new developments in the Federal
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:41.200]  Reserve and how it's a sister group is taking over Europe right now with Joe
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:45.720]  Plummer the book dishonest money financing the road to ruin and I know
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:49.680]  all the other radio shows listen to my show hope you get Joe on because his
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:52.120]  book needs to get out there to people and if you got friends and family that
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:55.880]  don't get it this is a great book for people to understand why they're losing
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:00.080]  their jobs why money doesn't go as far why all this has happened we'll be right
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:05.000]  back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are

[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:24.840]  whether you love him or hate him the point is they're trying to target him
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:28.840]  as they can bring down the big guy the system sees talk radio as alternative
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:34.080]  because you can call into it and it's long-form and the system said they want
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:37.080]  to shut down talk radio they've had like 10 different senators the last three
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:42.360]  years say that we need to understand that's happening also the system wants
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:47.320]  to gear up new wars here's a really creepy article Associated Press NYPD says
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.760]  Iran has conducted surveillance in New York City ahead of quote staging
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:59.040]  attacks pray that there's not a false flag to get the Iran war going wow if you
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:02.120]  missed that little Rouge interview earlier it'll rear in the audio streams
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:08.240]  and on stations that rear the show was amazing all this is going on again the
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.440]  book is dishonest money financing the road to ruin Joseph Plummer excellent
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:17.000]  book to expose how these globalists have done this to us because if you don't
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.800]  fix this the other trying to totally set up an authoritarian system to secure
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:25.840]  their ill-gotten gains and they openly say they want to reduce our numbers
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:29.880]  because they've stolen everything they don't want us around these are really
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:35.520]  nasty people and again I just keep going back to that other points Joe you
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:39.600]  want to make about the book do you think are important think we've covered most
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:43.920]  of it just basically I want people to learn how this system is being used
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:48.320]  against them so that when they create the inevitable crisis that they're trying
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:54.440]  to create there will be greater resistance and the ability to you know lay
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:59.280]  the foundation for what will replace what they've created it's great if people
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:04.640]  can go out and write books or do documentaries or whatever you know all
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.760]  of these things are very useful but it's it's the most important thing for
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.120]  people to do is to simply gain an awareness of what's going on because
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:19.080]  they cannot operate their scam if people understand what's going on and it really
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:23.720]  is their entire system is based on deception theft and violence and
