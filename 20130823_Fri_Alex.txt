[04:36.520 --> 04:41.840]  about any of this they giggle and snicker and and and and kind of do a
[04:41.840 --> 04:45.240]  little victory dance around whenever you warn them they take it as a sign of
[04:45.240 --> 04:50.440]  weakness that you care and are trying to inform them they're just begging to have

[07:34.440 --> 07:38.600]  is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the

[09:08.840 --> 09:23.240]  Jones it is Friday the 23rd day of August 2013 I'll be back this Sunday live as
[09:23.240 --> 09:28.160]  well 4 to 6 p.m. Central with the Sunday edition picked up by more than 80
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.840]  stations this show the weekday broadcast by over a hundred and 60 am and FM
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.320]  affiliates very honored that you have tuned in to listen to broadcast today you
[09:38.320 --> 09:44.200]  know I had them play that particular intro from death race 2000 one of my
[09:44.200 --> 09:50.680]  favorite B movies because it exposes a dystopic possible future America I had
[09:50.680 --> 09:56.680]  the crew play that because yesterday I saw a Atlantic wire article then I saw
[09:56.680 --> 10:02.280]  it on drudge report dot com then I saw it on Fox News this morning and on drudge
[10:02.280 --> 10:08.680]  from Fox and I I asked myself at about 6 30 a.m. when I was doing research why
[10:08.680 --> 10:15.720]  didn't you cover that yesterday and you're asking what story is that and I
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.840]  kind of psychoanalyzed why I didn't cover it and it was the same reason the
[10:21.840 --> 10:26.320]  public sometimes doesn't take action against corruption because it's so over
[10:26.320 --> 10:36.640]  the top you want to research it more and it just comes off as not real so I went
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.880]  back this morning and went and actually looked at the guy's site or the copy of
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.080]  it on the Google way back machine you know saved the archive he's taken most
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.120]  of it down I went and read all the articles follow the drudge links and I
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.280]  probably spent 30 minutes and it was worse than what Fox News and Atlantic
[10:54.280 --> 11:01.080]  wire were saying and it is a black senior member of the Department of Homeland
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.680]  Security I'm gonna get into the article here a little bit later in the hour who
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.960]  is in charge of buying many of the machine guns and bullets there's the
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.480]  headline DHS employee spends spare time promoting race war against whites and he
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.720]  says in there we're gonna have to kill all the white people and he goes I know
[11:19.720 --> 11:30.800]  that's hard for us Christians but it's got to be it's got to be done and I was
[11:30.800 --> 11:35.840]  asking myself why didn't I cover that yesterday and it was because when I first
[11:35.840 --> 11:43.320]  read the article it was so over the top because it's DHS and it's one of the
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.800]  main people over buying the billions of bullets and the machine guns and the
[11:48.800 --> 11:56.640]  guys got a website approved by DHS to promote this and I know MSNBC promotes
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.040]  race war and racial division and it's cartoonish and I have trouble even
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.480]  believing when I seek them out of Al Sharpton and Chris Matthews mouths and
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.200]  Carlos Watson who says you're racist if you are against Obamacare and Kathleen
[12:10.200 --> 12:16.000]  Sebelius saying the same thing the head of health and human services but again
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.440]  I'm just analyzing my shelf here why I didn't cover it yesterday and it's
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.800]  because I read that and I'm like it's just it's just it's just so crazy it's
[12:28.800 --> 12:35.200]  like video I saw yesterday of Syrian rebels attacking and schools and stuff
[12:35.200 --> 12:39.160]  and little kids begging for mommy with the whole top of their heads blown off
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.360]  and their brains open and I can't even look at it much less have the guys put
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.800]  it on the website much less show it now I've kind of gotten to the point of
[12:48.800 --> 12:53.240]  where the globalists want me I think where I just can't handle it anymore
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.000]  and start tuning out myself I'm doing what I've always warned everybody not
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.480]  to do more and more I'm getting to the point where where I mean I saw five
[13:04.480 --> 13:13.080]  articles this morning on info wars calm and then I went over and found other
[13:13.080 --> 13:19.880]  articles that were different articles on drugs report calm with black people
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.880]  killing white people because they're white all over the US and no national
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.280]  coverage of it other than the alternative media and I don't care if it's a
[13:31.280 --> 13:35.280]  black guy with four skinheads surrounding them dragging them behind a
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.880]  car that outrageous me but that gets covered on the news when it is a white
[13:40.880 --> 13:47.040]  person being beaten or shot man if you cover it you're called racist by MSNBC
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.640]  because they want they want the idea to be sold of total division in this
[13:53.640 --> 13:58.880]  country and they intend to beat the white minority now whites are now minority
[13:58.880 --> 14:05.000]  overall if you add up all the minority groups into doing whatever we're
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.400]  politically told or God forbid you're called a racist and it's nothing but a
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.800]  political tool and a political weapon but I was I was reading about this guy
[14:14.800 --> 14:17.920]  and reading the quotes about how we're gonna have to kill all the white people
[14:17.920 --> 14:23.600]  and it was just like dr. Khalid Muhammad that I played the clip the leader of the
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.360]  new black Panther Party saying we kill the women we kill the children why do
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.760]  we kill the women because the white woman is the military manufacturing center
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.280]  and every nine months she lays down on the back and military enforcement's
[14:39.280 --> 14:46.280]  rollout I like doing imitations folks as you know and it's just the issue of I
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.680]  don't want to turn my guns in you're a racist I don't like government-run
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.080]  health care it's a big scam I rip off you're a racist I don't want our troops
[14:54.080 --> 14:57.920]  being forced to take psychotropic drugs you're a racist I mean that's their
[14:57.920 --> 15:01.240]  only answer and of course they know that's their only answer because they
[15:01.240 --> 15:06.160]  are the master racist they are beyond it they are the master controllers
[15:06.160 --> 15:13.000]  dividing and conquering all of us the people and what's outrageous is they
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.520]  are the ones that are actually enslaving and killing people worldwide
[15:18.520 --> 15:22.480]  they are dividing and conquering everybody and they are cutting off the
[15:22.480 --> 15:29.080]  natural resources in Latin America in Eastern Europe in Asia in Africa
[15:29.080 --> 15:32.880]  everywhere they are cutting the resources off in their own white papers to
[15:32.880 --> 15:46.520]  reduce the population on record on record all over the planet and it is
[15:46.520 --> 15:53.360]  disgusting to see this unfolding and to know they are the eugenicists there's
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.080]  an article up on prisonplanet.com it's not all info wars.com I'm gonna ask the
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.040]  folks that's why you got to go to prisonplanet.com because a lot of people
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.720]  contribute to that site and for some reason ever ends up on info wars which
[16:03.720 --> 16:06.720]  in a way they go well that's okay because needs to be different yeah but
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.040]  it's really a backup mirror but then a bunch of the best news ends up on
[16:10.040 --> 16:13.800]  prisonplanet that gets a fraction of the traffic everybody's got a bookmark
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.160]  prisonplanet.com it's quite frankly a cleaner better site than info wars
[16:17.160 --> 16:22.520]  I need to remind my info wars writers to post their stuff on prisonplanet we're
[16:22.520 --> 16:25.760]  about to redesign both sides finally and they have all these apps and stuff we're
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.400]  going to watch but I want to do it right the point is is that look at this
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.360]  article vaccine inventor and genetic engineer jokes about the population and
[16:36.360 --> 16:42.120]  biological warfare great article by Christina Sarich but but it's and it's
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.200]  a Aaron Dykes for a video report you can link through and watch it at
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.680]  prisonplanet.com but the whole point is is that I watch the video it's not a
[16:51.680 --> 16:57.200]  joke not when Eric Pionka at UT or not when he is graduate students that are
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.280]  now top bioweapons experts go public countering me a few years ago when the
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.800]  FBI visited him because I called for it Pionka got up to the Texas Academy of
[17:05.800 --> 17:10.280]  Sciences to and said soon the airborne Ebola will be released we will save the
[17:10.280 --> 17:17.400]  earth 90% will die and I had the local newspaper reporters on the witness
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.960]  it there was photos taken as well they wouldn't laugh video the majority did a
[17:21.960 --> 17:27.800]  standing ovation and began to cry as he projected red skulls on the wall and then
[17:27.800 --> 17:31.440]  we went to his UT website with him dressed as a druid on the official UT
[17:31.440 --> 17:39.120]  website and he said come Lucifer oh my oh Lucifer and then I had his graduate
[17:39.120 --> 17:42.680]  students send me threatening emails that we published and I went and looked up
[17:42.680 --> 17:48.040]  their names from their graduate papery decade before and they're in white lab
[17:48.040 --> 17:58.000]  coats running bioweapon labs for the Pentagon I mean this isn't a joke all
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.120]  of them talk like this and the quote is just to illustrate the real threat we're
[18:03.120 --> 18:06.360]  facing while we're all fighting with each other over race and all the race
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.640]  pimps in the Democratic Party they're the biggest races who want to set each
[18:09.640 --> 18:13.240]  other's throats they're never gonna drop it folks because you think the only
[18:13.240 --> 18:16.760]  thing that existed in this world was people fighting with each other racially
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.400]  because they keep it going but they want it to be a white only thing and then
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.840]  actually encourage racial politics because that's powerful by blacks
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.640]  Latinos Asians and others and unify them around socialism and anti-gun
[18:29.640 --> 18:34.040]  cementing it with an anti-white rhetoric I'm sick of hearing about ugly
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.720]  dumb rednecks in the south we'll get your guns you know Al Sharpton and

[24:27.560 --> 24:34.800]  Alright folks, we are back live here on this Friday edition. Let me get into our top story
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.320]  because it just illustrates the incredible manipulation of the establishment state-run
[24:40.320 --> 24:50.320]  state-sponsored globalist-controlled crony capitalist anti-free market media. The kleptocrat
[24:50.320 --> 24:56.880]  support system media. You have got literally, I was thinking about it this morning, I keep
[24:56.880 --> 25:03.680]  saying, I see examples buried in local news stories all over the country where mobs of
[25:03.680 --> 25:10.760]  young black youth particularly go out and kill white people at fairs, at events, on
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.240]  street corners, you name it, or severely beat them and then tell them they're doing it
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.240]  because they're white and then later newspaper reporters go public, there's been a bunch
[25:20.240 --> 25:25.440]  of cases of this, and complain and say, my editor told me not to say that it was racially
[25:25.440 --> 25:33.160]  motivated because that's racist. So see, it's now racist to say there is a racism against
[25:33.160 --> 25:40.640]  white people being promoted by the globalist media in black culture, but it's also being
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.460]  done in the kind of la raza, la reconquista, hispanic culture and everybody that can read
[25:46.460 --> 25:51.680]  Spanish or speak Spanish knows that. My wife grew up in Spain, she lived there, I don't
[25:51.680 --> 25:59.200]  know, six years, speaks fluent Spanish, she is blown away by the stuff she hears on Mexican
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.080]  radio stations, what she sees on billboards, and she's the one that's been pointing it
[26:03.080 --> 26:11.960]  out to me for 14 years. And it is just incredible that today alone, without looking, I've seen
[26:11.960 --> 26:16.600]  five different cases because yesterday I said, I see cases every day, no, no, I see like
[26:16.600 --> 26:22.440]  five every day without looking, and then I don't even ever really, you know, talk about
[26:22.440 --> 26:33.400]  this stuff because it's just so overwhelming, like the Homeland Security DHS top employee
[26:33.400 --> 26:39.440]  who's over armament procurement saying that they need these arms to wipe out, we'll have
[26:39.440 --> 26:47.960]  the quote here, and they authorized this. He said, we're going to have to have the mass
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.860]  murder of whites and ethnic cleansing of Uncle Tom race traders. Oh yeah, that's another
[26:53.860 --> 26:58.920]  thing on these sites is that the ultimate crime is actually people getting along with
[26:58.920 --> 27:04.480]  each other racially. See, I mean, this is just insane, it's black separatism is what
[27:04.480 --> 27:07.960]  it is, and if people want to do that, that's their business, but don't make it about how
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.200]  I'm inherently evil because I'm white. That's what the Klan says is you're inherently evil
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.120]  because you're black or you're inherently evil because you're Jewish. I mean, this is,
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.720]  this is dyed in the wool pure racism to the point of even the Southern Poverty Law Center
[27:22.720 --> 27:27.960]  had to come out against it. And they've had their supporters going around shooting up,
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.520]  you know, focus on the family facilities and stuff. I mean, these are groups of people
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.600]  who eat, drink and sleep, race and religious warfare, because the globalists only want
[27:38.600 --> 27:43.720]  to have a debate about that, not about what all the robber barons are doing, discriminating
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.720]  against us all by deindustrializing the world through Agenda 21. But here's the article
[27:49.720 --> 27:57.720]  red linked up on info wars.com and prison planet.com is the media covering up the beginnings
[27:57.720 --> 28:05.160]  of a race war. That is the headline by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones. And the lengthy
[28:05.160 --> 28:12.600]  article goes over just some of the recent stuff that's happening. And again, so many
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.160]  times you hear about a group of people beat up at a fair or beat up at outside of movie
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.720]  theater or beat up at a mall or whatever. And it'll be, oh, youths beat up the group.
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.480]  And then you find they're white and blacks beat them up. They're white and blacks shot
[28:26.480 --> 28:32.320]  them. They're white and blacks car jacked them. And then it comes out like in the case
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.800]  of this Australian baseball player that was over here on a scholarship up in Oklahoma.
[28:38.800 --> 28:43.000]  And on their Twitters, they were saying, you know, racist stuff. They went out in a gang
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.640]  initiation to kill a cracker. And there's a black dad, you know, in the neighborhood
[28:48.640 --> 28:52.120]  of they tried to recruit his son and threatened him because he wouldn't go out and be part
[28:52.120 --> 28:58.760]  of it. And this is the type of stuff that goes on in these gang related deals. What
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.680]  did they do with the black guy drugged to death years ago that got so much attention
[29:01.680 --> 29:06.440]  in East Texas? They were guys out of prison. And it was a gang initiation for a new member
[29:06.440 --> 29:10.640]  to go out and kill a black person. And then on that same stretch of road a year later,
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.600]  because of all the media hype, four black guys drug a homeless white guy to death and
[29:15.600 --> 29:20.840]  no one picked it up but a local newspaper because it's a white guy. He deserves to die.
[29:20.840 --> 29:26.360]  He's not worth anything. And so it goes over how they're trying to hype up the fact that
[29:26.360 --> 29:33.960]  inherently if you're white, you need to die. And that's what this DHS guy says. He says,
[29:33.960 --> 29:39.120]  look, we need the weapons. We've got to kill the white people. And the DHS said you're
[29:39.120 --> 29:46.120]  authorized to have this website and say this, ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable.
[29:46.120 --> 29:52.120]  I'll break down their master plan straight ahead. We're on the March, the empires on

[33:24.320 --> 33:48.560]  This is Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen we are here. It is Friday. If you just joined
[33:48.560 --> 33:55.700]  us I am your host Alex Jones and we were discussing is the media covering up the beginnings of
[33:55.700 --> 34:01.080]  a race war. An article that Paul Watson put together this morning that's published on
[34:01.080 --> 34:08.000]  info wars.com and prisonpana.com that I contributed to. Let me read some of this. Despite engaging
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.640]  in seemingly endless and racially charged national debate about the Trayvon Martin case
[34:14.640 --> 34:21.520]  to demonize guns the U.S. corporate media the state run media has shown no interest
[34:21.520 --> 34:28.800]  in reviving the obsession despite a spat well it's not a spat it is a avalanche a tidal
[34:28.800 --> 34:37.880]  wave a veritable cornucopia of black on white murders at least two of which indicate a racially
[34:37.880 --> 34:42.540]  charged hate crime motivation behind the killings. I think if you randomly go out and shoot people
[34:42.540 --> 34:50.760]  in the back as part of an initiation to show you're a tough guy I think you're hateful
[34:50.760 --> 34:54.000]  like if you go just randomly kill a white person and you're having to be white it's
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.560]  hateful you just randomly go kill a black person you're black it's hateful you know
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.920]  I love how they said it wasn't enough in the Texas case where the skinhead prisoners in
[35:03.920 --> 35:10.080]  a gang war because they've been in the same prison with the black guy drug him to death
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.480]  they were given the death penalty but the media would say men aren't convicted of hate
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.000]  crime travesty and would do it and they never even say in the news the guys were given the
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.160]  death penalty by the way I think they've executed some of them now the point is is that's not
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.360]  enough my whole issue is a hate crime is a hate crime is a hate crime the point is they're
[35:29.360 --> 35:32.800]  only going to prosecute in the future see that's why they want to bring in hate crime
[35:32.800 --> 35:38.840]  so that the prosecutors can selectively decide when they're going to prosecute you the Soviets
[35:38.840 --> 35:44.680]  did this too I mean you kill a white devil you're gonna you get to maybe get a job with
[35:44.680 --> 35:54.280]  homeland security George Zimmerman's acquittal last month through a line under nearly 18 months
[35:54.280 --> 36:03.920]  of hand wringing over the threat posed by black people by racially charged hate crimes again
[36:03.920 --> 36:09.120]  18 months of hand wringing over the threat posed to black people by racially charged
[36:09.120 --> 36:14.720]  hate crimes black ideologues like Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton and others were constantly in the
[36:14.720 --> 36:22.760]  headlines holding up the Trayvon case as a dire warning that African Americans how about
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.160]  Americans you're not allowed to just be an American though it's meant to make you be
[36:26.160 --> 36:33.680]  obsessed with that that identity that they then illustrate that the establishment defines
[36:33.680 --> 36:40.320]  for you could now be targeted for murder merely as a result of the color of their skin in
[36:40.320 --> 36:46.880]  light of several high-profile black-on-white murders in recent days the invective has
[36:46.880 --> 36:53.400]  been noticeably less verbose the most anger Jesse Jackson could muster over the gang
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.040]  initiation hate crime slaying of an Australian student Chris Lane was a tepid tweet saying
[36:59.040 --> 37:06.160]  that the incident should be frowned upon well why even respond if you're just gonna say
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.160]  should be frowned upon you know just shot him in the back and then he died in the next
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.480]  20 minutes you know there and there's a description online of his death I mean you know let's
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.680]  just you know don't do this you know let's frown you know let's frown upon this in light
[37:20.680 --> 37:27.760]  of several high-profile black-on-white murders in recent days this is just disgusting folks
[37:27.760 --> 37:36.720]  and again I hate even having to get off into all of this it just makes my head spin to
[37:36.720 --> 37:45.040]  to see how this is pushed in the culture and to see people like Chris Rock say that we
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.200]  shouldn't question Obama he's our father and Michelle is basically our mother and then
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.120]  to see other people like Jamie Foxx say that Obama is our Lord and Savior meanwhile black
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.880]  unemployment's doubled meanwhile abortion of black people is accelerated not just here
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.920]  but worldwide with U.S. government funding under Obama that he spearheaded in Africa
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.440]  meanwhile the prisons are filling up the drug wars expanding in black neighborhoods more
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.720]  than doubling just in the last five years under Obama you can look up those numbers marijuana
[38:18.720 --> 38:25.600]  arrest of blacks more than tripling but it's okay because Obama's black so it's okay it's
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.480]  okay if poor people across the board have their payroll taxes raised more than any other
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.400]  time in recent history because doesn't matter because Obama's black even though he promised
[38:35.400 --> 38:41.600]  not to do it Lane was slaughtered by a gunshot to the back as part of a gang initiation by
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.560]  three juveniles an incident which the media initially tried to downplay as board deans
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.120]  two of these suspects are black it subsequently emerged that over that one of the suspects
[38:52.120 --> 38:57.480]  had posted racist tweets on his account before the murder stating 90% of white people are
[38:57.480 --> 39:09.360]  nasty hashtag hate them another reads I knocked out a five woods since Zimmerman court woods
[39:09.360 --> 39:17.240]  is a racist term for white people rock Obama who personally inserted himself in the Trayvon
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.720]  Martin case on two separate occasions was not familiar with Lane's murder according
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.320]  to the White House and it just goes on with a whole bunch of other cases of World War
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.320]  two vets having their brains beaten out because they're white and people being set on fire
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.240]  because they're white and and I mean I saw an article for a white kid burned by a black
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.160]  lady an 11 year old because he was white she burned his eyeballs out with a blow torch
[39:40.160 --> 39:45.160]  and man this stuff is only in local papers and then you've got to dig when the court
[39:45.160 --> 39:51.720]  case comes out that it was racially motivated and the media goes over the top not to report
[39:51.720 --> 39:56.720]  on the national statistics as you can pull up for yourself from the Justice Department
[39:56.720 --> 40:05.840]  of a 10 fold black on white ratio for every assault of a white person on a black person
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.680]  there are 10 black assaults on a white person according to the Justice Department unified
[40:10.680 --> 40:16.360]  crime statistics and this is just a fact that people need to be aware of and that and that
[40:16.360 --> 40:23.240]  communities need to be ashamed of because the word is hey go kill a peckerwood white
[40:23.240 --> 40:29.080]  person you know do something for the team kill a cracker ass today I mean this is all
[40:29.080 --> 40:35.120]  over Twitter it's all over Facebook it's a sick sick thing being pumped by the gangster
[40:35.120 --> 40:42.720]  rap culture and all it's going to do is then give cover to real white racists that are
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.520]  out there that are calling for race war with blacks and shame blacks are all racist and
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.600]  blah blah blah when it is still a minority of blacks from my research that are virulent
[40:53.600 --> 41:00.160]  racists but ladies and gentlemen they are virulent virulent virulently racist and it
[41:00.160 --> 41:06.560]  is kosher in the media it is acceptable it is okay if you're Hispanic to say racist things
[41:06.560 --> 41:12.240]  against whites it is okay if you're Asian to say racist things against whites it is okay
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.800]  if you're black to say racist stuff against whites folks I'm almost 40 years old but when
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.840]  I grew up in Dallas Texas let me tell you something I never heard racist jokes against
[41:23.840 --> 41:31.320]  black people anywhere not at deer camps with what you'd call rednecks I never heard racist
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.920]  stuff around the dinner table I never heard it now when I went to college a little bit
[41:37.920 --> 41:43.880]  I ran into some of it from both angles and I've I've I've seen white people scared of
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.920]  minorities because of political correctness and that and that they're and almost like
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.800]  such a guilt that I don't want to be around anybody that's another you know quote group
[41:52.800 --> 41:57.480]  because I do I mean that's really what this creates and I'll tell you something all this
[41:57.480 --> 42:04.960]  race-based politics pushed by the Democratic Party and pushed by MSNBC that's why you
[42:04.960 --> 42:14.960]  have what they call white flight to the suburbs and to the countryside because it makes white
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.120]  people many of which their parents and they themselves are part of the civil rights movement
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.400]  just feel incredibly threatened and uncomfortable but let me tell you something I live out in
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.120]  the hill country there's a lot of middle-class black people in Hispanics that are out there
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.280]  who want to homeschool their kids and be left alone as well this is more of also an instinctive
[42:33.280 --> 42:39.840]  fear of the cities and of the of the police of the crime of the drugs I mean let me tell
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.480]  you something there's drugs in the countryside as well but statistically ladies and gentlemen
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.160]  if your kids in the city and your kids going to public school they're going to be bullied
[42:50.160 --> 42:54.200]  I don't care what color they are just like another black kid got bullied to be part of
[42:54.200 --> 42:58.760]  the kill a cracker gang initiation and the dad said no so they said well we may come
[42:58.760 --> 43:03.640]  get your son next and his son was you know that's in the news having to hide out in his
[43:03.640 --> 43:09.880]  house in Oklahoma you put your I mean folks when I went to high school in a suburb of
[43:09.880 --> 43:18.160]  Dallas in 1988 89 90 91 went well I went a couple years in Dallas a couple years in
[43:18.160 --> 43:30.400]  Austin was so bad we moved down here it was rampant sex okay just constant 24 7 it was
[43:30.400 --> 43:39.800]  drugs everywhere it was fights constantly it was it was like fast times at Ridgemont
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.560]  High on on on steroids okay and let me tell you something high school is a lot wilder
[43:44.560 --> 43:49.160]  than that now ladies and gentlemen you put your kids in a public school unless it's in
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.520]  a rural area and still it's got to be extremely covertly Christian a lot of public schools
[43:54.520 --> 43:58.520]  are like that are really Christian but basically it's all run secretly they try to keep the
[43:58.520 --> 44:02.800]  feds out they try to keep the kids safe they try to keep everybody you know black white
[44:02.800 --> 44:08.280]  it doesn't matter you know to have a future there are quasi wealthy and middle class and
[44:08.280 --> 44:14.800]  wealthy suburbs and rural areas where people can be outside of this but that is the minority
[44:14.800 --> 44:23.280]  of areas ladies and gentlemen high school is a living hell I mean let me tell you about
[44:23.280 --> 44:27.800]  how politically correct I was being brought up my dad was a conservative on many issues
[44:27.800 --> 44:37.720]  but also what you call liberal on many same with my mother and you know it's tribalism
[44:37.720 --> 44:45.640]  is really what it is it's tribalism because if you went to a neighboring town to a bonfire
[44:45.640 --> 44:52.280]  the the the rednecks and usually the the richest rednecks and the fanciest trucks and whatever
[44:52.280 --> 44:56.880]  you'd be having fun visiting with a friend that invited you to one and almost invariably
[44:56.880 --> 45:01.200]  a bunch of big jacked up pickup trucks would show up you'd be there in your jacked up pickup
[45:01.200 --> 45:04.720]  truck and there would be a fight people go to the hospital and I'm not even tell the
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.720]  stories it's so over the top it's unbelievable okay so so that that probably happened to
[45:09.720 --> 45:14.520]  me every couple weeks but it'd be the same thing with you're out in the parking lot
[45:14.520 --> 45:20.600]  five black guys come over and say we're gonna beat your cracker head in right now and you
[45:20.600 --> 45:26.600]  would start being assaulted and end up in the hospital and and and if you didn't end
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.280]  up in the hospital and somebody else did you go to jail let me tell you get four or five
[45:31.280 --> 45:34.560]  people trying to beat beat your brains out you'll get real mean start beating other people's
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.520]  brains out I tell you it's probably the most exhilarating drug out there actually to black
[45:38.520 --> 45:45.080]  out and step out and Jesus absolutely eight on people but the whole point is is that you
[45:45.080 --> 45:49.800]  know when you turn it you when you basically turn into a caveman gorilla and start beating
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.960]  people's brains out that's what's going on and that's why white people are running to
[45:53.960 --> 46:02.000]  the hills folks okay I'll tell you right now that's what's going on and and it's always
[46:02.000 --> 46:09.480]  covered up I've been racially attacked by black people probably let's not exaggerate thirty
[46:09.480 --> 46:17.160]  five times I've been racially attacked by Hispanics let's not exaggerate five times let me tell
[46:17.160 --> 46:22.280]  you that's when you really get hurt bad and you know compound fractures you know you name
[46:22.280 --> 46:30.080]  it and oh yeah oh yeah you get hurt real bad and the whole point is is I am sick of it
[46:30.080 --> 46:36.120]  I am sick of the fact that I have been racially attacked over and over and over and over and
[46:36.120 --> 46:44.180]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:44.180 --> 46:48.780]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:48.780 --> 46:48.780]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:48.780 --> 46:49.780]  and over and over of and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
[46:49.780 --> 46:50.880]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:50.880 --> 46:51.840]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:51.840 --> 46:52.840]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:52.840 --> 46:53.840]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:53.840 --> 46:54.840]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[46:54.840 --> 47:00.620]  And they're bones broken because the one thing you don't do is ever go stand up against it
[47:01.400 --> 47:05.000]  Now that said that's what political correctness is in this country
[47:05.000 --> 47:11.640]  And so yeah, you got you got racist cops who are tribal and who will corner a black person or the same thing to them
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.760]  And you will get the same thing in an area where black cops will beat up a black person or a white person or whatever
[47:18.760 --> 47:23.360]  It's all gangs. It's cop gangs beating people up. It's black gangs beating people up
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.800]  It's white gangs beating people up. See I'm smart enough folks to not become a racist over this
[47:29.120 --> 47:37.380]  I'm smart enough to understand the manipulation. I'm smart enough to understand the geopolitical ramifications and to actually try
[47:38.440 --> 47:40.680]  To bring people together to have a gang
[47:41.760 --> 47:43.520]  Because everybody's tribal that's what it is
[47:43.520 --> 47:49.400]  We're designed like that based on private property and the family and liberty and freedom and being honorable
[47:49.400 --> 47:56.320]  The globalists want us to have a collectivist gang get us all fighting with each other over race religion region whatever
[47:56.840 --> 47:58.840]  What sex we are
[47:58.840 --> 48:00.840]  but never
[48:01.720 --> 48:09.600]  But absolutely never never never unify around liberty the only unifying force is government and collectivism
[48:09.600 --> 48:11.600]  That's why they're balkanizing us
[48:12.760 --> 48:14.760]  That's why they're doing this
[48:14.760 --> 48:21.520]  That's that's why all of these type of things are happening and I learned to recognize it was gangs
[48:21.520 --> 48:27.400]  It was gangs of rednecks that started fights with people. It was gangs of blacks that did it
[48:28.200 --> 48:31.560]  I mean folks. Do you think rednecks just go out and beat up black people?
[48:32.800 --> 48:35.440]  I mean and by the way, I mean trashy rednecks
[48:36.840 --> 48:41.160]  People that would literally get addicted to fighting and beating each other up of the head
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.360]  What do you think they do when they go home? They go home and do that to each other? You've watched all these discovery channel shows
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.320]  All the hillbilly, you know stuff where they're all beating each other up
[48:49.720 --> 48:54.680]  That's the type of stuff that goes on whether you're in the inner city with gangs or whether you're in the redneck
[48:54.680 --> 48:58.720] ville with the hillbilly gangs and the answer is humanity has
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.240]  Always acted like this and we need to stop it and transcend it. That's how you build
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.600]  civilization but MSNBC in the White House that they don't want that and
[49:08.600 --> 49:16.280]  And and who does the White House in the globalist really hate they hate the gun culture the Liberty culture and they're afraid it's spreading
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.720]  Which it is spreading. That's why Obama said we don't like these bitter clingers. They cling to their guns and their Bibles
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.960]  You see they don't want you to unify around a Bible black white Hispanic old young
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.400]  They don't want you to unify around a bill of rights and something for our kids and a future
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.880]  They want gang enclaves of white black rich poor
[49:36.880 --> 49:44.200]  Where then the police and the whole system play the part of arbiters over all this stuff. I
[49:46.600 --> 49:49.440]  Mean, let me tell you something. It's creepy. My wife goes
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.400]  I don't want to ever go to Mexico again because she speaks Spanish. It wasn't like this
[49:53.680 --> 49:56.840]  You know just 10 years ago 15 years ago when I'd go down there with her
[49:57.080 --> 49:59.480]  We go to places we went Mexico before man
[49:59.480 --> 50:05.680]  The Mexicans are sitting right there folks while they're giving you a drink or whatever talking total trash about ugly stupid gringos
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.280]  Filled to the earth blah blah blah blah blah blah blah my wife's like man. Let's get out of here
[50:10.400 --> 50:13.320]  You go to the next place that happens in the next place that happens
[50:13.320 --> 50:16.960]  It didn't used to be like that. It's because of the culture of the media
[50:17.600 --> 50:23.280]  Worldwide is pushing division and people fighting with each other so they can be a globalist corporate
[50:23.720 --> 50:25.720]  overwrite over everybody
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.160]  They want to
[50:29.160 --> 50:36.760]  Absolutely have everybody divided a hundred different ways and then all the time talk about how they don't want everybody divided and fighting with each other
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.960]  You see the system pushes the division
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.560]  But then at the same time then says oh, but the government will fix it
[50:42.560 --> 50:45.760]  We'll make all the rodeo clowns take sensitivity training and
[50:46.400 --> 50:52.920]  Pay $500 a piece or whatever and then and then sell total tyranny where somebody does something supposedly wrong
[50:52.920 --> 51:00.360]  Which wasn't even wrong so you're all guilty. They're gonna sell authoritarianism as the answer will cover cereal when we come back

[56:01.360 --> 56:05.200]  Well, I'll take a little bite on one of these during a three-minute break and
[56:05.960 --> 56:11.120]  Then invariably a piece of it gets in my teeth and then I inhale it once I'm on air
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Whoa boy, that'll wake you up

[56:24.960 --> 56:26.960]  finishing up with what I was saying there
[56:26.960 --> 56:32.680]  We hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on people

[57:39.000 --> 57:40.360]  In detail
[57:40.360 --> 57:47.600]  But we've told you for years because it's actually been in the foreign news and the debka file has accurately been reporting on the side of Israel
[57:47.600 --> 57:50.800]  that NATO US forces you name it
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.000]  For two and a half years have been arming the rebels that CNN calls
[57:55.480 --> 58:00.000]  Protesters and activists and they're blowing up mosques blowing up charges killing everybody
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.720]  They've been caught staging nerve gas attacks before this is a big one
[58:03.920 --> 58:10.240]  The evidence is mounting that the rebels did stage it and the Jerusalem Post is now reporting that Syrian rebel forces
[58:10.520 --> 58:13.000]  Trained by West are moving towards Damascus
[58:13.000 --> 58:22.000]  And that they're backed up by CIA commandos and others here's Paul Watson's article US trained rebels moved towards Damascus days before
[58:22.880 --> 58:24.880]  chemical attack
[58:25.240 --> 58:32.680]  Lawmakers who opposed arming FSA militants reconsider intervention now that they've got some images of dead kids
[58:32.680 --> 58:43.240]  So instead of having fake dead babies and incubators now they actually kill real babies
[58:43.240 --> 58:47.080]  This is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:50.040 --> 58:54.960]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.840]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes?
[58:59.840 --> 59:05.320]  Autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing

[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.640]  live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour and
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:42.080]  Coming up we've covered this from the video and in the local Missouri newspapers
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:48.120]  But we're gonna actually have the guys on that were arrested for thought crimes by the Obama truce squads
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.360]  We played the newscast they have police on TV saying you're not allowed to talk about Obama
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.800]  That is illegal and then they come out of you protest on the street corner
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.880]  Peacefully they come out and choke you and take you to jail
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.880]  Missouri police tackle and arrest peaceful impeach Obama protestors
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.640]  Kit Daniels wrote about that back on the 20th
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.360]  and we're gonna have the first interview with these guys these thought criminals dr. Dwayne weed and
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.720]  Mark
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.440]  messmer
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.240]  So that is gonna be a very informative coming up and Syrian girl on the big developments in Syria
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.240]  I mean, it's they're running covert ops in there publicly now
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.840]  To try to in a proxy war defeat the Russians that are there and this is an overt
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:38.360]  premeditated war against the country to put people in power at least ten times worse and
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.400]  See, I just have a moral compass
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.400]  I'm not saying I'm some great guy either because once once you get me riled up
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.400]  I can be as wicked as anybody can imagine
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.800]  But the point is is I try to control myself and not be like that
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:57.440]  And it's just you know on the face of it. They're invading. They're attacking two and a half years engaging in incredible atrocities
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:04.360]  Killing Christians in mass and our sick filthy elite is backing it and trying to cover it up
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:11.000]  And is most certainly all the evidence indicates behind the nerve gas attack on the convenient school full of kids
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.880]  To then wave the bloody shirt and a false flag and say we've got to invade it is unspeakably
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960]  Wicked
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.640]  And it will come back to reduced on us and now
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.800]  Two and a half years folks. They've been trying to overthrow Assad and
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.400]  They know full well if they do overthrow them, they'll still be sectarian war forever
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:38.980]  They are wrecking a place that you could fly into see all the famous ruins the Roman the Byzantine the Egyptian
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.800]  See where Paul lived
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.280]  See some of the oldest churches in the world go to the beach
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.840]  Go to the market. It's not any more man. They're just wrecking an old-world first-world country
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.920]  and
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:03.160]  They're making the women put the burkas on they're sexually mutilating them the women are being kicked out of the colleges in the cities that
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:09.680]  Al-Qaeda's taking over. I mean it and then I got to put up with the TSA wanting to grab my junk
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.080]  to see if there's a al-Qaeda bomb in there and
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080]  And
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.360]  It's just incredible
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.040]  And it's just it's all a big joke. It's all a big fraud. They don't even try to hide it
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.920]  It's also a bunch of criminals can grandstand and take over society and run everything
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  And it makes me want to throw up
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.120]  So we're gonna be getting to that also use the media covering up the beginnings of a race war
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.840]  No national debate over spat
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.960]  How about a deluge a tidal wave of a a flood of black-on-white crimes?
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.720]  Because Watson shows like five or six examples in the last few days. No man
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.200]  This is going on
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.360]  Continually and the bigger story is there been a bunch of articles where the media finally goes well
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  We were told not to
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:05.560]  Reporters have been a physically attacked or killed and then there's been so many examples of especially at the Trayvon Martin deal
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560]  And that's the media
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560]  Purposefully creating this idea
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.800]  That white people are walking around
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.720]  I mean white people folks are just like everybody else TV heads that are obsessed with sports
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.160]  And the only racial thing they know is that they're guilty and we're like afraid everyone thinks they're racist
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.440]  And so politically that's that way so the media can say do what we say or we'll say your racist
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.760]  Yes, okay, I'll do whatever you say. I'll turn my guns in to prove. I'm not racist. I'll support Obama care
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960]  I'll put an Obama sticker on oh
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960]  I'll do whatever you say
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  Alright, whatever you want
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.440]  And then meanwhile the government does want kind of a socialist army of like armed minorities like this DHS commander
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:54.800]  Who's over weapons purchasing with a website saying prepare to kill all the whites and any blacks that don't help us
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.480]  and then DHS is
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.520]  Supporting it

[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:19.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440]  Alex Jones
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.320]  Folks it's on right now
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.800]  On CNN during the three-minute break. I was back in the coffee room
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:47.720]  And I'm watching CNN as we have different networks on in every room in the office to monitor the state-run media and
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:54.200]  CNN's definitely state-run out of all of them. That's the most state run on record actually run by the Pentagon and CIA
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:03.560]  And they were saying the polar bears are all dying. It's terrible. The ice is melting. They live on folks polar bear numbers are up five fold
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.320]  According to the federal government, you can just pull that up since
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.600]  1955 five fold. I know we've written articles about it
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.960]  They're up in
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960]  Northern Europe. They're up in northern Russia
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.400]  And they they also showed the ice cap melting in the summer
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.760]  But didn't tell you it was only in the summer didn't show it getting big again in the winter
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.240]  So they showed a satellite shot of it melting going look it's melting. Yeah, it's the end of the summer
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.680]  Yeah, it it this is what the ice caps do in the summer in the winter
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:39.720]  In the in the summer they get smaller in the winter. They get bigger. This is what they do
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.280]  They get bigger in the winter smaller in the summer and I just watched them prey on the public
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.880]  Praying on the public
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:56.320]  That's my problem. There's just too many lies. It's too over the top. I can't even respond now. I
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.160]  Had them record it though
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.200]  I want to do a piece on the nightly news about this and analyze because I mean, I know they do this all the time
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.320]  But they actually I saw a children's book where they teach the penguins can't swim and are
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:15.360]  And are drowning in in Antarctica. This is in the Arctic in the North Pole. They were talking about and I've got it recording back there
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:23.040]  On seeing in right now there. They are fear mongering saying we've got to have carbon taxes or the polar bears
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.600]  That by the way
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600]  They're drowning. They said
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.640]  drowned
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.120]  Ladies and gentlemen polar bears are the greatest land animal for swimming
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.280]  They go out and swim out to ice flows to hunt seals and then back to the mainland
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  And I just it shakes me up it shakes me up
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.760]  Now I'll tell you what else shakes me up that we're going to our guest even Bloomberg has the headline NSA analyst
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.720]  Intentionally abused spying powers multiple times. Yeah, how about billions of times?
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:59.360]  How about it's on record that all everything's recorded and saved by the NSA and they've admitted that before I?
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.680]  Have an article here from the 1980s admitting it to folks dug up that we have one info wars calm today
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:14.480]  How about that? How about the fact that that the DEA is being given all the NSA info on people talking about
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.400]  smoking pot over the telephone and
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.880]  And then and then the NSA told them to lie to federal judges about it. That's Reuters been out for two weeks
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.720]  Ladies and gentlemen Obama went on seeing it in the same state-run media last night
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.400]  We're in a play a short clip of this. This is a quote said there are no allegations
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.280]  That the NSA is trying to listen on people's email
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.320]  That's even worse than saying the polar bears are all dying I
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.120]  Mean, that's like saying folks the sun blew up today. You can walk out and see it
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.040]  That's like walking out at midnight and saying it's high noon. That's like saying
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.100]  Santa Claus is real or something. I mean, it's not true folks of course
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  He's saying there's not even
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:11.560]  Allegations when it's on record just like Gibbs said we were told to go say there's no drone program when it had been admitted to exist
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.560]  for at least five years and
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.440]  He laughs in them and the MSNBC laughs because it's funny
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.720]  And you know what you people out there you take it you go along with it
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.440]  You put up with it and I don't know what your problem is and I'm not talking about our long-term listeners
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.080]  I'm talking about regular listeners. They always write articles in national review and time magazine
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.120]  I see them all the time
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:40.800]  I was driving in a car and I heard that nut and then I came to another city on a road trip and heard him again
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.000]  This guy's actually on the radio. What in the world? He's crazy
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.600]  I'm crazy because I know the numbers on polar bears. I'm crazy because I know about the NSA and the president's up there lying
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Let's go to this clip
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.400]  Let's go to this clip right now of Obama
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.920]  First acting like well, it's like a loaded gun trying to demonize guns with the NSA
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.120]  Everything he does is like double think mind control. It is like a loaded gun out there
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.600]  But we know what we're doing remember. He said, you know, you can trust him cuz cuz he's there running
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.300]  You let us run everything. Don't look into what we're doing. Yeah, we you we got caught lying to you all these times
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.300]  But just just trust me
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.520]  Just trust me. I
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.560]  Mean it's all he loves conning you folks. I mean he really is makes Bill Clinton look like an angel and an honest person
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.600]  I've got to say I've never seen anything like Obama. He's such a good liar
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.960]  If I wasn't informed watching this I would believe it because he comes off like he's telling the truth
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.960]  Let's play a man
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.160]  Literally shoving
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.080]  200 proof lies in your face
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.880]  I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that the technology is moving so quick. So see oh, you're legitimate
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.640]  Oh, it's just technology. Oh got away from us
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:59.280]  does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place and do some of these systems end up being like a
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.640]  Loaded gun out there and see now they want new laws to legalize it
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.480]  That's how they say we'll fix it because there are no allegations and
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.480]  And
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.760]  I interrupted that all I want people to hear that without me talking over it start at the beginning again and listen how everything he says is
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.760]  Psych warfare scripted. Oh, yeah, it's reasonable. You're concerned
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.880]  Because you know the laws you know technology grew and you know, it's just an oversight
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.080]  We need some new laws. The new laws are to legalize what they're doing. That's illegal
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:33.640]  So we'll fix it by legalizing it and oh, but it's like a loaded gun out there like oh gun scary
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.440]  You know, we understand but don't worry. I'm running the gun and by the way, there are no allegations that we're reading your email
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.680]  Oh, no, it's just all on record in thousands of publications
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.840]  declassified public
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.840]  not just Snowden
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.360]  Listen to this. I mean, it's a 40-second clip and it is
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.880]  Satan can only lie this good. I'm telling you right now
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.200]  everything you could analyze
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.960]  you could have a
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.960]  You could have a 10-year PhD in this 140 seconds analyzing every word of it. I'm telling you folks
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.840]  I study their lies. Okay. I mean this the he is a and this isn't a teleprompter either. This is why he's in there
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.920]  Okay, let's I mean this is this is unbelievable meant to trigger things in people's minds to put them at ease
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:26.280]  This is brainwashing. Let's go to it. I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that the technologies moving so quick
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.760]  that
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:35.840]  You know at some point does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place and do some of
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.040]  These systems end up being like a loaded gun out there
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:46.640]  That somebody at some future point could abuse because there are no allegations and I am very confident knowing the NSA and how they operate
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.320]  That purposely somebody's out there trying to abuse this program or listen in on people's email
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:58.920]  I am confident in that but what I recognize is that
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.680]  We're gonna have to continue to improve the safeguards
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:08.840]  Oh, and as technology moves forward that means that we may be able to build technologies to give people more assurance
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.560]  Oh, they're gonna we do have to do a better job
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.600]  They're going to build and more technologies to to make you know, they're got safeguards
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.920]  I got you in chains here chain down, but there's a safeguard for you
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.880]  There's a safe word. I mean, this is literal abuser stuff. I
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.400]  mean, I mean, that's that's what all this is ladies and gentlemen and
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.720]  It is so disgusting
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.520]  That they are recording everything on record
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.760]  They are abusing the Tea Party gun owner groups pro-life groups the press
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.120]  They're arresting members of the press using the NSA. They're persecuting government whistleblowers with it
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:56.480]  There's a reign of unbelievable terror going on and he says there's not even allegations and again
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.840]  It's seeing in is the worst. I mean just the polar bears are all dying pay carbon taxes to Al Gore total lie
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.840]  There's not even allegations. We're abusing this. I mean, it is
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:14.400]  Unbelievable. All right, I'm gonna shut up. I appreciate dr. Dwayne weed who's a chiropractor and mark
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:22.840]  Mesmer, I hope I'm pronouncing that right the peaceful impeach Obama protesters that made national news the last three days after the video went viral
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.480]  of
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.720]  these
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.720]  thought criminals
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.680]  Who I can tell her info wars listeners to the shirts. They were wearing sure enough
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:37.120]  They are an info wars viewers. They went out to hold up signs on the side of the highway
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:44.240]  Saying impeach Obama for NSA spying and stuff and the police came and choked them and took them to jail or choked mark
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.560]  So dr. Weed and mark
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.640]  Mesmer thank you for coming on thought criminals
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.160]  Tell us tell us
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:00.800]  About what happened and what happened once you got to jail and and were you lectured by the state police or did they apologize?
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.800]  for acting like North Korean soldiers a
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560]  No, we weren't lectured
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.360]  We were just out there holding our signs impeach Obama like we've done before
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.160]  and this time the
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.880]  Highway patrol along with the st. Charles the city police showed up in force. I think at one time
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.480]  I counted eight police cars out there
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.560]  They came up and they said that you know, we came up here to remove you from this overpass
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.120]  Wow, so what are you being charged with?
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.880]  We haven't been able to determine yet. I'll make some phone calls of and
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:42.080]  I'm not sure we were charged with anything. Well, how about we just send you to the the reeducation camps that the Army manual
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.240]  Calls for that would teach you to not be like this anymore. What do you think you are America?
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.920]  We're all headed there Alex if people stand up and exercise their rights
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.920]  So how many police showed up it looked like at least a dozen?
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:02.800]  There was definitely at least one police for every protester up there. We had I think we had about 10 or 12 protesters up there
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.440]  Okay, and I've looked at Missouri law. It says as long as you're not impeding traffic
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.800]  You can have signs on the side of the road and it's the same all over the country
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.360]  I guess they just ordered you to leave and you didn't and then that was enough
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:22.040]  Right. That's right. I have a friend of mine who's the chief of police in a neighboring county
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:29.040]  And he said that there was no law and he said that's the reason we kept asking him what ordinance. What law are we breaking by water authority?
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:35.080]  Are you ordering this off and when I asked that question the arresting officer just pointed to his uniform like this
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080]  And he said you see I'm a peace officer, right?
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.640]  And so implying that his authority came from from his uniform
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.720]  but my my friend the chief of police said that he thought that
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.960]  There's some type of law that allows them to be charged with a crime
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.080]  There's some type of law that allows them to hold people for 24 hours while they're seeking a warrant
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.880]  And he said that they considered that unethical
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.560]  But they will use that to hold someone for 24 hours
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.800]  Even though they have no intention to seek an alarm because he said he didn't think we did anything wrong
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:12.360]  Oh, yeah, it's a custodial custodial arrest and look what it is is a giant power grab. It's unconstitutional. It's been defeated
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.520]  Literally hundreds of times just like failure to ID has been defeated
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:21.880]  Uh, literally thousands of times in that case. They don't care. It's all about you will follow my order now
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:27.400]  But common law all of it states that you have the right to resist including with deadly force
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.720]  Unconstitutional actions in the minute he used an illegal chokehold on you mark. You had a right
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.240]  I think you should sue them for civil rights violations
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.440]  Not that we're so happy, but you know if we don't stand up for the first amendment, we're not going to have anything
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:50.040]  Very true, Alex, and we are considering that for sure because they just I think they did it to break us and punish us for questioning them
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.800]  But because we are info world listeners and very liberty minded
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:59.000]  We know our rights and we knew that was unconstitutional what they're asking us to do and it was a request not a lawful order
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.240]  And we know the difference
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.440]  Absolutely, I mean a lot of police now literally they even have cases of them pulling good-looking women over
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:12.040]  Or in some cases not even and ordering them to have sex with them and then getting in trouble because they actually believe they can order
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.040]  You to say come to your door and make them, you know, make you mother-in-law
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920]  Right
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:24.920]  That'd be an awful little unlawful order and we all your listeners know that but we're trying to awaken others and certainly other
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.920]  Processor to there for the first time
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.800]  They finally got an education in it and they have learned from that event last Saturday
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:39.800]  Well again, tell us exactly where this happened and and when the next demonstration is because I think it's important to double and triple down now
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.800]  nationwide
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.040]  I'm also told that the governor was involved and actually ordered these demonstrations shut down. Give us your take on that
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.800]  Certainly
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.800]  We were uh, we certainly don't need their permission, but we were told on our camera
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.800]  We have the footage that we could come back next Saturday
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.800]  So that's exactly what we intend to do doc you want to share the it's uh, the local government
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:08.200]  You want to share the yeah, it's the location is an exit 229 on interstate highway 70. This is uh in st. Charles
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:15.800]  It's that's the fairgrounds overpass and um, we uh, we this this story got a lot of press here
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.040]  Locally it was on all the television stations here. It's been talked about every single day on talk radio
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.440]  And I think a lot of people are going to be turning out tomorrow
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:32.920]  Uh, anybody in the area, uh, we welcome you to come out. It should be interesting. The media should be there
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.160]  And it should be a lot of fun
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.400]  And I don't think that the police or the highway patrol is going to dare
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.600]  Take a stand because this has been such an embarrassment for them, but you never know
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.840]  So, uh, it'll definitely be something interesting to see that's right
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.960]  That's why we do this all over the country most areas the police
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.080]  Uh protect the first amendment and and appreciate it knowing that it's their right and their children's valued
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.560]  A hard-won liberty as well
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.000]  Take the rodeo clown, which I've they've now released the video
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.720]  They just said oop. Don't let obama get run over by the bull. That's what clowns always do is
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.280]  You know be chased around by the bull
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.120]  They tried to imply that was racist or criminal and then they're making all the rodeo clowns
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.520]  They'll take sensitivity training that cost them between 300 and a thousand dollars
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.200]  They have obama truth squads up there saying criticizing obama
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.800]  Is illegal and it really looks like the government's trying to intimidate folks in missouri
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:34.200]  Particularly so you go out you have a mac like thugs. It creates national attention
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.680]  You go out now not with 10, but i'd imagine hundreds are going to show up
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.920]  If not thousands and teach them who runs america and that this is still a free country
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.280]  And then we still have a first amendment. So tell folks the time
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:55.560]  And it's everybody who's in missouri needs to make it to this event. What time to defend the first amendment
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.720]  It's from 10 a.m. To 4 p.m. Certainly want a peaceable
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:06.120]  protest and agreement against this government. We're not asking for anything out of the ordinary. We are not provocative tours
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.960]  We saw some comments that we wanted to get arrested. That's certainly not sure. We just no no that's that's the that's the globalist on the thing
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.280]  Just i would not even respond to their disinfo operations
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.360]  Correct
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.880]  I mean look look like when a woman gets raped they always turn around and say she deserved it
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.000]  She shouldn't have been wearing you know a skirt and and and it's always like we just went out and held up signs
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.960]  We're not trying to cause a problem. Don't even respond to the scum. Okay, listen
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.240]  I think everybody should show up first at 10 a.m. Because they may try to intimidate the first group that gets there
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.920]  We need everybody to show up at 10 a.m. And if you can't come later
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.240]  But 10 a.m. This Saturday and of course this is going to happen nationwide again, correct
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.960]  I'm not sure if tomorrow is actually nationwide or this is just something we did here. I don't believe it is
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.640]  Yeah, I don't think I don't think this is this one. This this movement is nationwide
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.040]  But as far as tomorrow
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.040]  Actually, I heard that oh, yeah tomorrow is only going to be here in st. Charles, Missouri
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.040]  This is not nationwide tomorrow just tomorrow. There is a
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:10.200]  Um capital on on september 11th, which is also begins the veto session and there's other issues along with that at Jackson city
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.800]  By the way, I want to add the rodeo clown that made fun of obama
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:19.160]  Which is something that that the first clowns did back in greece, you know against politicians as well there
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.800]  I mean, that's just part of a free society. Uh, he's been offered a job down here in texas
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.720]  But before I get to the truth squad stuff where the police are on the news saying will arrest you if you criticize obama
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:36.040]  Uh, what is going on with your police because I continue to see video of Missouri police acting like
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.640]  Gestapo
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:43.480]  I mean, I know you've been federalized to a certain extent with the mayak report saying gun owners are all terrorist up there
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.840]  But what's going on with your police? Have they been totally obama fine?
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.960]  You know, um
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.520]  I'm not a an enemy of the police and I know there are a lot of good police officers
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.040]  And I actually have friends like I said the chief of police is a friend of mine
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.080]  So I have friends who are police police are definitely following on one side of the line or the other
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.840]  And that's a side whether they're going to keep their oath and respect their constitutional rights
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.880]  Or whether they're going to follow their their orders and continue to trample on our rights
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:18.840]  Uh, so um as far as here in missouri of missouri highway patrol does not have a good reputation because a while back
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.960]  They released against missouri state law. They released the list of concealed carry
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.760]  Permit holders to the federal. Oh, yeah, your state police are bad news, man
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.200]  And they're trying to take over the sheriff, uh, alex
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.600]  Last november we had a sheriff petition going that was worded totally wrong and it said they want to create a new
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.040]  County police department what that does essentially takes the sheriff department
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.840]  Splits into two departments where the old sheriff department now does the court duties. Oh, yeah. No, no, no
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.080]  That's the u.n. Gen 21 deal uh in england and here they're getting rid of the sheriffs
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.520]  They don't want us to be able to elect our protector our peace officer. They don't want that relationship
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.680]  They want a bunch of look the state police have all been federalized since 1933. That's on record. Most of them don't even know that
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.160]  And and and your state police are legendary now for violating rights
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.760]  And they know they've got good people in missouri that are patriots and they're there to bully you and break your will
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.040]  They're the ones that put out the report saying gun owners and returning veterans of the number one terror threat
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.480]  Remember the myack report. Yes. All right. Yeah, I've heard it
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.920]  I mean, I mean no state police walked up and looked at you like you were the scum of the earth
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.640]  Bugging their eyes down and started choking you. I mean they need to be arrested
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.440]  Do you remember why because I said the word tyranny and then he flipped a switch and choked me
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.120]  Well, that's because they're guilty. Well, you know what look look just remember bad cops
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.160]  You're gonna lose everything to you fools and I know you don't care
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.960]  But later remember I want to play a clip of the tyranny that is in missouri right now
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:56.520]  They've got this in illinois and vermont of all places. I've seen them arrest people with true squads. This is five years ago now
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.640]  Now rodeo clowns can't make fun of obama now
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.760]  You can't hold a sign on the side of the street folks in america because they put ads on tv
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.560]  Saying criticizing that degenerate liar. Obama is illegal. Here's a clip of it
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:17.160]  Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.000]  During the presidential campaign
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.200]  This was john mills is live at the county election board in maple. But he's been learning more about which members of law enforcement
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.320]  All law enforcement are getting involved in this. John. Tell us more about this
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:34.840]  Russell, good evening prosecutors and sheriffs from across missouri are joining something called the barack obama truth squad
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:41.160]  Two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team. We met them this afternoon in the central west end
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:46.360]  They are jennifer joist from the city bob mccullough the st. Louis county prosecuting attorney
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:53.080]  They will be reminding voters that barack obama is a christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.800]  250,000
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:03.080]  They plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might violate missouri ethics laws
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:09.880]  We want to keep this campaign focused on is turn around you can watch all the different newscasts type in obama truth squads
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:15.960]  And then the guarantee they're in your area training us that authoritarianism is the way dr. Dwayne weed and mark mesmer

[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:34.760]  Folks we are back live here and we're going to get into the nightmare situation unfolding in syria
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.280]  That is so over the top corrupt and overtly
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Absurdest that I have trouble even
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.680]  Even being able to process it mentally
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.480]  With a syrian girl. Well, we're going to be talking to her here in just a moment
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:55.640]  But first off going back to what we were just talking about if you go to overpass this.org the big national group
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.360]  They have the overpass listed and where it's going to be tomorrow in missouri, but they're emailing us also

[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.960]  Out of my skeleton crew
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:15.080]  Who wants to go to missouri? I'd like to be able to send two reporters. I don't know if we have the people
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.320]  I would think josh and jacari
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.840]  Are two great camera guys that we could send up there for jacari to report and josh to shoot video
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.720]  Uh, but uh, we'll see who's able to go
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:31.000]  But then that brings up the next issue. I want to get on an airplane and go up there myself
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.480]  and
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.760]  Get in the face in a peaceful lawful way to the bully
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:43.560]  State police and go shame on you saying veterans of the terror threat shame on you wanting our guns. You're federalized
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.280]  Here's the war powers act of 33 and just let them arrest me if they want so I can sue them
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:54.520]  By the way, we sued from the g21 with rob dubbing arrested. I'm tired of it
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  I'm tired of you trampling on the first amendment
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.280]  Do you have any idea how many people died for that first amendment? You have any idea?
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.960]  How many people have died in darkness for the light of liberty?
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.280]  Do you have any idea what's inscribed over the george washington?
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.720]  Unknown revolutionary war soldier gravesite in philadelphia
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:22.280]  Inscribed above it are the words that many men have died in darkness for the light of liberty
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.760]  And I am I just couldn't with the video when the state police show up
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.120]  Oh bugging their eyes out and rushing up and start choking people
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.320]  I mean that is a salt you are disgusting filth
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:42.520]  Excuse me. I just know where this leads historically. They've already got it our country. They've already got it the the treasury
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:47.240]  They've already gutted all the pension funds. It's already all gone folks. They just haven't dropped the hammer yet
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.760]  And and and they're putting poison in the food and the water
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.440]  I mean, of course the new world order poison the american food and water supply
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.400]  To lower iqs and dumb us down all the numbers show that
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.080]  Because we were their main enemy. We were the big free powerful country
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.560]  They wanted to run us to set up their world government
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.680]  So they came in and took us over and now we're captured and they're trying to mop up what's left of america
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.440]  And and and I get angry because it's over the top
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.880]  To see obama
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.800]  Last night on cnn say there's not even allegations that we're doing anything wrong
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.400]  Just lying to people and then cnn 30 minutes ago
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:33.960]  Was going the polar bears are all dying and i'm sitting there and I know they put this lie out to school kids, but to adults
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.480]  Look it up for yourself
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.400]  Polar bear populations are up five times in the arctic
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:47.640]  And in every other part where they roam out of the arctic they don't go far below the arctic circle in the northern canada
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.640]  Just look at the guys just type in polar bear population up five fold. I mean, you'll I mean that's national geographic
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.840]  I just I just cannot believe their lies
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.600]  It'd be like saying cockroaches are going extinct or something
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.120]  And it's it's it's incredible what they do
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:10.040]  And then they go look the the north pole is almost melted and it showed the summer melt which has always happened
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:15.240]  I tell you have the northern passage in the spring and summer for ships for 500 years
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.400]  because the
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.880]  The ice melts and the ships can do the northern passage
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.800]  But I'm cursed with being just informed about basic stuff
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:33.000]  But they point a satellite at it and go here's just the melting in the last four months shows the north pole shrinking
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  by half
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.040]  As it's done since the days of leaf ericsson
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  And that's what makes me get so upset we're gonna go and get a report from syrian girl here in just a moment
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  I first want to point something out here
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:56.360]  People like glenbeck have built amazing with the 200 million dollars he makes a year
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:01.320]  When there's radio shows that are bigger that can't do that
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.640]  He's very smart people around him hired the former head of clear channel hired a bunch of top executives
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.520]  They know what they're doing and on record used our model of media
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.520]  There's been news articles about it to build a true internet platform and then put it on television
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:16.920]  I've been announcing I want to do this for 10 years and of course I saw where the internet was going
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:24.600]  Uh, and I'm glad people like glenbeck have done that. I'm sad that I see him promoting war in syria now with the nerve gas garbage
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:29.240]  And another wmd hoax this time. There's real dead people. But clearly it's the rebels
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.320]  We have less than one twentieth that much money every year and I am maxed out
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  Got a little bit of money in the bank
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.560]  A little bit of money and property as an emergency backup where I live that's it
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.600]  And I'm spending money. I made three years ago
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:52.120]  We had a good year three years ago. I'm spending that actually more than I take in right now
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:58.680]  To to finish the studios the uplinks everything I'm doing I want to be able to hire like three more reporters
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.040]  I want to be able to hire another camera person. I want to be able to hire more people
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:07.560]  I want to build a media organization and I couldn't have done this without you supporting us buying the books the videos

[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.440]  He does to make all this money. I don't have the big global of sponsors
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.720]  I need to just make a few million more a year
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.520]  To be able to effectively change history
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.320]  So I'm going to tell you right now ladies and gentlemen

[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.800]  We're not keeping score. We need money
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:48.280]  To fund the news division like I will spend emergency backup money to send reporters
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.520]  up to

[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.600]  I am really cracking the whip around here and in a good way and we are i'm you know
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.760]  I'm up through till 10 o'clock at night almost every night
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.120]  It because I know my children have no future if we don't do this. So i'm trying to go to the next level
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:49.400]  I'm not a businessman. I'm not a media mogul. I'm a talk show host and an analyst, but I've got to wear every hat
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.600]  I've got to do it. I've got the expertise. I know how to do it
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  I've got to step up and I'm committed to this fight, but I need you to go to your it's basically donating to buy the products at
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.760]  m4store.com or m4washealth.com. That's what it comes down to. Okay
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:10.120]  Joining us is a lady who's been on with us in the last year plus as things have escalated
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:17.640]  Uh, and she's since gone public with her full name and who she is and been on national TV in Australia
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.960]  her family
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.400]  Left Australia because uh, basically Assad ran some of them out
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.120]  So they don't like Assad and they're suing
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.920]  They were formerly you know part of the you know ruling party and the top folks in the country
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.200]  Uh, but that said she now for the last year plus has been very very critical
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:44.360]  Uh of what's happening there because it's foreign governments bringing an al-qaeda to carry out unbelievable atrocities blowing up churches
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.160]  You name it and she's been on for over a year the videos the news articles are on info wars.com
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:53.400]  Saying they're gonna stage a fake chemical attack. They've been caught staging some smaller ones
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:43:00.200]  Look at who put out the report, but but Syrian girl tell folks who you really are on air a little bit about yourself
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:06.360]  I think that's important what your real name is for folks that don't know and and your twitter your facebook up front
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:13.400]  So they understand and so they can go read the articles you've written the videos you did going back over a year that have all proven
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.280]  100 accurate and then tell us
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.480]  Even though you're getting you've been opposed to Assad, you know
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:25.560]  You've joined supporting that government because it is criminal to offensively come in and engage in mass murder
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:32.840]  So so so break down the latest from family. You've still got living there of what's happening as you join us
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.800]  From australia. Thank you for joining us
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.520]  Thanks a lot for having me again. Um, you know, it's a great
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:46.280]  Great podium to have that's independent one of the few podiums that actually listens to
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.200]  Um, this voice this message that is being drowned out because
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.800]  I actually don't want to fuel the war in syria. My intentions from the start
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.240]  is to try to expose
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.800]  the reality of the bigger grander scheme that's
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.600]  on being played here and
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.600]  personally, um
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.760]  My family were not exiled from syria, but they my previous
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.520]  Well, my grandfather was in government
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560]  Deposed by the bath party coup
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.920]  So my family as a whole from both sides have always been opposition and I grew up, um
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  You know being
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:41.800]  Um against the government being told about how terrible the crimes of the government were against, you know, my own family members
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.880]  Some of which went to jail under suspicion of being muslim brotherhood
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.600]  so, um
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.320]  For 20 years in fact, so I'm not
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.560]  Gonna come here and deny that the government wasn't a dictatorship. It wasn't corrupt
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.560]  Um that
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.120]  You know that people weren't angry with it
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.560]  And I'm not going to say that there there wasn't, you know, a legitimate
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.200]  Reason for people to want to create that change
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:23.080]  But the fact is that that was totally exploited. Um, and even preplanned by the foreign agendas, the us, um, nato, uh
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:26.360]  Basically the global elite as you call them
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.280]  Absolutely. And again, your real name is Mimi. Allah him
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.560]  You've had a lot of courage, uh, just in how long since you went public. It's been about a year and a half, right?
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.200]  I believe so. Yes. It was early. It was early last year
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.360]  But but this has been going on now for two and a half years and they call them activists
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:50.520]  They have tanks. They have Chinese toe missiles. They have us toe missiles. They have stingers. They have heat-seeking missiles
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:55.800]  They're blowing up churches blowing up airports blowing up markets and they're called heroes
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:00.520]  On seeing in and so even though the father Assad was somewhat brutal
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:08.280]  Compared to al-qaeda. He was a good guy. Now. It's correct to say that the the the son trained in england was loosening things though
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.280]  Or is that improper to say?
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:18.200]  No, it was definitely loosening things like every year I would go back and I would see that people were more open
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920]  speaking more openly the first
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:25.160]  A step you took was to release some political prisoners, but whilst he was
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:31.240]  Doing something good on one hand on the other hand you could say that there was government
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.200]  Failings and maybe his policy absolutely opening the economy
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:43.320]  Actually made the rich rich and the poor poor. Well, maybe maybe absolutely always willing to do that
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.040]  That's why I don't want a big centralized government. It will centralize the economy. That's just the way it is
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:54.440]  So that said we've shown the other side that your family's been opposition for 20 years. Now. Let's shift gears
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.640]  Into what's on record that the CIA the NATO commandos the heavy weapons
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.440]  The chemical attack that you over a year ago
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.040]  You were the first person to say they're going to a chemical false flag now the Russians have said they've done that they've caught
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:14.760]  I'm doing it before. What do you know about this latest attack right as the
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  UN inspector showed up
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:24.520]  Okay, well as you exactly said, you know, this incident occurred a day after the UN arrived in Damascus
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.920]  And the timing of it was you know, the Syrian government actually requested the UN presence
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.240]  To investigate another incident which was in Khan al-Assal in Aleppo
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.040]  So actually the UN team was
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.880]  Only kilometers away from the site because they were in Damascus
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.880]  When this happened exactly, they don't want the last chemical attacks that have been proven fake
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  Certified so they did a new bigger one
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440]  It's a logical
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:59.080]  To think that the Syrian government is going to profit from this just by the way that the media is reacting to this
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.840]  And you know one year to the day of this event
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.920]  Exactly was Obama's red line speech. That's right of
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720]  where he proposed the attack
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.560]  That's right of where he promised, you know, some sort of
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:20.600]  Unnamed action if Syria were to use chemical weapons and people inferred that that was a no fly zone
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.400]  and you know, that was the same time that
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:29.880]  Me and many other bloggers Tony Karchlucci were saying, you know, it looks like from the way they're posturing
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:37.400]  That they want to create some kind of chemical incident to give them an excuse to to intervene in some way
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.640]  now
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.160]  you know, I think it's absolutely undeniable that
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.800]  Little children died in Damascus three days ago and that the images are shocking and
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:55.880]  Anyone can see
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  cannot deny that and
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.880]  I'm not going to
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.640]  Comment on the nature of the gas that was used. I'm going to leave that to experts
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.240]  And I also don't want to implicate the rebels as a whole
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:13.960]  Because you know while you can say some of them are al-qaeda some of them are foreign some of them are thieves, you know
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  some of them would
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:21.880]  I have as we as I showed on my channel used a prisoner as an unwitting suicide bomber
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.560]  um
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:29.960]  And this is part of the the FSA that's one of the groups under the FSA umbrella that did this
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:37.080]  That's not an al-qaeda group. So, um, I don't want to implicate them directly because I'm sure that some of them
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.160]  had families that live in that area and I believe that
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.520]  They themselves are patsies to a global
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.960]  Game that you know, they're can fodder for and
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:56.280]  The powers that we have managed to convince them that they're going to get armed. They're going to get um
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:02.120]  No fly zones, but the reality of the situation is and what I do know
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:08.200]  Is that the us doesn't attack countries that actually possess chemical weapons
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.280]  and in order to achieve any kind of attack they would first have to um
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.760]  Get rid of a country's chemical weapons and this is one of the one of the reasons one of the
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:28.520]  Uh core causes for this war not only that but of course they want to um divide Syria up into many states
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.160]  And they they want to crush any um rogue states basically
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:36.120]  Yeah, any state not run by goldman sacks basically
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.880]  Uh, so we'll uh come right back on the other side and break that down
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.280]  Europe's been conquered by goldman sacks. They actually brag about that and jp morgan
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:48.920]  And the big royal families that set atop it and it is just unbelievable
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.880]  That this is going on and right on time
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  Uh, you have this chemical attack
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.360]  Right when the inspectors are there and of course the Syrian government has denied it

[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:47.000]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.320]  An ultimate extermination the war is here. It's an info war the spirit of 1776
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.720]  versus the mindset of
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.200]  1984
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.960]  You take a model man
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:18.840]  Me me allaheem known as syrian girl before her identity was revealed by australian tv news
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.640]  Um
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.200]  Is a family basically uh self exiled because of political reasons they don't like Assad
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.560]  But Assad was moving towards more of what you'd call democratization
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:37.800]  And reaching out to the west and i followed geopolitical developments. So was qaddafi
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.600]  He invested most his money with goldman sats and jp morgan and invited them all in opened up apologized
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.760]  Boy, they set him up
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.880]  Bam brought in al qaeda and now they've wrecked the whole country. They don't want africa being lifted up
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:58.600]  They want them to industrialize in fact the foundations complained about libya libya was jacking up all of africa
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.520]  By jacking them up by giving them aid be creating an infrastructure
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:08.280]  Globalists don't want anybody to have an infrastructure folks except them. It's called agenda 21
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.240]  It's military corporatism
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:17.080]  But that's that's the new order. It's militarized corporatism. That's the best way to describe them right there my term
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.960]  militarized corporatism
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.280]  scorched earth and and in closing
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.840]  Uh, then they got they've now got a lot of analysts saying this could lead to world war three with the russians there
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.400]  The russians are saying it's a false flag
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.800]  The the rebels have been caught three other times doing these fake chemical things
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.520]  Since the red line deal, but this one was bigger
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.960]  Uh, and i'm so sad for all the forces that are there, but we know of the countries turned over to al qaeda
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:48.200]  That i mean in my summation. What is that 10 times worse than Assad 20 times?
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.080]  Uh, your comments on that and other points and where you think this is going to go now
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:58.840]  I think you headed exactly where I was going to go in that direction
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:02.120]  I want to make it clear that as bad as the government used to be
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  What they have planned for to take power in Syria now is going to be 10 times worse as you said and
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:16.040]  You only need to look at history of what happened in libya and what happened in iraq to see that the u.s
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.120]  Government's intentions in the region was not democratization
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.440]  You know those governments those new ones tortured just as much as the previous ones
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.520]  If not more so only the the country that they're in is is completely decimated. That's the only difference
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.920]  and you know the
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:39.320]  The fact about libya as you said you know goddafi he really fell for it. He opened up the gates. He thought let's be friends
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.040]  They said in 2003
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.920]  He probably knew his country would be next on the list
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:52.920]  So in 2003 after the iraq invasion had already begun. He agreed to weapons of mass destruction disarmament
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.280]  And he was attacked in 2011 and I just said, you know, the the u.s
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.080]  Government is not going to attack a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:05.880]  They first have to remove them and you know
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.840]  From here on out, let's just call it goldman sacks
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.920]  I mean they brag they run the country
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.440]  So goldman sacks wants you to give up your wmds invest with them then they bring an al-qaeda
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.320]  Well, they destroy your country and then they make money by rebuilding it. Yeah, of course
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:27.080]  Exactly, right, you know, it's it's it's not even the u.s. Government. It's just a shortcut
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:33.560]  But then they roll into the water fluoridation in the shots and suddenly nobody can tie your shoelaces and you're like americans
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.800]  And it's game over. You're dead. Yeah
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.800]  I think it's just the face of something much darker and bigger and global
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.800]  And
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:43.720]  You know in iraq
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:50.200]  They were again disarmed in 1991 using the united nations and were attacked in 2003
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:58.600]  After the united nations was used again to make absolutely certain that saddam hadn't hidden some stash of wmd somewhere
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.080]  And in fact the u.s military when they invaded they were still
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:08.360]  Afraid of it enough to provide all their soldiers with gas masks. Oh, yeah, that's what the u.n
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:13.960]  Does it comes in as the peacekeeper to disarm you and then nato it comes in with the u.s. And murders everybody
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.840]  Absolutely
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.960]  Stay there man. I tell you just she has a way of crystallizing stuff that takes me hours to say

[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:30.920]  They want to destroy all independent nations the family

[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.840]  These are genocide operations
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.800]  And they're genociding our troops with the du and the vaccines and the force drugging as well
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:03.800]  The new world order we have a clip of a professor and his students
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:09.320]  Upon info wars.com today saying yeah, we need you know cut off the food
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.080]  And have genetically engineered bio weapons to get rid of people
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.560]  And you hear everybody clapping and smiling and it's a big group of graduate students and
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.200]  It's a power trip folks
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:26.920]  And they see it as exterminating cockroaches. So just understand good old boys and others that say, oh, let's kill them Arabs
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:31.240]  They're killing you too. So drink your fluoride
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:35.080]  Syrian girl finishing up. We got about four minutes in the segment other eloquent points
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.160]  You'd like to make about I see mainstream articles here saying Assad will still win
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:43.720]  But it looks like the globalists aren't going to stop. I mean, what do you expect them to do next?
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.600]  I
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:51.240]  I want to make it clear that I predict that there's not going to be a no fly zone
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:56.840]  You know if the u.s. Was going to do that if the the globalists were going to do that they would have done it 10 red lines ago
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:03.160]  Um, the russian veto wouldn't have stopped them. I think that what they really want to see is this armament of syria
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:06.040]  And they want to see syria get Balkanized and broken up
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:11.160]  Um, you know, well, yeah, Kissinger said that's what he wants. Kissinger said that. Yeah
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:20.760]  He absolutely said it and it was a run poll son ran poll who said that he heard that they were fighting towards a stalemate as well from another source
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:23.720]  So, um, you know, I just wanted to that and just
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:32.040]  To give evidence that at the un and Israeli ambassador a year ago said that we should expect to see the u.s.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.400]  The syrian government gassing children in the future
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:42.120]  And one year later, you know the smoke clears and the same ambassador said, you know, we we want to make sure that those syrian
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:49.480]  chemical weapons stockpiles don't end up in the hands of hasbullah. So really it's not about serious children
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:56.520]  It's not about it's about the chemical weapons. You know, it's about getting at them because they don't want to have any country that has a deterrent
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.960]  Not, you know, except for themselves. They want to control all the power just like they do with the guns
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.800]  So it's like they trick Saddam to use nerve gas on the iranians
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  And then later use that to invade him
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:15.560]  The iran-irak war was they're tricking both sides, you know to attack each other and um,
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:19.560]  On the on the
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:27.400]  GMO, you know Bremer one of the first things he did in iraq was allow GMO and syria in 2011
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:33.720]  Assad banned genetically modified food. So there's definitely these gains happening with monsanto
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.760]  You know being one of the corporate war mongers the the dogs of war
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:39.560]  Sure
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.920]  Well, Mimi, you know it came out the one in telegraph and bbc that Assad's people listen to this show
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.200]  And I can't believe these governments aren't sophisticated enough to figure this stuff out on their own
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:52.920]  I'm not being cynical. It's just that like Assad's dad sending him stuff. M fall war is them
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.400]  I mean, I don't understand why these governments are so rigid. They can't even figure this out
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:03.880]  Like why did the Arabs and the Persians let the west trick them into killing each other? Just I don't I don't understand this
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:06.360]  Why do they have to listen to me to figure this out?
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:09.240]  I think um
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:11.640]  You know people's
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.600]  Hated of each other can be easily fueled
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.520]  And that's what we're you know to divide and conquer
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:27.400]  And the name your neighbor your brother becomes an enemy worse than
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.320]  Then the enemy that's actually pulling your strings both of both of you from far away
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:37.240]  And I saw it happen in iraq. I saw it happen
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:43.000]  All over the place Libya, of course, so well Syrian girl, I'd like to get you on the nightly news
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.920]  Since this is all unfolding. I know we got you up very early over in Australia
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.800]  So you can give us a full and uninterrupted report with one of our reporters if you want to do that
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:56.200]  We'll set that up right now. We can dial you up in the next 10 minutes to do that for the nightly news
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:59.640]  If you'd like please tell the crew. Thank you very much. Uh, Mimi

[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:21.800]  The problem is we can't help everybody if every one of us who can will take care of ourselves
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:27.240]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't the new Justin case pack from e-foods direct

[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:43.480]  You need to be ahead of the game out to engineer the opinion of the american people so that they would not only endorse but demand
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.480]  A war
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.480]  Oh there's another one another plane just passed

[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:21.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.200]  By the way ladies and gentlemen
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:35.160]  If you take action if we the people take action
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.760]  There's no way the globalists can carry out their operations
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:45.960]  That's why they feed us gmo that in every study retards the rats that they feed it to and the monkeys that they feed it to in the apes
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:51.400]  That's why they give us the fluoride that in princeton and harvard and university of texas and
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:09:00.680]  Oxford studies shows around 20% iq reduction if you just drink fluoridated water at 1.6 part per million
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.320]  Which is what they put in our water
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.400]  for a decade
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:11.480]  And I just mentioned that again because they have MSNBC going he's insane
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.800]  He thinks we put fluoride in the water now. It's not that
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.840]  They're putting this stuff in the water
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.680]  It's that they're saying that they're not even putting it in the water
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:29.240]  It's like obama and I played the clip in the last hour. It's up on info wars.com said there's not even allegations
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.640]  The nsa is trying to listen in
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.520]  on people's email
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:41.480]  That's like gibbs saying there there is no drone program when the drone program is publicly admitted to exist. We are under
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:51.800]  A dictatorship of kleptocrat eugenicists who enjoy hurting us just like depleted uranium. They wouldn't use it until 1990
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.120]  They had it since world war two
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:01.080]  after the manhattan project 1946 there's papers on it. We've read them on air. We've had dr
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.760]  Doug rocky on a nuclear physicist
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:11.400]  A biologist former head of the pentagon d program. They would not allow him to use it in combat until 1990
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.000]  And then now they just use it everywhere now. They just put it in
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:21.480]  Concrete additives now it's in forklifts now. It's everywhere and the cancer rates go up and up and up and up
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:28.840]  91 percent of nuclear reactors are leaking. That's an associated press headline you can pull up out of 4
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:34.520]  420 something reactors 91 percent are leaking
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:37.960]  Last year when they had reactors leaking out in
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:47.400]  Southern california their answer was we'll just stop turning the alarms on in the city that have been there for 50 years when this happens
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:51.880]  So it is an insanity by the elite
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.920]  Where well i played the clip yesterday where the japanese government is putting on
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:01.080]  newscasts that if you smile studies show things won't hurt you
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.840]  And so smile and the radiation won't hurt you
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:10.120]  Uh, there's the headline a brainwashing campaign radiation doesn't affect people who are smiling
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.080]  And that is an attempt by the japanese government on the news
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:18.680]  We played the clip. By the way, if you're a new listener, i'm not joking
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:25.160]  They're saying if you smile it will protect you doesn't matter that most of the people that responded now are either dead or dying
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:32.360]  You know the uh the uh hundreds of people that were willing to go in there and try to clean that up and now it's melting down
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:34.840]  and degrading even more
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.640]  Now now it's getting worse and and and the stuff's pouring into the ocean
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:47.560]  You've got multiple reactors that are still very dangerous. You've got all these fuel rods the cleanups beginning
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:53.480]  And you've got tepco saying it's extremely dangerous, but you've got our media saying there's no problem
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.840]  Even though three months after the FDA tested yellowfin tune off san diego
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:01.480]  and didn't tell people for a year
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.120]  after that
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:05.880]  so that's uh
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.560]  15 months after then. Oh, yeah, we found higher radiation in fact a lot higher
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.840]  Some cases 10 times higher than what we say is safe in the yellowfin these different cesiums
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.320]  Uh, you know breakdowns
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.000]  And we say it's okay now. We're just going to raise what's safe now
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:28.520]  Now I've kind of set the table for that there. I've read a lot of shocking stuff in rt about, you know, this could be the greatest meltdown ever
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.600]  Coming and could kill millions. Is that fair mongering?
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:39.800]  I see articles about you know, the un says that they believe Chernobyl's killed a million people since 1986 20 plus years ago
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:45.080]  Is who knows? Uh, I I've had dr. Bob bowman on who's a physicist saying
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:49.720]  Undoubtedly we will have more deaths in the in the northern hemisphere from this radiation
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:52.600]  The northern hemisphere is over two times higher radiation
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:00.040]  Now you've got all these reports in Alaska where a lot of the radiation is actually gone of the of the animals dying the people's hair falling out
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:04.760]  The man who's really on top of this who's advised the eu the british government
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:07.880]  He's a chemical physicist has a lot of other letters to his name
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.720]  He's the other camp from the japanese government saying smile
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.840]  Radiations good for you or george mambiat saying we need more radiation. It's good for you or
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:18.760]  uh
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:24.120]  And cultures saying on fox news that the japanese should be thankful radiation is good for you. That's an actual quote
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.720]  So I think she should go live there at fuga shaman since she says that i'm not kidding go live there or shut up
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.600]  Uh, because I don't like this folks the fact that there are all these reports of milk and stuff even in texas with higher radiation
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:38.600]  They're like, oh, don't worry
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.320]  I mean, I mean I just because the elite has gone crazy
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:44.920]  And thinks all this is fine doesn't mean the rest of us have to go off the deep end
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.240]  Uh delusional thinking smiling won't protect you
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:52.280]  And so christopher busby's a british scientist
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.840]  Uh, and uh, he heads up a lot of very important advisory groups
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:03.240]  The low-level radiation campaign l l r c and again, I don't just go off what he says as a physicist
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:09.640]  I have had countless physicists the former head of the star wars program on the head of the pentagon program on
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:14.760]  I've probably had let's not exaggerate. I don't know 20 or so nuclear physicists on
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:21.720]  Famous submarine physicists on you name it who said they were lied to low-level
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:26.840]  If it gets into your body is just as bad because it's point blank up against the cells
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:33.080]  So i'm no physicist, but I can talk to all the top physicists and all the physicists agree with this 50 60 years ago
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.200]  Even 20 years ago. So there's a new irrational
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.160]  delusional let them eat cake
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.160]  Marie Antoinette on pcp
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.080]  Action where everybody just says this is fine now. He's been a hard guy to get he's very very busy
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.520]  But uh, he's able to join us
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:56.040]  Now christopher busby and christopher feel free with all the sites you're involved with
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:02.120]  To mention where people should get all your studies and material, but you've you've heard my little five minute rant here
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.280]  I mean am I the one that's insane should I smile and go live at fukushima?
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:15.800]  Where the animals are now to form the butterflies and the children or or are you right is is radiation bad for us?
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.920]  Alex you're spot-on with your rant, and I hope you continue to rant like this
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:28.040]  But I I can't see any easy way of persuading the governments of the world and the the scientific committees
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:33.800]  The bogus scientific committees that they've set up to operate this system of chicanery and lies
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:40.520]  Any way of stopping them? I mean to be honest these people ought to be sent to jail and and perhaps one day that will happen
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.120]  Who knows but at the moment?
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:47.000]  I see no sign of them backing off from what is clearly a very very serious problem
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:53.640]  And in my opinion probably the worst public health scandal in human history and one that is very likely set
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:57.720]  On destroying all life on earth if it's continued unabated
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:03.880]  This is really a serious serious problem. I mean, I'll give you an example a very a very recent example
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:08.120]  Of the sort of alice in wonderland world that we're living in
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:14.280]  With regard to radiation now you you will recall that the world health organization supremo
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.560]  bloke called wolfgang vice dr. Wolfgang vice
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:19.960]  They had a meeting in 2012
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:27.320]  To to talk about the health effects of fukushima and of course they said there wouldn't be any
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.680]  It wouldn't be any there would be no detectable health effects now
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.880]  What we discover in the last few months
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.560]  Is that a study done by the the medical university in fukushima has turned up now?
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:47.160]  Well, originally 27 cases of thyroid cancer in children and it's now gone up to 44 cases of thyroid cancer in children
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:50.120]  This is an official study now that the university
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:55.960]  Department which made this study they say I mean and it's quoted in the japan times
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:03.160]  They say we do not see that these thyroid cancers are associated with the with the fukushima contamination
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:06.920]  I mean, can you imagine such nonsense now the the actual
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.640]  Background rate for thyroid cancer in japan. I've dug out. It's actually zero
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:19.480]  Now, so this was a study done in 2005 and if we my my colleague
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.600]  Professor michael melko of the institute of power in belarus
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:26.360]  worked
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:33.000]  On the increases in thyroid cancer in in chenobal and he was able to determine a rate a pre chenobal rate in thyroid cancer
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:35.560]  In children and it was something like
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:40.440]  Three cases in 16 years in the whole population of belarus. Okay
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:47.560]  Now therefore, it's easy to work out that the excess risk in in fukushima
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:53.400]  Of thyroid chak chak thyroid cancer in children is approximately 200 times the expected value
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:58.120]  So it's not like 1.5 or 1.3 or 20 percent or something like that
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.520]  It's about 200 times
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:07.560]  But nobody's saying. Oh gosh. We got it wrong. Oh, oh dear the internal radiation must be worse than we thought or any of this stuff
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:11.400]  We hear a deadly silence from these people. They should all be sent to jail
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:15.480]  What has changed dr. Busby because and then I want to come back and talk about
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:21.080]  Uh, the critical nature and the press and how bad off are the six reactors the five damage
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:26.120]  Why are they saying a bigger disaster could come explain it to uh, you know layman like myself out here
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.760]  But we're going to break in about a minute and a half. But first
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.720]  Why
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:36.280]  Are we seeing this delusional manifestation and and and what do you liken it to?
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:43.640]  Uh, where all over the world. They're just raising the level saying it's safe now. What is this mass madness or what is it?
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:46.600]  I think it must be some kind of psychological denial
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.880]  I think I think you'd probably better talk to sociologists and psychologists about this rather than to a scientist
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:55.560]  I mean, I have thought about it and I thought of the various ways in which it can work
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:01.240]  And and I can step back from it and step back from it and eventually we get back to a situation where
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:05.560]  It is really quite political. It's it's about the domination of one
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:12.840]  One set of people by another set of people and the wars and the lies and so on that have continued throughout the whole of history
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:16.520]  And so in order to explain this basically all you're doing is is is
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.640]  Is explaining all the things that have happened in history which are equally insane to be honest
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.120]  We've had situations like this again and again
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.560]  Throughout history and this is so therefore it's not really anything new there except that in this case
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:34.040]  It's a question of the magnitude. So in the past you could have one's
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:40.440]  One set of mafia if you like dominating the people you could have people like for instance in the soviet union originally
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:45.000]  You could have people disappearing and the airbrushing of history and so on and we now see all of this thing
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:46.920]  All of this stuff happening in the united states
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.680]  We'll stay there explain it to us on the other side because I'm guessing you're gonna say now
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.920]  It's a global corporate mafia above the law and they've got melting down reactors
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.360]  Show the thread is much larger. I want to hear the end of this when we come back with dr. Busby on that looks shows
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:08.360]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to mersa and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:11.560]  That often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.640]  Fortunately a simple safe and effective alternative exists

[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:04.200]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger author of the best-selling book cancer step outside the box
[02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.600]  I want you to know some very important information in 1985
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.280]  President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:21.800]  Now 27 years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:26.840]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17

[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:45.880]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from carnivora.com. That's
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:52.280]  c-a-r-n-i-v-o-r-a dot com. That's 1-866-836-8735
[02:23:52.280 --> 02:24:03.240]  1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit carnivora.com. Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:17.080]  All right, we're back live with dr. Christopher Busbee. He is a chemical physicist and
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:25.800]  Advises major governments on issues of radiation. So I've already laid out some of the numbers the statistics. There's over 400 reactors
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:28.680]  90 plus percent are leaking anybody can look that up
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  Now they just say oh, it's okay if it leaks things bigger than Three Mile Island
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.320]  And so everyone knows what radiation does to people
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.320]  Everyone knows it increases cancer. Everyone knows it increases mutation
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:45.960]  Everyone knows who's not even a scientist, but we're entering this world of denial
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.720]  Dr. Busbee, finish your point. They got cut off by the break
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:52.360]  about
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:56.600]  Crazies in the past mafia in the past versus the current global mafia
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.520]  And then let's get into why I'm seeing articles all over the place
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:03.080]  mainstream and alternative saying
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:06.680]  Fukushima the worst is yet to come and then tell us if that's true or not
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:08.920]  Yes, right
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:14.040]  Well, what market forces and the kind of concentration of the global mafia has been able to do
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:17.480]  Is to produce such an enormously powerful military
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  and nuclear orientated
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:25.880]  Structure that that it's possible to choose scientists
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.520]  And to pay them pay those scientists that you want to tell you the things that you want to hear
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:37.240]  Or to tell you the things that enable you to continue with the operation that's making you lots of money and acquiring lots of power
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:41.560]  Now, of course, you can step back from that and I have a number of times tried to
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:46.280]  To to understand what it is that makes certain people want to be powerful and rich
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.480]  What kind of insecurities there are and certainly we see throughout history people like
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:57.160]  Well, if you like Hitler insecure people who who become powerful because of their insecurity
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:02.280]  And terrible things can happen because then they can acquire around themselves other people like themselves
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:05.800]  And they can pay those people and then you end up with a situation
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:10.920]  Which is monolithic and virtually impossible to to deal with and terrible things happen
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:12.920]  But what what we have now
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:19.800]  Is something that is it is almost universal and global and the situation because of the sheer magnitude of the problem
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:27.080]  The the the level of radionuclide emissions into the environment from all sorts of sources from the depleted uranium from the new
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:33.080]  Super weapons that use uranium from the endless leaking of these nuclear power stations
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.560]  Which which have just continued and are getting worse because as the as the nuclear power stations themselves are getting old
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.880]  All of these things have have conspired together to increase the concentration of radionuclides in the environment to a level
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:48.760]  Where it is now threatening life on earth
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:55.000]  There's no question that it is reducing fertility that it is increasing cancer and
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:02.760]  And that's the future looks really quite bleak and and and particularly it looks bleak because of what I can now go on to
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:05.880]  You asked me to look at this this Fukushima situation
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:07.880]  I want to do that. I want to do that in a moment
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:13.320]  I don't want to digress back to what you were just saying briefly and then we'll get into the latest on Fukushima itself while everybody's tuning in
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:15.880]  But what you say so eloquently is what?
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:21.000]  Eisenhower in his farewell address warned about he said the military industrial complex
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.480]  has been seized
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:25.480]  by corporate interest and
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:29.720]  And it itself is in seizing the entire scientific complex
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:35.160]  To where they will be unopposable and now they've hired all these mercenary scientists
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.400]  That will go along with anything
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:41.960]  And it does seem like the madness of Nero or something
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:47.640]  It's not it's it's even worse because not only do they acquire scientists by paying the money
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:53.400]  In order to to to to provide bogus scientific reports that support their position
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:58.680]  But anyone who happens to stand up and say something which they don't like or find something which goes against
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:04.440]  Their their their crazy world view this person gets swiftly dealt with. I mean I can name names
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.960]  There was a young scientist in Sweden called Martin Tondell
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:13.000]  Who discovered that there was a significant increase in cancer in the sweet northern Sweden
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.160]  After the very small amounts of radioactivity conventionally expressed
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.000]  That fell in northern Sweden after the Chernobyl accident
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.040]  Now he was swiftly dealt with by his boss
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:30.280]  His boss is a chap called Lars Eric Holm who was the ex-head of the international commission on radiological protection
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:35.400]  And is now would you believe can you imagine the medical officer of health for sweden?
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:35.960]  Wow
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:41.320]  So if you if you want to know what's happening in sweden in terms of health you go to Lars Eric Holm who is
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.160]  The ex-head of the international commission on radiological protection
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:47.960]  Well, that's like obama is putting cast sunstein
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.800]  The regulations are that said it was okay to spy on people without warrants
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:56.120]  On the NSA blue ribbon board to investigate the NSA
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:57.720]  Yes, yes
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:03.320]  Well, of course we can and we can find many many many situations in which this sort of thing on santo
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:10.280]  It's it's a it's a sort of third world war. Isn't it? It's it's it's the it's the governments versus the people. It's truly extraordinary
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.640]  Wow, we're gonna go to break long segment coming up and I want to then get into what's happening at uh
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:23.960]  At Fukushima itself, but it is it's it's like a bunch of crazy governments and corporations above the law
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.680]  Not in control of themselves
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:30.760]  Just on total power trips who don't even care about their grandchildren
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:36.200]  Dr. Busby, what's the best place for people to visit to see all your scientific papers and work?
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:42.120]  Uh, my green audit website. Uh is is w w w green audit dot org
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:48.280]  Uh, and I there's also a very good website, which I'm associated with called the low-level radiation campaign website

[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:53.720]  And then I've got all the different mainstream. You name it. Uh saying, you know, Fukushima leak is much worse than we were led to believe
[02:33:53.720 --> 02:33:55.720]  That's a bbc

[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:13.960]  Most of the Fukushima 50 are dead or dying including the director, but it's not bad for you and culture says
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.760]  See when I called her first said that I thought man, she's gone crazy, but I turned out that was a talking point
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:24.920]  And see my issue here is people say, what are you worried about radiation? You don't agree with the environmentalists and a lot of stuff
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.800]  I'm a real conservationist environmentalist. Okay. I don't want toxic waste in my food and water
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.920]  I don't like gmo because I've got unlimited studies and know how bad it is and no farmers that feed to their cows and it kills them
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.880]  I mean, I've experienced it
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:45.320]  And then I read about the groups that are putting these out. It's about population reduction and then you kind of get the answer
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:51.480]  They don't care whatever they do because it's just like it's not even a reduced population. It's like an anti-human thing. It's it's a psychopathic
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.920]  And you know, you talk about carbon dioxide
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:59.480]  And what we're doing you can argue all day what carbon dioxide is doing to the earth
[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:03.240]  The point is they want a carbon tax for the elites to get real rich
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  The first people to push that were
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.480]  Ken lay and al gore from in run
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:15.240]  But if they do something about the reactors and the gmo and all that and then came to me and said we really think
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:19.800]  Carbon dioxide's a big issue then I'd listen to them, but I've gone and looked at all the big threats. It's
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:22.520]  radiation gmo
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:25.800]  Then there's stuff like overfishing that I know is real and you know
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:29.160]  Overcutting of things and run. I mean, there's a lot of real stuff
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:32.280]  The problem is none of these big corporations want to do anything about that
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:37.320]  They just want to run around and have carbon taxes because it doesn't affect what they're doing
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:39.800]  Because they can just tax everybody
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.960]  And and the only reason I raise that is because you look at what's going on with Fukushima
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:50.760]  In the last month all the alternative media and dr. Busby and others have said this is getting serious
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:53.480]  And then now it's strange that he's on today
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:36:00.280]  Suddenly it's breaking in the mainstream media other than Japanese media. They were admitting it a few weeks ago that this is very serious
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:03.320]  So you're a physicist you've studied this your team has been there
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:06.280]  What's really happening with the reactors?
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:12.840]  Why are people so scared and how are they saying this is going to be much worse than what's already happened? Is that accurate?
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:19.640]  Well, it it is going to be much worse than it's that then has already happened if certain things happen
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:25.320]  But I can't really see any way of stopping those things happen. So I I I'm afraid I don't have a very
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.440]  Very positive outlook with regard to all of this, but I should start by saying that I always said it was serious
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:36.920]  What's happening now is people are slowly cocking on to the fact that everyone that was talking about it was covering it all up
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.960]  And now it's becoming increasingly clear and then the future will be increasingly more clear
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:47.400]  But that all along it was very serious right from the very beginning from the first explosions
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.560]  Which threw all the bits and pieces of reactor and fuel rods and whatnot up in the air where they went pitter-patter onto the ground
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:37:01.400]  And and the fact that the the pressure vessels themselves are hold and material has gone through the pressure vessel into the ground
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:04.680]  We don't know how much but the whole of the area around it is
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:11.640]  Is radioactive because the fuel is out of the out of the box that it was in that that's the problem now
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:18.280]  We hear all about how the the water is leaking into the Pacific Ocean and and how could the water be radioactive?
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:24.520]  When they've gone to such lengths to to ensure that it can't get to the Pacific Ocean and it can't be radioactive
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:31.720]  Fact is it is all it was always radioactive because all of this stuff fell into the ground and the ground water soaked it up
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:34.760]  And the huge amounts of water that were pumped in there to keep the thing cool
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:37.960]  And are still being pumped into to keep the thing cool
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.320]  Are leaking out through holes in the pressure vessel leaking out through the through the spent fuel tank holes and so on
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:49.480]  Um and contaminating the ground and that water is inevitably going to get back to the sea
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:53.320]  This is it's impossible for them to not to stop it from getting to the sea
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:57.160]  It's like trying to push water uphill and back when it happened you pointed out that
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:03.000]  That when you can eject those fuel rods when the mox reactor blew up that has the plutonium in it
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:04.760]  It shot them
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:07.800]  Later the New York Times had to admit two miles away
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.480]  And they had to have bulldozers just cover it up where it's at. Yeah
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:17.800]  Why not? I mean, this is insanity. It's right on the ocean. All that debris has now hit the u.s
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:19.640]  It's hitting canada
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:22.200]  And their answer is it's not bad for you. Please continue
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:26.360]  Yes, well, I have to say that that although it is bad for you
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:32.360]  It's not the kind of armageddon that the the dilution of this material into the into the pacific
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:38.120]  Is not the armageddon that some people have been saying so as far as the concentration
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:45.480]  So as far as the concentration of this stuff is concerned in terms of the pacific coast of america
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.920]  There will certainly be increases there and the fish will become more radioactive than they were before and so on
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:56.600]  But the levels of radioactivity and the fish are not going to be so enormously high that they would constitute a
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:00.600]  Sort of totally disastrous scenario
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:08.600]  Um, what what is far more and this is because the pacific consists of it contains about 300 million cubic kilometers of water
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:12.440]  Now, I know it's not going to all dilute into the water, you know uniformly
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:16.600]  And so they're going to be concentrations in the various currents that flow north across
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:22.840]  Across to to the united states and then the surface drift that takes the stuff across the united states by the water
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:26.760]  But by the time it gets to the to the coast it will be very much diluted
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:32.520]  And it will certainly contaminate the coast and the coast will have an effect on the people living there
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  But they're not all going to suddenly drop dead
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:41.160]  But what is much more serious is what they're now doing because what's just happened is as a result of the vast amounts of water
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:46.680]  That they've pumped into these things to keep them cool and they're still pumping into them to keep them cool
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:49.960]  The the whole of the land and this is how I see it of course
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:54.600]  They never tell you this you have to sort of deduce it all in some kind of Sherlock Holmes in a way
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:58.200]  That the land around these reactors has become soggy
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:02.840]  It's filled up with water and water is getting into the Pacific and the whole thing is like some sort of marsh
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:07.000]  Now the problem with that is that these reactors themselves are enormously heavy
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:12.520]  And so they're going to sink into the marsh and they're going to lose stability and possibly collapse now if that happens
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:15.080]  The main problem is reactor four
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:21.400]  Because there's a there's a tank there as you know, which contains about 1300 plus
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:28.280]  Spent fuel elements inside this tank which have to be continually kept warm the tank has to be kept full of water
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:30.920]  And if the tank breaks
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:37.160]  Which it would do if it if it slid the slid sideways and lost its structural integrity
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.160]  Then these fuel rods will then catch fire and might even melt and explode
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:46.120]  Which which is what I believed happened originally when there was the first explosion. Well, sure you were proven right
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:52.920]  I mean the mainline news admitted that they picked up the isotopes that meant that the uh, what is it fishing it happened?
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:56.680]  Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Well, it's fishing now all the time
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:00.920]  I mean that that we know there's fishing there because these short half-lived isotopes
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:05.720]  Uh are are are being detected. Sure. Sure. Why are they calling it a new leak now?
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.400]  Because you were saying this months ago that it was obviously leaking and now they admit that it's leaking and that it's getting soggy
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  And that it is going to sink into the ground and then I guess they can't keep it cool that it blows up
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:19.320]  Well, because they're measuring because people are now measuring the radioactive
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:25.800]  Radioactivity the radio nuclides in the seawater on the coast and they can't say that and they have to admit it because that's the only
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:31.960]  Place it can be coming from so what they've done is I think probably invented this idea that these tanks are leaking
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:35.240]  These enormous numbers of tanks that they've got there you've seen the pictures
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:41.000]  And so the only way that it can get to the city within the you know having told all the lies that they've told
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:45.560]  They've done got to continue to make up new lies in order to justify the original lies
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.040]  And they're saying well these tanks are leaking, but of course they can't find any leaks in the tanks
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:53.000]  But they're still looking of course nothing to do with the tanks leaking
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:56.280]  It's the fact that the whole area around is is saturated
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:03.640]  But radio nuclides as a result of the original explosions and the bulldozing of the old fuel elements and that holes in
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:07.560]  In the reactors and probably a sort of minor china syndrome
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:12.120]  Although it's not china. In fact, if you go to the other end of the earth, it's Buenos Aires, Argentina
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:19.720]  So that's the Buenos Aires syndrome. Sure. Sure. We'll explain the type of explosion that you documented happened in russia and the russians documented
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.120]  That you then believed happened there and then later the evidence came out
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:27.960]  Of the nuclei that show the reaction happened explain that to us doctor
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:30.280]  well, the
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:32.280]  there various kinds of
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:39.480]  Of arguments that were brought forward to say that there was a hydrogen explosion and we know that there are there is a hydrogen explosion
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:46.600]  But in Chernobyl a number of scientists who were in st. Petersburg actually measured ratio of xenon isotopes
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:49.720]  Which enable us to tell whether it's a nuclear explosion or whether it's a
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:57.160]  Hydrogen explosion the ratio of the xenon short lived xenon isotopes xenon one three three xenon one three three m xenon one three five
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.360]  That tells you the kind of explosion that occurs and in fact they the the test site
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:06.280]  The people who are trying to detect whether someone's letting off an atom bomb somewhere
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:12.360]  They have they have detection places all over the world for this as cbc cbto or something
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:17.640]  You know the comprehensive test band treaty organization have measurement sites all over the place
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:24.440]  And so originally so eventually they can actually detect the concentrations of these isotopes that enable you to tell whether it's a nuclear
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:29.640]  Explosion or not and in the case of Chernobyl it certainly was because the ratio of these isotopes showed
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.560]  That there was a nuclear explosion and it wasn't a hydrogen explosion at all
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:37.720]  Although a hydrogen explosion did follow of course because there's lots of hydrogen there
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.640]  Now I think that that reactor four explosion was a nuclear explosion
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:44.360]  I think what happened is that the the tank ran dry
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:50.520]  There was a meltdown of a significant proportion of the fuel elements in the tank the reactor four tank this one
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.440]  That's got the huge amount of radioactivity in it incidentally half of the entire
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.920]  Uh quantity of radioactivity in the whole of the Fukushima
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:05.400]  Complex is in is sitting in that tank. This is why everybody's freaking out. There's about 10 to the 20
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:13.000]  Becquerels of radio nuclides in that tank. So that's that's 1 and 20 zeros and that represents about 50 to 100 Chernobyl accidents
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:16.200]  So if that lot went up you then you are in trouble
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:22.520]  It's not a question of it going into the pacific then because this now it's in the air and the air gets across the pacific
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:27.320]  Quite quite reasonably fast. It's not not like it dilutes in the pacific
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:32.760]  But the jet stream carries it straight across through America. So you're in deep shit with that if that happens
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:38.360]  So what they have to do is to keep is to keep that thing from from from losing its water
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:41.160]  And and and then that's subsequently melting down
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:47.560]  What what I think happened was that there was a distillation of the plutonium from the plutonium parts of the of those spent fuel rods
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:51.400]  And the the critical mass of plutonium is about nine kilograms
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.640]  Now nine kilograms because plutonium is so dense is represented by a quantity of plutonium about the size of an apple
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:01.880]  Or maybe two apples, but anyway, not very much. So if that lot gets together
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:08.360]  There's an enormous bang and everything goes up in the air. So if you have explosions, it'll start slapping all this
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:13.640]  Radioactive material together, which could create the same thing you get with an atomic blast
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:19.640]  And now it's in the middle of one of the biggest nuclear waste dumps in the world where they've been storing 40 years of this
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:21.240]  crud
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:23.960]  Right on a fault line right on a tsunami line
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:28.200]  And they promised in their studies for those that didn't remember this two years ago
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:34.680]  That they would never, you know, have a problem if they got hit by a tsunami and then obviously they did
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:40.920]  And now they're saying don't worry. Dr. Busby, I want to give the number out for people that are in japan who have
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:52.200]  Vonage or ip phones. They can call us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and give us their take on what it's like
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:58.280]  Living in this and the kids dropping dead and the cancer is exploding and the deformed animals that are being born
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:05.160]  Insect and plant and animal. I mean, it's just amazing 800-259-9231
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:08.760]  And I'm trying to pull up an actual number to the network for folks to call direct
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:14.520]  So I can give that out to people. My guys are pointing it out to me now. Oh, there it is. They put the number up
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:18.440]  It's uh, uh, your country code 011 and then 1
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:20.360]  651
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.360]  695 7755
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.320]  1 651 695
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.720]  7755 to call us direct from japan
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:37.080]  And give us your your take on that but sir, what should I do because I saw the reports dr. Busby of
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.960]  milk on the west coast and
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:46.040]  And and surface vegetables having 10 20 30 40 times depending on the isotope safe levels
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:52.440]  Milk as far away as vermont having higher levels and it was always just don't worry this radiation. Is it bad for you?
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:56.360]  So I went back and looked at all that a return. They said it's very bad. Don't drink it. Don't eat it
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:59.880]  I looked at the plume coming in over texas, you know
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:05.160]  Not very high levels according to many experts, but still my wife's like do we go to the southern hemisphere?
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:08.840]  If this thing blows up, they'll obviously say it's safe. No big deal
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:11.640]  How long do I need to
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:17.240]  Take, uh, you know, nascent iodine. They say he's the best or whatever or do I move my wife and children?
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:22.520]  Uh to chile or something for a few years. What would you do dr. Busby?
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:28.360]  Yes, I think if think if it did blow up, I would be inclined to get out of the path of the fallout
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:33.080]  And so that means because the winds blow north and south from the equator
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.320]  And as we know from the concentrations of radionuclides that came down
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:40.440]  After the nuclear weapons testing in the 60s
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.880]  We know that in the southern hemisphere the concentrations are lower than they are in the northern hemisphere
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:53.320]  So so yes, so if that did happen and let and let's hope it doesn't happen because they are trying to to pull the
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:57.720]  The the fuel rods out and and do something about it
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:00.920]  Although god knows how they're going to succeed in doing that
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:06.680]  But if it does happen and if it gets bad, well, then I think it's time to head for the hills. Alex. Yes
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:11.320]  And of course, we know from chair noble it circled the earth and came back to england. We know that
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.080]  But uh from the using du bombardments the last two golf wars
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:21.160]  I know universities picked up the du in england and in france and I remember the professors got in trouble there
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  For warning people. I mean
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.160]  What about yeah, what about folks in europe?
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:30.280]  Well, europe is much further again
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:35.000]  And so so what so, you know, if you like to see it in this way, it would be like
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:37.880]  Japan would be 10
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:38.840]  and
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:41.880]  United states would be like like three
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:44.600]  And and europe would probably be one
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:48.120]  uh on that sort of level very very roughly
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:50.680]  um and uh
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:54.280]  The and it and it would be a sort of repeat only worse
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.200]  of the
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:01.800]  Atmospheric weapons testing of the period 1952 to 1963 which was absolutely terrible
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:05.720]  I mean the the the large bombs that were being exploded in the atmosphere then
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.680]  Reigned down enormous quantities of uranium and strontium 90 and cesium and all of this stuff
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:15.720]  Which which we're talking about now and that caused the cancer epidemic the one that started in the 90s
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.760]  And by the way for those that don't know correct me if i'm wrong those were fractions of what's at this giant nuclear waste
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.120]  Up I get so many people that send me emails or comments calling alex
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:29.000]  We did all the nuclear testing those were huge explosions that blew up whole, you know islands
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:30.920]  Why are you worried about a small explosion?
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:37.800]  They don't get a clean or explosion where most of it is destroyed in an atom bomb or a hydrogen bomb
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.000]  They don't understand how dirty reactors are can you explain why this is so dangerous to people
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.640]  Well, well, I have the moment. I have to say that that that that I I
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.520]  I think that the weapons fall out was very serious and the main no, I know it's bad
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:54.920]  But i'm saying compared to something like this go ahead. Sorry
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:50:01.800]  Well compared to something like this there's a lot more stuff in in in if the whole lot of this went up
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.800]  But the but the thing is that it won't go up in the same way as the weapons fall out
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:09.000]  Weapons fall out was went up into the stratosphere and circle the earth
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:14.040]  But this probably won't do that because it because the explosion won't be a kind of megaton explosion
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:16.040]  It will just be a local explosion
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:20.680]  So a lot of that stuff will go into the into the pacific it where it won't go up high enough to be
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:26.200]  To be taken right the way across the pacific all of it and I don't think all of it will go up as well
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:28.680]  That's the other thing, but I mean it won't be good
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:33.160]  So I I don't think that you you should say that this or anyone should say that this is going to be
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:36.200]  So terribly much more than the weapons fall out
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:41.720]  But we really don't know because it might all go up and if it does all go up then then then who knows because there is
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:46.040]  An awful lot of it. There's more of it than that than in the weapons fall out anyway, but not a lot more
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:52.440]  Wow, but amazing. I mean we usually we open this up every during fiction. We get tons of calls from Japan
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:54.600]  We're only getting a few coming in right now
[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:57.560]  800 259
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:50:59.640]  9231 Japan South Korea
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:03.240]  We want your take on this amino acids are the building blocks of proteins
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:06.920]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:09.720]  If they are to be used to create new proteins in your body
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:13.640]  Just like a brick layer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:18.120]  So too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:22.760]  Given your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health
[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:27.240]  Oneworld way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:31.400]  You see heating bends and twists amino acids and all-way protein powders
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:37.000]  We've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated with our true cool process
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:43.560]  You now have a choice with oneworld way. My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old when I started using oneworld way
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:49.400]  I weigh 228 pounds now after two and a half months. I weigh 182 pounds
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:52.280]  This is my ideal weight. I've noticed an increase in stamina
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:52:00.440]  Rate of recovery for workouts and an increase in my potency. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:08.440]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:12.040]  Unbelievably the media are keeping quiet about this
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:18.440]  I'm sure they know it but they probably know that revealing it on tv will generate mass hysteria and chaos
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:26.120]  But I believe you should be informed about it because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:32.760]  Only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive. Go to 123conspiracy.com
[02:52:33.080 --> 02:52:35.080]  Right now to see the truth
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:43.560]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:49.960]  And it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for war. It's something much darker
[02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:59.480]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down again. That's 123conspiracy.com
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:04.680]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger author of the best-selling book cancer step outside the box
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:07.480]  I want you to know some very important information
[02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:13.320]  In 1985 president Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the white house
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:16.760]  At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:22.280]  Now 27 years later carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:27.240]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:33.800]  Naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:41.240]  If you want to stay healthy now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:49.240]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com. That's c-a-r-n-i-v-o-r-a dot com

[02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:59.400]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.480]  Well
[02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:08.440]  You can't ever say this about my show no calls from japan
[02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:12.120]  I bet I guess dexter and fukushima. They weren't getting real news. They were all listening here
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:17.320]  And we could just load the phones for hours with callers from japan americans europeans living there, but also
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:19.720]  natives of japan
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:24.920]  We got a few minutes left in this segment a little bit into overdrive for calls for dr. Busby
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:27.240]  Who's a leading researcher and physicist?
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:30.200]  Dealing with nuclear fallout and problems from it
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:34.360]  He's proven to be very accurate in the last few years since fukushima in his predictions
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:42.680]  The toll free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 for a few questions on the subject here, but
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.040]  Some of my crew ran back again and said ask him about japan saying smile and it will protect you
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:50.200]  I think we already pretty much covered that but
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:54.920]  What do you make of the some of the green movements?
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:00.200]  trying to proliferate the answer to pollution is building more
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:05.400]  Local nuclear substations in every city. That sounds like a horrible idea to me
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.400]  It is a horrible idea
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:11.560]  The whole idea of doing any nuclear
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:13.560]  energy
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:18.120]  Reactors anywhere is a horrible idea. I don't know how anybody can imagine
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.440]  After what's happened in shinobu and what's now happened in fukushima
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.440]  Um, but there is any sense in continuing using this dreadfully dangerous
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:30.440]  technology
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:31.800]  um
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:38.920]  For creating energy. It just seems totally absurd and but but the green movement has been penetrated by by all sorts of
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:40.040]  of
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:43.160]  fifth columnists and so forth as I know as I know
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.800]  Um, I was I was
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:54.040]  In the green party for many years and I I could see then and I saw in europe when I was working for the policy information network
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:56.440]  on child health and environment
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:01.400]  You can actually identify the people coming in and and skewing the direction of the discourse
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:08.280]  So we know that these people exist and we know that that they're paid to to if you like attack me on the internet
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:14.840]  Another good example, you know, I had the whole load of shills and trolls and people writing things into my wikipedia entry
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:17.080]  And and attacking me in various ways and so forth
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:24.200]  So so let's not get to to to to work up about the green movement the green movement like any other movement can be controlled
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:26.440]  Sure, sure. I mean my only point is
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:29.800]  How can the establishment let this go on?
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:37.000]  When they know it's it's it's it's always having problems. They don't even care now reactors are leaking like never before
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:42.760]  I don't they care about their grandkids. I mean, this is this is this is not a suicide pack to be in control
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:49.480]  I mean, what's the point of this while they suppress new technologies we have we have
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:57.240]  We have to be we have to distinguish between the concept of the establishment and the and and people within the establishment
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:00.920]  I mean that the establishment is only a number of people
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:06.920]  I mean at the end of the day, they've got names like I said, you know, Lars Eric home is the medical officer of health for Sweden
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:12.120]  So so there are individuals in in in all of these systems who are key positions
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:17.640]  Who can control the discourse and who can control the media that the overall media as you know
[02:57:17.640 --> 02:57:20.520]  And and and put out various
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:26.920]  Pictures of reality, which are just totally untrue. Now the reason they do that is because they're paid to do it
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:28.920]  It's as simple as that
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:33.640]  They're paid to do it. It's not about whether they care about their children or don't care about their children and so on
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:39.560]  It's a it's a choice between being extremely rich and powerful and possibly your children might get leukemia
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:43.560]  Or or else being just an ordinary bloke, you know, who who doesn't have
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:50.200]  What is the point of ruling if you wreck everything? I just I just don't get these people that I don't get it
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:56.760]  I just don't get it. But I think I think it's I think it's a it's a personality thing at least, you know, you have to see you have to see that as
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:05.560]  Different personalities. There are different personalities and some personalities are dangerous dangerous to put to put in charge and and unfortunately
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:08.360]  Democracy throws these people up as leaders
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  Because they'll lie to everybody and tell us what we want to hear
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.160]  I think I think it comes down to we have been a lazy disposable society as well
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.920]  I mean just look at how unhealthy we are everything. I'm not on some high horse either. I'm just as bad as the next person
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:28.200]  But my goodness any idiot knows these reactors are just melting down and leaking everywhere. Cancer is exploding

[03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:25.080]  University panel discusses
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:29.400]  Cutting off food bio weapons to reduce population. It's already doing it with the du
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.840]  And I got a bunch of stories
[03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:36.440]  I don't have time to get to the just one up on a full wars calm and prison planet calm
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:37.560]  By the way, dr.
[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:43.240]  Buzz we have hard breaks because of satellites you got cut off earlier trying to give out the website for the llrc
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:46.600]  Give that out and then we'll jam in a few final questions here for you
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:50.680]  Yeah, right that that's the website llrc.org
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:54.360]  And the other one as I said was green audit.org
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:57.480]  And also we we have one called nuclear
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:04.200]  Nuclear justice.org. So which is which is also a development now, which is we're hoping that people will
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:09.560]  Right, but it will help us to take petitions to the european parliament and to other organizations
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:15.240]  Well, there is a madness and I mark it from 1990. They knew the du couldn't be used all the reports said it
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:17.240]  They just said, you know what it's good for you now
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:23.720]  Uh, and and they just don't I mean it was first. Oh wash your hands and wear a mask now. It's like, hey, don't worry about it
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:27.000]  Uh, let's go ahead and take a phone call mike
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:31.640]  Then the first office chris chris in florida. You're on the year quick question for dr. Busby
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:33.240]  Well, dr.
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:40.600]  Busby, what do you think of the idea of using certain kinds of lasers for selectively increasing the speed of radioactive isotope decay?
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:45.880]  I found a study from university of how I don't think the university of technology finland
[03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:50.840]  Ways are enhanced radioactivity k and selective transmutation of nuclei and there are others
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:53.160]  But what do you think of that idea?
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:58.840]  I think that that it would be interesting to to do some experiments to see if it's possible to do this
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:06.120]  But but my feeling is that it's not and that these sorts of experiments and this sort of approach
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:12.760]  Actually, we probably end up with producing more radioactivity or at least more dispersion of radioactivity
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:17.560]  There's a there's a system which they want to build in sweden now for doing this kind of thing
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:23.080]  Um, and the problem is that when you build this system, you then have to bring all the radioactivity or all that radio
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:27.400]  The radioactive waste there and in that very process you create
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:33.880]  All sorts of possibilities for for um, so the best thing is to find a place in the middle of the desert that doesn't have fault lines
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:41.560]  And seal it in concrete. That's right. That's right. Leave it alone and and and and put a fence around it and watch it for the rest of
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:43.480]  Eternity
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:48.440]  That's my my great question caller for Fukushima. How do you get enough lasers in there to like?
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:51.240]  I mean, how many hundreds of thousands of fuel rods are there doctor?
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:03:00.200]  There's 1,300 there's approximately 240 tons of fuel in reactor four which represents one and 20 knots of becquerels
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:05.080]  Uh, and you could say that in terms of explosive power if it all went off
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:12.040]  You can say one megaton per ton of uranium. So you've got approximately 240 megatons. Good lord of explosives there
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:16.760]  So um, you're talking about quite a lot of star is it 240 megaton bigger than any bomb they've built
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:23.560]  Yes, but if you add all the bombs together it comes to quite a lot of megatons and and it won't of course it won't go off like
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:29.480]  Sure, sure, but it's a disaster. It's unbelievable. It's just giving you a sort of rough idea of what there what there is there
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:34.520]  But aren't they storing like 500 plus thousand rods there at the facility
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:42.200]  One uh, the number of rods in in the in react in the reactor four vessel is 1,300 rods
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:45.240]  No, but I meant the whole facility storing a bunch, right?
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:50.840]  Oh, it's probably about twice as much as that if you take the hull so so but in terms of total quantity of material
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:53.880]  About half of it is in the reactor four um tank
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:03:59.640]  Uh, because I remember reading the news press reports of how much waste was there with some astronomical amount real fast
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:01.720]  Micah Tennessee quick question
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:06.600]  Oh, good afternoon. Yes, uh, the problem. I see is that the trade winds the
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:09.880]  Uh, prevailing winds run clockwise on the northern hemisphere
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:13.880]  They run counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere, which actually acts as a protection
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:20.920]  So I can see why the bushes 10 years ago would buy a vast tracts of land over the aquifers in south america to get ahead of the
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:26.760]  Yeah, Paraguay they're back there. They're actually my dad was down there on a charity thing and the bushes have companies everywhere
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.760]  And have actually moved down there
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:31.640]  And the reason people do this, uh, alex, you know
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:37.080]  They are luciferian and it's just like the old girl if I can't have him nobody else can so they just destroy
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:41.640]  What they can't totally control and there's too many uh free will people in the united states
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:45.880]  So might as well destroy them. Yeah, whatever whatever it is. It's evil dr. Busby
[03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:48.680]  Thank you so much for spending time with us. Look forward to talking to you again
[03:04:48.680 --> 03:04:53.080]  Hopefully things will not be explosive like you've said and we appreciate your time
[03:04:53.080 --> 03:05:18.200]  Fingers crossed on it. Fingers crossed. Yeah, everybody say a prayer. Sorry to the other collars. Back Sunday.
