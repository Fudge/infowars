[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.686]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:11.266]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.807]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:17.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.069]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:52.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 23rd day of August 2013, and we are going to have several very informative guests on today.
[00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:00.447]  We have two of the gentlemen on from Missouri who were arrested by the state police and brutalized, choked, assaulted.
[00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:12.611]  That is, by the way, a lethal assault, a considered assault with a deadly weapon to choke, just out of the blue, for protesting Obama peacefully on a street corner.
[00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.711]  That is coming up.
[00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:30.282]  Syrian Girl will be popping in to give us her intel on what's really happening in Syria, and Dr. Busby, nuclear and chemical physicist, will be joining us to discuss all the intel on the continued worsening of the situation in Fukushima, Japan, that affects
[00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:38.264]  The entire northern hemisphere massively, but particularly Japan and then Canada and the United States.
[00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.525]  A little bit of northern Mexico is also affected.
[00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:44.766]  Very serious situation and it's being ignored pretty much.
[00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:53.929]  There's some foreign press reporting on the increased radiation off gassing and leaking by the hundreds of thousands of gallons weekly into the Pacific Ocean.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.583]  That then directly comes into the West Coast.
[00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.885]  So that is coming up today.
[00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:01.626]  Wow!
[00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:05.670]  The Syria situation is moving exactly like we thought it would.
[00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:20.463]  In the last six months they've been massing U.S., NATO, Qatari, French troops by themselves, not just as part of NATO, British Special Forces, CIA commandos in Turkey, in Jordan,
[00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.834]  Jordan a month ago said, hey, you're supposed to come here for a drill and leave.
[00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:29.737]  You've occupied these airports on the border with Syria.
[00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:31.779]  What are you doing?
[00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.322]  I mean, this is serious business, folks.
[00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:34.562]  U.S.
[00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:37.705]  troops have deployed into the Gaza Strip area.
[00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.487]  That's in the back of the newspaper a couple times.
[00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:41.848]  This has all been gearing up.
[00:02:42.774 --> 00:03:03.710]  And now, right on time, you've got this chemical weapon attack three days ago, and now the open move to inject actual paramilitary from the West in, en masse, to engage the Russian spitsnats that are advising and trying to command the beleaguered Syrians.
[00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.172]  Unbelievable crime going on!
[00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:11.076]  To have our sickening, filthy, banker-run government publicly commanding Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:22.733]  While the outgoing FBI director, so he looks like a genius later, goes, I'm afraid Syrian Al-Qaeda is going to blow up America on New 9-11.
[00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:23.794]  You can see this happening.
[00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:25.015]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:26.396]  And I guess we are.
[00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:28.697]  Not the listeners of this show, but the general public.
[00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:38.044]  It'll be, yeah, yeah, Al-Qaeda took over Syria and got weapons and attacked New York and Chicago and Denver and Dallas and Austin.
[00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:44.345]  People will play videos of me on the news warning about this.
[00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:46.146]  It'll be, yeah, he's a traitor.
[00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:49.088]  He said the government did it.
[00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:50.549]  Logic is under attack.
[00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.669]  Truth is under attack.
[00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.291]  Common sense is under attack.
[00:03:54.291 --> 00:04:07.239]  And the ongoing FBI director, Mueller, is saying that, oh, I'm afraid the Al-Qaeda is going to strago give up all your rights.
[00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.821]  Give up all your rights, we're all in such grave trouble.
[00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:20.206]  I mean, it's not even transparent.
[00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:28.191]  It's crystal clear how ridiculously involved with the radical Muslims the banksters are.
[00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:31.514]  And the public wear their ignorance like a shield.
[00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:44.352]  Like a shroud of honor that if you warn them about any of this they giggle and snicker and kind of do a little victory dance around whenever you warn them.
[00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:48.635]  They take it as a sign of weakness that you care and are trying to inform them.
[00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:56.660]  They're just begging to have forced inoculations and be thrown into forced labor camps and to have their pension funds looted.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.141]  They're begging for it.
[00:04:58.141 --> 00:04:59.182]  Begging and begging.
[00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:04.531]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:09.456]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on US citizens.
[00:05:09.456 --> 00:05:13.860]  It is now more important than ever to protect yourself and your information on the web.

[00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:09.000]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.243]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:04.443]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:07:04.443 --> 00:07:09.970]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:17.479]  Billions of dollars have been spent, privately and publicly, looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:27.003]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:34.206]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:37.228]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:43.991]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:48.281]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:49.762]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:26.035]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:29.458]  To recap those revisions, women
[00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:35.088]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[00:08:35.088 --> 00:08:43.851]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:53.775]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:59.437]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.994]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:09.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:21.932]  It is Friday the 23rd day of August 2013.
[00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:24.795]  I'll be back this Sunday live as well 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:28.779]  Central with the Sunday edition picked up by more than 80 stations.
[00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:33.704]  This show, the weekday broadcast by over 160 AM and FM affiliates.
[00:09:33.704 --> 00:09:37.648]  Very honored that you have tuned in to listen to the broadcast today.
[00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:48.925]  You know, I had them play that particular intro from Death Race 2000, one of my favorite B-movies, because it exposes a dystopic possible future America.
[00:09:50.501 --> 00:10:07.227]  I had the crew play that because yesterday I saw a Atlantic Wire article, then I saw it on DrudgeReport.com, then I saw it on Fox News this morning, and on Drudge from Fox, and I asked myself at about 6.30 a.m.
[00:10:07.227 --> 00:10:11.929]  when I was doing research, why didn't you cover that yesterday?
[00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:15.610]  And you're asking what story is that?
[00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.071]  And I kind of psychoanalyzed why I didn't cover it.
[00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:36.016]  And it was the same reason the public sometimes doesn't take action against corruption, because it's so over-the-top, you want to research it more, and it just comes off as not real.
[00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:45.479]  So, I went back this morning and went and actually looked at the guy's site, or the copy of it on the Google Wayback Machine, you know, saved, the archive, because he's taken most of it down.
[00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:56.976]  I went and read all the articles, followed the drudge links, and I probably spent 30 minutes, and it was worse than what Fox News and Atlantic Wire were saying.
[00:10:56.976 --> 00:11:01.619]  And it is a black senior member of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.321]  I'm going to get into the article here a little bit later in the hour.
[00:11:06.616 --> 00:11:10.658]  Who is in charge of buying many of the machine guns and bullets.
[00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:15.300]  There's the headline, DHS employee spends spare time promoting race war against whites.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.221]  And he says in there, we're gonna have to kill all the white people.
[00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.343]  And he goes, I know that's hard for us Christians, but it's gotta be, it's gotta be done.
[00:11:29.748 --> 00:11:34.910]  And I was asking myself, why didn't I cover that yesterday?
[00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:48.573]  And it was because when I first read the article, it was so over the top because it's DHS and it's one of the main people overbuying the billions of bullets and the machine guns.
[00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:53.595]  And the guys got a website approved by DHS to promote this.
[00:11:54.884 --> 00:12:13.713]  And I know MSNBC promotes race war and racial division, and it's cartoonish, and I have trouble even believing what I see come out of Al Sharpton and Chris Matthews' mouths, and Carlos Watson, who says you're racist if you are against Obamacare, and Kathleen Sebelius saying the same thing, the head of Health and Human Services.
[00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:22.217]  But, again, I'm just analyzing myself here, why I didn't cover it yesterday.
[00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.048]  And it's because I read that and I'm like, it's just so crazy!
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:41.490]  It's like video I saw yesterday of Syrian rebels attacking schools and stuff and little kids begging for mommy with the whole top of their heads blown off and their brains open.
[00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:47.134]  And I can't even look at it, much less have the guys put it on the website, much less show it.
[00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:56.061]  I've kind of gotten to the point of where the globalists want me, I think, where I just can't handle it anymore and start tuning out myself.
[00:12:56.061 --> 00:12:58.303]  I'm doing what I've always warned everybody not to do.
[00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:11.724]  More and more, I'm getting to the point where, where, I mean, I saw five articles this morning on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:24.712]  And then I went over and found other articles that were different articles on DrugsReport.com with black people killing white people because they're white all over the U.S.
[00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:28.295]  and no national coverage of it other than the alternative media.
[00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:35.955]  And I don't care if it's a black guy with four skinheads surrounding him, dragging him behind a car.
[00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:37.696]  That outrages me.
[00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:43.801]  But that gets covered on the news when it is a white person being beaten or shot.
[00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:47.503]  Man, if you cover it, you're called racist by MSNBC.
[00:13:47.503 --> 00:13:54.108]  Because they want, they want the idea to be sold of total division in this country.
[00:13:55.219 --> 00:14:08.713]  And they intend to beat the white minority now, whites are now a minority overall, if you add up all the minority groups, into doing whatever we're politically told, or God forbid you're called a racist.
[00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:11.856]  And it's nothing but a political tool and a political weapon.
[00:14:11.856 --> 00:14:17.683]  But I was reading about this guy and reading the quotes about how we're going to have to kill all the white people.
[00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:28.169]  And it was just like Dr. Khalid Mohammed, that I played the clip, the leader of the New Black Panther Party, saying, we kill the women, we kill the children.
[00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:29.270]  Why do we kill the women?
[00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:34.614]  Because the white woman is the military manufacturing center.
[00:14:34.614 --> 00:14:42.219]  And every nine months, she lays down on her back and military enforcements roll out.
[00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:43.721]  I like doing imitations, folks, as you know.
[00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:47.549]  And it's just the issue of, I don't want to turn my guns in.
[00:14:47.549 --> 00:14:48.809]  You're a racist.
[00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.430]  I don't like government-run health care.
[00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.850]  It's a big scam, a rip-off.
[00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.271]  You're a racist.
[00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:56.692]  I don't want our troops being forced to take psychotropic drugs.
[00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:57.412]  You're a racist.
[00:14:57.412 --> 00:14:58.792]  I mean, that's their only answer.
[00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:03.333]  And of course, they know that's their only answer because they are the master racist.
[00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.514]  They are beyond it.
[00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:10.195]  They are the master controllers dividing and conquering all of us, the people.
[00:15:10.195 --> 00:15:11.476]  And what's outrageous is,
[00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:19.154]  They are the ones that are actually enslaving and killing people worldwide.
[00:15:19.154 --> 00:15:29.781]  They are dividing and conquering everybody and they are cutting off the natural resources in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in Asia, in Africa, everywhere.
[00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:38.387]  They are cutting the resources off in their own white papers to reduce the population on record.
[00:15:38.387 --> 00:15:40.568]  On record all over the planet.
[00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:47.488]  And it is disgusting.
[00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:53.218]  To see this unfolding and to know they are the eugenicist.
[00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:55.059]  There's an article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:56.239]  It's not on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:56.239 --> 00:16:06.404]  I'm going to ask the folks, that's why you got to go to PrisonPlanet.com, because a lot of people contribute to that site and for some reason never ends up on InfoWars, which in a way they go, well that's okay because it needs to be different.
[00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:08.485]  Yeah, but it's really a backup mirror.
[00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:12.907]  But then a bunch of the best news ends up on PrisonPlanet that gets a fraction of the traffic.
[00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:14.828]  Everybody's got to bookmark PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:17.189]  It's quite frankly a cleaner, better site than InfoWars.
[00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.374]  I need to remind my InfoWars writers to post their stuff on Prison Planet.
[00:16:22.374 --> 00:16:26.497]  We're about to redesign both sites finally and have all these apps and stuff we're going to launch.
[00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:27.358]  But I want to do it right.
[00:16:27.358 --> 00:16:27.899]  The point is...
[00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:37.919]  Uh, is that, look at this article, Vaccine Inventor and Genetic Engineer Jokes About Depopulation and Biological Warfare.
[00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:45.146]  Great article by Christina Sarich, but, but it's, and it's an Aaron Dykes video report.
[00:16:45.146 --> 00:16:47.628]  You can link through and watch it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:52.132]  But the whole point is, is that I watch the video, it's not a joke.
[00:16:52.955 --> 00:17:04.244]  Not when Eric Pionka at UT, or not when his graduate students that are now top bioweapons experts go public, countering me a few years ago when the FBI visited him, because I called for it.
[00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:10.849]  Pionka got up to the Texas Academy of Sciences and said, soon the airborne Ebola will be released, we will save the Earth, 90% will die.
[00:17:15.814 --> 00:17:17.676]  I had the local newspaper reporters on the witness stand.
[00:17:17.676 --> 00:17:20.678]  There was photos taken as well, they wouldn't allow video.
[00:17:20.678 --> 00:17:27.664]  The majority did a standing ovation and began to cry as he projected red skulls on the wall.
[00:17:27.664 --> 00:17:35.851]  And then we went to his UT website with him dressed as a druid on the official UT website and he said, come Lucifer, oh my, oh Lucifer.
[00:17:38.072 --> 00:17:51.259]  And then I had his graduate students send me threatening emails that we published, and I went and looked up their names from their graduate paper a decade before, and they're in white lab coats running bio-weapon labs for the Pentagon!
[00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:58.082]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[00:17:58.082 --> 00:17:59.423]  All of them talk like this.
[00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:10.395]  And the quote is, just to illustrate the real threat we're facing while we're all fighting with each other over race, and all the race pimps in the Democratic Party, they're the biggest racists who want to set each other's throats.
[00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:12.416]  They're never going to drop it, folks.
[00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:18.439]  Because you'd think the only thing that existed in this world was people fighting with each other racially, because they keep it going.
[00:18:18.439 --> 00:18:20.661]  But they want it to be a white-only thing.
[00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:32.404]  And then actually encourage racial politics, because that's powerful by blacks, Latinos, Asians and others, and unify them around socialism and anti-gun, cementing it with an anti-white rhetoric.
[00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.744]  I'm sick of hearing about ugly, dumb rednecks in the South.
[00:18:35.744 --> 00:18:36.704]  We'll get your guns.
[00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:39.225]  You know, Al Sharpton and Rangel and everybody else.
[00:18:39.225 --> 00:18:46.427]  A bunch of racist pigs, ladies and gentlemen, up there flaunting it, playing the race card, poking all of us.
[00:18:46.427 --> 00:18:47.127]  I'm sick of it.
[00:18:48.267 --> 00:19:15.620]  Vaccine inventor and genetic engineer jokes about the population of biological warfare, and he goes on to say, has anybody, the edible vaccine supporter and head of the Biodesign Institute for Infectious Diseases and Virology and Vaccinology, Dr. Charles Arntzen, has recently responded to questions about the issue of overpopulation with the following sardonic remarks.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.721]  Yeah, it's beyond sardonic.
[00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:19.650]  Has anybody seen contagion?
[00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.592]  That's the answer.
[00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:27.145]  Go out, use genetic engineering to create better viruses to wipe out the population.
[00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.712]  Okay, folks, and there's video of him up there at a town hall saying that.
[00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.412]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:19:34.412 --> 00:19:39.975]  And this isn't some minority of the scientists here.
[00:19:39.975 --> 00:19:49.980]  You don't get in the club, folks, at those high levels, and I've had countless scientists come on to tell you this is the fact, unless you agree and you're part of this death cult.
[00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:55.868]  Now when we come back, the big top story at InfoWars.com, then we're getting into U.S.
[00:19:55.868 --> 00:20:00.710]  Special Forces with the Al-Qaeda attacking Syria, is the media covering up beginnings of a race war?
[00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.531]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:07.260]  We're good.
[00:24:28.248 --> 00:24:32.531]  Alright folks, we are back live here on this Friday edition.
[00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:48.241]  Let me get into our top story because it just illustrates the incredible manipulation of the establishment, state-run, state-sponsored, globalist-controlled, crony-capitalist, anti-free market media.
[00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:52.985]  The kleptocrat support system media.
[00:24:52.985 --> 00:24:54.466]  You have got literally
[00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:56.667]  I was thinking about it this morning.
[00:24:56.667 --> 00:25:14.036]  I keep saying I see examples buried in local news stories all over the country where mobs of young black youth particularly go out and kill white people at fairs, at events, on street corners, you name it, or severely beat them.
[00:25:14.776 --> 00:25:28.148]  And then tell them they're doing it because they're white, and then later newspaper reporters go public, there's been a bunch of cases of this, and complain and say, my editor told me not to say that it was racially motivated because that's racist.
[00:25:28.148 --> 00:25:36.996]  So see, it's now racist to say there is a racism against white people being promoted by the globalist media.
[00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.951]  In black culture.
[00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:44.652]  But it's also being done in the kind of La Raza, La Reconquista, Hispanic culture.
[00:25:44.652 --> 00:25:48.993]  And everybody that can read Spanish or speak Spanish knows that.
[00:25:48.993 --> 00:25:51.014]  My wife grew up in Spain.
[00:25:51.014 --> 00:25:52.394]  She lived there, I don't know, six years.
[00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:53.735]  Speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:25:53.735 --> 00:26:01.657]  She is blown away by the stuff she hears on Mexican radio stations, what she sees on billboards.
[00:26:01.657 --> 00:26:03.838]  And she's the one that's been pointing it out to me for 14 years.
[00:26:05.103 --> 00:26:13.226]  And it is just incredible that today alone, without looking, I've seen five different cases.
[00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:15.626]  Because yesterday I said I see cases every day.
[00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:16.207]  No, no.
[00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:19.648]  I see like five every day without looking.
[00:26:19.648 --> 00:26:24.329]  And then I don't even ever really, you know, talk about this stuff.
[00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:26.870]  Because it's just so overwhelming.
[00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.051]  Like the Homeland Security
[00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:45.701]  A DHS top employee who's over armament procurement saying that they need these arms to wipe out, we'll have the quote here, and they authorized this.
[00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:53.266]  He said, we're going to have to have the mass murder of whites and ethnic cleansing of Uncle Tom race traitors.
[00:26:53.266 --> 00:26:59.771]  Oh yeah, that's another thing on these sites, is that the ultimate crime is actually people getting along with each other racially.
[00:27:01.317 --> 00:27:03.098]  See, I mean, this is just insane.
[00:27:03.098 --> 00:27:05.018]  It's black separatism, is what it is.
[00:27:05.018 --> 00:27:06.899]  And if people want to do that, that's their business.
[00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:10.960]  But don't make it about how I'm inherently evil because I'm white.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.762]  That's what the Klan says, is you're inherently evil because you're black, or you're inherently evil because you're Jewish.
[00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:23.685]  I mean, this is dyed-in-the-wool, pure racism, to the point of even the Southern Poverty Law Center had to come out against it.
[00:27:24.957 --> 00:27:30.900]  And they've had their supporters going around shooting up, you know, focus on the family facilities and stuff.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.984]  I mean, these are groups of people who eat, drink, and sleep race and religious warfare.
[00:27:36.984 --> 00:27:48.750]  Because the globalists only want to have a debate about that, not about what all the robber barons are doing, discriminating against us all by de-industrializing the world through Agenda 21.
[00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.291]  But here's the article, red-linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:52.811 --> 00:28:00.133]  And PrisonPlanet.com is the media covering up the beginnings of a race war.
[00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:04.494]  That is the headline by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:28:04.494 --> 00:28:10.056]  And the lengthy article goes over just some of the recent stuff that's happening.
[00:28:11.974 --> 00:28:24.842]  And again, so many times you hear about a group of people beat up at a fair, or beat up outside a movie theater, or beat up at a mall, or whatever, and it'll be, oh, youths beat up the group, and then you find they're white, and blacks beat them up.
[00:28:24.842 --> 00:28:27.103]  They're white, and blacks shot them.
[00:28:27.103 --> 00:28:30.725]  They're white, and blacks carjacked them.
[00:28:30.725 --> 00:28:35.588]  And then it comes out, like in the case of this Australian baseball player that was over here on a scholarship,
[00:28:36.829 --> 00:28:42.113]  Up in Oklahoma, and on their Twitters, they were saying, you know, racist stuff.
[00:28:42.113 --> 00:28:46.336]  They went out in a gang initiation to kill a crocker.
[00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:53.821]  And there's a black dad, you know, in the neighborhood and they tried to recruit his son and threatened him because he wouldn't go out and be part of it.
[00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:57.163]  And this is the type of stuff that goes on in these gang related deals.
[00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:03.059]  What did they do with the black guy drugged to death years ago that got so much attention in East Texas?
[00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:07.683]  They were guys out of prison and it was a gang initiation for a new member to go out and kill a black person.
[00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:17.593]  And then on that same stretch of road, a year later, because of all the media hype, four black guys drug a homeless white guy to death, and no one picked it up but the local newspaper.
[00:29:17.593 --> 00:29:20.536]  Because it's a white guy, and he deserves to die.
[00:29:20.536 --> 00:29:22.498]  He's not worth anything.
[00:29:22.498 --> 00:29:29.825]  And so it goes over how they're trying to hype up the fact that, inherently, if you're white, you need to die.
[00:29:31.314 --> 00:29:33.175]  And that's what this DHS guy says.
[00:29:33.175 --> 00:29:35.756]  He says, look, we need the weapons.
[00:29:35.756 --> 00:29:37.916]  We've got to kill the white people.
[00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:43.118]  And the DHS said, you're authorized to have this website and say this.
[00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:46.159]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable.
[00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:49.741]  I'll break down their master plan straight ahead.
[00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:51.141]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.141 --> 00:29:53.682]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.682 --> 00:29:56.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:02.299]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:05.944]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.

[00:33:17.665 --> 00:33:24.178]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:25.681]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.681]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here.
[00:33:46.681 --> 00:33:47.881]  It is Friday.
[00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:50.722]  If you just joined us, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:57.145]  And we were discussing, is the media covering up the beginnings of a race war?
[00:33:57.145 --> 00:34:04.547]  An article that Paul Watson put together this morning that's published on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that I contributed to.
[00:34:04.547 --> 00:34:06.928]  Let me read some of this.
[00:34:06.928 --> 00:34:09.289]  Despite engaging in seemingly endless
[00:34:10.464 --> 00:34:16.289]  and racially charged national debate about the Trayvon Martin case to demonize guns.
[00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:34.443]  The US corporate media, the state-run media, has shown no interest in reviving the obsession despite a spat, well it's not a spat, it is an avalanche, a tidal wave, a veritable cornucopia of black-on-white murders
[00:34:36.098 --> 00:34:40.803]  At least two of which indicate a racially charged hate crime motivation behind the killings.
[00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:47.430]  I think if you randomly go out and shoot people in the back as part of an initiation to show you're a tough guy, I think...
[00:34:49.471 --> 00:34:50.832]  I think you're hateful.
[00:34:50.832 --> 00:34:54.996]  Like if you go just randomly kill a white person and you happen to be white, it's hateful.
[00:34:54.996 --> 00:34:57.438]  You just randomly go kill a black person, you're black, it's hateful.
[00:34:57.438 --> 00:35:07.428]  You know, I love how they said it wasn't enough in the Texas case where the skinhead prisoners in a gang war, because they've been in the same prison with a black guy, drug him to death.
[00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:16.272]  They were given the death penalty, but the media would say, men aren't convicted of hate crime, travesty.
[00:35:16.272 --> 00:35:19.753]  And they never even say in the news, the guys were given the death penalty.
[00:35:19.753 --> 00:35:22.954]  By the way, I think they've executed some of them now.
[00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.495]  The point is, is that's not enough.
[00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:28.735]  My whole issue is a hate crime is a hate crime is a hate crime.
[00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:31.316]  The point is, they're only going to prosecute in the future.
[00:35:31.316 --> 00:35:38.318]  See, that's why they want to bring in hate crime, so that the prosecutors can selectively decide when they're going to prosecute you.
[00:35:38.318 --> 00:35:39.398]  The Soviets did this too.
[00:35:40.899 --> 00:35:49.728]  I mean, you kill a white devil, you get to maybe get a job with Homeland Security.
[00:35:49.728 --> 00:36:02.101]  George Zimmerman's acquittal last month drew a line under nearly 18 months of hand-wringing over the threat posed by black people by racially charged hate crimes.
[00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:10.033]  Again, 18 months of hand-wringing over the threat posed to black people by racially charged hate crimes.
[00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:23.361]  Black ideologues like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and others were constantly in the headlines, holding up the Trayvon case as a dire warning that African Americans... How about Americans?
[00:36:23.361 --> 00:36:24.922]  You're not allowed to just be an American, though.
[00:36:24.922 --> 00:36:26.863]  It's meant to make you be obsessed with that.
[00:36:28.413 --> 00:36:40.259]  That identity that they then illustrate, that the establishment defines for you, could now be targeted for murder merely as a result of the color of their skin.
[00:36:40.259 --> 00:36:43.761]  In light of several high-profile black on white murders in recent days, the
[00:36:46.027 --> 00:36:49.870]  Invective has been noticeably less verbose.
[00:36:49.870 --> 00:37:02.440]  The most anger Jesse Jackson could muster over the gang initiation hate crime slang of an Australian student, Chris Lane, was a tepid tweet saying that the incident should be frowned upon.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.082]  Wow, why even respond?
[00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:07.593]  If you're just going to say he should be frowned upon.
[00:37:07.593 --> 00:37:12.054]  You know, just shot him in the back and then he died in the next 20 minutes.
[00:37:12.054 --> 00:37:14.794]  You know, there's a description online of his death.
[00:37:14.794 --> 00:37:18.275]  I mean, let's just, you know, don't do this.
[00:37:18.275 --> 00:37:20.476]  Let's frown upon this.
[00:37:20.476 --> 00:37:27.958]  In light of several high-profile black-on-white murders in recent days, this is just disgusting, folks.
[00:37:27.958 --> 00:37:31.979]  And again, I hate even having to get off into all of this.
[00:37:31.979 --> 00:37:33.599]  It just makes my head spin.
[00:37:36.633 --> 00:37:49.376]  To see how this is pushed in the culture, and to see people like Chris Rock say that we shouldn't question Obama, he's our father, and Michelle is basically our mother.
[00:37:49.376 --> 00:37:55.398]  And then to see other people like Jamie Foxx say that Obama is our Lord and Savior.
[00:37:56.298 --> 00:37:58.439]  Meanwhile, black unemployment's doubled.
[00:37:58.439 --> 00:38:03.522]  Meanwhile, abortion of black people has accelerated, not just here but worldwide, with U.S.
[00:38:03.522 --> 00:38:07.785]  government funding under Obama that he spearheaded in Africa.
[00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.066]  Meanwhile, the prisons are filling up.
[00:38:10.066 --> 00:38:16.550]  The drug war is expanding in black neighborhoods, more than doubling just in the last five years under Obama.
[00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.230]  You can look up those numbers.
[00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.973]  Marijuana arrest of blacks, more than tripling.
[00:38:21.973 --> 00:38:24.234]  But it's okay, because Obama's black, so it's okay.
[00:38:25.478 --> 00:38:35.985]  It's okay if poor people across the board have their payroll taxes raised more than any other time in recent history, because it doesn't matter because Obama's black, even though he promised not to do it.
[00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:46.623]  Lane was slaughtered by a gunshot to the back as part of a gang initiation by three juveniles, an incident which the media initially tried to downplay as bored teens.
[00:38:46.623 --> 00:38:49.065]  Two of these suspects are black.
[00:38:49.065 --> 00:38:58.890]  It subsequently emerged that one of the suspects had posted racist tweets on his account before the murder, stating, 90% of white people are nasty.
[00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.691]  Hashtag hate them.
[00:39:00.691 --> 00:39:01.392]  Another reads,
[00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:09.106]  I knocked out a 5 Woods since Zimmerman Court.
[00:39:09.106 --> 00:39:12.432]  Woods is a racist term for white people.
[00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:22.477]  Barack Obama, who personally inserted himself in the Trayvon Martin case on two separate occasions, was not familiar with Lane's murder, according to the White House.
[00:39:22.477 --> 00:39:31.844]  And it just goes on with a whole bunch of other cases of World War II vets having their brains beaten out because they're white, and people being set on fire because they're white.
[00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:37.789]  And I mean, I saw an article of a white kid burned by a black lady, an 11-year-old, because he was white.
[00:39:37.789 --> 00:39:40.311]  She burned his eyeballs out with a blowtorch.
[00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:42.772]  And man, this stuff is only in local papers.
[00:39:43.573 --> 00:39:58.348]  And then you've got to dig when the court case comes out that it was racially motivated, and the media goes over the top not to report on the national statistics, as you can pull up for yourself from the Justice Department, of a tenfold
[00:39:59.662 --> 00:40:01.703]  Black-on-white ratio.
[00:40:01.703 --> 00:40:12.148]  For every assault of a white person on a black person, there are 10 black assaults on a white person, according to the Justice Department Unified Crime Statistics.
[00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:19.172]  And this is just a fact that people need to be aware of, and that communities need to be ashamed of.
[00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:24.154]  Because the word is, hey, go kill a peckerwood white person.
[00:40:24.154 --> 00:40:26.675]  You know, do something for the team.
[00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:28.477]  Kill a cracker ass today.
[00:40:28.477 --> 00:40:30.038]  I mean, this is all over Twitter.
[00:40:30.038 --> 00:40:31.519]  It's all over Facebook.
[00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:36.042]  It's a sick, sick thing being pumped by the gangster rap culture.
[00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:54.080]  And all it's going to do is then give cover to real white racists that are out there, that are calling for race war with blacks and saying blacks are all racist and blah blah blah, when it is still a minority of blacks, from my research, that are virulent racists.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.364]  But ladies and gentlemen, they are virulent, virulent, virulently racist.
[00:40:59.904 --> 00:41:01.925]  And it is kosher in the media.
[00:41:01.925 --> 00:41:03.085]  It is acceptable.
[00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:08.108]  It is okay if you're Hispanic to say racist things against whites.
[00:41:08.108 --> 00:41:11.189]  It is okay if you're Asian to say racist things against whites.
[00:41:11.189 --> 00:41:14.570]  It is okay if you're black to say racist stuff against whites.
[00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.071]  Folks, I'm almost 40 years old.
[00:41:17.546 --> 00:41:20.650]  But when I grew up in Dallas, Texas, let me tell you something.
[00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.976]  I never heard racist jokes against black people.
[00:41:24.976 --> 00:41:25.596]  Anywhere.
[00:41:25.596 --> 00:41:29.201]  Not at deer camps with what you'd call rednecks.
[00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:33.146]  I never heard racist stuff around the dinner table.
[00:41:33.146 --> 00:41:34.308]  I never heard it.
[00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:53.186]  Now, when I went to college a little bit, I ran into some of it from both angles, and I've seen white people scared of minorities because of political correctness, and almost like such a guilt that, oh, I don't want to be around anybody that's another, you know, quote, group.
[00:41:53.186 --> 00:41:56.067]  I mean, that's really what this creates.
[00:41:56.067 --> 00:42:00.550]  And I'll tell you something, all this race-based politics pushed by the Democratic Party,
[00:42:01.798 --> 00:42:03.799]  And push by MSNBC?
[00:42:03.799 --> 00:42:11.464]  That's why you have what they call white flight to the suburbs and to the countryside.
[00:42:11.464 --> 00:42:11.904]  Because...
[00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:22.583]  It makes white people, many of which their parents and they themselves are part of the civil rights movement, just feel incredibly threatened and uncomfortable.
[00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:23.403]  But let me tell you something.
[00:42:23.403 --> 00:42:25.084]  I live out in the Hill Country.
[00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:31.508]  There's a lot of middle class black people and Hispanics that are out there who want to homeschool their kids and be left alone as well.
[00:42:31.508 --> 00:42:39.373]  This is more of also an instinctive fear of the cities and of the police, of the crime, of the drugs.
[00:42:39.373 --> 00:42:40.314]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:42:40.834 --> 00:42:50.238]  There's drugs in the countryside as well, but statistically, ladies and gentlemen, if your kid's in the city and your kid's going to public school, they're going to be bullied.
[00:42:50.238 --> 00:42:51.939]  I don't care what color they are.
[00:42:51.939 --> 00:43:00.302]  Just like another black kid got bullied to be part of the Kill a Cracker gang initiation, and the dad said no, so they said, well, we may come get your son next.
[00:43:00.302 --> 00:43:03.724]  And his son was, you know, that's in the news, having to hide out in his house in Oklahoma.
[00:43:05.737 --> 00:43:18.488]  You put your... I mean, folks, when I went to high school in a suburb of Dallas in 1988, 89, 90, 91... I went a couple years in Dallas and a couple years in Austin.
[00:43:18.488 --> 00:43:21.390]  It was so bad we moved down here.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:29.757]  It was rampant sex, okay, just constant, 24-7.
[00:43:29.757 --> 00:43:31.678]  It was drugs everywhere.
[00:43:31.678 --> 00:43:34.541]  It was fights constantly.
[00:43:36.767 --> 00:43:42.413]  It was like fast times at Ridgemont High on steroids.
[00:43:42.413 --> 00:43:42.974]  Okay?
[00:43:42.974 --> 00:43:46.198]  And let me tell you something, high school is a lot wilder than that now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:46.198 --> 00:43:53.666]  You put your kids in a public school, unless it's in a rural area, and still it's got to be extremely covertly Christian.
[00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:55.628]  A lot of public schools are like that, are really Christian.
[00:43:56.409 --> 00:43:58.050]  Basically, it's all run secretly.
[00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.490]  They try to keep the feds out.
[00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.071]  They try to keep the kids safe.
[00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:05.753]  They try to keep everybody, you know, black, white, it doesn't matter, you know, to have a future.
[00:44:05.753 --> 00:44:16.517]  There are quasi-wealthy and middle class and wealthy suburbs and rural areas where people can be outside of this, but that is the minority of areas, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:16.517 --> 00:44:19.298]  High school is a living hell.
[00:44:21.769 --> 00:44:25.392]  I mean, let me tell you about how politically correct I was being brought up.
[00:44:25.392 --> 00:44:30.095]  My dad was a conservative on many issues, but also what you call liberal on many.
[00:44:30.095 --> 00:44:32.516]  Same with my mother.
[00:44:32.516 --> 00:44:39.501]  And, you know, it's tribalism is really what it is.
[00:44:39.501 --> 00:44:43.104]  It's tribalism because if you went to a neighboring town to a bonfire,
[00:44:46.507 --> 00:44:52.310]  The rednecks, they would usually be the richest rednecks and the fanciest trucks and whatever.
[00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:59.854]  You'd be having fun, visiting with a friend that invited you to one, and almost invariably, a bunch of big jacked-up pickup trucks would show up.
[00:44:59.854 --> 00:45:03.676]  You'd be there in your jacked-up pickup truck, and there would be a fight and people would go to the hospital.
[00:45:04.056 --> 00:45:07.739]  And I'm not even going to tell the stories, it's so over the top, it's unbelievable.
[00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:11.182]  Okay, so that probably happened to me every couple of weeks.
[00:45:11.182 --> 00:45:20.249]  But it'd be the same thing with you're out in the parking lot and five black guys come over and say, we're going to beat your cracker head in right now.
[00:45:20.249 --> 00:45:25.333]  And you would start being assaulted and end up in the hospital.
[00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:28.636]  And if you didn't end up in the hospital and somebody else did, you'd go to jail.
[00:45:30.265 --> 00:45:35.629]  Let me tell you, you get four or five people trying to beat your brains out, you'll get real mean and start beating other people's brains out.
[00:45:35.629 --> 00:45:41.372]  And I tell you, it's probably the most exhilarating drug out there, actually, to black out and snap out and go absolutely ape on people.
[00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:55.402]  But the whole point is, is that, you know, when you turn, when you basically turn into a caveman gorilla and start beating people's brains out, that's what's going on, and that's why white people are running to the hills, folks.
[00:45:55.402 --> 00:45:56.403]  Okay?
[00:45:56.403 --> 00:45:58.204]  I'll tell you right now, that's what's going on.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.081]  And it's always covered up.
[00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:11.224]  I've been racially attacked by black people, probably, let's not exaggerate, 35 times.
[00:46:11.224 --> 00:46:16.126]  I've been racially attacked by Hispanics, let's not exaggerate, five times.
[00:46:16.126 --> 00:46:19.667]  Let me tell you, that's when you really get hurt bad.
[00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:23.989]  And, you know, compound fractures, you know, you name it.
[00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:26.770]  And, oh yeah, oh yeah, you get hurt real bad.
[00:46:27.423 --> 00:46:30.264]  And the whole point is, is I am sick of it!
[00:46:30.264 --> 00:46:46.811]  I am sick of the fact that I have been racially attacked over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
[00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:56.854]  And the politically correct thing to do is just offer your kids up to have their noses broken and their eyes black and their bones broken.
[00:46:56.854 --> 00:47:01.799]  Because the one thing you don't do is ever go stand up against it.
[00:47:01.799 --> 00:47:05.623]  Now, that said, that's what political correctness is in this country.
[00:47:05.623 --> 00:47:11.629]  And so yeah, you got racist cops who are tribal and who will corner a black person and do the same thing to them.
[00:47:13.723 --> 00:47:19.087]  And you will get the same thing in an area where black cops will beat up a black person or a white person or whatever.
[00:47:19.087 --> 00:47:19.928]  It's all gangs.
[00:47:19.928 --> 00:47:21.890]  It's cop gangs beating people up.
[00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.631]  It's black gangs beating people up.
[00:47:23.631 --> 00:47:25.352]  It's white gangs beating people up.
[00:47:25.352 --> 00:47:29.656]  See, I'm smart enough, folks, to not become a racist over this.
[00:47:29.656 --> 00:47:32.438]  I'm smart enough to understand the manipulation.
[00:47:32.438 --> 00:47:40.484]  I'm smart enough to understand the geopolitical ramifications and to actually try to bring people together to have a gang
[00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:43.580]  Because everybody's tribal, that's what it is.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:50.703]  We're designed like that, based on private property, and the family, and liberty, and freedom, and being honorable.
[00:47:50.703 --> 00:48:06.711]  The globalists want us to have a collectivist gang, get us all fighting with each other over race, religion, region, whatever, what sex we are, but never, but absolutely never, never, never unify around liberty.
[00:48:06.711 --> 00:48:09.953]  The only unifying force is government and collectivism.
[00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:11.474]  That's why they're balkanizing us.
[00:48:13.127 --> 00:48:15.928]  That's why they're doing this.
[00:48:15.928 --> 00:48:19.349]  That's why all of these type of things are happening.
[00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:21.830]  And I learned to recognize it was gangs.
[00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:25.811]  It was gangs of rednecks that started fights with people.
[00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:28.552]  It was gangs of blacks that did it.
[00:48:28.552 --> 00:48:33.853]  I mean, folks, do you think rednecks just go out and beat up black people?
[00:48:33.853 --> 00:48:35.494]  And by the way, I mean trashy rednecks.
[00:48:36.974 --> 00:48:41.206]  People that literally get addicted to fighting and beating each other over the head.
[00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:42.631]  What do you think they do when they go home?
[00:48:42.631 --> 00:48:43.814]  They go home and do that to each other.
[00:48:44.804 --> 00:48:50.169]  You've watched all these Discovery Channel shows, all the hillbilly, you know, stuff where they're all beating each other up.
[00:48:50.169 --> 00:48:51.911]  That's the type of stuff that goes on.
[00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:56.575]  Whether you're in the inner city with gangs, or whether you're in the Redneckville with the hillbilly gangs.
[00:48:56.575 --> 00:49:03.561]  And the answer is, humanity has always acted like this, and we need to stop it, and transcend it.
[00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:05.683]  That's how you build civilization.
[00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:08.386]  But MSNBC and the White House, they don't want that.
[00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:12.343]  And who does the White House and the globalists really hate?
[00:49:12.343 --> 00:49:17.985]  They hate the gun culture, the liberty culture, and they're afraid it's spreading, which it is spreading.
[00:49:17.985 --> 00:49:21.026]  That's why Obama said, we don't like these bitter clingers.
[00:49:21.026 --> 00:49:23.687]  They cling to their guns and their Bibles.
[00:49:23.687 --> 00:49:26.388]  You see, they don't want you to unify around a Bible.
[00:49:26.388 --> 00:49:28.289]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:32.690]  They don't want you to unify around a Bill of Rights and something for our kids and a future.
[00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.912]  They want gang enclaves of white, black, rich, poor,
[00:49:38.416 --> 00:49:43.989]  Where then the police and the whole system play the part of arbiters over all this stuff.
[00:49:46.923 --> 00:49:48.004]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:49:48.004 --> 00:49:48.864]  It's creepy.
[00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:52.606]  My wife goes, I don't want to ever go to Mexico again, because she speaks Spanish.
[00:49:52.606 --> 00:49:57.489]  It wasn't like this, you know, just 10 years ago, 15 years ago, when I'd go down there with her.
[00:49:57.489 --> 00:49:59.330]  We go to places we went to Mexico before.
[00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:08.935]  Man, the Mexicans are sitting right there, folks, while they're giving you a drink or whatever, talking total trash about ugly, stupid gringos, filth of the earth, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:08.935 --> 00:50:10.276]  My wife's like, man, let's get out of here.
[00:50:10.856 --> 00:50:17.538]  You go to the next place it happens, and the next place it happens, it didn't used to be like that, it's because of the culture of the media.
[00:50:17.538 --> 00:50:25.681]  Worldwide is pushing division and people fighting with each other, so there can be a globalist corporate overwrite over everybody.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:36.866]  They want to absolutely have everybody divided a hundred different ways, and then all the time talk about how they don't want everybody divided and fighting with each other.
[00:50:36.866 --> 00:50:42.909]  You see, the system pushes the division, but then at the same time then says, oh, but the government will fix it.
[00:50:42.909 --> 00:50:45.551]  We'll make all the rodeo clowns take sensitivity training.
[00:50:46.516 --> 00:50:47.076]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:50:47.076 --> 00:50:50.599]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:50:50.599 --> 00:50:56.182]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:50:56.182 --> 00:50:59.585]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:54:09.957 --> 00:54:12.679]  Alright, I'm going to break down Syria here in a moment.
[00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:14.179]  We've got three guests coming up today.
[00:54:14.179 --> 00:54:21.884]  We've got political prisoners who were arrested for daring to protest the dear leader, Lord Obama.
[00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:26.387]  Syrian girl and what's happening in Syria popping up, and Dr. Busby on the situation in Japan.
[00:54:26.387 --> 00:54:28.328]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:54:29.127 --> 00:54:34.511]  From folks in Japan and Alaska, where the radiation is getting really bad.
[00:54:34.511 --> 00:54:36.673]  A lot of the tides have gone up there and it's been confirmed.
[00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:39.375]  The seals, the fish, the humans are just full of it.
[00:54:39.375 --> 00:54:43.158]  It's a very serious situation.
[00:54:43.158 --> 00:54:51.264]  Syria is ultra massively important and could, I'm not the only one saying this, lead to World War III type implications with Russia and China.
[00:54:51.264 --> 00:54:53.065]  It is a big, big deal.
[00:54:53.065 --> 00:54:53.746]  But first off,
[00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:59.542]  There are some real scum out there in the alarm industry that really overcharge people.

[00:55:42.076 --> 00:55:43.977]  You know what happens?
[00:55:43.977 --> 00:55:50.660]  What happens a lot to me is that I try to eat something during the break.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.980]  We've got to ban these guys.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.841]  Go ahead and punch me up on television.
[00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.383]  These are really good, these little health bars.
[00:55:58.383 --> 00:55:59.723]  Almond Coconut's my favorite.
[00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.364]  This is not product placement, obviously.
[00:56:02.364 --> 00:56:11.148]  But I'll take a little bite of one of these during a three-minute break, and then invariably a piece of it gets in my teeth, and then I inhale it once I'm on air.
[00:56:13.413 --> 00:56:16.354]  Whoa, boy, that'll wake you up.
[00:56:16.354 --> 00:56:17.234]  Now, I'm all right.
[00:56:17.234 --> 00:56:20.315]  It's just that, man, a little piece of that goes in your lung.
[00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:25.097]  It'll make you start crying.
[00:56:25.097 --> 00:56:26.598]  Finishing up with what I was saying there.
[00:56:28.649 --> 00:56:33.650]  We hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on people.

[00:57:28.239 --> 00:57:40.726]  All right, with my little hacking attack, I won't have much time to get properly into the serious situation, but we'll do that at the bottom of the next hour in detail.
[00:57:40.726 --> 00:57:49.931]  But we've told you for years, because it's actually been in the foreign news, and the Debka file has accurately been reporting on the side of Israel, that NATO, U.S.
[00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:50.792]  forces, you name it,
[00:57:51.991 --> 00:57:57.294]  For two and a half years they've been arming the rebels that CNN calls protesters and activists.
[00:57:57.294 --> 00:58:00.176]  And they're blowing up mosques, blowing up churches, killing everybody.
[00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:02.958]  They've been caught staging nerve gas attacks before.
[00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:04.398]  This is a big one.
[00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:07.240]  The evidence is mounting that the rebels did stage it.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:13.024]  And the Jerusalem Post is now reporting that Syrian rebel forces, trained by West, are moving towards Damascus.
[00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:17.960]  And that they're backed up by CIA commandos and others.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.641]  Here's Paul Watson's article.
[00:58:19.641 --> 00:58:25.285]  U.S.-trained rebels moved towards Damascus days before chemical attack.
[00:58:25.285 --> 00:58:33.490]  Lawmakers who opposed arming FSA militants reconsider intervention now that they've got some images of dead kids.
[00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:37.413]  So instead of having fake dead babies in incubators, now they actually kill real babies.
[00:58:43.357 --> 00:58:50.422]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.422 --> 00:58:55.145]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:58:55.145 --> 00:58:58.267]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:58:58.267 --> 00:59:03.811]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:05.412]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:05.732 --> 00:59:07.373]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:07.373 --> 00:59:12.036]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:12.036 --> 00:59:16.278]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:59:16.278 --> 00:59:18.840]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:25.063]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:59:55.889 --> 00:59:58.652]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:10.063]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:11.644]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.644 --> 01:00:13.185]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.185 --> 01:00:17.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.388 --> 01:00:21.452]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.717 --> 01:00:36.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:48.987]  And coming up, we've covered this from the video and in the local Missouri newspapers, but we're going to actually have the guys on that were arrested for thought crimes by the Obama truth squads.
[01:00:48.987 --> 01:00:49.947]  We've played the newscast.
[01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:52.969]  They have police on TV saying you're not allowed to talk bad about Obama.
[01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:54.650]  That is illegal.
[01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:59.093]  And then they come out of you protest on the street corner peacefully.
[01:00:59.093 --> 01:01:00.954]  They come out and choke you and take you to jail.
[01:01:01.974 --> 01:01:05.356]  Missouri Police Tackle and Arrest Peaceful Impeach Obama Protesters.
[01:01:05.356 --> 01:01:08.338]  Kit Daniels wrote about that back on the 20th.
[01:01:08.338 --> 01:01:11.120]  We're going to have the first interview with these guys, these thought criminals.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:17.824]  Dr. Duane Weed and Mark Messmer.
[01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:19.945]  So that is going to be very informative coming up.
[01:01:19.945 --> 01:01:22.427]  And Syrian Girl and the big developments in Syria.
[01:01:22.427 --> 01:01:28.891]  I mean, they're running covert ops in there publicly now to try to, in a proxy war, defeat the Russians that are there.
[01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:29.952]  And this is an overt.
[01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:39.724]  premeditated war against a country to put people in power at least ten times worse.
[01:01:39.724 --> 01:01:41.226]  And see, I just have a moral compass.
[01:01:42.056 --> 01:01:43.538]  I'm not saying I'm some great guy, either.
[01:01:43.538 --> 01:01:48.023]  Because once you get me riled up, I can be as wicked as anybody can imagine.
[01:01:48.023 --> 01:01:52.128]  But the point is, is I try to control myself and not be like that.
[01:01:52.128 --> 01:02:02.039]  And it's just, you know, on the face of it, they're invading, they're attacking, two and a half years, engaging in incredible atrocities, killing Christians en masse, and our sick, filthy elite
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:14.825]  is backing it and trying to cover it up and is most certainly all the evidence indicates behind the nerve gas attack on the convenient school full of kids to then wave the bloody shirt and a false flag and say we've got to invade.
[01:02:14.825 --> 01:02:26.090]  It is unspeakably wicked and it will come back to roost on us and now two and a half years folks they've been trying to overthrow Assad
[01:02:27.819 --> 01:02:31.982]  And they know full well if they do overthrow him, they'll still be sectarian war forever.
[01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:47.873]  They are wrecking a place that you could fly into, see all the famous ruins, the Roman, the Byzantine, the Egyptian, see where Paul lived, see some of the oldest churches in the world, go to the beach, go to the market.
[01:02:47.873 --> 01:02:48.654]  Not anymore, man!
[01:02:48.654 --> 01:02:51.816]  They're just wrecking an old world, first world country.
[01:02:56.596 --> 01:02:58.357]  They're making the women put the burkas on.
[01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:00.598]  They're sexually mutilating them.
[01:03:00.598 --> 01:03:04.840]  The women are being kicked out of the colleges in the cities that Al-Qaeda's taking over.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:14.585]  I mean, and then I got to put up with the TSA wanting to grab my junk to see if there's an Al-Qaeda bomb in there.
[01:03:14.585 --> 01:03:19.587]  And it's just incredible.
[01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.811]  It's all a big joke.
[01:03:22.811 --> 01:03:24.112]  It's all a big fraud.
[01:03:24.112 --> 01:03:25.212]  They don't even try to hide it.
[01:03:25.212 --> 01:03:30.775]  It's all so a bunch of criminals can grandstand and take over society and run everything.
[01:03:30.775 --> 01:03:32.957]  And it makes me want to throw up.
[01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:34.177]  So we're going to be getting to that.
[01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:38.179]  Also, is the media covering up the beginnings of a race war?
[01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:40.861]  No national debate over spat.
[01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:41.961]  How about a deluge?
[01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:44.143]  A tidal wave?
[01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:46.124]  A flood of black-on-white crimes?
[01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.390]  Because Watson shows like five or six examples in the last few days.
[01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.831]  No, man, this is going on continually.
[01:03:52.831 --> 01:04:01.913]  And the bigger story is there have been a bunch of articles where the media finally goes, well, we were told not to... where reporters have been physically attacked or killed.
[01:04:01.913 --> 01:04:06.075]  And then there's been so many examples of it, especially of the Trayvon Martin deal.
[01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:12.897]  And that's the media purposely creating this idea that white people are walking around
[01:04:14.224 --> 01:04:24.966]  I mean, white people, folks, are just like everybody else, TV heads that are obsessed with sports, and the only racial thing they know is that they're guilty and, or like, afraid everyone thinks they're racist.
[01:04:24.966 --> 01:04:29.687]  And so politically, that's that way so the media can say, do what we say, or we'll say you're racist.
[01:04:29.687 --> 01:04:30.867]  Yes, okay, I'll do whatever you say.
[01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.528]  I'll turn my guns in to prove I'm not racist.
[01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:34.428]  I'll support Obamacare.
[01:04:34.428 --> 01:04:36.808]  I'll put an Obama sticker on.
[01:04:36.808 --> 01:04:38.549]  I'll do whatever you say.
[01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:39.629]  All right, whatever you want.
[01:04:41.604 --> 01:04:56.013]  And then meanwhile the government does want kind of a socialist army of like armed minorities like this DHS commander who's over weapons purchasing with a website saying prepare to kill all the whites and any blacks that don't help us.
[01:04:56.013 --> 01:04:59.415]  And then DHS is supporting it.

[01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:03.411]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:06:03.411 --> 01:06:11.133]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:16.075]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:06:16.075 --> 01:06:18.236]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:06:18.236 --> 01:06:19.016]  If every one of
[01:06:19.036 --> 01:06:19.776]  We're good to go.

[01:08:11.745 --> 01:08:13.286]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.286 --> 01:08:17.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.487 --> 01:08:31.694]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:33.435]  Folks, it's on right now!
[01:08:34.804 --> 01:08:38.918]  On CNN, during the three-minute break, I was back in the coffee room.
[01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:50.442]  I'm watching CNN because we have different networks on in every room in the office to monitor the state-run media, and CNN's definitely state-run out of all of them.
[01:08:50.442 --> 01:08:55.084]  That's the most state-run on record, actually, run by the Pentagon and CIA.
[01:08:55.084 --> 01:09:01.406]  And they were saying, the polar bears are all dying, it's terrible, the ice is melting, they live on.
[01:09:01.406 --> 01:09:05.647]  Folks, polar bear numbers are up five-fold according to the federal government.
[01:09:05.647 --> 01:09:07.247]  You can just pull that up.
[01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:07.428]  Since 1955.
[01:09:09.088 --> 01:09:10.268]  Five-fold.
[01:09:10.268 --> 01:09:12.509]  I know, we've written articles about it.
[01:09:12.509 --> 01:09:25.414]  They're up in Northern Europe, they're up in Northern Russia, and they also showed the ice cap melting in the summer, but didn't tell you it was only in the summer, didn't show it getting big again in the winter.
[01:09:25.414 --> 01:09:29.255]  So they showed a satellite shot of it melting, going, look, it's melting!
[01:09:29.255 --> 01:09:31.756]  Yeah, it's the end of the summer!
[01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:34.717]  Yeah, this is what the ice caps do in the summer and the winter.
[01:09:36.294 --> 01:09:37.795]  In the summer, they get smaller.
[01:09:37.795 --> 01:09:38.975]  In the winter, they get bigger.
[01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:39.995]  This is what they do.
[01:09:39.995 --> 01:09:43.936]  They get bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer.
[01:09:43.936 --> 01:09:47.097]  And I just watch them prey on the public.
[01:09:47.097 --> 01:09:49.698]  Preying on the public!
[01:09:49.698 --> 01:09:50.538]  That's my problem.
[01:09:50.538 --> 01:09:51.738]  There's just too many lies.
[01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:54.419]  It's too over the top.
[01:09:54.419 --> 01:09:57.300]  I can't even respond now.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.240]  I had them record it, though.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.000]  I want to do a piece on The Nightly News about this and analyze it.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.281]  Because, I mean, I know they do this all the time.
[01:10:03.559 --> 01:10:10.083]  They actually, I saw a children's book where they teach the penguins can't swim and are drowning in Antarctica.
[01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:13.745]  This is in the Arctic, in the North Pole they were talking about.
[01:10:13.745 --> 01:10:17.947]  And I've got it recording back there on CNN.
[01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:28.273]  Right now they are fear-mongering saying we've got to have carbon taxes or the polar bears, that by the way, they're drowning, they said, drowned.
[01:10:30.118 --> 01:10:33.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, polar bears are the greatest land animal for swimming.
[01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:39.566]  They go out and swim out to ice flows to hunt seals and then back to the mainland.
[01:10:39.566 --> 01:10:41.487]  Man, I just, it shakes me up.
[01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.589]  It shakes me up.
[01:10:43.589 --> 01:10:46.151]  Now, I'll tell you what else shakes me up, then we're going to our guest.
[01:10:46.151 --> 01:10:52.717]  Even Bloomberg has the headline, NSA Analyst Intentionally Abused Spying Powers Multiple Times.
[01:10:52.717 --> 01:10:54.238]  Yeah, how about billions of times?
[01:10:54.238 --> 01:10:59.182]  How about it's on record that everything's recorded and saved by the NSA and they've admitted that before?
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:07.366]  I have an article here from the 1980s admitting it that folks dug up that we have on Infowars.com today.
[01:11:07.366 --> 01:11:08.687]  How about that?
[01:11:08.687 --> 01:11:17.035]  How about the fact that the DEA is being given all the NSA info on people talking about smoking pot over the telephone?
[01:11:18.427 --> 01:11:21.888]  And then the NSA told them to lie to federal judges about it.
[01:11:21.888 --> 01:11:23.088]  That's Reuters.
[01:11:23.088 --> 01:11:24.769]  Been out for two weeks.
[01:11:24.769 --> 01:11:30.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, Obama went on CNN, the same state-run media last night.
[01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.011]  We're going to play a short clip of this.
[01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:33.191]  This is a quote.
[01:11:33.191 --> 01:11:41.453]  Said there are no allegations that the NSA is trying to listen on people's email.
[01:11:41.453 --> 01:11:44.134]  That's even worse than saying the polar bears are all dying.
[01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:48.787]  I mean, that's like saying, folks, the sun blew up today.
[01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:50.968]  You can walk out and see it.
[01:11:50.968 --> 01:11:53.390]  That's like walking out at midnight and saying it's high noon.
[01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:58.533]  That's like saying Santa Claus is real or something.
[01:11:58.533 --> 01:12:00.754]  I mean, it's not true, folks!
[01:12:00.754 --> 01:12:13.042]  Of course, he's saying there's not even allegations when it's on record, just like Gibbs said we were told to go say there's no drone program when it had been admitted to exist for at least five years.
[01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:18.952]  And he laughed, and the MSNBC laughed, because it's funny!
[01:12:18.952 --> 01:12:19.552]  And you know what?
[01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:25.814]  You people out there, you take it, you go along with it, you put up with it, and I don't know what your problem is.
[01:12:25.814 --> 01:12:27.715]  And I'm not talking about our long-term listeners.
[01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:29.075]  I'm talking about regular listeners.
[01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:34.537]  They always write articles in National Review and Time Magazine, and I see them all the time.
[01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:40.879]  I was driving in a car, and I heard that nut, and then I came to another city on a road trip and heard him again!
[01:12:40.879 --> 01:12:42.800]  This guy's actually on the radio!
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.262]  What in the world?
[01:12:45.262 --> 01:12:46.403]  He's crazy!
[01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:49.705]  I'm crazy because I know the numbers on polar bears?
[01:12:49.705 --> 01:12:56.370]  I'm crazy because I know about the NSA and the president's up there lying?
[01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.352]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:12:58.352 --> 01:13:00.514]  Let's go to this clip right now of Obama.
[01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:05.512]  First acting like, well, it's like a loaded gun, trying to demonize guns with the NSA.
[01:13:05.512 --> 01:13:07.933]  Everything he does is like double-think mind control.
[01:13:07.933 --> 01:13:10.153]  It is like a loaded gun out there, but we know what we're doing.
[01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:15.135]  Remember, he said, you know, you can trust him because he's there running it.
[01:13:15.135 --> 01:13:15.976]  Let us run everything.
[01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.757]  Don't look into what we're doing.
[01:13:17.757 --> 01:13:23.059]  Yeah, we got caught lying to you all these times, but just trust me.
[01:13:23.059 --> 01:13:23.539]  Just trust me.
[01:13:24.981 --> 01:13:27.322]  I mean, he loves conning you folks.
[01:13:27.322 --> 01:13:30.884]  I mean, he really makes Bill Clinton look like an angel and an honest person.
[01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.785]  I've got to say, I've never seen anything like Obama.
[01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:34.185]  He's such a good liar.
[01:13:34.185 --> 01:13:36.626]  If I wasn't informed watching this, I would believe it.
[01:13:36.626 --> 01:13:38.327]  Because he comes off like he's telling the truth.
[01:13:38.327 --> 01:13:44.310]  Let's play a man literally shoving 200 proof lies in your face.
[01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:48.572]  I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that the technology is moving so quick.
[01:13:48.752 --> 01:13:50.212]  So, see, oh, you're legitimate.
[01:13:50.212 --> 01:13:51.413]  Oh, it's just technology.
[01:13:51.413 --> 01:13:52.993]  Oh, get away from us.
[01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:57.514]  Does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place?
[01:13:57.514 --> 01:14:00.455]  And do some of these systems end up being like a loaded gun out there?
[01:14:00.455 --> 01:14:02.756]  And see, now they want new laws to legalize it.
[01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:04.236]  That's how they say, oh, we'll fix it.
[01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:06.017]  Because there are no allegations.
[01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:06.957]  And I am very confident.
[01:14:06.957 --> 01:14:07.317]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:07.637]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:08.978]  We're going to go to our guest.
[01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:09.698]  I interrupted that.
[01:14:09.698 --> 01:14:11.719]  I want people to hear that without me talking over it.
[01:14:11.719 --> 01:14:16.400]  Start at the beginning again and listen how everything he says is psych warfare scripted.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.981]  Oh, yeah, it's reasonable you're concerned.
[01:14:18.981 --> 01:14:24.923]  Because, you know, the laws, you know, technology grew and, you know, just the oversight.
[01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:25.763]  We need some new laws.
[01:14:25.763 --> 01:14:28.344]  The new laws are to legalize what they're doing that's illegal.
[01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:30.825]  So we'll fix it by legalizing it.
[01:14:30.825 --> 01:14:34.106]  But it's like a loaded gun out there, like, oh, guns, scary.
[01:14:34.106 --> 01:14:36.427]  Yeah, we understand, but don't worry, I'm running the gun.
[01:14:36.427 --> 01:14:39.869]  And by the way, there are no allegations that we're reading your email.
[01:14:39.869 --> 01:14:45.271]  Oh, no, it's just all on record in thousands of publications, declassified public.
[01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:46.011]  Not just Snowden.
[01:14:48.141 --> 01:14:49.022]  Listen to this.
[01:14:49.022 --> 01:14:55.265]  I mean, it's a 40 second clip and it is... Satan can only lie this good.
[01:14:55.265 --> 01:14:56.605]  I'm telling you right now.
[01:14:56.605 --> 01:15:06.210]  Everything you could analyze... You could have a... You could have a 10 year PhD in this 140 seconds analyzing every word of it.
[01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.291]  I'm telling you, folks.
[01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:08.732]  I study their lies, okay?
[01:15:08.732 --> 01:15:11.873]  I mean, he is a... And this isn't a teleprompter either.
[01:15:11.873 --> 01:15:12.854]  This is why he's in there.
[01:15:14.116 --> 01:15:20.379]  Okay, this is unbelievable, meant to trigger things in people's minds to put them at ease.
[01:15:20.379 --> 01:15:21.479]  This is brainwashing.
[01:15:21.479 --> 01:15:22.040]  Let's go to it.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.322]  I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that the technology is moving so quick.
[01:15:27.299 --> 01:15:35.282]  That at some point does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place?
[01:15:35.282 --> 01:15:41.984]  And do some of these systems end up being like a loaded gun out there that somebody at some future point could abuse?
[01:15:41.984 --> 01:15:52.648]  Because there are no allegations, and I am very confident knowing the NSA and how they operate, that purposely somebody's out there trying to abuse this program or listen in on people's email.
[01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.468]  You're confident in that?
[01:15:54.468 --> 01:15:55.369]  I am confident in that.
[01:15:56.189 --> 01:16:03.593]  But, what I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards.
[01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:10.457]  And as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance.
[01:16:10.457 --> 01:16:13.158]  And we do have to do a better job.
[01:16:13.158 --> 01:16:19.362]  They're going to build more technologies to make you know they've got safeguards.
[01:16:19.362 --> 01:16:22.904]  I got you in chains here, chained down, but there's a safeguard for you.
[01:16:23.985 --> 01:16:25.046]  There's a safe word.
[01:16:25.046 --> 01:16:29.008]  I mean, this is literal abuser stuff.
[01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:34.151]  I mean, that's what all this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:39.514]  And it is so disgusting that they are recording everything on record.
[01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:45.174]  They are abusing the Tea Party, gun owner groups, pro-life groups, the press.
[01:16:45.174 --> 01:16:48.016]  They're arresting members of the press using the NSA.
[01:16:48.016 --> 01:16:50.758]  They're persecuting government whistleblowers with it.
[01:16:50.758 --> 01:16:53.740]  There's a reign of unbelievable terror going on.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.202]  And he says there's not even allegations.
[01:16:56.202 --> 01:16:57.964]  And again, CNN is the worst.
[01:16:58.689 --> 01:17:02.410]  I mean, just, the polar bears are all dying, pay carbon taxes to Al Gore.
[01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.910]  Total lie.
[01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.111]  There's not even allegations we're abusing this.
[01:17:06.111 --> 01:17:09.372]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:17:09.372 --> 01:17:10.232]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:17:10.232 --> 01:17:26.696]  I appreciate Dr. Dwayne Weed, who's a chiropractor, and Mark Mesmer, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, the peaceful impeach Obama protesters that made national news the last three days after the video went viral of these thought criminals.
[01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:33.949]  Uh, who I can tell are InfoWars listeners because of the shirts they were wearing, and sure enough they are an InfoWars viewer.
[01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:43.500]  They went out to hold up signs on the side of the highway saying impeach Obama for NSA spying and stuff, and the police came and choked them and took them to jail.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.321]  Or choked Mark.
[01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:45.562]  So, Dr. Weed and Mark...
[01:17:49.386 --> 01:17:53.369]  Mesmer, thank you for coming on, Thought Criminals.
[01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:57.853]  Tell us about what happened and what happened once you got to jail.
[01:17:57.853 --> 01:18:02.277]  And were you lectured by the state police or did they apologize for acting like North Korean soldiers?
[01:18:03.966 --> 01:18:06.307]  No, we weren't lectured.
[01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:10.688]  We were just out there holding our signs to impeach Obama like we've done before.
[01:18:10.688 --> 01:18:15.249]  And this time the Highway Patrol along with the St.
[01:18:15.249 --> 01:18:18.130]  Charles City Police showed up in force.
[01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:22.251]  I think at one time I counted eight police cars out there.
[01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:30.693]  They came up and they said that we came up here to remove you from this overpass.
[01:18:30.693 --> 01:18:32.694]  Wow, so what are you being charged with?
[01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.716]  We haven't been able to determine yet.
[01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:40.880]  I've made some phone calls, and I'm not sure we were charged with anything.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.583]  Well, how about we just send you to the re-education camps that the Army manual calls for?
[01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:47.705]  That would teach you to not be like this anymore.
[01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:48.506]  Where do you think you are?
[01:18:48.506 --> 01:18:50.227]  America?
[01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:54.691]  We're all headed there, Alex, if people don't stand up and exercise their rights.
[01:18:54.691 --> 01:18:56.292]  So, how many police showed up?
[01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:57.473]  It looked like at least a dozen.
[01:18:59.298 --> 01:19:02.881]  There was definitely at least one police for every protester up there.
[01:19:02.881 --> 01:19:07.665]  I think we had about 10 or 12 protesters up there.
[01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:10.067]  Okay, and I've looked at Missouri law.
[01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:13.430]  It says as long as you're not impeding traffic, you can have signs on the side of the road.
[01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:16.492]  And it's the same all over the country.
[01:19:16.492 --> 01:19:19.455]  I guess they just ordered you to leave and you didn't and that was enough.
[01:19:20.512 --> 01:19:21.132]  Right, that's right.
[01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:25.853]  I have a friend of mine who's the chief of police in a neighboring county.
[01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:27.913]  And he said that there was no law.
[01:19:27.913 --> 01:19:31.434]  He said that's the reason we kept asking him, what ordinance, what law are we breaking?
[01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.234]  By what authority are you ordering this off?
[01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:41.136]  And when I asked that question, the arresting officer just pointed to his uniform like this, and he said, you see I'm a police officer, right?
[01:19:41.136 --> 01:19:45.976]  And so implying that his authority came from his uniform.
[01:19:45.976 --> 01:19:49.017]  But my friend, the chief of police, said that he thought that
[01:19:49.977 --> 01:20:05.968]  Uh, there's some type of law that allows them to hold people for 24 hours while they're seeking a warrant, and he said that they consider that unethical, but they will use that to hold someone for 24 hours even though they have no intention of seeking a warrant because he said he didn't think we did anything wrong.
[01:20:06.328 --> 01:20:08.669]  It's a custodial arrest.
[01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:10.809]  And look, what it is is a giant power grab.
[01:20:10.809 --> 01:20:11.770]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:18.652]  It's been defeated literally hundreds of times, just like failure to ID has been defeated literally thousands of times in that case.
[01:20:18.652 --> 01:20:19.612]  They don't care.
[01:20:19.612 --> 01:20:21.913]  It's all about you will follow my order now.
[01:20:22.273 --> 01:20:29.398]  But common law, all of it, states that you have the right to resist, including with deadly force, unconstitutional actions.
[01:20:29.398 --> 01:20:34.182]  And the minute he used an illegal chokehold on you, Mark, you had a right.
[01:20:34.182 --> 01:20:37.724]  I think you should sue them for civil rights violations.
[01:20:37.724 --> 01:20:42.448]  Not that we're sue-happy, but, you know, if we don't stand up for the First Amendment, we're not going to have anything.
[01:20:43.911 --> 01:20:44.771]  Very true, Alex.
[01:20:44.771 --> 01:20:51.414]  And we are considering that for sure because they just, I think they did it to break us and punish us for questioning them.
[01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:57.696]  But because we are Infowar listeners and very liberty-minded, we know our rights and we knew that was unconstitutional, what they're asking us to do.
[01:20:57.696 --> 01:21:00.137]  And it was a request, not a lawful order.
[01:21:00.137 --> 01:21:00.957]  And we know the difference.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:18.249]  Absolutely, I mean a lot of police now literally, they even have cases of them pulling good looking women over, or in some cases not even, and ordering them to have sex with them and then getting in trouble because they actually believe they can order you to, say, come to your door and make them, you know, make you mow their lawn.
[01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:18.429]  Right.
[01:21:20.089 --> 01:21:21.670]  That'd be an awful little unlawful order.
[01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:25.454]  We all, your listeners know that, but we're trying to awaken others.
[01:21:25.454 --> 01:21:28.276]  And certainly other protesters are there for the first time.
[01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:32.560]  They finally got an education in it and they have learned from that event last Saturday.
[01:21:33.462 --> 01:21:44.188]  Well, again, tell us exactly where this happened and when the next demonstration is because I think it's important to double and triple down now nationwide.
[01:21:44.188 --> 01:21:48.810]  I'm also told that the governor was involved and actually ordered these demonstrations shut down.
[01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:50.691]  Give us your take on that.
[01:21:50.691 --> 01:21:51.012]  Certainly.
[01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:57.829]  We certainly don't need their permission, but we were told on our camera we have the footage that we could come back next Saturday.
[01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.650]  So that's exactly what we intend to do.
[01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:01.551]  Doc, do you want to share?
[01:22:01.551 --> 01:22:06.134]  The location is at exit 229 on Interstate Highway 70.
[01:22:06.134 --> 01:22:07.694]  This is in St.
[01:22:07.694 --> 01:22:08.175]  Charles.
[01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:11.329]  That's the Fairgrounds Overpass.
[01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:16.832]  And we, this story got a lot of press here locally.
[01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:19.434]  It was on all the television stations here.
[01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:23.056]  It's been talked about every single day on talk radio.
[01:22:23.056 --> 01:22:26.598]  And I think a lot of people are going to be turning out tomorrow.
[01:22:26.598 --> 01:22:30.440]  Anybody in the area, we welcome you to come out.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.440]  It should be interesting.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.821]  The media should be there.
[01:22:33.821 --> 01:22:35.362]  And it should be a lot of fun.
[01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:38.204]  And I don't think that the police or the Highway Patrol
[01:22:39.104 --> 01:22:49.129]  That's right.
[01:22:49.129 --> 01:22:50.909]  That's why we do this all over the country.
[01:22:50.909 --> 01:23:00.434]  Most areas, the police protect the First Amendment and appreciate it, knowing that it's their right and their children's valued hard-won liberty as well.
[01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:03.075]  Take the rodeo clown, which they've now released the video.
[01:23:03.695 --> 01:23:06.218]  They just said, oop, don't let Obama get run over by the bull.
[01:23:06.218 --> 01:23:10.442]  That's what clowns always do is, you know, be chased around by the bull.
[01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:18.970]  They tried to imply that was racist or criminal and then they're making all the rodeo clowns go take sensitivity training that cost them between $300 and $1,000.
[01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:22.214]  They have Obama truth squads up there saying, criticizing Obama.
[01:23:23.074 --> 01:23:48.414]  Is illegal and it really looks like the government's trying to intimidate folks in Missouri Particularly so you go out you have a Mac like thugs it creates national attention You go out now not with ten But I'd imagine hundreds are gonna show up if not thousands and teach them who runs America and that this is still a free country and that we still have a First Amendment so tell folks the time of
[01:23:49.134 --> 01:23:53.077]  And everybody who's in Missouri needs to make it to this event.
[01:23:53.077 --> 01:23:56.159]  What time to defend the First Amendment?
[01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:57.520]  It's from 10 a.m.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.521]  to 4 p.m.
[01:23:58.521 --> 01:24:02.784]  Certainly we want a peaceable protest and agreements against this government.
[01:24:02.784 --> 01:24:04.705]  We're not asking for anything out of the ordinary.
[01:24:04.705 --> 01:24:06.687]  We are not provocateurs.
[01:24:06.687 --> 01:24:08.608]  We saw some comments that we wanted to get arrested.
[01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:09.769]  I'm certainly not sure.
[01:24:09.769 --> 01:24:12.290]  No, no, that's the globalist on the thing.
[01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:15.413]  I would not even respond to their disinfo operations.
[01:24:15.413 --> 01:24:15.653]  Correct.
[01:24:16.547 --> 01:24:20.129]  I mean, look, when a woman gets raped, they always turn around and say she deserved it.
[01:24:20.129 --> 01:24:22.271]  She shouldn't have been wearing, you know, a skirt.
[01:24:22.271 --> 01:24:25.353]  And it's always like, we just went out and held up signs.
[01:24:25.353 --> 01:24:26.874]  We're not trying to cause a problem.
[01:24:26.874 --> 01:24:29.796]  Don't even respond to the scum, okay?
[01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:32.478]  Listen, I think everybody should show up first at 10 a.m.
[01:24:32.478 --> 01:24:35.419]  because they may try to intimidate the first group that gets there.
[01:24:35.419 --> 01:24:40.223]  We need everybody to show up at 10 a.m., and if you can't, come later, but 10 a.m.
[01:24:40.223 --> 01:24:41.163]  this Saturday.
[01:24:41.163 --> 01:24:43.285]  And of course, this is going to happen nationwide again, correct?
[01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:48.913]  I'm not sure if tomorrow is actually nationwide or if this is just something we did here.
[01:24:48.913 --> 01:24:50.333]  I don't believe it is.
[01:24:50.333 --> 01:24:59.295]  I don't think this movement is nationwide, but as far as tomorrow, actually I heard that tomorrow is only going to be here in St.
[01:24:59.295 --> 01:25:00.256]  Charles, Missouri.
[01:25:00.256 --> 01:25:02.556]  This is not nationwide.
[01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:03.676]  Tomorrow, just tomorrow.
[01:25:03.676 --> 01:25:10.258]  There is a Capital One on September 11th, which also begins the veto session and there's other issues along with that at Jefferson City.
[01:25:11.118 --> 01:25:19.224]  By the way, I want to add the rodeo clown that made fun of Obama, which is something that the first clowns did back in Greece, you know, against politicians as well there.
[01:25:19.224 --> 01:25:22.166]  I mean, that's just part of a free society.
[01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:24.347]  He's been offered a job down here in Texas.
[01:25:24.347 --> 01:25:32.132]  Before I get to the Truth Squad stuff, where the police are on the news saying, we'll arrest you if you criticize Obama, what is going on with your police?
[01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:37.216]  Because I continue to see video of Missouri police acting like Gestapo.
[01:25:37.796 --> 01:25:44.981]  I mean, I know you've been federalized to a certain extent with the MIAC report saying gun owners are all terrorists up there, but what's going on with your police?
[01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:46.863]  Have they been totally Obamified?
[01:25:48.243 --> 01:26:00.089]  You know, I'm not an enemy of the police, and I know there are a lot of good police officers, and I actually have friends, like I said, the chief of police is a friend of mine, so I have friends who are police.
[01:26:00.089 --> 01:26:11.936]  Police are definitely following on one side of the line or the other, and that's the side where they're going to keep their oath and respect our constitutional rights, or whether they're going to follow their orders and continue to trample on our rights.
[01:26:12.816 --> 01:26:26.686]  So, as far as here in Missouri, Missouri Highway Patrol does not have a good reputation because a while back they released, against Missouri state law, they released the list of concealed carry permit holders to the federal government.
[01:26:26.686 --> 01:26:28.828]  Oh yeah, your state police are bad news, man.
[01:26:29.679 --> 01:26:32.981]  And they're trying to take over the sheriff, Alex.
[01:26:32.981 --> 01:26:40.066]  Last November, we had a sheriff petition going that was worded totally wrong, and it said they want to create a new county police department.
[01:26:40.066 --> 01:26:46.371]  What that does, essentially, it takes the sheriff's department, splits it into two departments, where the old sheriff's department now does the court duties.
[01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:47.972]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, that's a U.N.
[01:26:47.972 --> 01:26:50.213]  Gen 21 deal in England and here.
[01:26:50.213 --> 01:26:51.414]  They're getting rid of the sheriffs.
[01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:52.235]  They don't want us to be able to
[01:26:52.435 --> 01:26:53.275]  We're good to go.
[01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:21.054]  Yes, right.
[01:27:21.054 --> 01:27:21.575]  Yeah, we heard it.
[01:27:21.575 --> 01:27:22.315]  We heard you say that.
[01:27:22.315 --> 01:27:30.178]  I mean, no state police walked up and looked at you like you were the scum of the earth, bugging their eyes out and started choking you.
[01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.698]  I mean, they need to be arrested.
[01:27:31.698 --> 01:27:33.039]  Do you remember why?
[01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:36.500]  Because I said the word tyranny, and then he flipped a switch and choked me.
[01:27:38.285 --> 01:27:39.306]  Well, that's because they're guilty.
[01:27:39.306 --> 01:27:40.307]  Well, you know what?
[01:27:40.307 --> 01:27:44.292]  Look, look, just remember, bad cops, you're going to lose everything, too, you fools.
[01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:46.694]  And I know you don't care, but later, remember.
[01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:50.078]  I want to play a clip of the tyranny that is in Missouri right now.
[01:27:50.078 --> 01:27:52.962]  They've got this in Illinois and Vermont, of all places.
[01:27:52.962 --> 01:27:55.264]  I've seen them arrest people with truce squads.
[01:27:55.264 --> 01:27:56.526]  This is five years ago now.
[01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:59.596]  Now rodeo clowns can't make fun of Obama.
[01:27:59.596 --> 01:28:08.839]  Now you can't hold a sign on the side of the street, folks, in America because they put ads on TV saying, criticizing that degenerate liar Obama is illegal.
[01:28:08.839 --> 01:28:09.699]  Here's a clip of it.
[01:28:09.699 --> 01:28:18.802]  Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.
[01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:21.763]  First, John Mills is live at the County Election Board in Maplewood.
[01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:26.485]  He's been learning more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in this.
[01:28:26.485 --> 01:28:28.126]  John, tell us more about this.
[01:28:28.126 --> 01:28:28.866]  Russell, good evening.
[01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:35.268]  Prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri are joining something called the Barack Obama Truth Squad.
[01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:38.810]  Two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team.
[01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:41.611]  We met them this afternoon in the Central West End.
[01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:44.092]  They are Jennifer Joyce from the city, Bob McCullough
[01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:44.852]  Listen to this ad.
[01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:45.793]  By the way, I brought that promise.
[01:29:04.753 --> 01:29:06.915]  We want to keep this campaign focused on issues.
[01:29:06.915 --> 01:29:07.316]  Turn her off.
[01:29:07.316 --> 01:29:08.577]  You can watch all the different newscasts.
[01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:14.183]  Just type in Obama True Squads and then guaranteed they're in your area training us that authoritarianism is the way.
[01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:22.692]  Dr. Duane Weed and Mark Mesmer, you know, if one of my crew members wants to jump on an airplane up to... where would they fly in best to get to the event tomorrow at 10 a.m.? ?
[01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:24.694]  Yeah, St.
[01:29:24.694 --> 01:29:26.996]  Louis Airport, Lambert Airport in St.
[01:29:26.996 --> 01:29:27.376]  Louis.
[01:29:27.376 --> 01:29:31.419]  It's on Interstate 70, which is where we are.
[01:29:31.419 --> 01:29:32.860]  It's just right down the road.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:40.646]  I've got a skeleton crew, but if any of my crew want to jump on an airplane tonight, I'll give them battle pay to go up there and be there at 10 a.m.
[01:29:40.646 --> 01:29:43.008]  tomorrow and videotape this, man.
[01:29:43.008 --> 01:29:43.868]  We salute you.
[01:29:43.868 --> 01:29:46.631]  Give out the website so folks can find out where it's at.
[01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.051]  Well, you know what?
[01:29:47.051 --> 01:29:48.212]  I'll get it and give it out on the other side.
[01:29:49.963 --> 01:29:53.895]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.895 --> 01:29:56.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:11.132 --> 01:33:15.204]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:15.204 --> 01:33:17.009]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.619 --> 01:33:46.948]  Folks, we are back live here and we're going to get into the nightmare situation unfolding in Syria that is so over-the-top corrupt and overtly absurdist that I have trouble even being able to process it mentally with a Syrian girl.
[01:33:46.948 --> 01:33:49.510]  We're going to be talking to her here in just a moment.
[01:33:51.089 --> 01:34:04.324]  But first off, going back to what we were just talking about, if you go to Overpasses.org, the big national group, they have the overpass listed and where it's going to be tomorrow in Missouri, but they're emailing us also the specifics so we can post it on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:04.324 --> 01:34:09.350]  I am asking my reporters right now, out of my skeleton crew,
[01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:12.758]  Who wants to go to Missouri?
[01:34:12.758 --> 01:34:14.179]  I'd like to be able to send two reporters.
[01:34:14.179 --> 01:34:15.521]  I don't know if we have the people.
[01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:24.008]  I would think Josh and Jakari are two great camera guys that we could send up there for Jakari to report and Josh to shoot video.
[01:34:24.008 --> 01:34:26.671]  But we'll see who's able to go.
[01:34:26.671 --> 01:34:28.632]  But then that brings up the next issue.
[01:34:28.632 --> 01:34:30.994]  I want to get on an airplane and go up there myself.
[01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:40.903]  Get in the face in a peaceful, lawful way to the bully state police and go, shame on you saying veterans of the terror threat.
[01:34:40.903 --> 01:34:42.543]  Shame on you wanting our guns.
[01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.843]  You're federalized.
[01:34:43.843 --> 01:34:46.124]  Here's the War Powers Act of 33.
[01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:49.624]  And just let them arrest me if they want so I can sue them.
[01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:53.745]  By the way, we sued from the G20 and won with Rob Doo being arrested.
[01:34:53.745 --> 01:34:55.126]  I'm tired of it.
[01:34:55.126 --> 01:34:57.046]  I'm tired of you trampling on the First Amendment.
[01:34:57.807 --> 01:35:00.749]  Do you have any idea how many people died for that First Amendment?
[01:35:00.749 --> 01:35:05.971]  Do you have any idea how many people have died in darkness for the light of liberty?
[01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:16.997]  Do you have any idea what's inscribed over the George Washington unknown Revolutionary War soldier gravesite in Philadelphia?
[01:35:16.997 --> 01:35:22.280]  Inscribed above it are the words that many men have died in darkness for the light of liberty.
[01:35:23.988 --> 01:35:32.335]  And I just couldn't with the video when the state police show up all bugging their eyes out and rushing up and start choking people.
[01:35:32.335 --> 01:35:33.476]  I mean, that is assault!
[01:35:33.476 --> 01:35:36.098]  You are disgusting filth!
[01:35:36.098 --> 01:35:37.279]  Excuse me.
[01:35:37.279 --> 01:35:39.381]  I just know where this leads historically.
[01:35:39.381 --> 01:35:40.842]  They've already gutted our country.
[01:35:40.842 --> 01:35:42.624]  They've already gutted the Treasury.
[01:35:42.624 --> 01:35:44.065]  They've already gutted all the pension funds.
[01:35:44.065 --> 01:35:45.907]  It's already all gone, folks.
[01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:47.268]  They just haven't dropped the hammer yet.
[01:35:48.433 --> 01:35:50.934]  And they're putting poison in the food and the water.
[01:35:50.934 --> 01:35:56.495]  I mean, of course the New World Order poisoned the American food and water supply to lower IQs and dumb us down.
[01:35:56.495 --> 01:35:58.076]  All the numbers show that.
[01:35:58.076 --> 01:35:59.376]  Because we were their main enemy.
[01:35:59.376 --> 01:36:01.476]  We were the big, free, powerful country.
[01:36:01.476 --> 01:36:03.817]  They wanted to run us to set up their world government.
[01:36:03.817 --> 01:36:05.377]  So they came in and took us over.
[01:36:05.377 --> 01:36:09.198]  And now we're captured and they're trying to mop up what's left of America.
[01:36:09.198 --> 01:36:15.140]  And I get angry because it's over the top to see Obama
[01:36:16.621 --> 01:36:23.766]  Last night on CNN say, there's not even allegations that we're doing anything wrong.
[01:36:23.766 --> 01:36:25.527]  Just lying to people.
[01:36:25.527 --> 01:36:30.191]  And then CNN, 30 minutes ago, is going, the polar bears are all dying.
[01:36:30.191 --> 01:36:35.614]  And I'm sitting there, and I know they put this lie out to school kids, but to adults.
[01:36:35.614 --> 01:36:37.676]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:36:37.676 --> 01:36:41.459]  Polar bear populations are up five times in the Arctic.
[01:36:42.324 --> 01:36:48.269]  And in every other part where they roam out of the Arctic, they don't go far below the Arctic Circle into Northern Canada.
[01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:48.709]  Just look at it.
[01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:51.651]  Guys, just type in polar bear population up five-fold.
[01:36:51.651 --> 01:36:54.693]  I mean, that's national geographic.
[01:36:54.693 --> 01:36:57.856]  I just cannot believe their lies.
[01:36:57.856 --> 01:37:01.899]  It'd be like saying cockroaches are going extinct or something.
[01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:04.181]  And it's incredible what they do.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:11.562]  And then they go, look, the North Pole's almost melted, and it showed the summer melt, which has always happened.
[01:37:11.562 --> 01:37:22.766]  I tell you, the Northern Passage in the spring and summer for ships for 500 years, because the ice melts and the ships can do the Northern Passage.
[01:37:22.766 --> 01:37:27.188]  But I'm cursed with being just informed about basic stuff!
[01:37:28.319 --> 01:37:32.863]  But they point a satellite at it and go, here's just the melting in the last four months.
[01:37:32.863 --> 01:37:35.525]  Shows the North Pole shrinking by half.
[01:37:35.525 --> 01:37:41.369]  As it's done since the days of Leif Erikson.
[01:37:41.369 --> 01:37:43.050]  And that's what makes me get so upset.
[01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:47.634]  We're going to go and get a report from Syrian Girl here in just a moment.
[01:37:47.634 --> 01:37:51.937]  I first want to point something out here.
[01:37:51.937 --> 01:37:56.361]  People like Glenn Beck have built amazing with the $200 million he makes a year.
[01:37:59.266 --> 01:38:01.468]  When there's radio shows that are bigger that can't do that.
[01:38:01.468 --> 01:38:03.169]  He's very smart people around him.
[01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:04.510]  Hired the former head of Clear Channel.
[01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:05.771]  Hired a bunch of top executives.
[01:38:05.771 --> 01:38:06.711]  They know what they're doing.
[01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:08.673]  And on record used our model of media.
[01:38:08.673 --> 01:38:10.154]  There's been news articles about it.
[01:38:10.154 --> 01:38:13.116]  To build a true internet platform and then put it on television.
[01:38:13.116 --> 01:38:15.477]  I have been announcing I want to do this for 10 years.
[01:38:15.477 --> 01:38:16.938]  And of course I saw where the internet was going.
[01:38:18.539 --> 01:38:20.720]  And I'm glad people like Glenn Beck have done that.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.501]  I'm sad that I see him promoting war in Syria now with the nerve gas garbage.
[01:38:25.501 --> 01:38:27.241]  Another WMD hoax.
[01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:30.562]  This time there's real dead people but clearly it's the rebels.
[01:38:30.562 --> 01:38:35.383]  We have less than 1 20th that much money every year and I am maxed out.
[01:38:35.383 --> 01:38:40.364]  I got a little bit of money in the bank.
[01:38:40.364 --> 01:38:43.204]  A little bit of money in property as an emergency backup where I live.
[01:38:43.204 --> 01:38:44.645]  That's it.
[01:38:44.645 --> 01:38:46.525]  And I'm spending money I made three years ago.
[01:38:47.452 --> 01:38:49.032]  We had a good year three years ago.
[01:38:49.032 --> 01:38:56.995]  I'm spending that, actually, more than I take in right now to finish the studios, the uplinks, everything I'm doing.
[01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:59.055]  I want to be able to hire, like, three more reporters.
[01:38:59.055 --> 01:39:00.696]  I want to be able to hire another camera person.
[01:39:00.696 --> 01:39:02.236]  I want to be able to hire more people.
[01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:04.077]  I want to build a media organization.
[01:39:04.077 --> 01:39:12.039]  And I couldn't have done this without you supporting us, buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ProPure water filters, the stuff at Infowarshealth.com.
[01:39:14.398 --> 01:39:22.141]  Just remember that when you buy from us, you are funding a media organization that's bigger than Beck Online.
[01:39:22.141 --> 01:39:25.001]  I don't know all these ways he does to make all this money.
[01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:27.222]  I don't have the big global sponsors.
[01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:33.404]  I need to just make a few million more a year to be able to effectively change history.
[01:39:33.404 --> 01:39:38.966]  So I'm going to tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, they make $200 million, we make $7 million.
[01:39:39.943 --> 01:39:41.123]  We're not keeping score.
[01:39:41.123 --> 01:39:44.305]  We need money to fund the news division.
[01:39:44.305 --> 01:39:53.328]  Like, I will spend emergency backup money to send reporters up to outside Kansas City where they're saying there's no First Amendment.
[01:39:53.328 --> 01:39:56.950]  You can't hold a sign on the side of the road saying impeach Obama and the police choke you.
[01:39:57.930 --> 01:39:59.451]  Right out of North Korea.
[01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:01.633]  But I will do it because it's got to be done.
[01:40:01.633 --> 01:40:07.337]  So I'm asking you right now, subscribe to the magazine, buy the Pro-Pure Water Filter, it's the best price, InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:40:46.368 --> 01:41:05.580]  Shop with the good guys so we can continue what we're doing and finish our expansion that's really going to reach people on cable, on satellite systems that have never been, you know, I want to get a satellite to beam it into Europe and to beam into Africa and Asia free to air because we're here to just
[01:41:06.502 --> 01:41:09.945]  Full on, put this message of liberty out worldwide.
[01:41:09.945 --> 01:41:17.410]  I mean, my goodness, you know, the CIA's got like ten different channels, the Russians have got channels, Saudi Arabia's got all these pro-Al Qaeda channels.
[01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:18.351]  We need a Patriot 1776.
[01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:18.772]  Hardcore system.
[01:41:22.325 --> 01:41:27.367]  And we couldn't have done what we've done so far without all of you out there, all the people that have supported us.
[01:41:27.367 --> 01:41:28.407]  You know who you are.
[01:41:28.407 --> 01:41:29.408]  Thank you.
[01:41:29.408 --> 01:41:32.269]  And we're trying to redesign the sites, launch all this other stuff.
[01:41:32.269 --> 01:41:35.470]  I am really cracking the whip around here in a good way.
[01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:38.791]  And I'm up there until 10 o'clock at night almost every night.
[01:41:39.911 --> 01:41:42.572]  Because I know my children have no future if we don't do this.
[01:41:42.572 --> 01:41:44.312]  So I'm trying to go to the next level.
[01:41:44.312 --> 01:41:45.533]  I'm not a businessman.
[01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:46.913]  I'm not a media mogul.
[01:41:46.913 --> 01:41:48.373]  I'm a talk show host and an analyst.
[01:41:48.373 --> 01:41:49.774]  But I've got to wear every hat.
[01:41:49.774 --> 01:41:50.874]  I've got to do it.
[01:41:50.874 --> 01:41:52.054]  I've got the expertise.
[01:41:52.054 --> 01:41:52.834]  I know how to do it.
[01:41:52.834 --> 01:41:53.975]  I've got to step up.
[01:41:53.975 --> 01:41:55.415]  And I'm committed to this fight.
[01:41:55.415 --> 01:42:01.337]  But I need you to go to... It's basically donating to buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:42:01.337 --> 01:42:02.057]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:42:04.725 --> 01:42:12.088]  Joining us is a lady who's been ominous in the last year plus as things have escalated.
[01:42:12.088 --> 01:42:18.330]  And she's since gone public with her full name and who she is and been on national TV in Australia.
[01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:24.292]  Her family left Australia because basically Assad ran some of them out.
[01:42:24.292 --> 01:42:26.053]  So they don't like Assad and they're suing.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:32.342]  They were formerly part of the ruling party and the top folks in the country.
[01:42:32.342 --> 01:42:45.288]  But that said, she now for the last year plus has been very, very critical of what's happening there because it's foreign governments bringing in Al-Qaeda to carry out unbelievable atrocities, blowing up churches, you name it.
[01:42:45.288 --> 01:42:46.829]  And she's been on for over a year.
[01:42:46.829 --> 01:42:51.711]  The videos, the news articles are on Infowars.com saying they're going to stage a fake chemical attack.
[01:42:51.711 --> 01:42:53.452]  They've been caught staging some smaller ones.
[01:42:54.412 --> 01:43:13.845]  Look at who put out the report, but Syrian Girl, tell folks who you really are on air, a little bit about yourself, because I think that's important, what your real name is for folks that don't know, and your Twitter, your Facebook up front, so they understand, and so they can go read the articles you've written, the videos you did going back over a year, that have all proven 100% accurate.
[01:43:15.526 --> 01:43:17.568]  Thanks a lot for having me again.
[01:43:17.568 --> 01:43:17.808]  It's a great
[01:43:41.707 --> 01:43:56.437]  podium to have that's independent, one of the few podiums that actually listens to this voice, this message that is being drowned out because I actually don't want to fuel the war in Syria.
[01:43:56.437 --> 01:44:08.605]  My intentions from the start is to try to expose the reality of the bigger, grander scheme that's being played here.
[01:44:08.605 --> 01:44:10.186]  And personally,
[01:44:12.190 --> 01:44:25.003]  My family were not exiled from Syria, but my grandfather was in government, deposed by the Ba'ath Party coup.
[01:44:25.003 --> 01:44:31.569]  So my family as a whole, from both sides, have always been opposition, and I grew up being
[01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:50.018]  Against the government being told about how terrible the crimes of the government were against my own family members, some of which went to jail under suspicion of being Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:44:50.018 --> 01:44:51.979]  For 20 years in fact.
[01:44:51.979 --> 01:44:58.804]  So I'm not going to come here and deny that the government wasn't a dictatorship, it wasn't corrupt.
[01:45:01.291 --> 01:45:03.913]  You know, that people weren't angry with it.
[01:45:03.913 --> 01:45:12.739]  And I'm not going to say that there wasn't a legitimate reason for people to want to create that change.
[01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:28.209]  But the fact is that that was totally exploited and even pre-planned by the foreign agendas, the US, NATO, basically the global elite, as you call them.
[01:45:28.985 --> 01:45:32.166]  Absolutely, and again, your real name is Mimi Al-Ahem.
[01:45:32.166 --> 01:45:34.527]  You've had a lot of courage, Justin.
[01:45:34.527 --> 01:45:36.187]  How long since you went public?
[01:45:36.187 --> 01:45:38.228]  It's been about a year and a half, right?
[01:45:38.228 --> 01:45:41.009]  I believe so, yes.
[01:45:41.009 --> 01:45:46.691]  It was early last year, but this has been going on now for two and a half years, and they call them activists.
[01:45:46.691 --> 01:45:49.792]  They have tanks, they have Chinese TOW missiles, they have U.S.
[01:45:49.792 --> 01:45:52.853]  TOW missiles, they have Stingers, they have heat-seeking missiles.
[01:45:52.853 --> 01:45:57.815]  They're blowing up churches, blowing up airports, blowing up markets, and they're called heroes.
[01:45:58.943 --> 01:46:00.224]  On CNN.
[01:46:00.224 --> 01:46:05.626]  And so even though the father Assad was somewhat brutal, compared to al-Qaeda, he was a good guy.
[01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:11.488]  Now it's correct to say that the son, trained in England, was loosening things though.
[01:46:11.488 --> 01:46:12.749]  Or is that improper to say?
[01:46:14.417 --> 01:46:23.303]  No, he was definitely loosening things, like every year I would go back and I would see that people were more open, speaking more openly.
[01:46:23.303 --> 01:46:43.336]  The first step he took was to release some political prisoners, but whilst he was doing something good on one hand, on the other hand you could say that there was government failings and maybe his policy of opening the economy actually made the rich rich and the poor poor.
[01:46:44.977 --> 01:46:45.478]  Absolutely.
[01:46:45.478 --> 01:46:46.599]  Always ruling elites do.
[01:46:46.599 --> 01:46:48.540]  That's why I don't want a big centralized government.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.321]  It will centralize the economy.
[01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:51.422]  That's just the way it is.
[01:46:51.422 --> 01:46:56.586]  So that said, we've shown the other side that your family's been opposition for 20 years.
[01:46:56.586 --> 01:47:01.669]  Now let's shift gears into what's on record.
[01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:07.614]  The CIA, the NATO commandos, the heavy weapons, the chemical attack that you over a year ago
[01:47:08.494 --> 01:47:11.135]  You were the first person to say they're going to do a chemical false flag.
[01:47:11.135 --> 01:47:12.895]  Now the Russians have said they've done that.
[01:47:12.895 --> 01:47:14.356]  They've caught them doing it before.
[01:47:14.356 --> 01:47:21.737]  What do you know about this latest attack right as the UN inspector showed up?
[01:47:21.737 --> 01:47:27.599]  Okay, well, as you exactly said, you know, this incident occurred a day after the UN arrived in Damascus.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:39.105]  And the timing of it was, you know, the Syrian government actually requested the UN presence to investigate another incident which was in Khan al-Assal in Aleppo.
[01:47:39.105 --> 01:47:46.029]  So actually the UN team was only kilometers away from the site because they were in Damascus when this happened.
[01:47:46.029 --> 01:47:51.512]  Exactly, they don't want the last chemical attacks that have been proven fake certified so they did a new bigger one.
[01:47:54.065 --> 01:48:02.997]  It's illogical to think that the Syrian government is going to profit from this just by the way that the media is reacting to this.
[01:48:02.997 --> 01:48:09.706]  And you know, one year to the day of this event, exactly, was Obama's redline speech.
[01:48:09.706 --> 01:48:10.107]  That's right.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:21.567]  Where he promised some sort of unnamed action if Syria were to use chemical weapons and people inferred that that was a no-fly zone.
[01:48:21.567 --> 01:48:37.437]  And that was the same time that me and many other bloggers, Tony Cartlidge, were saying it looks like from the way they're posturing that they want to create some kind of chemical incident to give them an excuse to intervene in some way.
[01:48:41.215 --> 01:49:02.245]  I think it's absolutely undeniable that little children died in Damascus three days ago and that the images are shocking and anyone can see, cannot deny that and I'm not going to comment on the nature of the gas that was used.
[01:49:02.245 --> 01:49:03.666]  I'm going to leave that to experts.
[01:49:04.594 --> 01:49:07.935]  And I also don't want to implicate the rebels as a whole.
[01:49:07.935 --> 01:49:21.940]  Because, you know, while you could say some of them are al-Qaeda, some of them are foreign, some of them are thieves, you know, some of them would have, as I showed on my channel, used a prisoner as an unwitting suicide bomber.
[01:49:23.661 --> 01:49:32.223]  And this is part of the FSA, one of the groups under the FSA umbrella that did this, that's not an Al-Qaeda group.
[01:49:32.223 --> 01:49:44.626]  So I don't want to implicate them directly because I'm sure that some of them have families that live in that area and I believe that they themselves are patsies to a global
[01:49:46.407 --> 01:49:49.990]  game that, you know, they're cannon fodder for.
[01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:59.097]  And the powers that be have managed to convince them that they're going to get armed, they're going to get no-fly zones.
[01:49:59.097 --> 01:50:09.165]  But the reality of the situation is, and what I do know, is that the US doesn't attack countries that actually possess chemical weapons.
[01:50:09.165 --> 01:50:13.628]  And in order to achieve any kind of attack, they would first have to
[01:50:16.053 --> 01:50:18.154]  Get rid of a country's chemical weapons.
[01:50:18.154 --> 01:50:24.276]  And this is one of the reasons, one of the core causes for this war.
[01:50:24.276 --> 01:50:33.299]  Not only that, but of course they want to divide Syria up into mini-states, and they want to crush any rogue states, basically.
[01:50:33.499 --> 01:50:37.000]  Yeah, any state not run by Goldman Sachs, basically.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.360]  So we'll come right back on the other side and break that down.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:44.001]  Europe's been conquered by Goldman Sachs, they actually brag about that, and J.P.
[01:50:44.001 --> 01:50:50.762]  Morgan, and the big royal families that sit atop it, and it is just unbelievable that this is going on.
[01:50:50.762 --> 01:50:58.344]  And right on time, you have this chemical attack, right when the inspectors are there, and of course the Syrian government has denied it.
[01:51:01.288 --> 01:51:05.091]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:07.193]  So you may know a few things about him.
[01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:13.878]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[01:51:13.878 --> 01:51:19.482]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[01:51:19.482 --> 01:51:20.202]  It's true!
[01:51:20.202 --> 01:51:22.024]  And he can email you the test results.

[01:52:00.459 --> 01:52:01.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:06.062]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:06.062 --> 01:52:11.765]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:11.765 --> 01:52:13.926]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[01:52:13.926 --> 01:52:15.347]  No word about IRAs.
[01:52:15.347 --> 01:52:18.028]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:18.028 --> 01:52:22.990]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:52:59.608 --> 01:53:01.009]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.009 --> 01:53:11.678]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:53:11.678 --> 01:53:15.761]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:53:16.121 --> 01:53:18.863]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:53:18.863 --> 01:53:30.150]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:53:30.150 --> 01:53:33.312]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:53:33.632 --> 01:53:39.775]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:53:39.775 --> 01:53:49.680]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.180]  The war is here.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.081]  It's an info war.
[01:53:53.081 --> 01:53:55.022]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:54:12.366 --> 01:54:25.370]  Amy Al-Aheem, known as Syrian Girl, before her identity was revealed by Australian TV News, is a family basically self-exiled because of political reasons.
[01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:28.031]  They don't like Assad.
[01:54:28.031 --> 01:54:33.913]  But Assad was moving towards more of what you'd call democratization and reaching out to the West.
[01:54:33.913 --> 01:54:36.934]  I follow geopolitical developments.
[01:54:36.934 --> 01:54:37.794]  So was Gaddafi.
[01:54:39.278 --> 01:54:45.279]  He invested most of his money with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, and invited them all in, opened up, apologized.
[01:54:45.279 --> 01:54:46.879]  Boy, they set him up.
[01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:47.299]  Bam!
[01:54:47.299 --> 01:54:48.580]  Brought in Al-Qaeda.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.340]  And now they've wrecked the whole country.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:52.820]  They don't want Africa being lifted up.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.021]  They want them to industrialize.
[01:54:54.021 --> 01:54:56.581]  In fact, the foundations complained about Libya.
[01:54:56.581 --> 01:54:59.501]  Libya was jacking up all of Africa.
[01:54:59.501 --> 01:55:03.682]  By jacking them up, by giving them aid, creating an infrastructure.
[01:55:03.682 --> 01:55:06.163]  Globalists don't want anybody to have an infrastructure, folks.
[01:55:06.163 --> 01:55:06.683]  Except them.
[01:55:06.683 --> 01:55:07.743]  It's called Agenda 21.
[01:55:09.389 --> 01:55:11.750]  It's military corporatism.
[01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:12.911]  That's the New World Order.
[01:55:12.911 --> 01:55:15.172]  It's militarized corporatism.
[01:55:15.172 --> 01:55:17.973]  That's the best way to describe them, right there, my term.
[01:55:17.973 --> 01:55:20.374]  Militarized corporatism.
[01:55:20.374 --> 01:55:21.174]  Scorched earth.
[01:55:21.174 --> 01:55:26.837]  And in closing, they've now got a lot of analysts saying this could lead to World War III with the Russians there.
[01:55:27.839 --> 01:55:30.440]  The Russians are saying it's a false flag.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:36.662]  The rebels have been caught three other times doing these fake chemical things since the Red Line deal, but this one was bigger.
[01:55:36.662 --> 01:55:47.205]  And I'm so sad for all the forces that are there, but we know if the country's turned over to Al-Qaeda that, I mean, in my summation, what is that, 10 times worse than Assad?
[01:55:47.205 --> 01:55:49.286]  20 times?
[01:55:49.286 --> 01:55:53.047]  Your comments on that and other points and where you think this is going to go now.
[01:55:54.249 --> 01:55:59.115]  I think you headed exactly where I was going to go in that direction.
[01:55:59.115 --> 01:56:08.305]  I want to make it clear that as bad as the government used to be, what they have planned to take power in Syria now is going to be ten times worse, as you said.
[01:56:09.867 --> 01:56:21.097]  You only need to look at history of what happened in Libya and what happened in Iraq to see that the US government's intentions in the region was not democratization.
[01:56:21.097 --> 01:56:24.980]  Those governments, those new ones, tortured just as much as the previous ones.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:29.624]  If not more so, only the country that they're in is completely decimated.
[01:56:29.624 --> 01:56:30.605]  That's the only difference.
[01:56:33.047 --> 01:56:36.748]  The fact about Libya, as you said, Gaddafi, he really fell for it.
[01:56:36.748 --> 01:56:37.729]  He opened up the gates.
[01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:40.150]  He thought, let's be friends.
[01:56:40.150 --> 01:56:45.532]  They said in 2003, he probably knew his country would be next on the list.
[01:56:45.532 --> 01:56:52.975]  So in 2003, after the Iraq invasion had already begun, he agreed to weapons of mass destruction disarmament.
[01:56:54.173 --> 01:56:55.634]  And he was attacked in 2011.
[01:56:55.634 --> 01:56:58.875]  And I just said, you know, the U.S.
[01:56:58.875 --> 01:57:03.878]  government is not going to attack a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction.
[01:57:03.878 --> 01:57:06.459]  They first have to remove them.
[01:57:06.459 --> 01:57:09.560]  But from here on out, let's just call it Goldman Sachs.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.241]  I mean, they brag.
[01:57:10.241 --> 01:57:11.081]  They run the country.
[01:57:11.081 --> 01:57:17.364]  So, Goldman Sachs wants you to give up your WMDs, invest with them, then they bring in Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:17.364 --> 01:57:20.765]  Well, they destroy your country and then they make money by rebuilding it.
[01:57:20.765 --> 01:57:21.366]  Yeah, of course.
[01:57:22.578 --> 01:57:23.359]  Exactly right.
[01:57:23.359 --> 01:57:25.642]  You know, it's not even the U.S.
[01:57:25.642 --> 01:57:26.163]  government.
[01:57:26.163 --> 01:57:28.025]  It's just a shortcut.
[01:57:28.025 --> 01:57:35.173]  And then they roll in with water fluoridation and the shots and suddenly nobody can tie your shoelaces and you're like Americans and it's game over, you're dead.
[01:57:35.173 --> 01:57:36.355]  Yeah.
[01:57:36.355 --> 01:57:39.839]  I think it's just the face of something much darker and bigger and global.
[01:57:42.435 --> 01:57:59.162]  You know, in Iraq, they were again disarmed in 1991, using the United Nations, and were attacked in 2003, after the United Nations was used again to make absolutely certain that Saddam hadn't hidden some stash of WMDs somewhere.
[01:57:59.162 --> 01:58:00.503]  And in fact, the U.S.
[01:58:00.503 --> 01:58:07.326]  military, when they invaded, they were still afraid of it enough to provide all their soldiers with gas masks.
[01:58:07.526 --> 01:58:08.469]  Oh yeah, that's what the U.N.
[01:58:08.469 --> 01:58:08.830]  does.
[01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:13.183]  It comes in as the peacekeeper to disarm you, and then NATO comes in with the U.S.
[01:58:13.183 --> 01:58:13.985]  and murders everybody.
[01:58:14.961 --> 01:58:17.021]  Absolutely.
[01:58:17.021 --> 01:58:17.642]  Stay there, man.
[01:58:17.642 --> 01:58:23.023]  I tell you, she has a way of crystallizing stuff that takes me hours to say.
[01:58:23.023 --> 01:58:26.503]  Mimi Alahim, Syrian girl, will give you her Twitter and Facebook.

[01:58:55.003 --> 01:58:56.263]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.263 --> 01:59:00.205]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.205 --> 01:59:02.605]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.605 --> 01:59:08.307]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:14.969]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.969 --> 01:59:20.951]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.951 --> 01:59:24.652]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[01:59:40.883 --> 01:59:42.024]  It's here.

[01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:58.853]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.475 --> 02:00:10.297]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.297 --> 02:00:11.878]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.878 --> 02:00:13.419]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.419 --> 02:00:17.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.621 --> 02:00:22.343]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.343 --> 02:00:26.024]  The globalists just don't want to destroy the eight rogue nations on their list.
[02:00:26.024 --> 02:00:27.965]  They've already taken down several of them.
[02:00:27.965 --> 02:00:33.528]  They want to destroy all independent nations, the family, anything that can stand against them.
[02:00:35.154 --> 02:00:53.619]  And when Serial Girl is on with us, Mimi Alahim talking about how they get people to give up their WMDs and then invade and then turn off the water, bring in GMO, bring in fluoride, bring in forced inoculations, cancer rates are like 14 times what they were in Iraq.
[02:00:53.619 --> 02:00:55.180]  These are genocide operations.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:01.204]  And they're genociding our troops with the DU and the vaccines and the forced drugging as well.
[02:01:01.204 --> 02:01:15.415]  The New World Order, we have a clip of a professor and his students up on Infowars.com today saying, yeah, we need, you know, cut off the food and have genetically engineered bioweapons to get rid of people.
[02:01:15.415 --> 02:01:20.800]  And you hear everybody clapping and smiling and it's a big group of graduate students and it's a power trip, folks.
[02:01:22.012 --> 02:01:24.114]  And they see it as exterminating cockroaches.
[02:01:24.114 --> 02:01:29.580]  So, just understand good old boys and others that say, oh, let's kill them Arabs.
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:31.221]  They're killing you too.
[02:01:31.221 --> 02:01:33.263]  So, drink your fluoride.
[02:01:33.263 --> 02:01:34.525]  Syrian girl, finishing up.
[02:01:34.525 --> 02:01:36.547]  We got about four minutes in this segment.
[02:01:36.547 --> 02:01:44.154]  Other eloquent points you'd like to make about, I see mainstream articles here saying Assad will still win, but it looks like the globalists aren't going to stop.
[02:01:44.154 --> 02:01:45.616]  I mean, what do you expect them to do next?
[02:01:47.972 --> 02:01:53.456]  I want to make it clear that I predict that there's not going to be a no-fly zone.
[02:01:53.456 --> 02:01:54.176]  You know, if the U.S.
[02:01:54.176 --> 02:01:59.879]  was going to do that, if the globalists were going to do that, they would have done it ten red lines ago.
[02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:02.021]  The Russian veto wouldn't have stopped them.
[02:02:02.021 --> 02:02:10.826]  I think that what they really want to see is disarmament of Syria, and they want to see Syria get balkanized and broken up.
[02:02:10.826 --> 02:02:13.267]  Well yeah, Kissinger said that's what he wants.
[02:02:13.267 --> 02:02:14.308]  Kissinger said that, yeah.
[02:02:14.775 --> 02:02:24.217]  He absolutely said it and it was Ron Paul's son, Ron Paul, who said that he heard that they were fighting towards a stalemate as well from another source.
[02:02:24.217 --> 02:02:38.681]  So, you know, I just wanted to that and just to give evidence that at the UN, an Israeli ambassador a year ago said that we should expect to see the US, the Syrian government gassing children in the future.
[02:02:39.461 --> 02:02:49.704]  And one year later, you know, the smoke clears and the same ambassador said, you know, we want to make sure that those Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles don't end up in the hands of Hezbollah.
[02:02:49.704 --> 02:02:52.945]  So really, it's not about Syria's children.
[02:02:52.945 --> 02:02:55.446]  It's not about, it's about the chemical weapons.
[02:02:55.446 --> 02:03:00.967]  You know, it's about getting at them because they don't want to have any country that has a deterrent.
[02:03:00.967 --> 02:03:02.808]  Not, you know, except for themselves.
[02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:05.529]  They want to control all the power, just like they do with the guns.
[02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:14.106]  So it's like they tricked Saddam to use nerve gas on the Iranians and then later use that to invade him.
[02:03:14.106 --> 02:03:17.851]  The Iran-Iraq war was they're tricking both sides, you know, to attack each other.
[02:03:17.851 --> 02:03:20.795]  And on the
[02:03:22.555 --> 02:03:27.358]  GMO, you know, Bremer, one of the first things he did in Iraq was allow GMO.
[02:03:27.358 --> 02:03:31.860]  And Syria in 2011, Assad banned genetically modified food.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:41.125]  So there's definitely these games happening with Monsanto, you know, being one of the corporate warmongers, the dogs of war, as they call them.
[02:03:41.125 --> 02:03:45.768]  Well, Mimi, you know, it came out on The London Telegraph and BBC that Assad's people listen to this show.
[02:03:46.548 --> 02:03:49.529]  I can't believe these governments aren't sophisticated enough to figure this stuff out on their own.
[02:03:49.529 --> 02:03:51.269]  I'm not being cynical.
[02:03:51.269 --> 02:03:53.890]  It's just that, like, Assad's dad sending him stuff.
[02:03:53.890 --> 02:03:57.531]  I don't understand why these governments are so rigid.
[02:03:57.531 --> 02:03:59.071]  They can't even figure this out.
[02:03:59.071 --> 02:04:03.532]  Like, why did the Arabs and the Persians let the West trick them into killing each other?
[02:04:03.532 --> 02:04:05.692]  I don't understand this.
[02:04:05.692 --> 02:04:07.633]  Why do they have to listen to me to figure this out?
[02:04:13.393 --> 02:04:17.634]  Hatred of each other can be easily fueled.
[02:04:17.634 --> 02:04:21.615]  And that's what we're, you know, it's divide and conquer.
[02:04:21.615 --> 02:04:34.357]  And your neighbor, your brother, becomes an enemy worse than the enemy that's actually pulling your strength, both of you, from far away.
[02:04:34.357 --> 02:04:36.538]  And I saw it happen in Iraq.
[02:04:36.538 --> 02:04:37.278]  I saw it happen
[02:04:38.198 --> 02:04:40.700]  All over the place, Libya of course, so...
[02:05:01.491 --> 02:05:03.573]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:05:03.573 --> 02:05:11.600]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.544]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:05:16.544 --> 02:05:18.446]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:05:18.706 --> 02:05:25.131]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:05:25.131 --> 02:05:33.338]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from E-Foods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:05:33.338 --> 02:05:39.722]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[02:05:39.722 --> 02:05:40.743]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[02:06:01.209 --> 02:06:05.071]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:06:05.071 --> 02:06:10.593]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:06:10.593 --> 02:06:18.316]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:06:18.316 --> 02:06:27.440]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:34.828]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:06:34.828 --> 02:06:37.712]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:06:37.712 --> 02:06:44.640]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand a war.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:46.161]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:06:46.161 --> 02:06:47.423]  Another plane just hit!

[02:07:55.530 --> 02:08:09.478]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:09.478 --> 02:08:17.163]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.384 --> 02:08:39.408]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, if you take action, if we, the people, take action, there's no way the globalists can carry out their operations.
[02:08:39.408 --> 02:08:46.610]  That's why they feed us GMO that in every study retards the rats that they feed it to and the monkeys they feed it to and the apes.
[02:08:46.610 --> 02:08:51.492]  That's why they give us the fluoride that in Princeton and Harvard and University of Texas and
[02:08:53.394 --> 02:09:07.344]  Oxford studies shows around 20% IQ reduction if you just drink fluoridated water at 1.6 part per million, which is what they put in our water, for a decade.
[02:09:07.344 --> 02:09:12.208]  I just mention that again because they have MSNBC going, he's insane!
[02:09:12.208 --> 02:09:14.590]  He thinks we put fluoride in the water!
[02:09:14.590 --> 02:09:15.851]  Now it's not that
[02:09:16.963 --> 02:09:23.147]  They're putting this stuff in the water, it's that they're saying that they're not even putting it in the water.
[02:09:23.147 --> 02:09:35.055]  It's like Obama, and I played the clip in the last hour, it's up on Infowars.com, said there's not even allegations the NSA is trying to listen in on people's email.
[02:09:35.055 --> 02:09:40.859]  That's like Gibbs saying there is no drone program when the drone program is publicly admitted to exist.
[02:09:40.859 --> 02:09:41.540]  We are under
[02:09:43.579 --> 02:09:48.141]  A dictatorship of kleptocrat eugenicists who enjoy hurting us.
[02:09:48.141 --> 02:09:51.743]  Just like depleted uranium, they wouldn't use it until 1990.
[02:09:51.743 --> 02:09:56.865]  They had it since World War II.
[02:09:56.865 --> 02:09:57.906]  After the Manhattan Project.
[02:09:57.906 --> 02:09:59.586]  1946, there's papers on it.
[02:09:59.586 --> 02:10:00.507]  We've read them on air.
[02:10:00.507 --> 02:10:09.011]  We've had Dr. Doug Rocky on, nuclear physicist, biologist, former head of the Pentagon DU program.
[02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:10.772]  They would not allow them to use it in combat until 1990.
[02:10:12.776 --> 02:10:14.137]  And then now they just use it everywhere.
[02:10:14.137 --> 02:10:16.698]  Now they just put it in concrete additives.
[02:10:16.698 --> 02:10:17.959]  Now it's in forklifts.
[02:10:17.959 --> 02:10:19.179]  Now it's everywhere.
[02:10:19.179 --> 02:10:23.602]  And the cancer rates go up and up and up and up.
[02:10:23.602 --> 02:10:25.363]  91% of nuclear reactors are leaking.
[02:10:25.363 --> 02:10:28.224]  That's an Associated Press headline you can pull up.
[02:10:28.224 --> 02:10:35.388]  Out of 420-something reactors, 91% are leaking.
[02:10:35.388 --> 02:10:37.970]  Last year when they had reactors leaking out in
[02:10:39.591 --> 02:10:49.414]  Southern California, their answer was, we'll just stop turning the alarms on in the city that have been there for 50 years when this happens.
[02:10:49.414 --> 02:11:02.558]  So, it is an insanity by the elite, where, well I played the clip yesterday where the Japanese government is putting on newscasts that if you smile, studies show things won't hurt you.
[02:11:02.558 --> 02:11:04.879]  And so smile and the radiation won't hurt you.
[02:11:06.076 --> 02:11:06.857]  There's the headline.
[02:11:06.857 --> 02:11:07.937]  A brainwashing campaign.
[02:11:07.937 --> 02:11:12.140]  Radiation doesn't affect people who are smiling.
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:15.562]  And that is an attempt by the Japanese government on the news.
[02:11:15.562 --> 02:11:16.322]  We played the clip.
[02:11:16.322 --> 02:11:19.484]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking.
[02:11:19.484 --> 02:11:21.706]  They're saying if you smile, it will protect you.
[02:11:21.706 --> 02:11:26.249]  Doesn't matter that most of the people that responded now are either dead or dying.
[02:11:26.249 --> 02:11:31.132]  You know, the hundreds of people that were willing to go in there and try to clean that up.
[02:11:31.132 --> 02:11:34.834]  And now it's melting down and degrading even more.
[02:11:38.459 --> 02:11:42.323]  Now it's getting worse, and the stuff's pouring into the ocean.
[02:11:42.323 --> 02:11:45.065]  You've got multiple reactors that are still very dangerous.
[02:11:45.065 --> 02:11:46.567]  You've got all these fuel rods.
[02:11:46.567 --> 02:11:48.689]  The cleanup's beginning.
[02:11:48.689 --> 02:12:01.281]  And you've got Pepco saying it's extremely dangerous, but you've got our media saying there's no problem, even though three months after the FDA tested yellowfin tuna off San Diego and didn't tell people for a year.
[02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:04.271]  After that.
[02:12:04.271 --> 02:12:07.433]  So that's, uh, 15 months after that.
[02:12:07.433 --> 02:12:10.234]  Oh, yeah, we found higher radiation effect a lot higher.
[02:12:10.234 --> 02:12:13.877]  Some cases 10 times higher than what we say is safe in the elephant.
[02:12:13.877 --> 02:12:19.380]  These different cesiums, uh, you know, breakdowns and we say it's okay now.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.980]  We're just going to raise what's safe.
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:23.741]  Now, I've kind of set the table for that there.
[02:12:23.741 --> 02:12:31.764]  I've read a lot of shocking stuff in RT about, you know, this could be the greatest meltdown ever coming and could kill millions.
[02:12:31.764 --> 02:12:33.204]  Is that fear-mongering?
[02:12:33.204 --> 02:12:38.005]  I see articles about, you know, the UN says that they believe Chernobyl's killed a million people since 1986, 20-plus years ago.
[02:12:41.306 --> 02:12:42.887]  Who knows?
[02:12:42.887 --> 02:12:50.148]  I've had Dr. Bob Bowman on as a physicist saying, undoubtedly we will have more deaths in the northern hemisphere from this radiation.
[02:12:50.148 --> 02:12:53.289]  The northern hemisphere is over two times higher radiation.
[02:12:53.289 --> 02:12:57.390]  You've got all these reports in Alaska where a lot of the radiation's actually gone.
[02:12:57.390 --> 02:13:00.671]  Of the animals dying, people's hair falling out.
[02:13:00.671 --> 02:13:07.873]  The man who's really on top of this, who's advised the EU, the British government, he's a chemical physicist, has a lot of other letters to his name.
[02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:23.415]  He's the other camp from the Japanese government saying, smile, radiation's good for you, or George Mombiot saying, we need more radiation, it's good for you, or Ann Coulter saying on Fox News that the Japanese should be thankful radiation's good for you.
[02:13:23.415 --> 02:13:25.156]  That's an actual quote.
[02:13:25.156 --> 02:13:27.657]  So I think she should go live there at Fukushima since she says that.
[02:13:27.657 --> 02:13:28.477]  I'm not kidding.
[02:13:28.477 --> 02:13:30.478]  Go live there, or shut up.
[02:13:30.478 --> 02:13:36.699]  Because I don't like this, folks, the fact that there are all these reports of milk and stuff, even in Texas, with higher radiation.
[02:13:36.699 --> 02:13:38.160]  They're like, oh, don't worry.
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:46.845]  I mean, just because the elite has gone crazy and thinks all of this is fine doesn't mean the rest of us have to go off the deep end.
[02:13:46.845 --> 02:13:50.166]  Delusional thinking, smiling, won't protect you.
[02:13:50.166 --> 02:14:00.812]  And so, Christopher Busby's a British scientist, and he heads up a lot of very important advisory groups, the low-level radiation campaign, LLRC.
[02:14:00.812 --> 02:14:03.254]  And again, I don't just go off what he says as a physicist.
[02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:21.750]  I have had countless physicists, the former head of the Star Wars program on, the head of the Pentagon program on, I've probably had, let's not exaggerate, I don't know, 20 or so nuclear physicists on, famous submarine physicists on, you name it, who said they were lied to, low-level
[02:14:22.972 --> 02:14:27.293]  If it gets into your body, it's just as bad because it's point-blank up against the cells.
[02:14:27.293 --> 02:14:30.274]  So I'm no physicist, but I can talk to all the top physicists.
[02:14:30.274 --> 02:14:33.435]  And all the physicists agreed with this 50, 60 years ago.
[02:14:33.435 --> 02:14:34.315]  Even 20 years ago.
[02:14:34.315 --> 02:14:44.857]  So there's a new, irrational, delusional, let-them-eat-cake, Marie Antoinette-on-PCP action where everybody just says, this is fine now.
[02:14:44.857 --> 02:14:45.798]  He's been a hard guy to get.
[02:14:45.798 --> 02:14:46.698]  He's very busy.
[02:14:48.075 --> 02:14:52.256]  But he's able to join us now.
[02:14:52.256 --> 02:14:59.557]  Christopher Busby, and Christopher, feel free with all the sites you're involved with to mention where people should get all your studies and material.
[02:14:59.557 --> 02:15:03.218]  But you've heard my little five-minute rant here.
[02:15:03.218 --> 02:15:04.938]  I mean, am I the one that's insane?
[02:15:04.938 --> 02:15:12.199]  Should I smile and go live at Fukushima where the animals are now deformed, the butterflies and the children?
[02:15:12.199 --> 02:15:14.540]  Or are you right?
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:15.840]  Is radiation bad for us?
[02:15:16.733 --> 02:15:34.481]  Alex, you're spot on with your rant, and I hope you continue to rant like this, but I can't see any easy way of persuading the governments of the world and the bogus scientific committees that they've set up to operate this system of chicanery and lies.
[02:15:34.481 --> 02:15:35.502]  Any way of stopping them?
[02:15:36.022 --> 02:15:40.644]  I mean, to be honest, these people ought to be sent to jail, and perhaps one day that will happen.
[02:15:40.644 --> 02:15:41.544]  Who knows?
[02:15:41.544 --> 02:15:57.769]  But at the moment, I see no sign of them backing off from what is clearly a very, very serious problem, and in my opinion, probably the worst public health scandal in human history, and one that is very likely set on destroying all life on Earth if it's continued unabated.
[02:15:58.385 --> 02:16:00.467]  This is really a serious, serious problem.
[02:16:00.467 --> 02:16:08.096]  I mean, I'll give you an example, a very recent example of the sort of Alice in Wonderland world that we're living in.
[02:16:09.015 --> 02:16:10.617]  With regard to radiation.
[02:16:10.617 --> 02:16:25.971]  Now, you will recall that the World Health Organization's supremo bloke called Wolfgang Weiss, Dr. Wolfgang Weiss, they had a meeting in 2012 to talk about the health effects of Fukushima.
[02:16:25.971 --> 02:16:27.492]  And of course they said there wouldn't be any.
[02:16:27.492 --> 02:16:28.453]  There wouldn't be any!
[02:16:28.453 --> 02:16:30.575]  There would be no detectable health effects.
[02:16:30.575 --> 02:16:33.938]  Now, what we discover in the last few months
[02:16:34.765 --> 02:16:47.315]  Is that a study done by the Medical University in Fukushima has turned up now, well originally 27 cases of thyroid cancer in children and it's now gone up to 44 cases of thyroid cancer in children.
[02:16:47.315 --> 02:16:48.976]  This is an official study.
[02:16:48.976 --> 02:17:03.167]  Now the University Department which made this study, they say, I mean and it's quoted in the Japan Times, they say we do not see that these thyroid cancers are associated with the Fukushima contamination.
[02:17:03.527 --> 02:17:05.568]  I mean, can you imagine such nonsense?
[02:17:05.568 --> 02:17:13.810]  Now, the actual background rate for thyroid cancer in Japan, I've dug out, it's actually zero.
[02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:25.713]  So, this was a study done in 2005, and if we, my colleague, Professor Michael Malco, of the Institute of Thyroid and Belarus, worked
[02:17:26.611 --> 02:17:34.683]  On the increases in thyroid cancer in Chernobyl, and he was able to determine a rate, a pre-Chernobyl rate in thyroid cancer in children.
[02:17:34.683 --> 02:17:40.531]  And it was something like three cases in 16 years in the whole population of Belarus, okay?
[02:17:41.630 --> 02:17:53.513]  Now, therefore, it's easy to work out that the excess risk in Fukushima of thyroid cancer in children is approximately 200 times the expected value.
[02:17:53.513 --> 02:17:58.694]  So it's not like 1.5 or 1.3 or 20% or something like that.
[02:17:58.694 --> 02:18:00.694]  It's about 200 times.
[02:18:00.694 --> 02:18:07.656]  But nobody's saying, oh gosh, we got it wrong, or oh dear, the internal radiation must be worse than we thought, or any of this stuff.
[02:18:07.876 --> 02:18:10.098]  We hear a deadly silence from these people.
[02:18:10.098 --> 02:18:12.640]  They should all be sent to jail.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.341]  What has changed, Dr. Busby?
[02:18:14.341 --> 02:18:21.247]  Because, and then I want to come back and talk about the critical nature and the press and how bad off are the six reactors, the five damaged.
[02:18:21.247 --> 02:18:23.629]  Why are they saying a bigger disaster could come?
[02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:26.651]  Explain it to, you know, laymen like myself out here.
[02:18:26.651 --> 02:18:28.473]  But we're going to break in about a minute and a half.
[02:18:28.473 --> 02:18:30.254]  First, why
[02:18:31.818 --> 02:18:37.586]  Are we seeing this delusional manifestation and what do you liken it to?
[02:18:37.586 --> 02:18:41.472]  Where all over the world they're just raising the level saying it's safe now.
[02:18:41.472 --> 02:18:42.173]  What is this?
[02:18:42.173 --> 02:18:43.655]  Mass madness or what is it?
[02:18:44.224 --> 02:18:47.065]  I think it must be some kind of psychological denial.
[02:18:47.065 --> 02:18:52.286]  I think you'd probably better talk to sociologists and psychologists about this rather than to a scientist.
[02:18:52.286 --> 02:19:04.049]  I mean, I have thought about it and I've thought of the various ways in which it can work and I can step back from it and step back from it and eventually we get back to a situation where it is really quite political.
[02:19:04.049 --> 02:19:12.871]  It's about the domination of one set of people by another set of people and the wars and the lies and so on that have continued throughout the whole of history.
[02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:22.196]  And so in order to explain this, basically all you're doing is explaining all the things that have happened in history, which are equally insane, to be honest.
[02:19:22.196 --> 02:19:31.941]  We've had situations like this again and again throughout history, so therefore it's not really anything new there, except that in this case, it's a question of the magnitude
[02:19:32.501 --> 02:19:37.745]  So in the past, you could have one set of mafia, if you like, dominating the people.
[02:19:37.745 --> 02:19:43.829]  You could have people like, for instance, in the Soviet Union, originally, you could have people disappearing and the airbrushing of history and so on.
[02:19:43.829 --> 02:19:47.051]  And we now see all of this stuff happening in the United States.
[02:19:47.051 --> 02:19:47.672]  Well, stay there.
[02:19:47.672 --> 02:19:56.898]  Explain it to us on the other side, because I'm guessing you're going to say, now it's a global corporate mafia above the law, and they've got melting down reactors, so the threat is much larger.
[02:19:56.898 --> 02:19:59.720]  I want to hear the end of this when we come back with Dr. Busby.
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:00.441]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:01.141 --> 02:20:11.909]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.

[02:22:33.271 --> 02:22:36.013]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:22:36.013 --> 02:22:38.774]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:23:00.168 --> 02:23:04.950]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:07.971]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:07.971 --> 02:23:16.934]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:16.934 --> 02:23:21.856]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:23:45.855 --> 02:23:49.438]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[02:23:56.704 --> 02:23:57.986]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:57.986 --> 02:23:59.046]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:23:59.046 --> 02:24:05.412]  He's going the distance.
[02:24:05.412 --> 02:24:06.273]  He's going for speed.
[02:24:12.327 --> 02:24:15.310]  All right, we're back live with Dr. Christopher Busby.
[02:24:15.310 --> 02:24:21.835]  He is a chemical physicist and advises major governments on issues of radiation.
[02:24:21.835 --> 02:24:24.437]  So I've already laid out some of the numbers, the statistics.
[02:24:24.437 --> 02:24:25.859]  There's over 400 reactors.
[02:24:25.859 --> 02:24:27.720]  90 plus percent are leaking.
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.502]  Anybody can look that up.
[02:24:29.502 --> 02:24:31.864]  Now they just say, oh, it's OK if it leaks.
[02:24:31.864 --> 02:24:34.306]  Things bigger than Three Mile Island.
[02:24:34.306 --> 02:24:37.328]  And so everyone knows what radiation does to people.
[02:24:38.189 --> 02:24:39.749]  Everyone knows it increases cancer.
[02:24:39.749 --> 02:24:41.970]  Everyone knows it increases mutation.
[02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:46.370]  Everyone knows, who's not even a scientist, but we're entering this world of denial.
[02:24:46.370 --> 02:25:06.734]  Dr. Busby, finish your point that got cut off by the break about crazies in the past, mafia in the past, versus the current global mafia, and then let's get into why I'm seeing articles all over the place, mainstream and alternative, saying Fukushima the worst is yet to come, and then tell us if that's true or not.
[02:25:07.884 --> 02:25:09.045]  Yes, right.
[02:25:09.045 --> 02:25:37.279]  Well, what market forces and the concentration of the global mafia has been able to do is to produce such an enormously powerful military and nuclear-orientated structure that it's possible to choose scientists and to pay those scientists that you want to tell you the things that you want to hear, or to tell you the things that enable you to continue with the operation that's making you lots of money and acquiring lots of power.
[02:25:37.839 --> 02:25:49.008]  Now, of course, you can step back from that, and I have a number of times tried to understand what it is that makes certain people want to be powerful and rich, what kind of insecurities there are.
[02:25:49.008 --> 02:25:57.234]  And certainly we see throughout history people like, well, if you like Hitler, insecure people who become powerful because of their insecurity.
[02:25:57.734 --> 02:26:11.486]  And terrible things can happen because then they can acquire around themselves other people like themselves and they can pay those people and then you end up with a situation which is monolithic and virtually impossible to deal with and terrible things happen.
[02:26:11.486 --> 02:26:19.853]  But what we have now is something that is almost universal and global and the situation because of the sheer magnitude of the problem
[02:26:20.473 --> 02:26:38.435]  The level of radionuclide emissions into the environment from all sorts of sources, from the depleted uranium, from the new super weapons that use uranium, from the endless leaking of these nuclear power stations which have just continued and are getting worse as the nuclear power stations themselves.
[02:26:38.875 --> 02:26:39.136]  I don't
[02:26:56.675 --> 02:27:02.899]  The future looks really quite bleak and particularly it looks bleak because of what I can now go on to.
[02:27:02.899 --> 02:27:05.940]  You asked me to look at this Fukushima situation.
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:13.885]  I want to do that in a moment but I want to digress back to what you were just saying briefly and then we'll get into the latest on Fukushima itself while everybody's tuning in.
[02:27:13.885 --> 02:27:18.627]  But what you say so eloquently is what Eisenhower in his farewell address warned about.
[02:27:18.627 --> 02:27:25.111]  He said the military industrial complex has been seized by corporate interest and
[02:27:25.851 --> 02:27:32.860]  And it itself is seizing the entire scientific complex to where they will be unopposable.
[02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:37.546]  And now they've hired all these mercenary scientists that will go along with anything.
[02:27:37.546 --> 02:27:42.031]  And it does seem like the madness of Nero or something.
[02:27:42.732 --> 02:27:58.770]  It's even worse because not only do they acquire scientists by paying them money in order to provide bogus scientific reports that support their position, but anyone who happens to stand up and say something which they don't like or find something which goes against
[02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:01.652]  They're crazy worldview.
[02:28:01.652 --> 02:28:03.414]  This person gets swiftly dealt with.
[02:28:03.414 --> 02:28:04.555]  I mean, I can name names.
[02:28:04.555 --> 02:28:21.051]  There was a young scientist in Sweden called Martin Tondell who discovered that there was a significant increase in cancer in northern Sweden after the very small amounts of radioactivity conventionally expressed that fell in northern Sweden after the Chernobyl accident.
[02:28:21.691 --> 02:28:24.312]  Now, he was swiftly dealt with by his boss.
[02:28:24.312 --> 02:28:35.858]  His boss is a chap called Lars-Erik Holm, who was the ex-head of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, and is now, would you believe, can you imagine, the medical officer of health for Sweden!
[02:28:35.858 --> 02:28:36.278]  Wow!
[02:28:36.278 --> 02:28:45.203]  So if you want to know what's happening in Sweden in terms of health, you go to Lars-Erik Holm, who is the ex-head of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.
[02:28:45.563 --> 02:28:56.947]  Well, that's like Obama is putting Cass Sunstein, the regulations czar that said it was okay to spy on people without warrants, on the NSA Blue Ribbon Board to investigate the NSA.
[02:28:56.947 --> 02:28:58.007]  Yes, yes.
[02:28:58.007 --> 02:29:02.808]  Well, of course, we can find many, many, many situations in which this sort of thing happens.
[02:29:02.808 --> 02:29:07.330]  Monsanto... It's a sort of third world war, isn't it?
[02:29:07.330 --> 02:29:09.231]  It's the governments versus the people.
[02:29:09.231 --> 02:29:10.331]  It's truly extraordinary.
[02:29:11.147 --> 02:29:12.048]  Wow, we're going to go to break.
[02:29:12.048 --> 02:29:18.273]  Long segment coming up, and I want to then get into what's happening at Fukushima itself.
[02:29:18.273 --> 02:29:20.214]  But it is.
[02:29:20.214 --> 02:29:31.843]  It's like a bunch of crazy governments and corporations above the law, not in control of themselves, just on total power trips, who don't even care about their grandchildren.
[02:29:31.843 --> 02:29:36.207]  Dr. Busby, what's the best place for people to visit to see all your scientific papers and work?
[02:29:37.258 --> 02:29:50.273]  My green audit website is www.greenaudit.org and there's also a very good website which I'm associated with called the Low-Level Radiation Campaign website which is www... Great, great, stay there.
[02:29:50.273 --> 02:29:50.893]  We're on the run.
[02:29:50.893 --> 02:29:51.674]  We'll give it on the other side.
[02:29:51.674 --> 02:29:54.197]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.197 --> 02:29:56.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:09.354]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:30:09.354 --> 02:30:13.597]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[02:32:11.741 --> 02:32:16.667]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:32:16.667 --> 02:32:18.850]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:32:18.850 --> 02:32:19.471]  If every one of
[02:32:19.531 --> 02:32:20.312]  We're good to go.

[02:33:12.611 --> 02:33:16.953]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:16.953 --> 02:33:27.197]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:27.197 --> 02:33:28.978]  Boy, we are riders on the storm!
[02:33:30.168 --> 02:33:31.410]  There is no doubt about that.
[02:33:31.410 --> 02:33:39.380]  Up on screen at InfoWars.com, we have a link to a National Geographic story.
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:41.542]  Latest radioactive leak in Fukushima.
[02:33:41.542 --> 02:33:42.483]  How is it different?
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:46.342]  So that's how they report it.
[02:33:46.342 --> 02:33:53.866]  And then I've got all the different mainstream, you name it, saying, you know, Fukushima leak is much worse than we were led to believe.
[02:33:53.866 --> 02:34:07.854]  That's a BBC, Huffington Post, radioactive groundwater nears the sea, Fukushima endgame, the water has nowhere to go, going to the, Fukushima inspectors careless.
[02:34:08.948 --> 02:34:12.310]  Most of the Fukushima 50 are dead or dying, including the director.
[02:34:12.310 --> 02:34:14.251]  But it's not bad for you, Ann Coulter says.
[02:34:14.251 --> 02:34:16.832]  See, when Ann Coulter first said that, I thought, man, she's gone crazy.
[02:34:16.832 --> 02:34:19.794]  But it turned out that was a talking point.
[02:34:19.794 --> 02:34:22.816]  And see, my issue here is people say, why are you worried about radiation?
[02:34:22.816 --> 02:34:25.337]  You don't agree with the environmentalists on a lot of stuff.
[02:34:25.337 --> 02:34:28.199]  I'm a real conservationist environmentalist, OK?
[02:34:28.199 --> 02:34:30.660]  I don't want toxic waste in my food and water.
[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:36.964]  I don't like GMO because I've got unlimited studies and know how bad it is and know farmers that feed it to their cows and it kills them.
[02:34:38.052 --> 02:34:40.734]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[02:34:40.734 --> 02:34:42.715]  And then I read about the groups that are putting these out.
[02:34:42.715 --> 02:34:44.156]  It's about population reduction.
[02:34:44.156 --> 02:34:45.437]  And then you kind of get the answer.
[02:34:45.437 --> 02:34:48.238]  They don't care whatever they do, because it's not even to reduce population.
[02:34:48.238 --> 02:34:50.720]  It's like an anti-human thing.
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:52.941]  It's psychopathic.
[02:34:52.941 --> 02:34:57.064]  And you talk about carbon dioxide and what we're doing.
[02:34:57.064 --> 02:35:00.066]  You can argue all day what carbon dioxide is doing to the earth.
[02:35:00.066 --> 02:35:03.268]  The point is they want a carbon tax for the elites to get real rich.
[02:35:05.172 --> 02:35:09.545]  The first people to push that were Ken Lay and Al Gore from Enron.
[02:35:10.362 --> 02:35:17.687]  But if they do something about the reactors and the GMO and all that, and then came to me and said, we really think carbon dioxide is a big issue, then I'd listen to them.
[02:35:17.687 --> 02:35:19.828]  But I've gone and looked at all the big threats.
[02:35:19.828 --> 02:35:22.930]  It's radiation, GMO.
[02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:27.673]  Then there's stuff like overfishing that I know is real and, you know, overcutting of things.
[02:35:27.673 --> 02:35:29.815]  I mean, there's a lot of real stuff.
[02:35:29.815 --> 02:35:32.937]  The problem is none of these big corporations want to do anything about that.
[02:35:32.937 --> 02:35:39.481]  They just want to run around and have carbon taxes because it doesn't affect what they're doing because they can just tax everybody.
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:44.144]  And the only reason I raise that is because you look at what's going on with Fukushima.
[02:35:44.144 --> 02:35:51.673]  In the last month, all the alternative media and Dr. Busby and others have said, this is getting serious.
[02:35:51.673 --> 02:35:54.156]  And then now it's strange that he's on today.
[02:35:54.156 --> 02:35:55.998]  Suddenly it's breaking in the mainstream media.
[02:35:56.599 --> 02:36:00.442]  Other than Japanese media, they were admitting it a few weeks ago, that this is very serious.
[02:36:00.442 --> 02:36:04.024]  So, you're a physicist, you've studied this, your team has been there.
[02:36:04.024 --> 02:36:06.987]  What's really happening with the reactors?
[02:36:06.987 --> 02:36:08.888]  Why are people so scared?
[02:36:08.888 --> 02:36:12.190]  And how are they saying this is going to be much worse than what's already happened?
[02:36:12.190 --> 02:36:14.712]  Is that accurate?
[02:36:14.712 --> 02:36:20.156]  Well, it is going to be much worse than has already happened, if certain things happen.
[02:36:20.156 --> 02:36:25.380]  But I can't really see any way of stopping those things happen, so I'm afraid I don't have a very
[02:36:26.321 --> 02:36:30.905]  Positive outlook with regard to all of this, but I should start by saying that I always said it was serious.
[02:36:30.905 --> 02:36:37.630]  What's happening now is people are slowly cottoning on to the fact that everyone that was talking about it was covering it all up.
[02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:53.622]  And now it's becoming increasingly clear, and in the future will be increasingly more clear, that all along it was very serious, right from the very beginning, from the first explosions, which threw all the bits and pieces of reactor and fuel rods and whatnot up in the air where they went pitter-patter onto the ground.
[02:36:54.723 --> 02:37:10.334]  And the fact that the pressure vessels themselves are holed and material has gone through the pressure vessel into the ground, we don't know how much, but the whole of the area around it is radioactive because the fuel is out of the box that it was in.
[02:37:10.334 --> 02:37:11.615]  That's the problem.
[02:37:11.615 --> 02:37:18.340]  Now we hear all about how the water is leaking into the Pacific Ocean and how could the water be radioactive?
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.986]  When they've gone to such lengths to ensure that it can't get to the Pacific Ocean and it can't be radioactive.
[02:37:24.986 --> 02:37:43.443]  The fact is, it was always radioactive because all of this stuff fell into the ground and the groundwater soaked it up and the huge amounts of water that were pumped in there to keep the thing cool and are still being pumped in to keep the thing cool are leaking out through holes in the pressure vessel, leaking out through the spent fuel tank holes and so on.
[02:37:44.203 --> 02:37:49.687]  Um, and contaminating the ground, and that water is inevitably going to get back to the sea.
[02:37:49.687 --> 02:37:53.410]  This is, it's impossible for them to not, to stop it from getting to the sea.
[02:37:53.410 --> 02:37:55.131]  It's like trying to push water uphill.
[02:37:55.131 --> 02:38:07.961]  And back when it happened, you pointed out that when you can eject those fuel rods, when the MOX reactor blew up that has the plutonium in it, it shot them, a letter to the New York Times had to admit, two miles away
[02:38:08.721 --> 02:38:11.806]  And they had to have bulldozers just cover it up where it's at.
[02:38:11.806 --> 02:38:12.146]  Why not?
[02:38:12.146 --> 02:38:13.749]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:38:13.749 --> 02:38:15.171]  It's right on the ocean.
[02:38:15.171 --> 02:38:18.015]  All that debris has now hit the U.S.
[02:38:18.015 --> 02:38:19.036]  It's hitting Canada.
[02:38:19.864 --> 02:38:21.625]  And their answer is, it's not bad for you.
[02:38:21.625 --> 02:38:22.865]  Please continue.
[02:38:22.865 --> 02:38:36.309]  Yes, well, I have to say that although it is bad for you, it's not the kind of Armageddon, the dilution of this material into the Pacific is not the Armageddon that some people have been saying.
[02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:44.571]  So as far as the concentration of this stuff is concerned, in terms of the Pacific coast of America,
[02:38:45.231 --> 02:38:50.874]  There will certainly be increases there and the fish will become more radioactive than they were before and so on.
[02:38:50.874 --> 02:39:01.381]  But the levels of radioactivity in the fish are not going to be so enormously high that they would constitute a sort of totally disastrous scenario.
[02:39:01.381 --> 02:39:05.143]  What is far more, and this is because the Pacific contains about 300 million cubic kilometers of water.
[02:39:09.045 --> 02:39:23.214]  Now, I know it's not going to all dilute into the water uniformly, and so there are going to be concentrations in the various currents that flow north across to the United States, and then the surface drift that takes the stuff across the United States by the water.
[02:39:23.214 --> 02:39:26.736]  But by the time it gets to the coast, it will be very much diluted.
[02:39:27.476 --> 02:39:32.980]  And it will certainly contaminate the coast, and the coast will have an effect on the people living there.
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:35.842]  But they're not all going to suddenly drop dead.
[02:39:35.842 --> 02:39:38.183]  What is much more serious is what they're now doing.
[02:39:38.183 --> 02:39:54.674]  Because what has happened is, as a result of the vast amounts of water that they've pumped into these things to keep them cool, and they're still pumping into them to keep them cool, the whole of the land, and this is how I see it, of course they never tell you this, you have to sort of deduce it all in some kind of Sherlock Holmesian way,
[02:39:55.674 --> 02:39:58.596]  The land around these reactors has become soggy.
[02:39:58.596 --> 02:40:03.279]  It's filled up with water and water's getting into the Pacific and the whole thing is like some sort of marsh.
[02:40:03.279 --> 02:40:07.662]  Now the problem with that is that these reactors themselves are enormously heavy.
[02:40:07.662 --> 02:40:11.725]  And so they're going to sink into the marsh and they're going to lose stability and possibly collapse.
[02:40:11.725 --> 02:40:15.508]  Now if that happens, the main problem is Reactor 4.
[02:40:15.508 --> 02:40:18.870]  Because there's a tank there, as you know, which contains about 1,300 plus spent fuel elements.
[02:40:23.988 --> 02:40:29.150]  Inside this tank, which have to be continually kept warm, the tank has to be kept full of water.
[02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:44.777]  And if the tank breaks, which it would do if it slid sideways and lost its structural integrity, then these fuel rods will then catch fire and might even melt and explode, which is what I believed happened originally when there was the first explosion.
[02:40:44.977 --> 02:40:46.318]  Well, sure, you were proven right.
[02:40:46.318 --> 02:40:53.142]  I mean, Mainline News admitted that they picked up the isotopes that meant that the, uh, what is it, fission had happened?
[02:40:53.142 --> 02:40:54.943]  Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.
[02:40:54.943 --> 02:40:56.864]  Well, it's fissioning now all the time.
[02:40:56.864 --> 02:41:03.388]  I mean, we know there's fissioning there, because these short, half-lived isotopes are being detected.
[02:41:03.388 --> 02:41:03.768]  Sure, sure.
[02:41:03.768 --> 02:41:05.809]  Why are they calling it a new leak now?
[02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:14.374]  Because you were saying this months ago that it was obviously leaking, and now they admit that it's leaking and that it's getting soggy and that it is going to sink into the ground, and then I guess they can't keep
[02:41:15.915 --> 02:41:22.899]  Well, because they're measuring, because people are now measuring the radioactivity, the radionuclides in the seawater on the coast.
[02:41:22.899 --> 02:41:27.541]  And they can't say that, and they have to admit it, because that's the only place it could be coming from.
[02:41:27.541 --> 02:41:34.425]  So what they've done is, I think, probably invented this idea that these tanks are leaking, these enormous numbers of tanks that they've got there.
[02:41:34.425 --> 02:41:35.286]  You've seen the pictures.
[02:41:35.826 --> 02:41:46.454]  And so the only way that it can get to the sea within the, you know, having told all the lies that they've told, they've got to continue to make up new lies in order to justify the original lies.
[02:41:46.454 --> 02:41:48.076]  And they're saying, well, these tanks are leaking.
[02:41:48.076 --> 02:41:51.358]  But of course, they can't find any leaks in the tanks, but they're still looking.
[02:41:51.358 --> 02:41:53.420]  Of course, nothing to do with the tanks leaking.
[02:41:53.420 --> 02:42:03.668]  It's the fact that the whole area around it is saturated with radionuclides as a result of the original explosions and the bulldozing of the old fuel elements and the holes in
[02:42:04.228 --> 02:42:08.852]  In the reactors and probably a sort of minor China syndrome, although it's not China.
[02:42:08.852 --> 02:42:12.855]  In fact, if you go to the other end of the earth, it's Buenos Aires, Argentina.
[02:42:12.855 --> 02:42:14.657]  So that's the Buenos Aires syndrome.
[02:42:14.657 --> 02:42:15.017]  Sure, sure.
[02:42:15.017 --> 02:42:26.967]  Well, explain the type of explosion that you documented happened in Russia and the Russians documented that you then believed happened there and then later the evidence came out of the nuclei that show the reaction happened.
[02:42:26.967 --> 02:42:27.968]  Explain that to us, doctor.
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:40.129]  Well, there are various kinds of arguments that were brought forward to say that there was a hydrogen explosion, and we know that there is a hydrogen explosion.
[02:42:40.129 --> 02:42:43.212]  But in Chernobyl, a number of scientists who were in St.
[02:42:43.212 --> 02:42:49.777]  Petersburg actually measured a ratio of xenon isotopes, which enable us to tell whether it's a nuclear explosion or whether it's a
[02:42:50.477 --> 02:42:51.038]  I don't know.
[02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:10.194]  They have detection places all over the world for this.
[02:43:10.194 --> 02:43:18.222]  CBC, CBTO or something, you know, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, have measurement sites all over the place.
[02:43:18.222 --> 02:43:25.209]  And so eventually they can actually detect the concentrations of these isotopes that enable you to tell whether it's a nuclear explosion or not.
[02:43:25.209 --> 02:43:26.250]  And in the case of Chernobyl,
[02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:33.913]  It certainly was, because the ratio of these isosopes showed that there was a nuclear explosion, and it wasn't a hydrogen explosion at all.
[02:43:33.913 --> 02:43:38.295]  Although a hydrogen explosion did follow, of course, because there's lots of hydrogen there.
[02:43:38.295 --> 02:43:41.816]  Now, I think that that Reactor 4 explosion was a nuclear explosion.
[02:43:41.816 --> 02:43:52.980]  I think what happened is that the tank ran dry, there was a meltdown of a significant proportion of the fuel elements in the tank, the Reactor 4 tank, this one that's got a huge amount of radioactivity in it.
[02:43:52.980 --> 02:43:54.481]  Incidentally, half of the entire
[02:43:55.337 --> 02:43:55.558]  Uh, uh,
[02:44:14.858 --> 02:44:15.238]  We're good.
[02:44:35.575 --> 02:44:41.359]  Is to keep that thing from losing its water and then subsequently melting down.
[02:44:41.359 --> 02:44:48.204]  What I think happened was that there was a distillation of the plutonium from the plutonium parts of those spent fuel rods.
[02:44:48.204 --> 02:44:52.026]  And the critical mass of plutonium is about 9 kilograms.
[02:44:52.026 --> 02:44:57.630]  Now 9 kilograms, because plutonium is so dense, is represented by a quantity of plutonium about the size of an apple.
[02:44:58.422 --> 02:44:59.423]  Or maybe two apples.
[02:44:59.423 --> 02:45:00.664]  But anyway, not very much.
[02:45:00.664 --> 02:45:05.307]  So if that lot gets together, there's an enormous bang, and everything goes up in the air.
[02:45:28.843 --> 02:45:33.407]  That they would never, you know, have a problem if they got hit by a tsunami.
[02:45:33.407 --> 02:45:34.768]  And then obviously they did.
[02:45:34.768 --> 02:45:37.491]  And now they're saying don't worry.
[02:45:37.491 --> 02:45:42.676]  Dr. Busby, I want to give the number out for people that are in Japan who have Vonage or IP phones.
[02:45:42.676 --> 02:45:43.456]  They can call us 800-259-9231.
[02:45:43.456 --> 02:45:45.718]  800-259-9231 and give us their take on what it's like.
[02:45:52.825 --> 02:46:18.113]  uh... living in this in the kids dropping dead in the cancers exploding in the deformed animals that are being born insect and plant and animal i mean it's just amazing eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one and i'm trying to pull up an actual number to the network for folks to call direct uh... so i cannot give that out to people my guys are pointing it out to me now other as they put the number up it's up uh... your country code oh one one and then one
[02:46:19.053 --> 02:46:22.435]  6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-5-5-1-6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-5-5 to call us direct from Japan and give us your take on that.
[02:46:22.435 --> 02:46:23.856]  But sir, what should I do?
[02:46:23.856 --> 02:46:25.137]  Because I saw the reports, Dr. Busby, of
[02:46:38.112 --> 02:46:46.936]  Milk on the West Coast and surface vegetables having 10, 20, 30, 40 times, depending on the isotope, safe levels.
[02:46:46.936 --> 02:46:49.737]  Milk as far away as Vermont having higher levels.
[02:46:49.737 --> 02:46:52.738]  And it was always, just don't worry, this radiation isn't bad for you.
[02:46:52.738 --> 02:46:56.880]  So I went back and looked at old literature and they said it's very bad, don't drink it, don't eat it.
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:05.143]  I looked at the plume coming in over Texas, you know, not very high levels according to many experts, but still, my wife's like, do we go to the Southern Hemisphere?
[02:47:05.763 --> 02:47:09.729]  If this thing blows up, they'll obviously say it's safe, no big deal.
[02:47:09.729 --> 02:47:21.185]  How long do I need to take, you know, nascent iodine, they say is the best or whatever, or do I move my wife and children to Chile or something for a few years?
[02:47:21.185 --> 02:47:22.527]  What would you do, Dr. Busby?
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:29.841]  Yes, I think if it did blow up, I would be inclined to get out of the path of the fallout.
[02:47:29.841 --> 02:47:46.664]  And so that means because the winds blow north and south from the equator, and as we know from the concentrations of radionuclides that came down after the nuclear weapons testing in the 60s, we know that in the southern hemisphere the concentrations are lower than they are in the northern hemisphere.
[02:47:46.664 --> 02:47:50.605]  So yes, if that did happen, and let's hope it doesn't happen,
[02:47:51.204 --> 02:48:01.394]  Because they are trying to pull the fuel rods out and do something about it, although God knows how they're going to succeed in doing that.
[02:48:01.394 --> 02:48:06.498]  But if it does happen, and if it gets bad, well, then I think it's time to head for the hills, Alex.
[02:48:06.498 --> 02:48:06.719]  Yes.
[02:48:07.563 --> 02:48:10.805]  And of course we know from Chernobyl it circled the Earth and came back to England.
[02:48:10.805 --> 02:48:23.293]  We know that from the using DU bombardments the last two Gulf Wars, I know universities picked up the DU in England and in France and I remember the professors got in trouble there for warning people.
[02:48:23.293 --> 02:48:25.594]  I mean, what about folks in Europe?
[02:48:28.396 --> 02:48:44.374]  Well, Europe is much further again, and so if you like to see it in this way, it would be like Japan would be 10, and the United States would be like 3, and Europe would probably be 1.
[02:48:45.547 --> 02:48:48.149]  Uh, on that sort of level, very, very roughly.
[02:48:48.149 --> 02:49:02.536]  And, uh, and it would be a sort of repeat, only worse, of the atmospheric weapons testing of the period 1952 to 1963, which was absolutely terrible.
[02:49:02.536 --> 02:49:05.738]  I mean, the large bombs that were being exploded in the atmosphere then
[02:49:06.198 --> 02:49:12.824]  Rained down enormous quantities of uranium and strontium-90 and cesium and all of this stuff which we're talking about now.
[02:49:12.824 --> 02:49:15.867]  And that caused the cancer epidemic, the one that started in the 1980s.
[02:49:15.867 --> 02:49:21.031]  And by the way, for those that don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, those were fractions of what's at this giant nuclear waste dump.
[02:49:21.031 --> 02:49:25.715]  I get so many people that send me emails or comments going, Alex, we did all the nuclear testing.
[02:49:25.715 --> 02:49:29.419]  Those were huge explosions that blew up whole, you know, islands.
[02:49:29.419 --> 02:49:31.821]  Why are you worried about a small explosion they don't get?
[02:49:32.421 --> 02:49:38.164]  A cleaner explosion where most of it is destroyed in an atom bomb or a hydrogen bomb.
[02:49:38.164 --> 02:49:40.445]  They don't understand how dirty reactors are.
[02:49:40.445 --> 02:49:44.027]  Can you explain why this is so dangerous to people?
[02:49:44.027 --> 02:49:51.331]  Well, at the moment I have to say that I think that the weapons fallout was very serious.
[02:49:51.331 --> 02:49:54.373]  No, no, I know it's bad, but I'm saying compared to something like this.
[02:49:54.373 --> 02:49:54.933]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:49:56.107 --> 02:50:02.212]  Well, compared to something like this, there's a lot more stuff if the whole lot of this went up.
[02:50:02.212 --> 02:50:05.895]  But the thing is that it won't go up in the same way as the weapons fallout.
[02:50:05.895 --> 02:50:09.358]  Weapons fallout went up into the stratosphere and circled the Earth.
[02:50:09.358 --> 02:50:14.141]  But this probably won't do that, because the explosion won't be a kind of megaton explosion.
[02:50:14.141 --> 02:50:16.223]  It will just be a local explosion.
[02:50:16.223 --> 02:50:19.206]  So a lot of that stuff will go into the Pacific.
[02:50:19.206 --> 02:50:20.787]  It won't go up high enough to be
[02:50:21.267 --> 02:50:27.733]  to be taken right the way across the Pacific, all of it, and I don't think all of it will go up as well, that's the other thing.
[02:50:27.733 --> 02:50:29.114]  But I mean, it won't be good.
[02:50:29.114 --> 02:50:42.626]  So I don't think that you should say that this, or anyone should say that this is going to be so terribly much more than the weapons fallout, but we really don't know, because it might all go up, and if it does all go up, then who knows, because there is an awful lot of it.
[02:50:42.626 --> 02:50:46.589]  There's more of it than in the weapons fallout anyway, but not a lot more.
[02:50:46.589 --> 02:50:47.029]  Wow!
[02:50:47.029 --> 02:50:47.990]  That's quite bad.
[02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.531]  Amazing!
[02:50:49.291 --> 02:50:52.534]  Usually when we open this up during Fukushima, we get tons of calls from Japan.
[02:50:52.534 --> 02:50:55.576]  We're only getting a few coming in right now.
[02:50:55.576 --> 02:50:58.719]  800-259-9231.
[02:50:58.719 --> 02:51:01.221]  Japan, South Korea, we want your take on this.
[02:51:01.221 --> 02:51:03.583]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
[02:51:03.583 --> 02:51:07.346]  Amino acids have to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them.
[02:51:07.346 --> 02:51:10.188]  If they are to be used to create new proteins in your body.
[02:51:10.188 --> 02:51:18.195]  Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:51:18.715 --> 02:51:23.477]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:51:23.477 --> 02:51:27.619]  One World Whey is an undamaged amino acid food, unlike any other.
[02:51:27.619 --> 02:51:35.763]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids, and all whey protein powders we've investigated, and most proteins you consume, are heated.
[02:51:35.763 --> 02:51:39.665]  With our TrueCool™ process, you now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:51:39.665 --> 02:51:41.906]  My name is Daniel, I'm 34 years old.
[02:51:41.906 --> 02:51:44.787]  When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:51:44.787 --> 02:51:44.847]  Now,
[02:51:46.528 --> 02:51:48.829]  After two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds.
[02:51:48.829 --> 02:51:50.830]  This is my ideal weight.
[02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:55.831]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:51:55.831 --> 02:51:57.372]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:52:01.513 --> 02:52:09.016]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:52:09.016 --> 02:52:12.718]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:52:12.718 --> 02:52:18.541]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:52:19.417 --> 02:52:30.650]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:34.794]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:52:35.535 --> 02:52:44.197]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:52:44.197 --> 02:52:48.058]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[02:52:48.058 --> 02:52:50.499]  It's something much darker.
[02:52:50.499 --> 02:52:56.181]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:52:56.181 --> 02:53:00.602]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:53:00.602 --> 02:53:04.603]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.365 --> 02:53:08.388]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.388 --> 02:53:17.378]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.378 --> 02:53:22.283]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:22.916 --> 02:53:34.288]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.288 --> 02:53:41.295]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:41.955 --> 02:53:42.115]  Well...
[02:54:05.663 --> 02:54:07.344]  You can't ever say this about my show.
[02:54:07.344 --> 02:54:08.524]  No calls from Japan.
[02:54:08.524 --> 02:54:12.266]  I bet I guess Decker and Fukushima, they weren't getting real news, they were all listening.
[02:54:12.266 --> 02:54:15.768]  We could just load the phones for hours with callers from Japan.
[02:54:15.768 --> 02:54:18.869]  Americans, Europeans living there, but also natives of Japan.
[02:54:20.930 --> 02:54:30.559]  A few minutes left in this segment, a little bit into overdrive for calls for Dr. Busby, who's a leading researcher and physicist dealing with nuclear fallout and problems from it.
[02:54:30.559 --> 02:54:34.862]  He's proven to be very accurate in the last few years since Fukushima in his predictions.
[02:54:34.862 --> 02:54:37.325]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 for a few questions on the subject here.
[02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:48.395]  Some of my crew ran back again and said, ask him about Japan saying, smile and it will protect you.
[02:54:48.395 --> 02:55:03.689]  I think we already pretty much covered that, but what do you make of some of the green movements trying to proliferate the answer to pollution is building more local nuclear substations in every city.
[02:55:03.689 --> 02:55:05.371]  That sounds like a horrible idea to me.
[02:55:07.627 --> 02:55:09.668]  It is a horrible idea.
[02:55:09.668 --> 02:55:16.312]  The whole idea of doing any nuclear energy reactors anywhere is a horrible idea.
[02:55:16.312 --> 02:55:18.153]  I don't know how anybody can imagine
[02:55:19.168 --> 02:55:33.057]  After what's happened in Chernobyl and what's now happened in Fukushima, that there is any sense in continuing using this dreadfully dangerous technology for creating energy.
[02:55:33.057 --> 02:55:35.459]  It just seems totally absurd.
[02:55:35.459 --> 02:55:42.264]  But the green movement has been penetrated by all sorts of columnists and so forth, as I know.
[02:55:45.466 --> 02:56:01.529]  I was in the Green Party for many years and I could see then, and I saw in Europe when I was working for the Policy Information Network on Child Health and Environment, you can actually identify the people coming in and skewing the direction of the discourse.
[02:56:02.270 --> 02:56:08.372]  So we know that these people exist and we know that they're paid to, if you like, attack me on the internet.
[02:56:08.372 --> 02:56:17.115]  Another good example, you know, I had a whole load of shills and trolls and people writing things into my Wikipedia entry and attacking me in various ways and so forth.
[02:56:17.735 --> 02:56:21.539]  So let's not get too worked up about the Green Movement.
[02:56:21.539 --> 02:56:24.581]  The Green Movement, like any other movement, can be controlled.
[02:56:24.581 --> 02:56:25.262]  Sure, sure.
[02:56:25.262 --> 02:56:37.232]  I mean, my only point is, how can the establishment let this go on when they know it's always having problems, they don't even care now, reactors are leaking like never before?
[02:56:37.232 --> 02:56:37.973]  Hello?
[02:56:37.973 --> 02:56:39.294]  Don't they care about their grandkids?
[02:56:39.294 --> 02:56:42.837]  I mean, this is not a suicide pact to be in control.
[02:56:45.031 --> 02:56:47.012]  I mean, what's the point of this?
[02:56:47.012 --> 02:56:51.396]  While they suppress new technologies?
[02:56:51.396 --> 02:56:58.921]  We have to distinguish between the concept of the establishment and people within the establishment.
[02:56:58.921 --> 02:57:02.263]  I mean, the establishment is only a number of people.
[02:57:02.263 --> 02:57:04.025]  I mean, at the end of the day, they've got names.
[02:57:04.025 --> 02:57:08.608]  Like I said, Lars-Erik Holm is the Medical Officer of Health for Sweden.
[02:57:08.608 --> 02:57:11.430]  So there are individuals in all of these
[02:57:11.550 --> 02:57:12.310]  We're good to go.
[02:57:41.741 --> 02:57:49.064]  Or else being just an ordinary bloke, you know, who doesn't have... But what is the point of ruling if you wreck everything?
[02:57:49.064 --> 02:57:53.005]  I just don't get these people that... I don't get it.
[02:57:53.005 --> 02:57:55.026]  I just don't get it.
[02:57:55.026 --> 02:57:57.767]  I think it's a personality thing, Alex.
[02:57:57.767 --> 02:58:01.168]  You know, you have to see it as different personalities.
[02:58:01.168 --> 02:58:02.949]  There are different personalities.
[02:58:02.949 --> 02:58:07.471]  And some personalities are dangerous to put in charge.
[02:58:07.471 --> 02:58:10.792]  And unfortunately, democracy throws these people up as leaders.
[02:58:11.817 --> 02:58:13.877]  Because they'll lie to everybody and tell us what we want to hear.
[02:58:13.877 --> 02:58:18.738]  I think it comes down to we have been a lazy, disposable society as well.
[02:58:18.738 --> 02:58:20.659]  I mean, just look at how unhealthy we are.
[02:58:20.659 --> 02:58:21.119]  Everything.
[02:58:21.119 --> 02:58:22.339]  I'm not on some high horse either.
[02:58:22.339 --> 02:58:23.719]  I'm just as bad as the next person.
[02:58:23.719 --> 02:58:29.940]  But my goodness, any idiot knows these reactors are just melting down and leaking everywhere.
[02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:31.000]  Cancer's exploding.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.621]  We're going to come back with a quick little five-minute segment.
[02:58:33.621 --> 02:58:34.581]  Now we have loaded phones.
[02:58:34.581 --> 02:58:38.102]  I think some calls from Japan, of course, because we're running out of time.
[02:58:38.102 --> 02:58:39.042]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:58:42.625 --> 02:58:45.627]  By the way, I'll be back live this Sunday, folks, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:45.627 --> 02:58:48.108]  Central, with the Sunday Show.
[02:58:48.108 --> 02:58:48.889]  Follow us on Twitter.
[02:58:48.889 --> 02:58:50.370]  A bunch of new stories at InfoWars.com.

[02:59:52.028 --> 02:59:55.638]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.638 --> 02:59:58.846]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.799 --> 03:00:07.100]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:08.881]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.881 --> 03:00:10.622]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.622 --> 03:00:12.202]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.202 --> 03:00:13.763]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.763 --> 03:00:15.224]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.224 --> 03:00:15.644]  Yep.
[03:00:15.644 --> 03:00:17.045]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.045 --> 03:00:17.966]  We're back live.
[03:00:17.966 --> 03:00:22.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.968 --> 03:00:28.471]  University panel discusses cutting off food, bioweapons to reduce population.
[03:00:28.471 --> 03:00:29.472]  They're already doing it with the DU.
[03:00:31.378 --> 03:00:37.121]  And I've got a bunch of stories I don't have enough time to get to that just went up on FLWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:37.121 --> 03:00:39.563]  By the way, Dr. Busley, we have hard breaks because of satellites.
[03:00:39.563 --> 03:00:43.465]  You got cut off earlier trying to give out the website for the LLRC.
[03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:47.747]  Give that out, then we'll jam in a few final questions here for you.
[03:00:47.747 --> 03:00:48.648]  Yeah, right.
[03:00:48.648 --> 03:00:49.848]  That's the website, LLRC.org.
[03:00:51.654 --> 03:00:55.337]  And the other one, as I said, was greenaudit.org.
[03:00:55.337 --> 03:01:03.063]  And also, we have one called nuclearjustice.org, which is also a development now.
[03:01:03.063 --> 03:01:10.108]  We're hoping that people will help us to take petitions to the European Parliament and to other organizations.
[03:01:10.108 --> 03:01:12.070]  Well, there is a madness, and I mark it from 1990.
[03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:14.372]  They knew the DU couldn't be used.
[03:01:14.372 --> 03:01:15.612]  All the reports said it.
[03:01:15.612 --> 03:01:16.493]  They just said, you know what?
[03:01:16.493 --> 03:01:17.174]  It's good for you now.
[03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:22.334]  Uh, and they just don't, I mean, it was first, oh, wash your hands and wear a mask.
[03:01:22.334 --> 03:01:24.396]  Now it's like, eh, don't worry about it.
[03:01:24.396 --> 03:01:26.838]  Uh, let's go ahead and take a phone call.
[03:01:26.838 --> 03:01:27.619]  Mike?
[03:01:27.619 --> 03:01:28.740]  No, no, first off, it's Chris.
[03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:29.841]  Chris in Florida.
[03:01:29.841 --> 03:01:30.402]  You're on the air.
[03:01:30.402 --> 03:01:31.623]  Quick question for Dr. Busby.
[03:01:32.892 --> 03:01:40.895]  Well, Dr. Mosby, what do you think of the idea of using certain kinds of lasers for selectively increasing the speed of radioactive isotope decay?
[03:01:40.895 --> 03:01:51.359]  I found a study from University of Finland, Laser Enhanced Radioactive Decay and Selective Transmutation of Nuclei, and there are others.
[03:01:51.359 --> 03:01:52.399]  But what do you think of that idea?
[03:01:53.769 --> 03:02:06.212]  I think that it would be interesting to do some experiments to see if it's possible to do this, but my feeling is that it's not, and that these sorts of experiments and this sort of approach
[03:02:07.117 --> 03:02:12.900]  Actually, we'll probably end up with producing more radioactivity, or at least more dispersion of radioactivity.
[03:02:12.900 --> 03:02:17.642]  There's a system which they want to build in Sweden now for doing this kind of thing.
[03:02:17.642 --> 03:02:35.411]  And the problem is that when you build this system, you then have to bring all the radioactivity, all the radioactive waste there, and in that very process, you create all sorts of possibilities for... So the best thing is to find a place in the middle of the desert that doesn't have fault lines and seal it in concrete?
[03:02:35.911 --> 03:02:36.952]  That's right, that's right.
[03:02:36.952 --> 03:02:43.614]  Leave it alone and put a fence around it and watch it for the rest of eternity.
[03:02:43.614 --> 03:02:46.136]  That's my... Alright, great question, caller.
[03:02:46.136 --> 03:02:51.238]  For Fukushima, how do you get enough lasers in there to like... I mean, how many hundreds of thousands of fuel rods are there, doctor?
[03:02:52.210 --> 03:02:52.991]  There's 1,300.
[03:02:52.991 --> 03:03:01.318]  There's approximately 240 tons of fuel in reactor 4, which represents 1 and 20 noughts of Becquerels.
[03:03:01.318 --> 03:03:07.703]  And you could say that in terms of explosive power, if it all went off, you can say one megaton per ton of uranium.
[03:03:07.703 --> 03:03:12.187]  So you've got approximately 240 megatons of explosives there.
[03:03:12.187 --> 03:03:14.569]  So we're talking about quite a lot of stuff.
[03:03:14.569 --> 03:03:16.771]  Is a 240 megaton bigger than any bomb they've built?
[03:03:17.512 --> 03:03:21.817]  Yes, but if you add all the bombs together, it comes to quite a lot of megatons.
[03:03:21.817 --> 03:03:24.000]  And it won't, of course it won't go off like that.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.323]  Sure, sure, but it's a disaster, it's unbelievable.
[03:03:26.323 --> 03:03:29.266]  Just giving you a sort of rough idea of what there is there.
[03:03:29.266 --> 03:03:34.493]  Sure, but aren't they storing like 500 plus thousand rods there at the facility?
[03:03:35.982 --> 03:03:41.645]  The number of rods in the Reactor 4 vessel is 1,300 rods.
[03:03:41.645 --> 03:03:45.527]  No, but I meant the whole facility storing a bunch, right?
[03:03:45.527 --> 03:03:48.588]  Oh, it's probably about twice as much as that if you take the whole.
[03:03:48.588 --> 03:03:54.891]  So in terms of total quantity of material, about half of it is in the Reactor 4 tank.
[03:03:54.891 --> 03:03:57.812]  Because I remember reading the news press reports of how much waste was there.
[03:03:57.812 --> 03:03:59.233]  It was some astronomical amount.
[03:03:59.233 --> 03:04:00.974]  Real fast, Mike in Tennessee, quick question.
[03:04:03.187 --> 03:04:04.508]  Good afternoon, yes.
[03:04:04.508 --> 03:04:09.993]  The problem I see is that the trade winds, the prevailing winds, run clockwise on the northern hemisphere.
[03:04:09.993 --> 03:04:14.036]  They run counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere, which actually acts as a protection.
[03:04:14.036 --> 03:04:22.624]  So I can see why the Bushes ten years ago would buy up vast tracts of land over the aquifers in South America to get ahead of the... Yeah, Paraguay.
[03:04:22.624 --> 03:04:28.429]  Actually, my dad was down there on a charity thing, and the Bushes have companies everywhere and have actually moved down there.
[03:04:29.588 --> 03:04:43.301]  The reason people do this, Alex, you know, they're Luciferian, and it's just like the old girl, if I can't have him, nobody else can, so they just destroy what they can't totally control, and there's too many free-will people in the United States, so might as well destroy them.
[03:04:43.301 --> 03:04:45.222]  Yeah, whatever, whatever it is, it's evil.
[03:04:45.222 --> 03:04:48.746]  Dr. Busby, thank you so much for spending time with us, look forward to talking to you again.
[03:04:48.746 --> 03:04:53.110]  Hopefully things will not be explosive, like you've said, and we appreciate your time.
[03:04:54.261 --> 03:04:55.804]  Fingers crossed, Alex.
[03:04:55.804 --> 03:04:56.646]  Fingers crossed.
[03:04:56.646 --> 03:04:58.009]  Yeah, everybody say a prayer.
[03:04:58.009 --> 03:04:58.950]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:59.752]  Back Sunday.
