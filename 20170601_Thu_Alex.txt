[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  We've got a long way to go, and there's a short time to get there, time is kind of just what
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  no man can run.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  Give me liberty, or give me death.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Let it all hang out cause we got a run to pick.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  And there's beer in Texarkana.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  We'll bring it.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  We'll bring it back to us.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  We'll bring it back to us.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Great Jerry Reed.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  We'll bring it back to us.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  He's found it down, put it up and truck it.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  We got a long way to go.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.960]  Got a long way to go.
[00:42.960 --> 00:45.000]  And there's a short time to get there.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  Time is kind of just what no man can run.
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can officially say that this date,
[00:56.000 --> 01:11.000]  This date, June 1st, 2017, is one of the most important dates in world history.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.560]  When Trump was sworn in on the 20th of this year, and he made the bold statements he made,
[01:16.560 --> 01:23.320]  it was incredibly important, it was historical, but it was only claims, it was only promises,
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.000]  it was only a commitment.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald John Trump is delivering the goods.
[01:33.240 --> 01:40.840]  The entire world government project is based on a $100 trillion per decade carbon tax,
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.320]  and he's set to destroy it today.
[01:45.320 --> 01:48.920]  And the media says, America built this, what are you doing?
[01:48.920 --> 01:54.320]  Yes, the globalists using American power through the UN built a global carbon tax system that
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.960]  would selectively be enforced against certain countries, certain industries, and certain
[01:59.960 --> 02:03.000]  companies and organizations.
[02:03.000 --> 02:12.600]  Total neo-futilism, absolute surveillance over all human activities, kicking off a $100
[02:12.600 --> 02:19.960]  trillion, predominantly private tax.
[02:19.960 --> 02:29.120]  Run by private mercantile exchanges owned by NM Rothschild in London, by the Chicago
[02:29.120 --> 02:35.400]  mercantile trading groups owned and controlled by Barack Obama, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[02:35.400 --> 02:44.160]  You cannot make up the bold Joker level swindle, the earth is in the balance, the seas will
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.800]  rise, the polar bears will all die, this will happen, as they buy luxury homes on the beach
[02:48.800 --> 02:56.440]  side and as the oceans stay at a level very constant, and as the Arctic and Antarctic
[02:56.440 --> 03:02.000]  get larger, they tell school children they've all melted.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.840]  The great lies are falling, and as Trump prepares to do this at the Rose Garden, the controlled
[03:09.840 --> 03:20.360]  demolition of world government's funding mechanism, as that happens ensconced, beginning as we
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.680]  speak, noon Eastern, world leaders are arriving at the Chantilly Marriott Conference Center,
[03:26.680 --> 03:32.560]  five-star center, where I've been twice to cover Bilderberg, our reporters are there now,
[03:32.560 --> 03:34.600]  they're arriving now.
[03:34.600 --> 03:41.120]  The globalists are meeting ensconced, encamped, and their own agenda, published to the world
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.400]  at infowars.com, at the Daily Mail, the London Guardian, remember the group didn't exist
[03:45.400 --> 03:52.000]  before, just eight and a half years ago, nine years ago, when Obama was about to be elected,
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.640]  Hillary and him were inside there secretly, we saw him go in, the media said, I was insane,
[03:56.640 --> 04:04.120]  having hallucinations in the woods in Chantilly, it actually said, I was having a full schizophrenic
[04:04.120 --> 04:10.600]  breakdown, the New York Times said, even though there was Secret Service helicopters, MP5
[04:10.600 --> 04:17.480]  submachine guns, they just said doesn't exist, Jones is insane, but then Drudge started linking
[04:17.480 --> 04:21.160]  to foreign European news and admitting it was real and they had to back off, so just
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.320]  in nine years, we've gone from them saying it doesn't exist to admitting it exists and
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.920]  admitting world government is in crisis, I have a stack of articles here admitting world
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.360]  governments in crisis, Soros says the European Union is now in an existential crisis surrounded
[04:34.360 --> 04:40.560]  by hostile powers, yes like the evil America, and Trump and the nationalist movement in
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.520]  the UK, that's those are the enemies, the bad guys, because they don't want to be under
[04:45.520 --> 04:51.160]  the great Nazi air, the Nazi fortune, the owner of the hijacker of Luxembourg, Junker,
[04:51.160 --> 04:55.520]  who's threatened the United States today and says, you will not be America first, close
[04:55.520 --> 05:01.240]  quote, you will not be America first, the insolence.
[05:01.240 --> 05:08.320]  A video has gone viral on the internet, where Muslim migrants are caught in the act, stealing
[05:08.320 --> 05:15.880]  flowers and toys from, get this, a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Manchester
[05:15.880 --> 05:21.320]  bombing, during the video, you can hear the man behind the camera, who is from Manchester,
[05:21.320 --> 05:33.680]  approaching the two migrant men and accusing them of being thieves, now one of the migrants
[05:33.680 --> 05:42.040]  is seen holding a stuffed blue smurf toy, that he had just stolen from the memorial,
[05:42.040 --> 05:46.960]  now Casey missed that, the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants, I'll knock this
[05:46.960 --> 05:52.680]  out of the pair of you, proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal
[05:52.680 --> 06:01.520]  cucks, and you can watch the video in its entirety right now at info wars dot com.
[06:01.520 --> 06:05.880]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:05.880 --> 06:10.600]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.600 --> 06:16.280]  to detoxify the body, that's why I'm introducing z shield, toxic metal and chemical defense
[06:16.280 --> 06:22.200]  support, it's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[06:22.200 --> 06:27.080]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war, it is a classical 360
[06:27.080 --> 06:31.400]  win, this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.680]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[06:36.680 --> 06:40.760]  get, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[06:40.760 --> 06:45.520]  this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[06:45.520 --> 06:51.040]  as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires

[08:11.120 --> 08:15.560]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[08:15.560 --> 08:16.560]  one
[08:16.560 --> 08:32.360]  from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones, June 1, 2017, this is one
[08:32.360 --> 08:40.520]  of the most important days in world history, yes, January 20 was when Trump made the commitment
[08:40.520 --> 08:46.440]  to try to turn the corner against austerity, against globalism, against forced planned
[08:46.440 --> 08:51.480]  austerity, against the eugenics plan of the global corporate combine that is the new world
[08:51.480 --> 09:00.680]  order, he made the declarations that day and declared God as our leader and as the progenitor
[09:00.680 --> 09:10.960]  of all that is good and invited God back into America, he invoked the birthright, that was
[09:10.960 --> 09:19.120]  a big day, today if he truly kills the global 100 trillion per decade carbon tax system
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.080]  that is meant to track every action you have and shut down key industries and companies
[09:24.080 --> 09:41.920]  with selective enforcement, total neo technotronic technocracy feudalism, if he destroys this,
[09:41.920 --> 09:50.320]  it's the equivalent of winning world war two because it is the entire global project
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.380]  that they've had going for 50 plus years, David Rockefeller died this year, Zbigniew
[09:55.380 --> 10:00.480]  Brzezinski, one of his main protege's died, this is all symbolic because world corporate
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.600]  government is dying, it doesn't mean it won't try to reorganize and come back, it doesn't
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.800]  mean it still isn't in place in many areas but it has been identified as unelected global
[10:10.800 --> 10:21.880]  corporate government, Junkers, the heir of the Nazi fortune, Nazi royalty, German royalty,
[10:21.880 --> 10:32.080]  Prussian royalty, his grandfather took over Luxembourg during world war two with paratrooper
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.480]  commandos, he owns the richest country in the world per capita because his grandfather
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.800]  took it by force with men parachuting in and dropping artillery in the first time it had
[10:42.800 --> 10:52.280]  been done and then they went into Greece, his grandfather took a country and he has set
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.240]  up the European Union with a collection of scum, it's totally unelected and they are
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.720]  in major British newspapers today saying quote, no nations are allowed to make any agreements
[11:04.720 --> 11:12.520]  with America, we rule Europe and we have a EU army and we will march in on you and it's
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.200]  just in the newspapers like it's no big deal, I've got the articles right here, think about
[11:18.200 --> 11:25.920]  that, the arrogance, the insolence, schnubbed furious Junker, remember the Junker bombers
[11:25.920 --> 11:35.680]  vows Brussels will block trade deals between US and EU states, he talks about trade wars
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.480]  and then you can also search there's articles today about yes we have an EU army, we are
[11:39.480 --> 11:52.160]  not allowed to leave, Junker was never elected, you understand that, Junker was never elected,
[11:52.160 --> 11:59.520]  the EU council was created in a quote steel trade deal in 1947, the treaty of London,
[11:59.520 --> 12:07.560]  in 1956 the treaty of Rome, I've read it, I made a film on it and it's the whole plan
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.520]  and it's carbon copy, the Nazi plan, when they finally took Europe how they were going
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.080]  to economically control people, how they were going to put steroids on the vaccines, how
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.680]  they were going to adulterate the food to slowly dumb down the public until they were
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.760]  so mentally retarded they could just start wiping everybody out, we are under that plan
[12:24.760 --> 12:33.120]  now and Trump is trying to leave it, you understand folks, I'm not here telling you my opinion,
[12:33.120 --> 12:36.720]  the reason Hillary Clinton came out in the big speech yesterday and said she lost the
[12:36.720 --> 12:48.160]  election because of info wars and that we're Russian agents, she's gotten even more brazen
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.600]  than Maxine Waters, even her former head PR person said it's a total conspiracy theory,
[12:52.600 --> 13:00.520]  totally made up, I mean ladies and gentlemen, Maxine Waters and Hillary now say drain the
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.120]  swamp and Crooked Hillary came from Putin, they're now saying Nigel Farage who started
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.680]  UKIP 25 years ago and who is a right wing libertarian patriot is a Russian agent, a
[13:11.680 --> 13:20.600]  person of interest, this is ridiculous because these are the globalists, so look at these
[13:20.600 --> 13:26.320]  headlines, again you identify world government, you identify it's unelected, you identify
[13:26.320 --> 13:33.920]  it's authoritarian and then you identify it's agenda to people and it's game over, we have
[13:33.920 --> 13:42.880]  now achieved, phase one, there aren't just evil people in the world, they're good men
[13:42.880 --> 13:57.120]  and women as well, phase one is very close to being complete, phase one, phase two is
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.480]  all about courage because you have to actually read the globalist white papers and their
[14:01.480 --> 14:07.680]  statements and find out that they're so dug in what they've done with the GMO that's already
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.320]  affecting our genetics and the vaccines and the nanotech and the vaccines and the chemicals
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.720]  and what they've done and their admissions of what they've done, the deformity, the
[14:18.720 --> 14:27.000]  mental illness, the plague that you're already seeing in the public with the low IQs and
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.240]  the far away stare and the dream state people are in, they're putting people into an induced
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.440]  dream state for the next level, ladies and gentlemen, cancer is up in children, again
[14:36.440 --> 14:42.680]  over 10,000% on average, breast cancer types over 3,000%, diabetes, several thousand percent
[14:42.680 --> 14:51.800]  type two, they're killing us, you're going to have to admit, I'll explain something,
[14:51.800 --> 14:59.240]  the EU is unelected and is run by German royalty, the number one or number two most powerful
[14:59.240 --> 15:11.960]  royal house in Germany, they had German states, Prussian royalty, top Nazis, top arms producers,
[15:11.960 --> 15:19.720]  Junker was number one arms producer in World War II for the Nazis, that man is threatening
[15:19.720 --> 15:27.440]  us and threatening Trump and is directing Soros to shut down independent media and
[15:27.440 --> 15:35.160]  to go after the press and Trump publicly, Junker, whose grandfather, sat atop the Nazi
[15:35.160 --> 15:43.360]  system at the highest level with Hitler, is now directing a 89 year old Nazi collaborator
[15:43.360 --> 15:55.320]  with the 87, you cannot make this up, these people are pure evil certified and Hillary
[15:55.320 --> 15:59.640]  says I say the most horrible things about her and I'm so dark-hearted and I'm so evil,
[15:59.640 --> 16:06.080]  lady, your whole career was defending pedophiles and child kidnappers when you first became
[16:06.080 --> 16:11.280]  a lawyer, that's what you chose, your husband is an admitted sex pervert who flies around
[16:11.280 --> 16:18.080]  with known pedophile and known child traffickers, your top people constantly are getting busted
[16:18.080 --> 16:23.720]  with little kids and child porn and sneaking kids out of Haiti, the UN just got caught,
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.680]  you think I want to go up against you, you think I'm stupid, how evil you are, but the
[16:27.680 --> 16:35.200]  children demand it lady, so I commit my body, my heart, my soul, everything to Jesus Christ
[16:35.200 --> 16:41.040]  and I stand on Christ against you, I know who you are and you're not facing my will,
[16:41.040 --> 16:48.120]  you are facing the will of God, I am not an arrogant Satanist like you that is all about
[16:48.120 --> 16:56.640]  my own personal power, I stand humbly in dirty rags before God but I will not sign on to
[16:56.640 --> 17:03.600]  your Satanism and I see you and I know you and I stand against you, God stands with us
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.640]  and your satanic forces of Islam and your satanic forces of Hollywood and your satanic forces
[17:08.640 --> 17:20.640]  of Nambla and all of you will be broken, you will be broken in the name of Jesus Christ
[17:20.640 --> 17:28.600]  you will be smashed, so rally your gods because there's only one true God and that's the God
[17:28.600 --> 17:39.120]  of life and all the blessings and the mastery that we see in the creation of that God, Trump
[17:39.120 --> 17:46.560]  is not a servant of death, Trump is not a servant of poverty and failure, Trump is not
[17:46.560 --> 17:54.160]  a servant of those who would persecute children and that is his sin and any of us that do
[17:54.160 --> 18:01.160]  not serve this system of death are the enemies of the world system, world awaits, that means
[18:01.160 --> 18:06.200]  globalist, Trump's decision on US future in Paris accord, they never tell you it's a carbon
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.320]  tax, a global government, it's always the polar bears talking to you like your five
[18:10.320 --> 18:17.920]  year olds, EU China unite behind Paris climate deal, as Trump moles US withdrawal, I told
[18:17.920 --> 18:23.000]  you it's the EU, it's communist China and it's the globalist, the democrats in Hollywood,
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.680]  they admit that in CNN, the popes involved rallying against Trump, Soros says the European
[18:27.680 --> 18:33.760]  Union is now in an existential crisis surrounded by hostile powers like America and England,
[18:33.760 --> 18:42.760]  oh the bad guys, America and England, poise to announce it very soon, the world built
[18:42.760 --> 18:50.640]  a climate deal for the US, Trump may be about to leave it, no, robber barons hijacked America
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.840]  and use it to build the world government and now we took America back to command base and
[18:54.840 --> 19:00.120]  we're destroying it, oh and look what happened to the stock market, it's back up, then private
[19:00.120 --> 19:07.040]  sector job growth rebounds to rip roaring pace in May ADP, the nation's largest payroll
[19:07.040 --> 19:18.200]  system announces, private payrolls add 253K in May versus 185K, Americans comfort rises

[19:30.240 --> 19:36.640]  not a vampire, it doesn't mean he's perfect, the enemy truly hates it because they know
[19:36.640 --> 19:43.720]  and now Bilderberg meets, they've been meeting since 1954 in secret, global leaders mainly

[19:47.480 --> 19:51.160]  no longer private, no longer fully secret because they've now been identified, oh from
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.160]  conspiracy theory to reality, was always there, now you know about it, they had been on their

[21:06.800 --> 21:11.440]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[21:11.440 --> 21:15.040]  hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.960]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate
[21:18.960 --> 21:21.760]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[21:21.760 --> 21:26.760]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had

[24:24.560 --> 24:30.480]  But I tell you, it is very, very humbling and it's beyond a feeling of fear.
[24:30.480 --> 24:36.820]  It is a feeling of extreme responsibility and shame.
[24:36.820 --> 24:40.440]  Most people get a lot of power and they become arrogant, they become crazy, they become mega
[24:40.440 --> 24:47.440]  maniacal because they're not purpose driven for the great mission.
[24:47.440 --> 24:49.440]  So many good men and women don't ever seek power.
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.240]  So they just sit there on the sidelines and let bad people basically run things.
[24:53.240 --> 24:55.920]  And they want to run things and tell you what to do.
[24:55.920 --> 25:02.080]  Good people just simply want to be examples and try to build a better world.
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.960]  And to have Hillary come out and call me a dark heart and come out again, I'm going to
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.560]  play this later and say that in full wars is why she lost the election and that we were
[25:10.560 --> 25:17.360]  directed directly with the Russians and that we advise the Russians.
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.280]  I mean, this is just the way she puts its total lies, but in a way it's true.
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.600]  We are creating the global talking point, but we didn't invent it.
[25:26.600 --> 25:29.560]  We're resurrecting the Renaissance.
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.160]  We're resurrecting Western civilization.
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.680]  We're resurrecting our better angels, basically.
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.920]  And we're pointing out how the global system is unelected and how it's tyrannical and
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.720]  how its real program is to basically face humans out and merge with machines.
[25:51.720 --> 25:53.560]  I mean, here it is in the Daily Mail today.
[25:53.560 --> 25:57.720]  Artificial intelligence will outperform humans in all tasks in just 45 years and can take
[25:57.720 --> 25:59.880]  over every job in the next century.
[25:59.880 --> 26:00.880]  Experts claim.
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.360]  And they pretty much all agree because that's where it's going.
[26:04.360 --> 26:06.160]  The decision has been made.
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.160]  You read MIT.
[26:07.160 --> 26:08.320]  You read the white papers.
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.440]  The decision was made by the 80s to face humans out.
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.640]  So you see the PR and the movies and the cartoons they show kids in public schools in Europe
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.920]  and the United States where it shows us blasting off in rocket ships and going and spreading
[26:22.920 --> 26:30.840]  disease and infecting planets like we're a pox.
[26:30.840 --> 26:36.720]  This is a very anti-human globalist group who operate like they are some alien invasion
[26:36.720 --> 26:41.160]  force that runs the media trying to convince us all to commit cultural suicide.
[26:41.160 --> 26:43.080]  And I'm not saying they're aliens.
[26:43.080 --> 26:50.040]  I'm saying the Bible says it's interdimensional and it's a big bad entity and whether you
[26:50.040 --> 26:55.040]  believe it or not, the elites are killing little kids, drinking blood, torturing people
[26:55.040 --> 27:01.040]  and they believe they're channeling off-world stuff.
[27:01.040 --> 27:03.040]  And they believe it's not even another dimension.
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.040]  They're communicating over space-time continuum through the dimensions.
[27:07.040 --> 27:09.120]  And again, I'm a sociologist.
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.280]  I'm a lay anthropologist.
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.000]  I study what they write and what they believe and when they get on their knees in the morning,
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.800]  when they get on their knees at night, it is like something right out of the golden child
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.520]  where the door closes and the bricks all disappear and what is thy bidding, master?
[27:27.520 --> 27:33.200]  Enslave the children, kill them all, disease their blood, bring in evil, have them commit
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.600]  to more evil, prepare the death and destruction.
[27:36.600 --> 27:40.400]  I mean, it's just like when you actually study these people and I've been around them some,
[27:40.400 --> 27:43.120]  they'll go, of course, we're gonna take over and we're unstoppable.
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.160]  I mean, you think I'm the only guy that can act like that?
[27:45.160 --> 27:48.720]  I act like that because I've seen them act like that since I was a teenager.
[27:48.720 --> 27:50.760]  It's like a Stephen King novel, man.
[27:50.760 --> 27:55.880]  My life's been incredible and see why it is now, but it's only because I've seen them.
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.800]  I've been aware of it because there's not just evil in the world, there's good.
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.840]  Can you guys pull up from Julius Caesar, Shakespeare's, just type in fly havoc and let loose the
[28:06.840 --> 28:07.840]  dogs of war?
[28:07.840 --> 28:15.000]  I mean, that full passage, it starts with Antonin, you're talking about the death of Caesar
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.360]  and how great evil was gonna then come into the world.
[28:17.360 --> 28:21.480]  If you guys can put that on screen, I'll read it now or I'll read it when we come back.
[28:21.480 --> 28:25.200]  But great evil is coming into the world.
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.600]  Great good is also coming into the world and you're going to have to decide which side
[28:29.600 --> 28:30.600]  you want to be on it.
[28:30.600 --> 28:31.600]  It's that simple.
[28:31.600 --> 28:38.360]  Anthony, blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that
[28:38.360 --> 28:43.520]  mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered.
[28:43.520 --> 28:46.800]  That's all chopped up with their guts hanging out.
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.520]  That mothers, let me start over, blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.120]  objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered
[28:58.120 --> 28:59.840]  with the hands of war.
[28:59.840 --> 29:07.520]  Full pity choked with custom of fell deeds and Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge with
[29:07.520 --> 29:15.680]  eight that hunger by his side come hot from hell to the hunger of hell shall in these
[29:15.680 --> 29:23.480]  confines with a monarch's voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul
[29:23.480 --> 29:33.600]  deed shall smell above the earth with carrying men groaning or burial that's right living
[29:33.600 --> 29:39.360]  zombies rotting men who cannot die because they are the living dead the archetype of
[29:39.360 --> 29:50.440]  the zombie living but dead consciousness God turned over to Satan will be back.
[29:50.440 --> 30:01.560]  There on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.560 --> 30:08.680]  A video has gone viral on the internet where Muslim migrants are caught in the act stealing
[30:08.680 --> 30:16.240]  flowers and toys from get this a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Manchester
[30:16.240 --> 30:17.240]  bombing.
[30:17.240 --> 30:22.400]  In the video you can hear the man behind the camera who is from Manchester approaching
[30:22.400 --> 30:33.000]  the two migrant men and accusing them of being thieves.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.880]  Now one of the migrants is seen holding a stuffed blue smurf toy that he had just stolen
[30:38.880 --> 30:42.400]  from the memorial.
[30:42.400 --> 30:48.000]  Now Casey missed that the man from Manchester told the Muslim migrants I'll knock this out
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.160]  of the pair of you proof that not all of the citizens of Manchester are liberal cucks and
[30:54.160 --> 31:24.000]  you can watch the video in its entirety right now at info wars dot com.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.120]  Whether it's your home or office you owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your
[31:28.120 --> 31:31.400]  children to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:31.400 --> 31:36.440]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:36.440 --> 31:41.600]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't.
[31:41.600 --> 31:45.360]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.200]  one of these systems can keep eight hundred square feet incredibly clean.
[31:49.200 --> 31:53.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive
[31:53.200 --> 31:55.960]  filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.960 --> 32:01.940]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for our store dot com.
[32:01.940 --> 32:06.920]  In America's two hundred and forty plus year history we have seen veterans from the first
[32:06.920 --> 32:12.360]  battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today
[32:12.360 --> 32:16.400]  fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[32:16.400 --> 32:20.360]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about is those that made the ultimate
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.160]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[32:23.160 --> 32:27.760]  This group of specials for two thousand seventeen Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've
[32:27.760 --> 32:32.440]  ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that
[32:32.440 --> 32:35.400]  put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[32:35.400 --> 32:39.560]  We have over a thousand high quality products available that are discounted and in four
[32:39.560 --> 32:40.560]  store dot com.
[32:40.560 --> 32:45.480]  You add auto ship several of these are lost leaders sixty five percent off coil silver

[32:53.320 --> 32:58.360]  these are our memorial day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic
[32:58.360 --> 33:03.480]  the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[33:03.480 --> 33:07.880]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[33:07.880 --> 33:14.560]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones I don't know what
[33:14.560 --> 33:22.440]  happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[33:22.440 --> 33:26.760]  We came we saw he died.
[33:26.760 --> 33:37.080]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Qaddafi has led to a failed state maybe Libya was
[33:37.080 --> 33:42.120]  not perfect under Qaddafi but it had even if to some extent a functioning government
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.520]  one unified country it was a sovereign state.
[33:46.520 --> 33:51.000]  Libya now has two rival governments a civil war that has left over four thousand people
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.280]  dead and its cities are ruined.
[33:53.280 --> 34:00.520]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[34:00.520 --> 34:05.040]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against
[34:05.040 --> 34:10.680]  gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely they're mistreated she claims to
[34:10.680 --> 34:11.920]  be their champion.
[34:11.920 --> 34:19.720]  We let ISIS take this position it was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them
[34:19.720 --> 34:21.640]  as the founder of ISIS.
[34:21.640 --> 34:27.000]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.800]  lujahideen equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.400]  inside Afghanistan and we were successful and this really just is so disgusting.
[34:37.400 --> 34:42.600]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993 he told his secretary
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.120]  that he would be back but the deputy White House counsel and boyhood friend of Bill
[34:47.120 --> 34:49.000]  Clinton never returned.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.360]  There has been this urgency to end this and you know historically that makes no sense
[34:56.360 --> 35:01.440]  we all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.280]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.360]  changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story that's according
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.760]  to website info wars.
[35:12.760 --> 35:18.520]  If a Google user types in Clinton body they get car repair shop results instead of a story
[35:18.520 --> 35:22.560]  that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.840]  circumstances over the last three decades.
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.120]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.120]  risks.
[35:30.120 --> 35:33.240]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.680]  I don't know the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant
[35:37.680 --> 35:44.320]  updates about my personal situation as a 27 year old that works for the DNC.
[35:44.320 --> 35:50.000]  We shot in the back murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.240]  down the street in Washington.
[35:51.240 --> 35:59.280]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[35:59.280 --> 36:05.200]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[36:05.200 --> 36:06.520]  I'll admit it.
[36:06.520 --> 36:12.960]  I have an extremely dark heart.
[36:12.960 --> 36:15.760]  I have a multifaceted heart.
[36:15.760 --> 36:23.840]  My loving soft heart is about 10 times bigger than my dark heart but my big fat black heart
[36:23.840 --> 36:30.480]  is probably bigger than yours Hillary but I never acted on evil technology.
[36:30.480 --> 36:32.480]  I never acted with the knowledge of evil.
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.640]  I never used it because I've got a conscience and a soul pointed at God.
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.240]  You are a weak little demon that was given temporal power because you sought it and because
[36:44.240 --> 36:51.320]  you would do anything and you were then denied all of the real birthright you could have
[36:51.320 --> 36:59.040]  had satanist, enemy of the children, I'm just thinking about it, Hillary Clinton is an enemy
[36:59.040 --> 37:00.040]  of the children.
[37:00.040 --> 37:08.720]  That should be her title, enemy of the children, in fact the globalist are enemies of the children,
[37:08.720 --> 37:12.960]  enemies of humanity, enemies of our future, enemies of our success, all they talk about
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.160]  is how much they hate us, how much better they are than us, how we need to die and get
[37:18.160 --> 37:19.160]  out of their way.
[37:19.160 --> 37:27.120]  I have a better idea, if you like death so much how about you slit your own throat?
[37:27.120 --> 37:33.440]  I don't wish any harm upon you but if you like death so much then you grab a big long
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.000]  dagger and you jab it into that fat neck and you slide it across those carotid arteries
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.840]  if death's what you seek so much and if death's what you love so much, if death is your God
[37:44.840 --> 37:56.280]  then go to your God, I've seen you before and I know your name, now, the enemy will
[37:56.280 --> 38:07.920]  be overthrown but you better know that it will not be without a price but that's the
[38:07.920 --> 38:16.880]  great riddle that's not a riddle, why people think about doing the right thing as if they're
[38:16.880 --> 38:24.520]  going to lose something, you only lose not doing the right thing.
[38:24.520 --> 38:31.400]  Temporal power on this planet means nothing to be around a bunch of mentally ill, out-of-control
[38:31.400 --> 38:38.640]  psychopaths and sociopaths and mercenaries and trash is the most empty peacock existence
[38:38.640 --> 38:46.720]  that you could have, the great secret is the enemy lives in a nightmare prison, their fortresses,
[38:46.720 --> 39:04.640]  their palaces are prisons, in Revelation, Satan, Lucifer, the devil, black serpent is
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.360]  locked up for a thousand years on review, people come and they marvel, they say that
[39:10.360 --> 39:15.560]  is what did all this, that ruled us, that deceived the world, that killed billions,
[39:15.560 --> 39:24.240]  that creature, when you realize how powerful you are in the image of God and why that creature
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.880]  wants to destroy you and wants to destroy children, the essence of creativity, the essence
[39:29.880 --> 39:39.120]  of the seed of the universe, the essence of what we are going to become and you have these
[39:39.120 --> 39:44.940]  weak-minded people that resonate with the devil so they can then carry out their operations
[39:44.940 --> 39:53.880]  against humanity and you care what they think or what they want.
[39:53.880 --> 40:02.600]  Standing on this bridge and watching this creature stomp towards me, I don't have fear.
[40:02.600 --> 40:10.480]  I feel nauseous at how much I'm like that creature because with great knowledge comes
[40:10.480 --> 40:19.360]  great sorrow, the Bible again, all true, the profane can't understand it because they're
[40:19.360 --> 40:25.120]  not meant to because they made decisions and their ancestors made decisions to turn away
[40:25.120 --> 40:34.160]  from God, my ancestors thank God, didn't, that's why the enemy doesn't know, that's
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.840]  why they can't stand us, that's why they know they can't beat us and they try to find
[40:39.840 --> 40:44.720]  out why they can't defeat people that love life and why every time those that love life
[40:44.720 --> 40:51.560]  and God are about to be defeated, we always win and it's because of the mastery of what
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.480]  God has created.
[40:55.480 --> 41:08.400]  Our ancestors fools set their will against you over the thousands of years in the mind
[41:08.400 --> 41:13.000]  of God being able to actually tune into that, they understood what was coming in the future
[41:13.000 --> 41:21.840]  and could envision the future in the purity of those days and we're transcending through
[41:21.840 --> 41:29.840]  the genetics, it's electrical into time space to today, everyone out there, every one of
[41:29.840 --> 41:34.680]  your ancestors is alive coursing through your electrons, coursing through your blood, coursing
[41:34.680 --> 41:40.720]  through your body into your very cells, your mother, your father raised you, loved you,
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.720]  that mother, that father, all continual back thousands of years, thousands and thousands,
[41:46.720 --> 41:54.640]  you transcend time space, you're already living forever, that's why they want to kill children,
[41:54.640 --> 42:12.800]  that's why they don't want families, it's why they want to get rid of the sexes.
[42:12.800 --> 42:20.080]  These creatures aren't going to stop till we're all dead, who cares about Hollywood,
[42:20.080 --> 42:29.840]  who cares about celebrities, who cares about crap, who cares about being part of this system,
[42:29.840 --> 42:38.640]  it's all a joke, it's all a con game, it's all a lie, you've already arrived, you're
[42:38.640 --> 42:45.640]  already somebody innately, when you point your soul at God, I just feel sorry for those
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.120]  that have been so long willfully turning away from God when God came knocking that God gave
[42:51.120 --> 42:58.440]  them their free will and let them be turned over to complete evil and oblivion.
[42:58.440 --> 43:01.040]  I've got a bunch of clips I need to get to Hillary and the rest of it, but I look at
[43:01.040 --> 43:22.720]  her self-serving witch, a predator, a hater of God, a hater of justice, a lover of twisted
[43:22.720 --> 43:33.680]  filth, and I think how did a monster like this ever crawl out of hell and get its hands
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.760]  around our children's throats and every bit of my humanity that's pointed at God says,
[43:39.760 --> 43:50.480]  stand, hold fast and quite frankly, these Satanists look for power, they're so foolish, if they
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.160]  really loved God, they'd be given so much power and they would be so ashamed of the
[43:55.160 --> 43:59.880]  power they had because the vessel holding the power wasn't even righteous enough to
[43:59.880 --> 44:06.280]  even be able to imagine the mind of God, you fools, the whole mind of God is waiting for
[44:06.280 --> 44:13.360]  you open but you don't want to be part of that, you don't want communion with the God
[44:13.360 --> 44:19.600]  of justice and life and light and everything real, that's why your God calls himself the
[44:19.600 --> 44:33.280]  God of light, a fraud, a counterfeit, you are the God of darkness, a failure, the God
[44:33.280 --> 44:50.720]  of cancer, the God of betrayal, the God of weakness, the God of loneliness and everything
[44:50.720 --> 45:06.600]  it sells is poison, everything it does is meant to make you weaker, to cast you down,
[45:06.600 --> 45:08.960]  to destroy you and I just don't like con artists, I mean look at this, Uma Abedin humiliating
[45:08.960 --> 45:15.600]  U-turn Hillary, Hack invites Wiener back home, I said when she was divorced two weeks
[45:15.600 --> 45:22.000]  ago that was a stunt, those two are nasty little buggers, nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty
[45:22.000 --> 45:31.960]  Remfields, let me explain something, Uma Abedin and Anthony Wiener, those are just
[45:31.960 --> 45:48.800]  ghouls, those are just slaves, ugly, wheat, twisted, fallen so that Hillary can feel powerful
[45:48.800 --> 45:53.840]  around them and then look at that radiating dark force you're watching on TV, Hillary
[45:53.840 --> 46:05.640]  behind her coming out of the darkness, I mean that is somebody turned over to evil, that
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.480]  is somebody turned over to power trip about how great they are and then why does Hillary
[46:10.480 --> 46:17.520]  hate me so much because she knows I'm not scared of her because she knows despite everything
[46:17.520 --> 46:26.000]  they've done, I only wish I had more energy to fight them and it's not because I'm a hero,
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.760]  it's because I am running from them, they smell so bad spiritually, they're so demonic,
[46:31.760 --> 46:38.920]  they're so rotten, they're so filthy, they're so diseased, they're so twisted that my resisting
[46:38.920 --> 46:50.960]  them is like a person trying to get oxygen, it's a life and death struggle, my very shells
[46:50.960 --> 46:59.480]  recoil at Hillary and Bill, I don't want to be with them for eternity, fear of God is
[46:59.480 --> 47:13.080]  only recognizing good from evil, you call it fear of God, it's fear of being fallen,
[47:13.080 --> 47:24.920]  it's fear of being separated from God, God's love is so pure, so massive, so all-encompassing
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.600]  and you see everywhere the mastery of what God built and everything God did and how it's
[47:29.600 --> 47:35.800]  all reward and loving and pure and honorable and all perfectly lined out and prepared
[47:35.800 --> 47:45.440]  to the processes of life and just all the magic and the rites of passage and the enemy
[47:45.440 --> 47:52.000]  seeks to take those rites of passage away and destroy our humanity.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.140]  You should be recoiling from it, thank God Trump is preparing to destroy the climate
[47:58.140 --> 48:05.800]  carbon tax system, thank God he pulled out of the TPP an outrageous foreign world government
[48:05.800 --> 48:14.240]  made in secret that was supposed to administer the carbon tax, he is the equivalent in his
[48:14.240 --> 48:21.160]  executive orders and actions of thousands of V-17 bombers dropping bombs on Nazi emplacements
[48:21.160 --> 48:29.080]  in World War II, the devastation weekly is the equivalent and Yunker and others classically
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.800]  shoot their mouths off in arrogance and say, I've got the quotes, you won't have America
[48:33.800 --> 48:39.440]  first, we'll stop Trump, we're rallying with China and the Vatican and the Democrats and
[48:39.440 --> 48:47.360]  the Republicans to defeat you and we'll defeat the Americans.
[48:47.360 --> 48:54.840]  Soros is in the newspaper, CNBC saying it's America and England and Russia against the
[48:54.840 --> 49:00.200]  EU like they're the good guys and we're all Russian stooges, Russia just pulled a face
[49:00.200 --> 49:04.760]  sucker off of it 20 years ago, halfway, it's trying to crawl away, halfway bleeding to
[49:04.760 --> 49:09.240]  death from the New World Order.
[49:09.240 --> 49:13.700]  So of course the globalists go look the Russians, oh look America, all it is is the Russia has
[49:13.700 --> 49:23.040]  decided in its 800 year history to join the West, Russia has embraced the West, Russia
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.840]  has come out of its feudalism and its systems and its reprogramming 80 years under Bolshevik
[49:28.840 --> 49:34.480]  globalist Goldman Sachs attack and is now struggling for identity, struggling and is
[49:34.480 --> 49:42.160]  now attempting to keep its identity but join the West in prosperity and the globalists
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.080]  are panicking like Hillary says and the Russians don't know how to manipulate our politics,
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.880]  they got it from info wars and they got it from WikiLeaks and so I thought we were being
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.880]  ordered by the Russians but now Hillary finally had to tell the truth and I'm not bragging
[49:55.880 --> 50:04.520]  about it, people understand why this is an important broadcast, why we're under attack
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.440]  because we are speaking the truth, I don't care if you're in Russia or in the continent
[50:09.440 --> 50:16.440]  of Africa or Asia or South America, it doesn't matter where you are, you know this is true,
[50:16.440 --> 50:20.280]  they're announcing world government, microchipping, to buy and sell, it's all in the news, forced
[50:20.280 --> 50:26.080]  inoculations, all over the world being announced, they're saying the family's bad, they're
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.000]  invoking racism to get us all fighting with each other, all over the country saying no
[50:30.000 --> 50:36.800]  whites weekends and all this crap to make whites racist.
[50:36.800 --> 50:39.800]  You know I'm not really going to plug this out, I'm too focused, I probably should because
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.800]  I got to fund the operation, we tend to the Memorial Day specials, some of them are the

[54:10.200 --> 54:12.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[54:12.960 --> 54:22.720]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner
[54:22.720 --> 54:26.120]  or later, gotta cut you down, sooner or later.
[54:26.120 --> 54:34.200]  So within one hour, one hour of the excess Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour,
[54:34.200 --> 54:43.440]  the Russians, let's say WikiLeaks, the same thing, dumped the John Podesta emails.
[54:43.440 --> 54:49.520]  Now if you've ever read the John Podesta emails, they are anodyne to boredom.
[54:49.520 --> 55:00.840]  But they were, forgive him for what he said about you.
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.240]  So they were run-of-the-mill emails, especially run-of-the-mill for a campaign.
[55:05.240 --> 55:06.240]  Should we do this?
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.240]  What should she say?
[55:07.240 --> 55:14.960]  The stuff that is so common, basic, within one hour they dumped them and then they began
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.720]  to weaponize them.
[55:16.720 --> 55:25.880]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like info wars,
[55:25.880 --> 55:33.880]  fake outpieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[55:33.880 --> 55:39.520]  And so they had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that, and they
[55:39.520 --> 55:41.120]  had to be given the go-ahead.
[55:41.120 --> 55:48.640]  Okay, this could be the end of the Trump campaign, dump it now, and then let's do everything
[55:48.640 --> 55:53.680]  we can to weaponize it, and we know it hurt us.
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.000]  So there's Hillary basically saying info wars, WikiLeaks, cost her the election, full
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.400]  videos up on infowars.com.
[55:59.400 --> 56:06.240]  Lady, everyone was going through the WikiLeaks, mainstream media, though, wouldn't put the
[56:06.240 --> 56:07.240]  damning stuff out there.
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.840]  I mean, there's top Democrats talking about we got to keep our constituents poor and in
[56:11.840 --> 56:18.560]  the dark and helpless, and clear talk about, you know, spirit cooking, Alistair Crowley
[56:18.560 --> 56:23.160]  events, we're going to have blood and semen and mother's milk on the menu, and then they
[56:23.160 --> 56:26.520]  admit they're doing these rituals, and then all the weird sex stuff, and then Podesta's
[56:26.520 --> 56:32.320]  brother has naked pictures of kids with her butt sticking out in the Washington Post saying,
[56:32.320 --> 56:38.400]  I'll have Deviant Art of I Want, I mean, you know, you guys are sick, and you got Jerry
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.280]  Epstein as Alita Express, and all that, and Bill Clinton's rapes, and, you know, your
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.160]  Haiti mission caught doing it, and your own people caught shipping kids in and mass, and
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.240]  the UN caught just killing hundreds of kids and trafficking thousands.
[56:51.240 --> 56:56.080]  I mean, I could go on for hours, it's all mainstream news, you just hang your hat on
[56:56.080 --> 57:00.000]  a pizza place that the media focused on, then people talked about, is there something
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.840]  there, and I said, hey, I think this is a honey pot, so then I'm the one that pulled
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.320]  back, you know, that's not the one, that's his brother, it shows like the naked kids
[57:07.320 --> 57:13.320]  sticking their butts out, I don't want to show it, it's in the news, and children with
[57:13.320 --> 57:19.240]  their little naked red butts paddled, he talks about it in the news, just don't put it on
[57:19.240 --> 57:25.600]  screen, guys, images of what looks like six-year-old girls, you know, all lined up, just, there's
[57:25.600 --> 57:30.600]  worse, just don't show it, I can't look at it, I got daughters, it makes me really
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.360]  angry, I'm not mad at you, just I don't want to show it, there's even worse stuff than
[57:34.360 --> 57:35.360]  that.
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.200]  This is what they show the Washington Post, because the lesser magic is, if he can be
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.480]  all creeped out in the Washington Post, smiling demonically, his sick brother, let's just show
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.000]  a picture of him, and then show all this weird art in this house, and say, it's ours, we'll
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.400]  do it, I'll show paddled neighborhood kids if I want, mmm, mmm, see, that's about throwing
[57:50.400 --> 57:58.280]  it in our face, that's what they're into, just heaven help us, and that guy's, of course,
[57:58.280 --> 58:01.840]  Tim with the Russians, reportedly, and all the rest of it, so, before I go any further,
[58:01.840 --> 58:05.520]  just please support the broadcast, ZShield, that detoxifies the body from heavy metals

[58:51.480 --> 58:54.680]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it, why
[58:54.680 --> 58:56.400]  is this so good?
[58:56.400 --> 59:01.080]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[59:01.080 --> 59:05.720]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[59:05.720 --> 59:11.440]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[59:11.440 --> 59:17.120]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees,
[59:17.120 --> 59:21.600]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere, these are all
[59:21.600 --> 59:22.600]  parasites.
[59:22.600 --> 59:24.800]  Tell us about all the stuff I said, there's so many things that are in it.
[59:24.800 --> 59:29.760]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[59:29.760 --> 59:32.480]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:32.480 --> 59:35.760]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today, it just
[59:35.760 --> 59:40.280]  came back in yesterday, Living Defense, mforestore.com, and folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff
[59:40.280 --> 59:45.720]  that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, mforestore.com, thank
[59:45.720 --> 59:49.160]  you Dr. Grip from the Global Healing Center, thank you so much for all your work sir on
[59:49.160 --> 59:54.000]  this great product.
[59:54.000 --> 1:00:04.400]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:10.440]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, deep in the heart of Texas, it's
[1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:11.440]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:18.960]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country, running
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:30.520]  down a way of life, I don't mind them, and I don't mind them switching sides and standing
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:39.560]  up for things, they believe in, like women of Venezuela or North Korea, and we're seeing
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:48.800]  a resurgence of Americana, yeah, running down a way of life, running down a way of life,
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:54.040]  I'm fighting and thought to die here.
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:01:00.840]  You don't love it, leave it, you don't love it, leave it, let this song I'm singing be
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:01.840]  warning.
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:05.760]  You know, I don't like if you don't love it, leave it, when the globalists are taking our
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:09.800]  liberties, taking our freedoms and posing as if they're Americana, but my point is if
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:14.600]  you hate free market so much, there are quite a few socialist and communist hell holes you
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:19.960]  can still go to, being a slave labor camp, Venezuela is totally collapsing into hell
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:23.880]  on earth, killing a bunch of journalists today, attacking AFP reporters, I mean it is just
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:31.560]  like zombie land, now there, I mean just full on collapse beyond failed civilization,
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.560]  crazy town, because you kill incentives and people owning their own stuff and having their
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:41.440]  own plot of land or having their own job, and you create a bunch of dependents who think
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:49.000]  that they are God and a huge communist force of people waddling around in uniforms, that's
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.520]  a recipe for doom.
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:55.760]  Lord Monkton's coming up in the next segment, Trump is set, when does he set, they keep
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:01.480]  saying this afternoon, do we know how long until he does that Rose Garden speech to pull
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:06.960]  out of the carbon tax, the global carbon tax, this is such a big deal.
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:10.920]  By the way, it's stuck up on me, I saw some tweets and some comments this morning saying
[1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:15.560]  hey Alex you usually cover Bilderberg, you know you've been right on that for 20-something
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:21.360]  years, why aren't you covering Bilderberg, we do have four reporters that are getting
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:28.980]  there as we speak, so we are covering Bilderberg, I will say this, it's kind of gotten past
[1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:33.920]  say, because world governments out in the open, they failed at covering it up, so now
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:37.120]  that mainstream media is covering it and admitting they want world government, admitting
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:45.920]  they want to overthrow Trump, we're still there to break things down, but we're not
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:50.320]  needed as much as we were previously.
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:55.760]  So we've got 2PM Central coming up with the vaunted speech, who's doing the fourth hour
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:03:01.120]  today, Abaport's awesome, just let him know though, we're going to have to pre-empt part
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.720]  of him for this Trump thing, I'm going to have to co-host with him, with the Trump speech
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:09.080]  because we need to definitely get the announcement probably five minutes long, but this is history,
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:13.600]  this is coffin nails to the globalist, this is big old oak stakes and counter-acculus
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:19.560]  heart, I mean this is super delicious, taxing all carbon on the planet and tracking it all
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.240]  and selectively deciding who gets charged what to totally control society and paying
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:28.680]  the Rothschilds and the Obama's and the Clintons, hundreds of billions of dollars, I mean Al
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:32.480]  Gore just in the carbon exchange crap, he's already involved in getting a few countries
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:39.760]  like New Zealand on board has made billions of dollars, I mean that pig, what a joke,
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.400]  you pay him a carbon indulgence, he said hey, they used to pay the Pope 500 years ago indulgence
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:48.600]  to get their family out of purgatory, I guess the Pope voted to get rid of that, so that's
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:57.760]  not there anymore, trapped in purgatory, awaiting the hour of reprisal, the time slips away,
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:07.360]  gotta come in with rainblood, I haven't played that in a while, yeah climate change, 4 trillion
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.840]  carbon taxes needed to save humanity, oh save humanity from global warming as economists,
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:16.560]  I love that they always start with some little number, it's 100 trillion every decade, that's
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:21.280]  what's been proposed, that's what's in it, that's what Davos says for five years, 100
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:25.840]  trillion, 10 trillion a year and that's just a start, you know most taxes start counting
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:34.520]  on a little camel's nose under the tent flap, but not these, but Soros and Yunker, the unelected
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:41.000]  air of all Nazi glute basically, put his little weird Nazi collaborator running around, all
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:45.600]  the leftist is worship, he's a rock star, oh we love you, you're so loving, you're so
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.040]  good, it's like Elvis in the 50s who just thought girls were like throwing their panties at him,
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:54.520]  oh you're a mass murdering, weird creepy guy, screws everybody over, oh yeah he's awesome,
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:05:00.240]  you know, oh please screw us over, please rip me off, meh meh meh meh meh meh,
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:07.040]  Builderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year, this is the first Builderberg
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.720]  meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump election have come to pass,
[1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:16.120]  and the elites now see their power base crumbling before their very eyes, among some of the
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:21.360]  subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration and can he be heel, also
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:26.280]  the rise of populism, elites are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling,
[1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:31.400]  now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending, HR McMaster, Wilbur
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:35.960]  Ross and Chris Liddell, most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help
[1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:41.000]  the elites derail the current administration, there are two ways at which this can go, either
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.440]  the Globals will try to bring Trump to heel or they will try to impeach him after the
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:48.920]  2018 election, you can read more about this in exclusive Builderberg schemes to overthrow
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:54.560]  Trump on infowars.com and ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds, spread this
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:59.360]  link and help wake up some minds, Rob, you're reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly
[1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:00.360]  news.

[1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:09.280]  back in stock at infowarsstore.com, research across the board is clear, when bacteria
[1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:13.320]  infects your gums it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart
[1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:18.200]  attacks, that's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:21.400]  health can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:28.480]  iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:33.040]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:37.720]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath, just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:43.360]  by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more, due to
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:47.200]  requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:48.200]  children.
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:51.840]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free, learn more

[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:17.120]  at info warshore.com.

[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:34.360]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:35.920]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance,
[1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:47.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:51.800]  There's a massive fight for that and people overuse Nazi analogies.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.760]  They use them constantly if you don't want open borders or you don't want high taxes
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:56.680]  or Obamacare, you must be a Nazi.
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:01.560]  But Junker, his grandfather, was one of the top Nazis in Germany.
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:10.120]  They were the top arms producer next to Klump and it's a fact, they are royalty.
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:15.440]  They are basically Prussian royalty and they were the top of the Reich and then his grandfather
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:17.360]  took over Luxembourg by force.
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:22.240]  He basically owns it and runs it today and he's in the unelected EU bureaucracy set
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:27.320]  up at a steel deal back in the 40s, I mean this is crazy.
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:32.560]  And now he's threatening the UK, he's threatening the United States, he's saying, well, economic
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.800]  warfare, I've got some of the incredible statements where he says, we will allow no treaties between
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:42.480]  the UK and the United States with any of our members and he now is setting up his EU army.
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:43.480]  That's right.
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:47.080]  He's trying to expropriate NATO, that's why Trump was having to take NATO to the woodshed
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:52.760]  because, I mean, this is a real power struggle, this is a, I don't want to say it's Nazi,
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:58.520]  but the EU was a Nazi program and it is one of the top heirs to the Nazi fortunes who
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:01.640]  is commanding this and making very erroneous statements.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.320]  Now Nigel Farage is under investigation as a person of interest for the Russians and
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:10.520]  they have congressional hearings where I am and Hillary came out here saying she lost
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:15.160]  because of info wars, but she finally said something true.
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:19.120]  She said, but we know info wars is giving the Russians the attack profile.
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:21.520]  Well, yeah, we're promoting freedom worldwide.
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:22.720]  We hope the Russians pick it up.
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  We're not Russian run.
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:31.440]  We're promoting Magna Carta 1215, we're promoting Declaration of Independence 1776, we're, we're
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:34.880]  promoting the history of the English speaking peoples, which Churchill wrote a three volume
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  book on it.
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.840]  We are promoting the flower of Western Renaissance culture, not the Russians.
[1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:43.680]  And the globalists can't stand against that with their unelected system.
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:50.480]  And now, set in 50 minutes from now, one of the biggest moments in modern history against
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:56.000]  the $100 trillion every decade carbon tax that Deimos has announced, that's what it
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  is.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  They say it's saving polar bears and saving earth.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.200]  No, it's a private global consortium and the man Lord Monk and top advisor to Margaret
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:07.200]  Thatcher fighting this for three decades, since its embryonic level, hundreds of billions
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.720]  have been spent to promote this lie because it's not just taxes, it's total control.
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:15.240]  Now Trump is set to pull out of it and implode it.
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:20.720]  And the elites are beside themselves, the unelected elites, Yonker and others that were
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:26.600]  bumping into Trump and acting tough, unelected schnapps there in the face of someone who
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:31.640]  is elected, totally fearful of forage or they've clearly, the police said have tried to kill
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:38.560]  repeatedly, now trying to imply he's a Russian agent because he's a patriot for the UK.
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:45.440]  These dishonorable scum are so fearful of the return of honorable, truthful men and
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:46.440]  women.
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:47.440]  And it's happening now.
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:53.400]  We are seeing, I believe, a really a new dawn of renaissance if it isn't killed, killed
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:57.120]  in its, you know, bassinet, if it isn't killed embryonically.
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:03.720]  General Christopher Moncton joins us, Science and Public Policy is his excellent website,
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:04.920]  ScienceandPublicPolicy.org.
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:05.920]  Also what's up with that?
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:12.720]  It also works with Mr. Moreno, but I tell you, this is a great day and I certainly want
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:16.480]  to thank Lord Moncton for being the very tip of the spear.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.560]  Well Alex, how wonderful it is to be with you again.
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:26.960]  And yes, it looks as though Mr. Trump is going to ease his way out of the Paris Treaty.
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:32.520]  Whether he'll come out all in one great rush or whether he'll be slightly slow and crafty
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:39.640]  about it and say, well, let's set up a team B to try to have a look at the science from
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:44.520]  both sides rather than only one side before we rush into anything, you might do that.
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.920]  But he's certainly not going to stay enthusiastically in this Paris Accord.
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:53.320]  And of course, as you know, America isn't in the Paris Accord as if it were a treaty
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:57.200]  because it hasn't been ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:01.400]  And I can't think of any circumstance in which the Senate would ever ratify such a treaty.
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:05.680]  And of course, the longer this nonsense goes on, the longer the discrepancy between the
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:11.920]  wild predictions made by the profiteering extremists, the profiteers of doom that I call them, the
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:17.200]  longer the gap between what they predicted and the perfectly calm and sensible weather
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.480]  that we see most of the time.
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:24.600]  The wider that gap becomes, the more difficult it becomes for world leaders who had hoped
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:29.560]  to make their pensions on the strength of this, as you say, this trillions of dollars
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:35.120]  now that are being demanded by the global elite to keep them in clover while the rest
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:37.720]  of us can't even afford to heat our houses.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:43.400]  7,000 Britons died in December a few years ago because we had snow for the whole month
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:44.400]  on the ground.
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:45.400]  Why did they die?
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:51.480]  They didn't die because they were cold.
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.640]  They died because they couldn't afford to heat their homes, and that's why they were
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:55.640]  cold.
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:56.640]  It wasn't because the weather was cold.
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:02.880]  And the trouble is that this murderous policy, for that is what it is, has no scientific
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:05.120]  basis whatsoever.
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:08.160]  And Donald Trump and his team know this.
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:13.280]  I briefed a couple of them in Washington a couple of years ago, and they've kept in
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:16.480]  touch ever since they've watched this unfold.
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:22.000]  And they know, among other things, that I and my team are working on the paper which
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.600]  is going to finally blast the whole nonsense out of this.
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:35.280]  We have now discovered not one, not two, not three, but four serious errors in the way
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:40.760]  they work out how much global warming we can expect to get from, let us say, a doubling
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:43.000]  of the carbon dioxide concentration.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.240]  In the air, they've been trying to say, well, it's somewhere between one and a half and
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:50.720]  four and a half Celsius with the best estimate of three Celsius, and this would bring the
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:53.280]  world to an end by 2100.
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.640]  That's what the profiteering...
[1:14:55.640 --> 1:15:01.520]  And he also said by 2013, he said in the inconvenient load of BS, 2006, that the Antarctic and Arctic
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:03.960]  would no longer have ice caps, and instead they're bigger.
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:05.280]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.960]  Well, the Arctic is not chewing so much ice, but certainly the Antarctic has grown more
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:14.080]  or less consistently, apart from the last year or two.
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:17.360]  Sure, so the Southern has gotten bigger, but I mean, the North's what it was, right?
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:23.200]  He actually said, Stern actually said in a paper called Dietz et al. 2007 that the world
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:24.200]  was going to...
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:29.320]  There was a 10% chance that the world was going to come to an end because of global warming
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:30.320]  by 2100.
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:33.720]  Well, we can now prove that that is not the case.
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:35.200]  It was never likely to be the case anyway.
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:36.200]  But it's so simple.
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:37.200]  We can share.
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:40.920]  Let me get the results out before we talk about it.
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:47.080]  We can now demonstrate and demonstrate formally by a proof that the amount of warming you
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:51.900]  can expect to see, if in all other respects, you believe everything we're told by the
[1:15:51.900 --> 1:15:55.880]  usual suspects, but in the respects where we correct the errors, we make corrections.
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:16:01.680]  We can show that the amount of warming you're going to get per doubling of CO2 is likely
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:07.520]  to be less than one Celsius degree, and it can't even be as much as one and a half.
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.640]  So we're below the entire range of estimates that have been made in the past by the usual
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:13.640]  suspects.
[1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:14.640]  And some of them have been predicting...
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:15.640]  Sure.
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  Let me just jump in here.
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:17.640]  I mean, I understand.
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:18.640] ...predicting 13 Celsius.
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:23.080]  Now, what is happening is that Trump has seen through all this.
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:25.200]  He is not taking any more of this nonsense.
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:30.280]  He is going to say to the world, we've had enough of this, that we are going to be cautious
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:35.640]  because we know how much this upsets the nations who have decided they want to believe in this
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:36.800]  garbage.
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:39.720]  But the fact is, he is going to take a cautious line.
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:42.720]  He's going to say, we'd like to get out of this if we can.
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:45.440]  We're going to look very much more carefully at the science.
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:50.920]  And I think this is a very great moment because at last you have a world leader who is saying
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:56.600]  we are going to look at the science and we're no longer going to listen to the overpaid
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:58.120]  Marxist pressure groups.
[1:16:58.120 --> 1:16:59.680]  That was my next question.
[1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:00.680]  Yeah.
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:01.680]  That was my next question.
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:03.800]  I understand what Skype is hard for you to hear me because the two go over each other.
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:04.800]  That happens.
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:07.000]  But that's where I was going next.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.480]  Look, every time you come on, I know you have signs of public policy.
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:13.400]  I know you've got global papers with top scientists that are the top red papers.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:14.400]  Our listeners know that.
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:15.760]  They know it's a fraud.
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:19.600]  We tactically want you on, somebody that used to be at 10 Downing Street to talk about
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:23.840]  where Europe is, where the EU is, how big you think this is and what Trump's doing.
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:25.080]  You started getting into that.
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:26.080]  We're sold.
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.720]  We know it's been proven right.
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:31.120]  We know that it hasn't been warming for what, you know, 18 years or whatever it is.
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:33.420]  We know they hid the decline in temperature.
[1:17:33.420 --> 1:17:35.360]  We know that, you know, these models are there.
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:39.920]  I mean, I think we've won that war bureaucratically, though, they're still dug in.
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.600]  So what do you make of this?
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:47.120]  Soros says European Union is now in an existential crisis surrounded by hostile powers, the UK
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:48.120]  and the US.
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:49.120]  This is just crazy.
[1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:50.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.120]  Junker is threatening the UK and the US.
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:54.120]  I want you to speak about him specifically and who created the EU.
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:57.440]  What you think they'll do to Trump now because, I mean, clearly you agree with me that this
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:58.440]  is huge.
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:17:59.560]  This is historic.
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:04.080]  This carbon tax is the heart of the private authoritarian corporate world government.
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:06.360]  Well, this is what they wanted to do.
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:10.080]  They wanted to take over the world and set up a global government.
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.040]  That was the phrase that was used in the Copenhagen Treaty in 2009, the treaty that failed.
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:19.560]  They were going to set up a global government on the excuse of this global warming.
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:24.160]  And the reason why I spent a few moments mentioning the paper we're working on is that this major
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:27.200]  discovery we've just made, this is breaking news.
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:29.400]  We can actually prove.
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:35.080]  We can actually prove that global temperature is not even going to rise by as much as one
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:36.080]  or the other.
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:37.080]  Well, then let's spend some more time on that.
[1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:38.080]  I didn't realize this was breaking.
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:39.080]  I mean, because I know the previous science.
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:42.000]  I wouldn't bore you with it otherwise.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.760]  We have been working on this and this is just in the last couple of weeks.
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:45.760]  We've discovered this.
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:51.320]  We are now using national physical laboratories around the world to test this result to make
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:52.320]  sure that we are.
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:53.320]  Give us the one minute summation.
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:54.320]  What has been discovered?
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:59.920]  One minute summation is that we can prove that it's not going to be more than one Celsius
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:04.920]  degree per doubling of CO2 concentration, not the three, five, 10, 30.
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:08.240]  So CO2 really isn't raising temperature much.
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:12.120]  It's not going to raise it by more than one Celsius, even if you believe everything else
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:13.120]  that they say.
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  Once we correct for these areas.
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:16.120]  But how much higher was it in the past?
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:18.400]  Was it hundreds of times higher?
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:19.880]  Now the difference, let me just finish this.
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:23.800]  The difference between our paper and anything else that's been published on this is that
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:33.120]  we are able to prove definitively that for 120 years climate science has got this wrong.
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:37.720]  They've made a series of quite extraordinary errors, which nobody's noticed because they
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:41.760]  borrowed mathematics from somewhere else without understanding it.
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:46.800]  And we're having a great difficulty persuading peer reviewers to understand this.
[1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:49.960]  But they are gradually getting there and this will be published quite shortly.
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:53.960]  And when it is, this will be the end- Okay, well, stay there then.
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:54.960]  I'm intrigued.
[1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:55.960]  I understand why you're so excited then.
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:19:57.360]  I didn't realize this was a whole new paper.
[1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:00.080]  I know there were all these others proving this, but you're saying this is all new.
[1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:01.080]  We'll be back with that straight ahead.
[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:03.640]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:05.760]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:07.960]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:09.920]  Find your happiness with pure soap.
[1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:14.680]  These all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps are the very best you've ever used.

[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:04.580]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[1:22:04.580 --> 1:22:06.160]  Those times may be near.
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:10.200]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:11.840]  and North Korea.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:16.640]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:20.440]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  from a single cyber attack.
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:26.640]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide

[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:07.800]  All right, Donald Trump coming up, about an hour and a half, we're going to carry the
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:12.160]  press conference here live, they've just been implementing us into this treaty without ever
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:15.000]  actually ratifying it, but he's saying we're not going to go along with this, just like
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.520]  Obama was shutting down our whole power plants.
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:20.720]  I want to get into your paper that he says is going to be out very, very soon Lord Mockton,
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:24.360]  very, very exciting to hear even more evidence of this, but obviously this is all just a
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:28.840]  power grab, they admit that's what it is, but briefly you're an expert on the EU globalism,
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:32.400]  you helped Margaret Thatcher come to her conclusion and not be part of it early on, and to kind
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:37.640]  of stave it off and not be part of Bilderberg, Junker, his arrogant statements about going
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:43.160]  after the UK, going after the US, trade war, EU armies, I mean I don't think people realize
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:48.960]  how epic the history is, we're witnessing of this unelective bureaucracy and Soros saying
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:53.560]  that it is collapsing, what would you say about this period we're in and just briefly
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:25:00.280]  the history of the EU, I mean is it not a dream of the bureaucrats of Nazi Germany?
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:06.520]  Well first of all, you're quite right, the links between totalitarianism in Europe and
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:12.280]  the establishment of the EU are entirely clear, although the EU was originally founded as
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:16.320]  the European Coal and Steel community to make sure there was enough supplies of coal and
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:22.160]  steel for the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, it then became transmogrified
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  into an unelected tyranny by clerk, a dictatorship, which can make laws, there is a European parliament
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.720]  but it can't even bring forward a bill, it's an extraordinary entity and in any case the
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:40.640]  unelected commissars, and I couldn't really name all that many of them, who run this from
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.000]  behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms, these commissars who are just like the Politburo
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.560]  of the Soviet Union, so the Constitution of the Soviet Union when that collapsed was
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:55.880]  picked up by the European Union, and so we now have this totalitarian constitution where
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:01.440]  the unelected bureaucrats can overrule any decision of the elected European parliament
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:05.080]  and of course they also have the right to overrule the parliaments of all the member states.
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:10.120]  And let me stop you there, let me stop you there because what you said is exactly right,
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:16.120]  European Union, EU, China, unite behind Paris climate deal as Trump mulls US withdrawal,
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.720]  we have the communist Chinese dictator at the Debo's meeting two months ago saying don't
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:24.880]  worry, we'll keep America in line, I mean this is literally a new axis of evil, then
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:30.240]  I have Juncker quoted here saying that we will not allow any, the UK or the US have
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.080]  any treaties with any member of the EU, I mean this is, I think this is an unelected
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:41.360]  guy saying this, is this not classical dictatorship of a, what would you call it, a type of bureaucratic
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  oligarchy?
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:47.400]  Well, this is exactly what is it, tyranny by clerk is what I call it, these are jumped
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:54.400]  up little nobodies who are dictating to the world because they couldn't get elected themselves
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:59.200]  and so from the sidelines they go into these great corporatist entities like the World
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:06.360]  Bank and the EU and the UN and then increasingly we are foolish enough to transfer powers like
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:11.360]  the powers in the Paris treaty to these unelected bureaucrats and then if we want to say well
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:15.560]  actually you don't need those powers anymore, the science has collapsed and we're going
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:19.600]  to come out of that treaty, just look at how they start blubbing as they realise they're
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:23.200]  no longer going to get the trillions they thought they were going to get because let's
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.800]  make no mistake about this, who was going to pay for the Paris treaty, it wasn't going
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:32.440]  to be the French, it wasn't going to be the Brits, it was going to be you, the Americans.
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:40.280]  The whole idea of this climate change nonsense is to take America down, that's why Mr. Obama
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:44.640]  who hated America with every fibre of his being, that's why he said he was going to
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:50.360]  have a war on coal, not just because coal owners were the biggest contributors to his
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:55.360]  enemies, the Republican Party, but because he knew if he could destroy America's energy
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:28:00.400]  supply and increase the price and make America uncompetitive that would be the end of the
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:06.320]  United States, that is the objective here, it's got nothing whatsoever to do with the
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:07.320]  climate.
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:09.400]  And by the way Lord Monkton we're going to go to break new five more minutes on the
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:13.440]  Saturday, ten more, on your new research and the scientists and the big paper I know you
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:17.920]  got published in China's biggest scientific journal, just to kind of give us a review
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:21.400]  of where the science is because it really is open and shut at this point and then I'm
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:24.200]  going to ask you what is the main driver, obviously the sun but I'd like you to elaborate
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.880]  and list some of the top scientists you're working with, but just briefly, we're going
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:31.440]  to come back and do it and I'll give you the four of five minutes to cover it, but haven't
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:34.840]  you, we already really won here, I mean they've gone from global freezing to warming, now
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:38.600]  climate change, well we know climate change is happening, this is not man-made, we can't
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:43.160]  control it, I mean how would they admit it when they just say it's not climate change
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:44.920]  but they were full of bull?
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.560]  The problem with the Territarians is that once they have decided on a thing then they
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:56.520]  will not let go, they're not concerned with reason, the one thing that will stop them
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:03.960]  is if we can prove scientifically, prove mathematically that they were incorrect, that they were basing
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:09.480]  their assumption of large amounts of warming on mathematical errors that they and their
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:14.160]  predecessors have made for the past 120 years, that's what's unique about this, we're going
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:19.360]  to prove that they got it wrong, whether they got it wrong deliberately or accidentally,
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:23.600]  we can't prove one way or the other, then no doubt that will now be investigated, what
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:26.640]  we can do is prove that they were wrong.
[1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.200]  But you do have a mind to define?
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:33.000]  That if it's available, this is going to change everything, because suddenly with all these
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:37.480]  people who are posturing and whining like Junker and so forth and telling Mr. Trump where
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:43.720]  to get off, he's going to be able to say to them no, we've got research that shows that
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:47.880]  this is simply wrong, you're going to have to look at that search and if you find it
[1:29:47.880 --> 1:29:50.200]  is wrong, then that's the end of it and you can understand it.
[1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:52.840]  We're going to be right, stay right there, I want to come back and talk about the actual
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:53.840]  research.
[1:29:53.840 --> 1:30:01.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:07.000]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year, this is the first Bilderberg
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.720]  meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump election have come to pass and
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.640]  the elites now see their power base crumbling before their very eyes.
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:20.240]  Among some of the subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration and can he
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:21.240]  be Heel?
[1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:26.400]  Also the rise of populism, elites are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling.
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:31.320]  Now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending HR McMaster, Wilbur
[1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:33.400]  Ross and Chris Liddell.
[1:30:33.400 --> 1:30:38.040]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:39.040]  administration.
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:43.000]  There are two ways at which this can go, either the Globals will try to bring Trump to Heel
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.880]  or they will try to impeach him after the 2018 election.
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.800]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on Infowars.com

[1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:37.080]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:43.320]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys, I love the Infowars true and I just want to

[1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:30.600]  synthetic materials ever created called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:33.520]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:37.560]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:39.520]  of advanced, lightweight armor.
[1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:40.520]  It works.
[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:44.120]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest-level
[1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:49.040]  ballistic-resistant certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:53.800]  Defender Body Armor is now available through Infowarsstore.com, so you can defend yourself,
[1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:58.360]  your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalist all at the same time.
[1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:05.360]  A total of 361.
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:39.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the jewel in the crown, the entire superstructure, the skeleton of
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:45.600]  world government, is this global carbon tax, and it's to be selectively enforced, just
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:49.400]  like General Electric got waivers and kept all its power plants open and saw their competition
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:50.400]  shut down.
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:52.880]  They made tens of billions, and they gouged this on power prices.
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:57.040]  This is just one example of not building an economy based on competition, but an economy
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:59.480]  based on shutting down your competition.
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.600]  Look at Venezuela.
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.480]  Look at every steel mill in England shut down and literally shipped to India, where they
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:09.000]  have no carbon controls.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.720]  If you hear it from me, I think Lord Moncton's wrong, and I say that the nice way.
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.040]  I mean, I think he's right, but I think, and I'm going to go to him in a moment after I
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:22.280]  plug here, I think he's wrong to think the main argument is it's all a fraud.
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:24.080]  We know it's a fraud.
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:25.080]  We've proven it.
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:26.080]  He's proven it.
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  The power plants is clear.
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:31.040]  They keep saying it's not clear on their side because it's clear on ours, but it's
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:35.520]  the con game that all these third world countries are exempt and the elites are making money
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:41.320]  off this with carbon exchanges, private companies getting your tax money, passed on from the
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:46.160]  pump and passed on from your house and passed on from everything you do.
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:47.160]  That's why it's a fraud.
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:48.680]  It's only done to certain countries.
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:50.360]  The elites are making money off of it.
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:51.720]  That's what kills it.
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:53.760]  Sure, showing that polar bears can swim.
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:55.440]  We're going to go to Lord Moncton in just a moment.
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:58.080]  I just wanted to throw that out there and then go to him and let him stew for a moment
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:01.280]  and then we'll let him get into a science, but also just the political obviousness of
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:02.280]  these villains.
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:06.000]  Before you go any further, we're listening to supporting Hillary Clinton came out and
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.040]  said she lost the election because the info wars yesterday and she claimed that I'm advising
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:10.040]  the Russians.
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:14.400]  Maxine Waters says that they're telling us what to do, but now no, no, we're telling
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:15.400]  Putin what to do.
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:18.360]  I think the science is telling, I'm not a Russia file.
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:21.280]  I don't like all the stuff Putin does, but he does say carbon taxes are about shutting
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.840]  down nation states and bankrupting the population.
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:28.480]  People get Lord Moncton to take on that, but big anti-communist is his own right.
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:30.480]  The Russians aren't communist now, but he'll be called a communist.
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:35.000]  I guess we're all Russians now if we don't want to pay George Soros or Bill Clinton money
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:39.440]  or Al Gore, but we've extended the Memorial Day special.
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:41.840]  Some of these specials are the biggest we've ever had.
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:45.320]  Silver bullet, colloidal silver, super high quality, 65% off.
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:47.920]  You do auto ship, sign up for the next shipment.
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:48.920]  You get 10% off.
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:49.920]  It's 75% off.
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:50.920]  We've never done anything like that.
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:56.080]  Supermobile vitalities back in stock is known concentrated essential oil herbs that basically
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:58.200]  help clean out your body and boost your libido stamina.
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:35:59.200]  You name it.
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:03.720]  Survival Shield X2, the amazing, purest iodine out there, totally organic deep breath crystal
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:08.920]  source that is now back in stock 40% off.
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:14.440]  Again, these things show out, but we want you to try them and then sign up and keep using
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:16.680]  them so we can build the operation and get you great products.
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.560]  It's a win-win brain force, great, new tropic with a whole bunch of known good things for
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:21.560]  your brain.
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:26.440]  47% off, secret 12, 43% off, knockout, just has nine different things like the Valyrian
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:31.920]  root, L-trip to fan, melatonin, but it's $19 normally.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:35.400]  It's the same dose of melatonin in there that people pay $19 for.
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:38.720]  This has eight other things in it and it's $19.95.
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:41.880]  It's now $9.95, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:44.360]  All in four-wars Trump shirts that are selling now better than ever.
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.720]  Trump's kind of gotten really popular again as he's taken action.
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:55.200]  They're still at cost 75% off, $495, and we've got all the new shirts in that say CNN terrorist
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:59.920]  with the lady, simulating murdering Trump, because that's the new meme to show that it
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:01.080]  is the media that's the enemy.
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:03.520]  We've got our $200,000 contest we just launched.
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:09.120]  Can't wait to see folks start getting on national TV legally and lawfully, saying CNN is terrorist
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.320]  media, is fake news, is the enemy of the American people, infowars.com.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:19.480]  You get $1,000 if you show the shirt with infowars.com on it as well, and that CNN is
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:21.240]  a terrorist organization against America.
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:26.320]  You get $2,500 if you get it audibly out two or three times.
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:28.520]  A lot of folks get it out once, I still pay out.
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:33.640]  We paid $140,000 out our contest last year, Bill Clinton's a rapist, they want to play
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:37.320]  games, we're going to head up against them, and I got a contest for even more vicious
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:40.000]  than this if they want to keep playing games and threatening me and all the rest are crap
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  behind the scenes.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  You want to fight, you got one.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.640]  Have you figured it out yet, the intimidation doesn't work, dummies.
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:47.440]  The next contest will be a million dollars if you keep pushing.
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:50.640]  It's not because I'm Mr. Tough Guy, I know you're a bunch of scum.
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:53.640]  Keep flying around on Jerry Epstein's pedophile plane and get out of my way.
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:57.920]  Keep showing us off to your little jihadi buddies and just blew up the situation over
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:02.240]  in Manchester, keep making your excuses about that and go hang out with Ariana Grande.
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:06.880]  She hates America and she hates Christians and she hates her effing fans and hopes they
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:08.680]  effing die.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.840]  This liberal elite is so narcissistic and disconnected, it makes me sick, so thanks
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:18.440]  for your support everybody, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139, you'll get great products
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:23.600]  and know you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight as shock troops to expose globalism.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:28.640]  Now scienceandpublicpolicy.org, what's up with that.com, the leading fighter of the
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.680]  global government, carbon fraud, Lord Monkton, so people just tuned in, I think we should
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:37.320]  go for the political lies, how the elites are making money on this, you know, we already
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:40.800]  know from hide the decline in their own documents, it's a fraud, other studies that are out there
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:43.720]  but I know you've been at the tip of the spear with top researchers, publishing in
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:47.840]  top journals, you say you've got a new mega findings that have just been discovered coming
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:51.960]  out soon so tell us about that sir.
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:57.600]  The most important thing you need to know is that yes you're right that of course we
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:02.400]  can say they're all making money out of it and so they are but the only way to stop them
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:08.480]  and stop them quickly is to prove that they are wrong and they thought they could get
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:13.200]  away with making a waffling story that is very hard to prove wrong and they'd get away
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:14.200]  with it.
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:19.520]  However, they made several large errors which have taken us a lot, it's taken me eleven
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:25.440]  years to find these errors, I've been working quietly away at it, we've finally got there,
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:31.320]  we know what they did wrong, we know how big this is, what it means is that the yes you'll
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:35.840]  get a little bit of warmer weather as a result of putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:41.440]  but it's not going to be much more than kind of one Celsius for every doubling of CO2 concentration,
[1:39:41.440 --> 1:39:46.400]  you're looking at one Celsius of warming over the next 100 to 150 years, it's not exactly
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:52.320]  anything that really needs to be worried about and here's the difference Alex, we can prove
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:56.880]  it, I'm not going to go into the weeds of how we've proved it, that will be for the
[1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:01.360]  scientists to pick through once we publish but the point is that this is different from
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:06.040]  just saying well it's probably not going to happen as they say, we can prove that it's
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:13.240]  not going to happen as they say because their estimates are based on these four huge errors
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:18.520]  in the models calculations that we have now found, we've calculated them, we've been to
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:23.400]  our national science laboratories on both sides of the Atlantic to get confirmation
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:28.920]  of our understanding of what we found, that's not to say they will endorse what we found,
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:33.240]  they don't do that but they will do measurements for us, we've had them done and what those
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:40.320]  measurements show is that we are right about this and once this paper is out there then
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:44.760]  everyone who goes around saying there's a 97% consensus and Trump was toe the line with
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.320]  the rest of the world community, all he needs is this one paper and all he has to do is
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:56.880]  to give this to anyone who tries to say that to him, junk or whoever and say go away, get
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:03.000]  your scientists to read this and come back and tell me if I am wrong and of course they
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.400]  won't be able to because this is a formal mathematical and physical proof and that's
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:13.320]  the difference, nearly every paper until now on climate science has been speculations
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:17.480]  being saying well we think this might happen and we think the other will happen and some
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:21.200]  of the observations point this way and some of the observations point that way, what we
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:26.600]  have done is to go right back to the theory to look at the theory that they are using
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:30.880]  to multiply up how much warming we are going to get from the very small effect you get
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:37.400]  just from the CO2 itself and we have found that to put it really at its simplest, Alex,
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:45.280]  they screwed up and we can prove it and what that means is that once this paper is published
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:50.080]  and it can't be stopped, eventually it will be published, not long away now I think, once
[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:54.880]  it's published then that's the end of the climate scale, you watch how quickly it collapses
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:59.760]  after this comes out because however much they may want to go on making money out of
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.360]  this, there will no longer be any reason to have a UN Framework Convention on Climate
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:09.680]  Change, that was based on these mistakes, no longer any need for an IPCC, no longer
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:14.280]  need for the Paris Accord or any of the other plethora of treaties by which just like the
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:18.560]  EU, a treaty here, a treaty there until suddenly all your freedoms are gone, they were doing
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:25.120]  that on a world scale with this climate thing, all of that will now come to an end because
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:28.440]  we can prove that they were wrong.
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:33.080]  This is over, Alex, it's over and it's all over by the shouting, we've got to publish
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:39.280]  the paper, sure, but we've had it read by the greatest experts in the world on the particular
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:41.120]  kind of mathematics we're looking at.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.600]  So let's be clear, you've already published with other scientists some of the top, I'm
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:49.280]  not saying that some of the, in fact, don't you have the most read paper in the world?
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.200]  Well on, yes, in the Chinese Science Bulletin, which is the Science Bulletin of the Chinese
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.520]  Academy of Sciences, the world's largest scientific academy, we published a paper a
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:06.080]  couple of years ago which was so popular around the world that it had been read by 12 times
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:14.080]  as many people as any other paper in the entire history, the 60-year archive of that distinguished
[1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:15.080]  journal.
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:18.960]  I mean, this is the world's largest Academy of Sciences, they don't suffer fools gladly.
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:22.280]  We had quite a time getting it through peer review because we were saying then we were
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:26.960]  beginning to point to some of the areas of the mathematics that we're looking at.
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:31.360]  And then I wrote a further paper which was published in the Energy and Environment Journal
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.720]  again a couple of years ago which said, look, there are problems with this mathematics here
[1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:39.520]  and what the problems are and we can't yet see what they've done wrong.
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:40.520]  Can anyone?
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:41.520]  Sure, sure.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:42.520]  I mean, the truth is we don't know, but we know.
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:44.600]  Someone came forward and they said, you need to read this textbook.
[1:43:44.600 --> 1:43:49.360]  I read it and the moment I saw it, I saw what they'd done wrong and we've done the math
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:51.120]  and well, that's the end of it.
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.320]  And that's coming out in the next few weeks, but just getting back to the beginning was
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:54.320]  very exciting.
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:00.720]  Just in closing here, I want folks to know history's happening right now and they've
[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:05.240]  spent how many decades and how many, I know it's over $100 billion, big central banks,
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:11.480]  pushing the carbon tax and pushing this planetary regime and to monitor all the nations and
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.000]  make the nations go under it.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:17.560]  So beyond the tax, it's the global control, it's the global court, it's the global enforcement,
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:20.960]  it's the climate crimes, all that's happening.
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.880]  This is so big, Trump's doing this, A, and then B, every time you're on, I get tweets
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:30.480]  and emails and on the street people go, next time Moncton's on, bring up this.
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:35.800]  And I know there's people that think every ice crystal trail is some type of weather
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:39.880]  modification, but they have patents, they admit there's barium salts, lino dioxide,
[1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:46.760]  they admit there's massive weather mod going on, Bill Gates is involved, Dubai's involved,
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:53.040]  China's involved, they've got antenna arrays that are manipulating the ions and the nuclei,
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:56.880]  you know, I guess mimicking some of the things that solar radiation does.
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:59.480]  We know when there's a big solar flare, we have thunderstorms or whatever.
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:01.320]  I mean, this has all been documented.
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:07.160]  They're artificially manipulating the weather already and we know there's a UN climate manipulation
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:12.120]  weather weapon 1979 treaty introduced in 1978, passed in 1979.
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:15.880]  So we know this is going on, it's very secretive, so then people exaggerate because they don't
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:19.840]  know what's really going on, but from your deep research into climate, do you have any
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:22.200]  comments on how that might be affecting things?
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:28.840]  Yeah, the first thing is that we are far smaller and far less powerful in affecting the climate
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:30.640]  than they think.
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:36.920]  And that's why they can't do much more than a little bit of silver iodide dropped on the
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:40.440]  clouds to make them rain when you have a drought in a local area.
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:46.360]  You can't do anything worldwide to alter the weather, however hard you try.
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.080]  And this is really the result of our research.
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:52.920]  You can just see that there is a kind of inbuilt stability to the climate system, which means
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:56.640]  that short of letting off every nuclear bomb around the world and go on doing that every
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:58.920]  day for the next 400 years.
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:01.440]  That's right, we wouldn't have this ancient planet with an ancient atmosphere if it wasn't
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:03.680]  a very stable position.
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:04.680]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:06.120]  I mean, you're quite right.
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:10.600]  Here we are, four and a half billion years on, okay, there may be a few people who think
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:14.880]  it's only 6,000 because they believe in the rather balmy calculations of an Anglican
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:16.280]  divine in the 17th century.
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:19.720]  I was about to say, the Bible doesn't say that, the Bible doesn't say that some preacher
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:20.720]  did.
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:22.600]  That's right, it was Bishop Asher.
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:26.680]  He was a very worthy, amiable divine, and he just amused himself by calculating how
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:30.440]  many generations there'd been since Abraham in the Bible, and from that he worked out
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:36.080]  that the world was created on the 15th of April, 4,004 BC.
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:40.160]  And there are even Bibles of the period, I've got one, which show every date thereafter
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:44.680]  from 4,004 BC until the time of Christ, all written into the margins, and it's all very
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:45.680]  silly.
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:49.400]  But the point is, this is a very old planet, it's a very stable planet.
[1:46:49.400 --> 1:46:53.840]  To destabilize it, you'd need to do something to the sun, you'd need to have a big asteroid
[1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:57.720]  hitting us, we'd need to go through a large cloud of intergalactic dust, there'd need
[1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:02.400]  to be an enormous super volcano eruption, these are the things that can alter the climate.
[1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:09.960]  But altering one part in 2,000 of the composition of the atmosphere over the next 150 years
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:15.440]  is not going to make any difference at all, and as I say, the magic thing about our paper
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:19.840]  is that we can prove it, and it's already beginning to worry people, because they've
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:23.520]  begun to hear about it, I've given a couple of talks about it, but the latest thing that
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:29.600]  we've found just in the last couple of weeks shows the stakes are even bigger than we thought,
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:33.840]  and therefore we are now just concluding our research in the next couple of days, then it
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:36.920]  goes off to the journal for a peer review, and if there's a...
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:41.040]  We'll have you on that, but we're almost out of time, let me just say this, when you've
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:45.120]  got six years ago, the main group coordinating the universities globally saying let's hide
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:50.120]  the decline, I think it's pretty clear they know this is a joke, but I mean I don't
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  think we can prove it, that's the difference, once they know we can prove it, once they
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:01.920]  know we know what they did wrong, once they know that anyone who in future tries to say
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:06.200]  that we are going to have a significant impact on the climate will be laughed at because
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:10.240]  there is no scientific basis for it, there's my final two questions, the one thing these
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:13.480]  people don't like is to be laughed at, and they're going to be if they try to position
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:16.440]  this line in your look, they don't like being questioned, they say every scientist agrees
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.080]  when almost none of them actually agree with them, but now we can prove that they're wrong.
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:25.200]  Sure, okay, now let me do these two final or skypes a little bit off here so I hope
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:29.840]  you can hear me, yeah, I know there's different numbers from ice cores and mud cores and other
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.720]  things that they've done, the numbers hundreds of times, the CO2 in our history, and that
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:40.280]  didn't make the planet overheat too much, in fact a lot of scientists and climatologists
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:45.120]  I've read believe if CO2 tripled or quadrupled it would make plants grow faster, make the
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  oceans more healthy, and that they believe the planet's so old that we're actually in
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:54.160]  a carbon-starved position and down the road could off gas and even end up like Mars that
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:57.880]  clearly lost its atmosphere, I know you've talked to climatologists, you've talked to
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:02.120]  solar, you know solar physicists, you've talked to astrophysicists, I mean I don't know.
[1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:04.520]  Yeah, let me give you some figures on this, it's very interesting, I mean you're quite
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:09.520]  right, Patrick Moore, the founder of Greenpeace, who is of course no longer with Greenpeace
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.640]  because he doesn't believe in global warming, he has done a very interesting paper which
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:17.680]  I helped him write, which shows that over the last 2,000 years, about 2 million years
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.960]  I should say, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily declining, almost to the
[1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:26.280]  point where plants were being starved of it, now we're putting more CO2 into the atmosphere,
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:29.840]  everything grows like billiard in the garden, don't we ever have time to plant a garden,
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.440]  but if you do, everything grows much faster now because of what's called CO2 fertilization,
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:39.800]  CO2 is plant food, the paradoxical thing about this is that we know now from the satellites
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:45.440]  that CO2 is greening the planet, you can see it from outer space, areas like this.
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:49.800]  So shouldn't we actually terraform, or what do they call it, if you've already got an
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:53.160]  atmosphere, shouldn't we geo-engineer with more of it?
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:56.920]  Of course we should, and that's what we're doing of course, because despite all the preaching
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:02.120]  and the winning from these profiteers of doom, everybody is burning more fossil fuels,
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:06.800]  there's a God involved, and the climate is responding very favorably because everything
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:12.040]  is growing at a rate it's never grown in our lifetime, this is a thoroughly good thing,
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:16.680]  and you're quite glad at it, the growth is quite staggering, the total plant biomass
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:21.560]  of the earth has gone up by something like 15 to 30% in the last 100 years.
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:25.080]  What about the cycle, aren't we due for a new ice age?
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:30.200]  Well who can tell, it's 5,000 years overdue, so don't hold your breath.
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:33.800]  But we should actually be worried about cooling then, I mean that's what the evidence shows.
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.920]  Cooling is the real killer, cooling is the real killer, if the planet were to cool even
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:43.640]  by as little as one Celsius degree, large amounts of agricultural area would disappear,
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:48.080]  and that would impose real strain on the populations of the world.
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:52.600]  Thank you Lord Moncton, thank you so much, big day with President Trump, thank you so
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.000]  much for your work bringing us to this point, and the listeners, we're all in this together
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:59.200]  ladies and gentlemen, we're making history, we're changing things, we're on the march,
[1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:01.440]  the empire's on the run.
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:06.440]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:11.200]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:16.120]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:18.640]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:23.160]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:24.160]  across America.

[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:06.560]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:11.200]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:14.800]  hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:18.720]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:21.520]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had

[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:53.320]  I'll be close to John Rapport in the fourth hour today because Trump's gonna be giving
[1:54:53.320 --> 1:55:02.240]  his announcement on the carbon tax, driving a big giant steak right into the heart of
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:06.200]  the funding system, the blood supply for the cancer that is the new world order.
[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:12.000]  If he does this and he's able to execute it, it's just incredible.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  Trump is for real.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.400]  Does it mean he's perfect?
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:21.720]  I'm not in the cult of some follower, I'm not in the cult of some leader, I'm not a
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:23.520]  follower.
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:27.880]  The elites genuinely want him dead, the elites genuinely got beaten, the elites are genuinely
[1:55:27.880 --> 1:55:29.800]  upset about what he's doing.
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:33.480]  He's just business-like and wants prosperity and isn't out to kill economies and pick winters
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:40.320]  and losers and screw people over because Trump's dad was super hardcore and his brother tried
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:45.400]  to suppress him and his dad was meaner and held to him for a long time to make him strong
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:51.400]  and Trump dominated him both by the end basically and dominated him in a nice way but he just
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:59.680]  thrives in a very, very serious environment and his dad came up as a German immigrant
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:05.760]  becoming a successful builder in a very, very rough New York area and the word is it was
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:08.600]  a lot of behind the scenes stuff.
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.760]  They didn't just let you go around and build stuff, you had to fight for it and so his
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.280]  dad was super hard-nosed, Trump's been hard-nosed, the family's hard-nosed, they're hard-working,
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:27.400]  so he's the blue-collar billionaire and they started crying on Memorial Day when the memorial
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:30.400]  for dead trips was coming by, in fact the only time you ever really seen him get emotional
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:32.560]  like that, we ought to pull that up, Trump crying.
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:42.360]  I was not here Tuesday to play the clip because I was dealing with the family issues.
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:46.160]  By the way, I'm not going to make comments on my divorce case which has been over for
[1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:51.480]  two and a half years and the custody battle for my children other than just to say that
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:58.920]  you notice there's no news about the Tuesday hearing, you notice there's nothing.
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:02.360]  All the big leftist sites celebrating I'm a bad dad, I was going to lose my kids, the
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:11.480]  media made all that up, all of it made up, totally made up and I wish my ex-wife well
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:17.560]  and I am hoping that things can work out and get better and I'm not going to get into
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:22.440]  the judge's ruling because the judge did not bar us from getting into it, I'm just going
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:29.880]  to say that the children are where they were and that we are working to unify them more
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:38.640]  with their mother and that's the bottom line but the media tried to destroy me and my children
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:39.640]  and they failed.
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:43.760]  So, this is about my family and my privacy and I'm all about privacy for everybody else.
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:47.560]  I'm all against the NSH buying and I'm all against leaving the general public alone,
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:52.040]  their families alone until they get in the political arena and so I've asked folks to
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:56.960]  you know give us that privacy but I appreciate your prayers and your support because it's
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:06.960]  really meant a lot and I've also been impressed with the judicial system at least in this
[1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:09.880]  case.
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:12.840]  People run the judicial system down a lot, I do quite a bit the night circuit and things
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:22.480]  but extremely intelligent, extremely, extremely fair so that's all I have to say on that
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:30.440]  point but I tell you God loves drunks, children in the United States of America and let me
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:37.000]  tell you I'm so humble because my whole life, I've had so much providence, it's just humbling.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:40.440]  We're going to take your calls and get to a lot of news in a third hour, stand by, I'll
[1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:44.560]  give the number out when we come back, infowars.com, please spread that URL, we're trying to shut

[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:57.280]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lessington
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:01.920]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:05.560]  hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.480]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:12.280]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:17.320]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had

[1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:24.560]  line and didn't talk but took action.

[1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:53.840]  true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[1:59:53.840 --> 2:00:10.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:15.360]  This is it boys, total co-combat with the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:25.120]  Because there's a war on for your mind, June 1, 2017, I was starting to quote Slim Pickens
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:34.480]  from the Doctor Strange Love, this is it boys, toe-to-toe nuclear war with the Ruskies.
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:40.400]  This is it boys, toe-to-toe battle with the globalist in information war and they are
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:46.040]  preparing the riots all over the news, they're preparing the race war, they're in full attack
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:52.000]  against the family trying to wreck the youth before they achieve real consciousness.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:01:01.360]  They are strutting around roaring like a lion seeing who they can devour.
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:12.560]  I have a true sense of satisfaction in that my common sense understanding that if we could
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:20.200]  just expose the fact that there's a global government and that it's corporate and that
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:24.520]  it's unelected and that it's tax exempt and that it has diplomatic immunity, that it's
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:31.600]  the new royalty, that that's so uncool and so out of control and what it wants to do
[2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:40.920]  to us make us poor and then reduce our population, that dog's not going to hunt if somebody stands
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:42.080]  up and calls it out.
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:44.840]  But they'd play this game of saying it didn't exist, oh there's no Bilderberg, oh there's
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:48.360]  no, I mean Al Gore would testify six, seven years ago that there was no carbon tax when
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:51.880]  he owns the big one in Chicago and the big one in London, it's actually called blood
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:59.200]  and gore or gore and blood because of the partners name blood and it's made billions
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:07.880]  of dollars for that jerk off and I call him the jerk off because I mean he's this big
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:17.200]  goofy con man whose daddy was the right hand man for Armand Hammer who was the right hand
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:26.640]  man for the Soviets and forced labor camps, I mean these are bad people, run around wanting
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:33.200]  carbon taxes, he owns Occidental Petroleum, did you know that and they're one of these
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:37.000]  families that's so rich that their wealth's not even known, it's like the Bushes, the
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:44.040]  Bushes made deals with the, well with a lot of people with Klaus Barbie who's a low level
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:51.000]  guy but with Joseph Mengele who was royal and with the Angel of Death and of course
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:59.760]  with Junker and all the usual scumbags, they just think they're better than everybody
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:09.520]  and just strut around pulling their crap, an unelected EU threatening Trump and threatening
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:24.680]  us and you know what, if we roll over to Junker, we deserve what we get and I look at the Germans,
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:35.840]  smart good people, hell I, a lot of my lineage is German, Prussian, Alsatian but I look at
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:45.160]  the Germans and what they put up with and how they're so domesticated but then I guess
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:51.120]  we didn't lose 21 million people in World War II, Germany was 70 million people, they
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:57.280]  lost 21 million, that'll get you to, that'll get you in line on that and they sure followed
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:01.560]  their orders too, they followed orders and 21 million got killed and they're still following
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:11.360]  orders, I guess Braveria is kind of like the Texas of Germany, so people, that's kind
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:15.640]  of the wall, people don't follow rules much there, I lived in Germany, I probably live
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:22.680]  in Braveria but man, just the Germans are so smart, nation by nation, one of the highest
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:32.360]  IQ pronations in the world but they follow orders off the edge of a cliff, I mean what
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:38.680]  is Germany doing paying the bill for the EU with some jerk Junker who like, his family
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:44.320]  hijacked Luxemburg so he runs that, he runs the EU and never got it, it's like dude get
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:50.040]  out of there you unelected rat, it's over, it's gone, we're calling it out so there's
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:56.000]  the big satisfaction, is that I knew if you exposed globalism and the fact it was unelected,
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:01.640]  it'd be game over, we're gonna go to break, we're gonna go to break right now.
[2:05:01.640 --> 2:05:17.800]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting, among some of the subjects of the secret confab
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:23.320]  will be the Trump administration and can he be heel, also the rise of populism, elites
[2:05:23.320 --> 2:05:27.360]  are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling, now three members of the
[2:05:27.360 --> 2:05:32.080]  current Trump administration are going to be attending, HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross and
[2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:36.600]  Chris Liddell, most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites
[2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:41.040]  derail the current administration, there are two ways at which this can go, either the
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:44.360]  globalists will try to bring Trump to heel or they will try to impeach him after the
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.840]  2018 election, you can read more about this at exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow
[2:05:48.840 --> 2:05:54.480]  Trump on infowars.com and ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds, spread this

[2:05:58.840 --> 2:06:00.840]  nightly news.

[2:06:07.040 --> 2:06:11.720]  and Concord, right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[2:06:11.720 --> 2:06:16.960]  hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice, that's what this holiday and remembrance
[2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:21.160]  is all about, is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:26.560]  a better world, this group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest

[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:05.720]  The reason info wars life has 5 star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[2:07:05.720 --> 2:07:09.520]  products I'm going to use for my family, I take this, my family takes this and then it
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:13.120]  funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful information you're going to find

[2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:27.640]  iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:32.720]  Yeah I've actually just run out of my super female, I had a few bottles at my house and
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:38.040]  I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great,
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:43.680]  looking good and I know my hair is a little luxurious once again so obviously the super
[2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:45.800]  female is amazing, I love it.
[2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:50.640]  Nascent iodine is essential, survival shield x2, if there's one product that I would say
[2:07:50.640 --> 2:07:55.520]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield x2, it's got
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:08:15.200]  a 5 star rating, it's a win win infowarslife.com.
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:26.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:38.880]  Hollywood, Babylon, Hollywood, is that Elvis?
[2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:44.200]  Alright let's get serious, Darren McBreen, he doesn't usually do this, he's a great guy,
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:48.320]  one of our better editors and researchers, they're all excellent but he put together
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:53.720]  this ultimate Maxine Waters cringe fest video slash audio, it's up on infowars.com if you're
[2:08:53.720 --> 2:08:59.840]  a radio listener, you want to see it, it is Mad Maxine, the Maxine Waters movie, then
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:07.600]  we're going to come back and take your phone calls 800-25-992-31800-2599231, your call's
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:13.640]  coming up after this but here it is, a lot of time in the making, it's powerful, Mad
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:15.640]  Maxine.
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:10:05.600]  I made it, I have a right to my anger, I call it rebellion.
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:10.760]  Chapter 1, my name is Mad Maxine, the disproportionate numbers of black males that are in prisons
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.880]  around this country are in prisons because they don't have the wealth by which to get
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:22.600]  fancy lawyers who will go in and ensure that they buy justice for them as white folks can
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:23.600]  do in America.
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:30.120]  This is punishment, this is being very harsh on the most vulnerable people in our society
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:36.360]  to include liquor stores and this group of stores that you would not like to have the
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:38.120]  welfare recipients use.
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:42.280]  Lawyers have been charged with ethics violations for asking regulators to help a bank in which
[2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:44.440]  her husband had a financial interest.
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  She denies breaking any house rules.
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:54.840]  What people have seen on television in recent days is outlandish behavior by the Tea Party
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:11:01.240]  operation in Washington D.C. and I think that speaks volumes about what's causing problems
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:02.240]  in Washington D.C.
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:05.920]  What exactly outlandish behavior, specifically what do you mean by that?
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:11.360]  The shouting of the Republicans were out there having a great time, they were laughing, they
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:15.840]  were waving the American flag, they were egging them on and I thought that was outrageous
[2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:16.840]  behavior.
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:19.120]  Guess what this liberal will be all about?
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:29.360]  This liberal will be all about socializing, basically taking over and the government running
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:42.960]  all of your companies.
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:51.840]  Chapter 2, my Russian Narrative I couldn't believe it, after all I'd
[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:59.600]  done to pave the way for a woman president that I still lived in a sexist nation that
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:02.600]  couldn't handle a woman president.
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:12.280]  But then it occurred to me, we didn't lose the election, the Russians stole it and I'm
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:16.280]  telling everybody.
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:23.440]  I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians and
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:24.440]  the Kremlin.
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:30.640]  Absolutely was in collusion with the Kremlin and Putin in Russia.
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:38.280]  Our intelligence agencies have already confirmed that the Russians did hack into the D.N.C.
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:43.880]  This is a bunch of scumbags, that's what they are, who are all organized around making
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:44.880]  money.
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:47.440]  Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing.
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:52.240]  You have an investigation going on where the president is implicated.
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:55.520]  Just to be clear, there has been no actual evidence yet.
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:56.520]  No it has not been.
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:12:57.520]  No it has not been.
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:12:59.960]  Can people see what's going on?
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:03.840]  Why do you think they hacked into our election?
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.640]  They hacked into the election because they have to make sure that Donald Trump got elected.
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:32.040]  My people, when you see her district, where she doesn't live, just like Venezuela, the
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:38.600]  wages of socialism are massive and always the same.
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:48.800]  I built my career on appealing to the people that women of color can accomplish things too.
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:55.960]  But I'll be damned if a white man tries to virtue signal their way up the ladder.
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:10.240]  And as far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell.
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:17.560]  Ah, young cur and soros activate the race forces.
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:23.400]  The heir of the Nazi fortune, Alan control, turns loose the race politics that took them
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:26.400]  to power in the 30s in Germany.
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:33.400]  I'm not afraid of anybody.
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:35.680]  This is a tough game.
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:37.680]  I'm a strong black woman.
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:38.680]  See them?
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:39.680]  Look at them in the eye.
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:40.680]  Look at them in the eye.
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:41.680]  They're fighting against them.
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:42.680]  Go back to Europe.
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:43.680]  Go back to Europe.
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:44.680]  Look at them in the eye.
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:45.680]  Right?
[2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:46.680]  This one too.
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:47.680]  Look at them.
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:15:06.080]  Why don't you quit worrying about the Tea Party and look at your own district and the
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:13.640]  hellhole that's been created there while you were the representative from that district,
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:16.120]  Maxine.
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:22.960]  Maxine Waters is not only a traitor to our nation, but she's not right in the head.
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:29.120]  In fact, the only people who are crazier than Maxine Waters are the people who support
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:33.120]  her.
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:38.600]  After four, my lies, my hypocrisies, my millennials.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:46.400]  At this stage of my life, I get a little confused sometimes, and it sounds like I'm
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:54.720]  that shit crazy, but there's a method to my madness because this struggle, it ain't
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:16:01.160]  no joke, and my millennials, they stay woke.
[2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:04.920]  Maxine Waters, the Democratic congresswoman calling for President Trump's impeachment,
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:09.120]  getting a standing ovation before presenting the award for best fight against the system.
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:14.920]  You are very vocal in supporting an investigation that could lead to President Trump being impeached.
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:18.920]  They've got to stop his ass.
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:27.200]  I think the millennials have adopted me because they really do believe I speak truth to power,
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:34.440]  and I discovered one thing, just tell the truth.
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440]  I have not called for impeachment.
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:47.480]  The President is a liar, his actions are contemptible, and I'm going to fight every day until he's
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:48.480]  impeached.
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:51.640]  I have not called for the impeachment yet.
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:54.440]  I say it over and over again, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:58.440]  And I will fight every day until he is impeached.
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:00.440]  And it's one of lies.
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:07.440]  This isn't edited, she says it back and forth.
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:13.440]  Should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to that question?
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  I have not called for impeachment.
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:20.440]  You said I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached, that's what you tweeted.
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:24.440]  You know people don't like to hear the word impeachment, but we know you like saying it.
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:31.440]  He lies every day, he's in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil, and everybody around
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:34.440]  him are allies with the criminals.
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:38.440]  Yes, we want the oil, we want the Russian resources dumbo.
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:42.440]  This is extraordinary, this woman is delusional.
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  That's what we do Maxine, we're capitalists.
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:46.440]  You said it.
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:47.440]  I go back to...
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:48.440]  What, what?
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:49.440]  A grown man talks like that.
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:50.440]  I go back to President Clinton.
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.440]  I don't care about Clinton.
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.440]  I care about this because I'm going to work every day until I get him impeached.
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:02.440]  I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:03.440]  Putin's playbook.
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:10.440]  I think that when you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked, crooked Hillary,
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:12.440]  lock her up, lock her up, all of that was developed.
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:18.440]  I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin.
[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:22.440]  You obviously have been very critical of James Comey in the past.
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  You said that he had no credibility, I assume, that you support the President's decision
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:28.440]  then to fire his FBI Director.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:30.440]  No, I do not necessarily.
[2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:33.440]  The FBI Director has no credibility.
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:37.440]  But if you said that FBI Director James Comey had no credibility, wouldn't you support
[2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:40.440]  the fact that the President then counted Trump?
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:41.440]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:43.440]  Now President Trump made the decision to get rid of him?
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:46.440]  No, no, not necessarily.
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:51.440]  If Hillary Clinton had won the White House, would you have recommended that she fire
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:53.440]  FBI Director James Comey?
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:55.440]  Well, let me tell you something.
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:01.440]  If she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her and what he
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  tried to do, she should have fired him.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:07.440]  Yes, the FBI Director has no credibility.
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:09.440]  We want a diplomatic solution.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:19.440]  We do not want war in North Korea, in Aleppo.
[2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:28.440]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance
[2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:36.440]  into North Korea, North Korea at all.
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:39.440]  They are some sneaky bastards.
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:45.440]  Stop it.
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:47.440]  Just give us the gas.
[2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:49.440]  We spare your lives.
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:50.440]  That's all we want.
[2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:52.440]  It's too much pain.
[2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:54.440]  Stay woke.
[2:19:54.440 --> 2:19:56.440]  My verminios!
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.440]  Stay woke!
[2:19:57.440 --> 2:19:59.440]  We'll be back with your calls.
[2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:06.440]  The video's on in four hours.
[2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:35.440]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:37.440]  best for you and your family.
[2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:41.440]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:46.440]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:06.440]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Leicester
[2:21:06.440 --> 2:21:11.440]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:14.440]  hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:17.440]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:21.440]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:22.440]  world.
[2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:27.440]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:32.440]  on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the
[2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:34.440]  line and didn't talk but took action.

[2:21:51.440 --> 2:21:56.440]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic,
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:59.440]  the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:02.440]  This is Dan Pillard. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:04.440]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:07.440]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:09.440]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[2:22:09.440 --> 2:22:13.440]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[2:22:52.440 --> 2:23:04.440]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:10.440]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:15.440]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:17.440]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:19.440]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:23.440]  See guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:50.440]  Go to libertyoncall.org, that's libertyoncall.org.
[2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:58.440]  The ShelterPod at ShelterPod.com. Shelter when you need it most.
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:21.440]  You know, there's all these news articles out that I claim
[2:24:21.440 --> 2:24:26.440]  that Megan Kelly's coming to interview me next week, like I've arrived or something.
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:31.440]  I mean, I'm not bragging here, but I almost am not doing the interview.
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:34.440]  Because I don't even want to put up with it or deal with mainstream media.
[2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:37.440]  I've been on Nightline, I've been on Fox, I've been on everything.
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:42.440]  I don't really get any response off these shows.
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  And I turn down most of the interviews.
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:47.440]  I turn them down every day.
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:50.440]  But I know she has a big magazine show.
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:52.440]  And she's got a big show coming out on NBC.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:53.440]  She just interviewed Putin.
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:56.440]  She told me that two weeks ago, but said, please don't tell anybody.
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:24:59.440]  Well, now you see the interview with Putin's there on this Sunday.
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:04.440]  And it's Putin, Alex Jones, and then Trump.
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:09.440]  And I'd be dumb if I didn't do some of these interviews.
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:10.440]  I know it's how to do it.
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:11.440]  I know they're going to attack me.
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  I understand that.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:13.440]  They told me they're not going to.
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:15.440]  I'm not stupid.
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:22.440]  But I'm when she gets here, I'm going to play her the clip of where she was.
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:26.440]  I don't remember that on Fox where they play a clip where I'm saying Hillary killed all these kids in Syria.
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:29.440]  And they played it and said, I was talking about the pizza place.
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:34.440]  And I'm going to stick there with her and say, look at this, see what you did right here?
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:35.440]  Here's the original clip.
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:36.440]  And it doesn't even matter.
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:39.440]  The point is, is that media makes a joke.
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:41.440]  It says, Jones blushed.
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:43.440]  He's in love with Megan Kelly.
[2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:45.440]  Megan Kelly don't have enough meat on her bones.
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:47.440]  Okay.
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.440]  I'm not.
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:51.440]  I haven't been enamored with people in Hollywood for 18 years.
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:55.440]  I mean, Hollywood early on got me in films.
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:26:01.440]  I was out in Hollywood quite a bit and I was never enamored with it, but I really don't like it now.
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:05.440]  And I've been at parties with you name it Brad Pitt, you name it.
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:06.440]  I mean, small parties.
[2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:07.440]  Okay.
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:10.440]  I've been there.
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:11.440]  I like Clint Eastwood.
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:12.440]  I like Kurt Russell.
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:15.440]  I am a big, big fan of those guys.
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  Clint Eastwood is a living legend and a patriot, but it's because they're politics.
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:19.440]  I like them and they're good.
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:21.440]  They're movies, but I don't worship that.
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:27.440]  And the reason I raise this is I would have loved to interview somebody like Alexander
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:35.440]  Schultz and Eason, a real patriot for humanity that I get butterflies about or Trump because
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:36.440]  he's such a trailblazer.
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  That is my rock stars or a Billy Corrigan who's got great music.
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:42.440]  That'll play more of his bumper music.
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:45.440]  I love smashing pumpkins and his other stuff he does on his own, but I like Billy because
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:46.440]  he's so smart.
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:50.440]  We talk on the phone, you know, quite a bit and text each other, but it's not because
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:51.440]  he's a famous.
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:52.440]  It's because he's an interesting person.
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:57.440]  And I just think it's so important that we reject celebrity culture.
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  It's so important that we just say no to whatever their force feeding is because whatever their
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:08.440]  force feeding is, the Ariana Grande's or the Taylor Swift's, it's just a load of crap
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.440]  and what they add onto it is meant to snare our daughters particularly.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  I'm going to go to your calls when we come back from break, John and Matt and John and
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:19.440]  Trent and Carlos.
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  I'll go right to you.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:24.440]  800-25-99231 is the toll free number, but I don't want to go to here with a minute or
[2:27:24.440 --> 2:27:25.440]  two.
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:26.440]  We have left and then not giving me enough time.
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  A long segment, 18 minute segments coming up.
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:30.440]  So we're going to go to break and come back and talk to you.
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:36.440]  But briefly, that's one of their news to haven't gotten to.
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:41.440]  Maybe I shouldn't do the interview of Megan Kelly, but then I realized when I saw these
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:43.440]  articles, they'll say I made it up.
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:44.440]  I have to.
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:50.440]  That's the level I've now gotten to where the media all said I had my kids taken away
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:52.440]  and that didn't happen.
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:56.440]  And the media was there in the courtroom when it didn't happen and they all left and didn't
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:27:57.440]  report it.
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:02.440]  Do you have any idea how controlled the Austin American statesman is?
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:10.440]  And I don't even care because I know they're a bunch of liars, but I mean, wow.
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:12.440]  Wow.
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:15.440]  Amazing.
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:16.440]  Absolutely amazing.
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:24.440]  I sat there and I watched that ruling Tuesday and I watched the media look like they've
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:28.440]  all been punched in the stomach and they all left and I knew there wouldn't be a word.
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  They even had coordinated like a show extras, Inside Edition or whatever.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:41.440]  That was all coordinated weeks before the air that afternoon, thinking it would get piggybacked
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:43.440]  and some ruling against me.
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:45.440]  I mean, they talk about concerted with the media.
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  I mean, and then to watch them have everything they thought was going to happen on.
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:57.440]  But it's just wild and have Hillary attacking me and saying, I'm watching you lost the election.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:28:59.440]  Info wars is because you took action.
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:01.440]  This isn't about credit either.
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:02.440]  By the way, that's kind of creepy credit.
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:05.440]  That's kind of scary to have that mob boss, that pedophile protector.
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:12.440]  That's what she admittedly is that that monster, that criminal, that anti American globalist
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:13.440]  hating you.
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:14.440]  Just seething.
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:15.440]  Oh, it's dark heart.
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:18.440]  Oh, how he can be so horrible.
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:20.440]  Alex Jones and info wars.
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:26.440]  Oh, I mean, I'm like, wow, that is a that is a Medusa hates me.
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:28.440]  But I don't have any fear.
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:30.440]  Do what you're going to do, sweetie.
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:32.440]  You already had a lot.
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:34.440]  So line up.
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:36.440]  But again, it's the spirit of Liberty.
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  I got to talk about the show that is we're under attack.
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:41.440]  And I got to set the record straight with people about where things really stand.
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  But oh, that video you just saw or heard very powerful.
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:46.440]  I'm mad Maxine.
[2:29:46.440 --> 2:29:51.440]  The ultimate Maxine compilation is up on info wars.com and on real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:52.440]  Please spread it.
[2:29:52.440 --> 2:29:53.440]  It's powerful.
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:56.440]  Alex Jones and the Jesus.
[2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:26.440]  These are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling.
[2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:31.440]  Now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending HR McMaster, Wilbur
[2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:33.440]  Ross and Chris Liddell.
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:38.440]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:39.440]  administration.
[2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:41.440]  There are two ways at which this can go.
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:44.440]  Either the globals will try to bring Trump to heal or they will try to impeach him after
[2:30:44.440 --> 2:30:45.440]  the 2018 election.
[2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:50.440]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on info wars.com
[2:30:50.440 --> 2:30:54.440]  and ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:56.440]  Spread this link and help wake up some minds.
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:25.440]  Rob Dure reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news.
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:03.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:32:03.440 --> 2:32:08.440]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:09.440]  to detoxify the body.
[2:32:09.440 --> 2:32:11.440]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:14.440]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:15.440]  It's made in the USA.
[2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:20.440]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:22.440]  the body and it supports the info war.
[2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:26.440]  It is a classical 360 win.
[2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:30.440]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:34.440]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:35.440]  get.
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:39.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country
[2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:44.440]  in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:49.440]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[2:32:49.440 --> 2:32:52.440]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:55.440]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:32:55.440 --> 2:32:59.440]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:27.440]  When I grow up I want to be a rock star.
[2:33:27.440 --> 2:33:29.440]  I love this song.
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:36.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:55.440]  You're listening to Alex Jones for 22 years.
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:57.440]  What do they say?
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:02.440]  Christopher Walken, more cowbell.
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:07.440]  Booze and ladies, keep me right.
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:14.440]  To the show tonight, we're an American band.
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:16.440]  We're an American band.
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:18.440]  I love it.
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:23.440]  The restoration of the Republic is here.
[2:34:23.440 --> 2:34:25.440]  I love it.
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:27.440]  I'm going to you right now.
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:30.440]  Every time I put one of these out, the media does the same thing.
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:33.440]  We're fake news because we're so on target and so accurate.
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:36.440]  We make mistakes, but we'll tell you.
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:40.440]  Media sources that are seen as friendly to the White House, not a lot of folks,
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:42.440]  but big talk radio gets this.
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:46.440]  And then we're good about getting it out within minutes of the White House releasing
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:48.440]  or before it's even released.
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:50.440]  And then they'll sometimes have hundreds of articles.
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  Jones claims he has an exclusive White House press release.
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:55.440]  Well, we do release these first, but we're not seeing exclusive.
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:35:00.440]  Then they just lie and say that we said exclusive because they're so angry we're getting these.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:02.440]  Like they didn't get press passes.
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:03.440]  Okay, they did.
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:06.440]  Well, it's just it's ongoing.
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:08.440]  It's just it's like Trump every level.
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:09.440]  He's with the Russians every level.
[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:11.440]  He's selling us out every level.
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:13.440]  He's bad as the economy explodes.
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:15.440]  Paris Accord.
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:16.440]  And these are the talking points.
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:20.440]  I mean, the headline is the White House has put out its Paris Accord talking points.
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:22.440]  This is 25 minutes ahead of the president.
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:23.440]  Let's get course you on right now.
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:24.440]  I know you wanted to come on.
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:25.440]  I was about to go to calls.
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:28.440]  This is breaking actually because you're getting the first look right now.
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:29.440]  We need to get this up fast.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:39.440]  The first look at President Trump's climate announcement, really carbon tax announcement.
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:46.440]  So White House releases talking points ahead of Trump's announcement on the Paris Accord.
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:48.440]  I mean, this is this is this is huge.
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:50.440]  And we just Google this minutes ago.
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:52.440]  No one else has this or has gotten it out yet.
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:55.440]  The Paris Accord is a bad deal for Americans.
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:35:58.440]  You're going to hear the president say this.
[2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:00.440]  The Paris Accord is a bad deal for Americans.
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:06.440]  The president's action today is the press secretary is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first.
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:12.440]  The accord was negotiated poorly by the administration and signed out of desperation.
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:16.440]  It front loads cost American people to the detriment of our economy.
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:24.440]  Yeah, we have to pay first and job growth while extracting meaningless commitments from the world's top global emitters.
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:25.440]  China and India.
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:26.440]  Exactly.
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:31.440]  That's I told Monkton this is the angle to go with that everybody else is exempt but us in Europe.
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:33.440]  And he goes on to say China is exempt.
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:35.440]  The US is already leading the world energy production.
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:38.440]  It doesn't need a bad deal that will harm American workers.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.440]  Yes.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:51.440]  It undermines US competitiveness and jobs according to a study by the NERA consulting meeting that Obama administration requirements in the Paris Accord would cost us economy 3 trillion over the next several decades more than that.
[2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:59.440]  By 2040, our economy would lose 6.5 million industrial sector jobs, including 3.1 million manufacturing sector jobs.
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:05.440]  It would effectively decapitate our coal industry, which now supplies about one third of our electrical power.
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:06.440]  It was half.
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:13.440]  The deal was negotiated badly and expires and extracts meaningless commitments from the world's top polluters.
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:25.440]  The Obama negotiated accord imposes unrealistic targets on US for reducing our carbon emissions while giving countries like China a free pass for years to come.
[2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  Bing bong, bing bing bong.
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:31.440]  Under the accord, just magic, world government blows up, bing bing bong bong bong bing.
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:33.440]  Under the accord, bing bong bong, bing bing bing.
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  Got it, Alex.
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:38.440]  Under the accord, it's just a little magic thing.
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:42.440]  Like on the witch, they twinkle their nose, but just front goes bing bing bong bong.
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:44.440]  Under the accord, and all the attorneys gone.
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:48.440]  See, China will actually increase emissions in 2030, but we can't.
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:49.440]  We have to cut.
[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:52.440]  The US is already a clean energy and oil and gas leader.
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:56.440]  We'll reduce our emissions and continue to produce American energy without the Paris Accord.
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:59.440]  America has already reduced its carbon dioxide emissions.
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:01.440]  Well, the scientists say we should increase it, actually.
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:03.440]  That's life-giving gas.
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:08.440]  Since 2006, CO2 emissions have declined by 12% and are expected to continue to decline.
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:13.440]  According to the Energy Information Administration, EIA, the US is the leader in oil and gas production.
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:15.440]  This is all designed economic warfare to shut us down.
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:16.440]  That's admitted.
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:20.440]  The agreement funds a UN climate slush fund underwritten by American taxpayers.
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.440]  President Obama committed $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund,
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:29.440]  which is about 30% of the initial funding without authorization from Congress.
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:34.440]  With $20 trillion in debt, US taxpayers should not be paying to subsidize other countries' energy needs.
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:38.440]  We should probably rename the name of our streams right now on Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms.
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:42.440]  Because I know it was dealing with Trump prepares to pull out a world government, basically,
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:47.440]  and Bilderberg's now in sconce 20 miles from the president openly trying to plot his overthrow.
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:49.440]  That's in their talking points.
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:53.440]  From not existing to now they admit they exist to admitting they want world government.
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:55.440]  So that's all happening.
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:38:57.440]  The deal also accomplishes little for the climate.
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  According to researchers at MIT, if all member nations met their obligations,
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:03.440]  the impact of the climate would be negligible.
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:13.440]  The impact would be estimated to be likely to reduce global temperature by the rise of less than 0.2 degrees Celsius in 82 years from now, in 2100.
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:19.440]  Now joining us just briefly, because I promise I'm going to John and Matt and John and Trent and Carlos here in just a moment.
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:24.440]  Dr. Corsi, our DC bureau head, again, got us first these talking points.
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:27.440]  These are all going out now, as we speak. They're going up on infowars.com.
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:31.440]  If you want to see what the press secretary and the president are about to be saying here in the next hour,
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:34.440]  you can also follow him on Twitter at Jerome Corsi.
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:37.440]  Jerome underscore Corsi. Follow me. They're at real Alex Jones.
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:41.440]  It's more essential than ever you get his articles out because they're very scholarly.
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:43.440]  They're from insiders in the government.
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.440]  They're fighting for America.
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:48.440]  And so Corsi's been breaking a lot of big bombshells here.
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:53.440]  So we haven't heard exactly what the president's going to do officially.
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:58.440]  But having these talking points, I think we can announce we know he's going to announce he is pulling out of it
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:01.440]  and that we're not going to be part of it.
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  This is a big deal.
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  It's a very big deal, Alex. I just got that one hour before the president's announcement,
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:16.440]  what the White House is doing is it's preparing those of us who are the media favorable to the president
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:18.440]  to know what's in advance is going to happen.
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:25.440]  And these points are very clear. It's very clear that the president is saying that this is a bad deal.
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:28.440]  And there's no compromise. We're out of it entirely.
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:34.440]  What the White House is expecting is that the loony left, as I say, is going to go insane.
[2:40:34.440 --> 2:40:41.440]  In fact, the talking points say to expect that there's going to be a huge revolver,
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  massive outpouring of emotion from the left as we pull out of this Paris Climate Court.
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:49.440]  But it's done.
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:52.440]  And this is amazing because we're getting the talking points first.
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:56.440]  He sent them to me like 30 minutes ago, which I would have read my stack of news they were handing me.
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:01.440]  So this is big. We are now breaking that he will officially pull out because they weren't sure.
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:04.440]  It's true. We've got the talking points.
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:06.440]  They would never send these talking points.
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:08.440]  And we don't want to have a baby with the EU and have a world government.
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:10.440]  I mean, it's smart to pull out of this.
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:13.440]  Oh, I think it's brilliant. I'm thrilled.
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:18.440]  I mean, this has been a terrible agreement from the beginning. It was punishing to the United States.
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:22.440]  It left the other countries of the world that we're going to benefit.
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:25.440]  We're going to be subject to carbon restrictions.
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:28.440]  We have to cut back on coal, petroleum.
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:32.440]  It was going to be constant being part of the EU.
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:34.440]  It's so discriminatory.
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:37.440]  Oh, it was entirely one-sided.
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:42.440]  Obama negotiated another treaty here with Paris Accord.
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:45.440]  It was never passed by the Senate, never ratified by the Senate.
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:48.440]  But it was going to be detrimental to the U.S. economy.
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:52.440]  So Obama did something again that was going to punish the U.S. economy.
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:54.440]  And this Paris peace accord was that.
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:57.440]  And Trump realized it from the beginning.
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:02.440]  He let everybody argue, including Jared and Ivanka, both of whom were in favor of this.
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:04.440]  And Trump pulled out.
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:05.440]  And he's going to do it.
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:09.440]  The girls' garden is going to be in an hour where you're getting the talking points in the White House right now.
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:12.440]  You see them. You've shown them to the audience.
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:15.440]  That just came into me with a White House address on it.
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:19.440]  I sent it into you so you can verify it's got a White House address.
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:20.440]  Well, that's amazing.
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:22.440]  You've got so many of these talking points ahead of the time.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:24.440]  He even goes out to other folks and talk radio.
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:27.440]  But this is just now, again, breakingininfowars.com.
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:29.440]  Confirmed they had left it nebulous.
[2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:31.440]  But they had implied he was going to pull out.
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:32.440]  It is now official.
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:36.440]  When Roger Stone first said three weeks ago, the word is he will be pulling out.
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:41.440]  People called it fake news. But now we have the talking points from the press office first at infowars.com.
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:44.440]  You'll be going out on news everywhere as well here in the next few minutes.
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:47.440]  But good job, Doc, getting that first.
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:53.440]  Well, I just want to give you the scoop, Alex, as soon as we got the talking points, as soon as I can turn 14.
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  Well, we're going to give you the headline.
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:57.440]  I'm sorry, 45 minutes ago you were calling and I didn't get the message.
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:42:59.440]  You just start calling the bat phone whenever.
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:00.440]  It's nobody's fault in there. It's my fault.
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:02.440]  They were trying to hand me this stuff, but I was busy on other news.
[2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:03.440]  But this is a big deal.
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:08.440]  What do you make of Yunker, the literal royal Nazi heir?
[2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:11.440]  Just his family hijacked Luxembourg. He runs that.
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:14.440]  He's the EU dictator, unelected.
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:16.440]  He's threatening the United States with trade war.
[2:43:16.440 --> 2:43:17.440]  He's threatening England.
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  And Soros says the European Union is now in existential crisis surrounded by hostile powers and calls the U.S. and the U.K. hostile powers teamed up with Russia.
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:28.440]  All because we don't want carbon taxes and want to run our own countries.
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:30.440]  That just means Russia wants to be sovereign.
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:35.440]  That doesn't make us Russian agents that we all hate Soros.
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:46.440]  Well, in fact, what Soros is afraid of is that this great dream he's had, which was within inches of being completed, had Hillary Clinton been elected.
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:49.440]  The EU had been flying along.
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:53.440]  And now what you've got with the EU is a potential breakup scenario.
[2:43:53.440 --> 2:44:00.440]  You've got other countries within the EU who are radically looking at their positions and saying, we don't need this.
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:08.440]  And Europe is in grave threat of being overwhelmed by Islamic refugees.
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:11.440]  And we're seeing the results of terrorism.
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:13.440]  And it just compounds the problem.
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:16.440]  Bilderberg is not going to be able to solve this problem.
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:18.440]  And Soros is going to go down with it.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:31.440]  The pulling out of the Paris Accord today is a major, major announcement, a major step in the Trump presidency as one that the Hillary Clinton presidency would never have done.
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:33.440]  Well, I'm about to retweet your tweet.
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:37.440]  We've got an article going up on infowars.com with the press accord talkers.
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:40.440]  These are the talking points of the president.
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:44.440]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, he is going to completely pull out.
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:49.440]  This is going to only make the globalists come after him even more.
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:54.440]  We shouldn't probably publish those talking points on the website.
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:59.440]  We should write an article around it, but I don't want to let the White House talking points get out any more than we've shown them.
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:00.440]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:03.440]  I was able to put the other ones out before.
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:04.440]  It was okay.
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:06.440]  I mean, it's fine.
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:09.440]  It's just that I don't want to just put the memo up as such.
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:13.440]  I'd rather write an article about it and get it out once the announcement's made.
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:14.440]  Well, then pull it.
[2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:15.440]  Pull it because they were about to put it up.
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:16.440]  Guys, sorry.
[2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:17.440]  Tell it on my fault.
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:18.440]  Pull it right now.
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:19.440]  Yeah, because we don't want to.
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:21.440]  I mean, the White House sends these out.
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:23.440]  We want to stay on the preferred list.
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:24.440]  We want to stay.
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  No, I didn't understand.
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:26.440]  So you're a great guy.
[2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:27.440]  Please tell me the rules.
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:28.440]  I know.
[2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:33.440]  I got excited to see it myself and sent it right into you immediately.
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:34.440]  It didn't really.
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:37.440]  Well, next time, tell me the proviso that I need to not show this stuff.
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:38.440]  Yeah.
[2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:42.440]  Talking points are some that when we get them, it's the, you know, real trying to prepare
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:48.440]  the media for a blitz, which we expect from the left.
[2:45:48.440 --> 2:45:52.440]  And so this gives us a way to, you know, basically know what in fact is going to be.
[2:45:52.440 --> 2:45:54.440]  This is the ammo to get ready to back the president.
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:56.440]  It's all totally true.
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:57.440]  Precisely.
[2:45:57.440 --> 2:46:00.440]  And I mean, all these points, I think are points that are points that we're going to
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:02.440]  have to go through and debate.
[2:46:02.440 --> 2:46:03.440]  You'll see.
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:04.440]  Well established.
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:07.440]  And these points are going to be reflected in White House press releases.
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:10.440]  So within an hour, what we have is talking points.
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:13.440]  You're going to get memorialized in White House press releases.
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:17.440]  The White House is going to be putting out these messages and they're trying to get
[2:46:17.440 --> 2:46:18.440]  in advance.
[2:46:18.440 --> 2:46:24.440]  The various supporters who are going to be on the media to be out there.
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:25.440]  Listen, great job.
[2:46:25.440 --> 2:46:26.440]  John Rappaport's coming on the next hour.
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:28.440]  We're going to play the president's speech.
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:30.440]  But if you want to pop in later, that's great.
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:32.440]  I'm going to let you go so you can write that article doc.
[2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:33.440]  Thank you.
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:34.440]  Okay.
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:35.440]  Great.
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:36.440]  Thanks.
[2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:37.440]  Until folks again, how they follow you on Twitter.
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:38.440]  Yes.
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:42.440]  You can do the doc course here underscore Corsi, but draw at Jerome Corsi.
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:43.440]  You'll find it.
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:44.440]  And I want to tell all the listeners.
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:46.440]  A lot of you send us whistleblower stuff Intel.
[2:46:46.440 --> 2:46:51.440]  A lot of times I don't feel like I can read secret documents or things.
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:52.440]  Not that I can't as a journalist.
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:56.440]  I just sometimes it takes me too long to authenticate and I don't get to it.
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:46:59.440]  Corsi has worked in classified areas and worked in a lot of things.
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:00.440]  He's able to vet things.
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:05.440]  He's also worked as a fraud analyzer for the feds and as a degree in banking from Harvard.
[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:08.440]  So you can always send him tips.
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:12.440]  And so give folks your email at info wars for whistleblowers and people.
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:13.440]  Yeah.
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:16.440]  It's doctor C at info wars.com.
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:18.440]  Dr C at info wars.com.
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:26.440]  Is that fully spelled out doctor is always just click on your email doc torc at doc torc
[2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:27.440]  at info wars.com.
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:29.440]  So folks that want to get in contact with you or whistleblower.
[2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:30.440]  Give you Intel.
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:31.440]  They could do it right there.
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:32.440]  Thank you doc.
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:33.440]  Absolutely.
[2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:34.440]  Thank you.
[2:47:34.440 --> 2:47:35.440]  Thank you.
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:36.440]  That's big breaking news.
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:37.440]  Sorry.
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:38.440]  The callers have them holding for 40 minutes or 38 minutes.
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:39.440]  I'm going to go to you right now.
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:41.440]  We're going to go to let me see.
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:42.440]  We got callers in Alabama.
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:44.440]  We got callers in North Carolina.
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:47.440]  We got callers in Tejas.
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:50.440]  We got calls from Oregon.
[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:51.440]  Montreal, Canada.
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:53.440]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:55.440]  Let's talk to John in the great state of Alabama.
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.440]  You're on the air.
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:47:59.440]  Hey.
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:00.440]  Hey Alex.
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:01.440]  What are you doing?
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:02.440]  Hey good.
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:04.440]  Hi.
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:07.440]  Thank you for having me on.
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:10.440]  Anyway, I was wondering, would you like to be talking about the refugee crisis?
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  Because I heard you.
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:12.440]  I'm mentioning it.
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:13.440]  Yeah.
[2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  And they've been totally ignoring Trump and the state department is in total rebellions.
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:20.440]  We have record numbers of refugees brought in so far.
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:22.440]  47,000 in the last three months.
[2:48:22.440 --> 2:48:24.440]  So total muting the government against Trump.
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:26.440]  Isn't that crazy?
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:27.440]  Yeah.
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:28.440]  That is crazy.
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:35.440]  And the refugees in Western Europe especially, you really have the surge of these completely
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:38.440]  Muslim and unlawabiding people.
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:39.440]  Let's explain.
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:44.440]  They're coming from hell holes, failed states, Somalia, Sudan, Libya.
[2:48:44.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  These are hell holes where women literally are sold on slave blocks and are not even
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:51.440]  human.
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:55.440]  It's like importing Klingons or something.
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:48:58.440]  There are a lot of Muslim countries that are actually culture.
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:03.440]  They're all being overrunning killed and Obama and the Liberals are supporting blowing up
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:05.440]  the good Muslims.
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:07.440]  I agree.
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:09.440]  I know what you're talking, man.
[2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:10.440]  You got Libya.
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:13.440]  Gaddafi's regime was a very secular regime.
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:15.440]  Gaddafi never did anything.
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:17.440]  They'd blow stuff up and blame him.
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:19.440]  I'm not saying he was an angel, but he lived in a tent.
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:21.440]  He gave away 99% of the wealth to the people.
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:22.440]  He was the real deal.
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:26.440]  And he believed Obama was his friend, met with him a bunch, invested his money in the
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:28.440]  West, let the CIA in, said, I want to be your friend.
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:32.440]  And they killed him and brought in radical Muslims to murder everybody.
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:34.440]  I mean, how dirty is that?
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:36.440]  Yeah, you know, I know.
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:42.440]  They called Libya the gateway of Africa because Libya was really a state that really kept
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:43.440]  these refugees.
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:47.440]  Yeah, once the globalists, and I'm not defending apartheid, they replaced one evil with an ANC
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:48.440]  communist evil.
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:50.440]  But now, South Africa's imploding.
[2:49:50.440 --> 2:49:53.440]  It was jacking up Southern Africa and Central Africa.
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:56.440]  And Gaddafi was jacking up all of North and Central Africa.
[2:49:56.440 --> 2:50:00.440]  He was literally funding everything, creating an economy, and it's gone.
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:03.440]  It's all gone.
[2:50:03.440 --> 2:50:06.440]  Yeah, I think Libya really has collapsed.
[2:50:06.440 --> 2:50:08.440]  And I don't think really it'll ever...
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:09.440]  Well, she came.
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:10.440]  She saw he died.
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:12.440]  You know, you know how that is?
[2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:14.440]  It's so much fun to be liberal like Hillary.
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.440]  So much fun to be Bill Clinton too on that rape plane with all the good buddies.
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:20.440]  Over there.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:21.440]  Thank you, John.
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:22.440]  We're going to break.
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:25.440]  I'm going to go right to Matt, right to John, right to Trent, right to Carlos, and I'll
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:28.440]  go into the next hour, and I'm going boom-a-boom to your calls.
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:31.440]  And of course, then we're going to get into Trump's press conference and more.
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:34.440]  Usually about 10 minutes late, so that's coming up in about 15 minutes.
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:35.440]  Infowars.com.
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:37.440]  Have you spread the link to the show yet?
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:41.440]  Because let me tell you, Hillary says we lost her of the election by name.
[2:50:41.440 --> 2:50:42.440]  And you know what?
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:43.440]  We did.
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:44.440]  You did.
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:46.440]  But now the enemy's fighting back.
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:47.440]  And I'm here on the front lines.
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:50.440]  I'm going on to the end, whether we win, lose, or draw.
[2:50:50.440 --> 2:50:52.440]  But I need your prayers and support now more than ever.
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  Go to infowarsstore.com.

[2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:05.440]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:10.440]  at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today,
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:14.440]  fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:18.440]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:21.440]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.

[2:54:46.440 --> 2:54:47.440]  Again.
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:48.440]  Again.
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:49.440]  Bye-bye, Brzezinski.
[2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:52.440]  Bye-bye, mass murderer.
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:55:00.440]  Bye-bye, David Rockefeller, Nazi collaborator.
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:07.440]  That's the big equalizer.
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:10.440]  Of some.
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:17.440]  Strangers' hand.
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:24.440]  Your money and its main engine is about to be TNTed.
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:27.440]  Donald Trump has loaded the explosives.
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:35.440]  It's about to strut out onto the green with a rose garden and detonate.
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:41.440]  Lost in a wilderness.
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  Not for long.
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:48.440]  Because you see, turnabout is always fair play.
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:51.440]  There's always an equal and opposite reaction in the universe.
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:54.440]  And we are in the Trumpian age, aren't we?
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:55.440]  No.
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:56:06.440]  I will quote Julius Caesar, the play, again, by the great playwright, the greatest playwright ever,
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:13.440]  that there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune and our fortune's leader.
[2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:15.440]  Our fortune is freedom.
[2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:17.440]  Our fortune is expanding.
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:19.440]  Our fortune is honor.
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:21.440]  That's what we're looking for.
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:27.440]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:31.440]  When fortune favors the bold, does it not?
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:37.440]  I could care less about money other than the fact that it's a weapon to build what I needed to stand against the enemy's attacks.
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:43.440]  Like a lighthouse out on the promontory or a peninsula with big waves slamming into the rocks.
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:46.440]  I need money to build those rocks, not sand.
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:51.440]  William Shakespeare, there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:57.440]  Omitted, all the voyage of life is bound in the shallows and in the miseries.
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:11.440]  On such a full sea as we are now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures.
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:14.440]  Yes, most people live in the shallows.
[2:57:14.440 --> 2:57:17.440]  Most times in history, you're in the shallows, not times of change.
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:25.440]  You are now in the greatest flood of human change the world's ever seen and it's only going to get more intense.
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:30.440]  So pray for us, pray for yourself, pray for justice, pray for enlightenment.
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:33.440]  Pray for prosperity for all so we might be free.
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:39.440]  Not prosperity to have tokens of success or worship things mindlessly and consumerism,
[2:57:39.440 --> 2:57:48.440]  but have a house and a car and good health care and a life and a future so that we can transcend that and do greater things.
[2:57:48.440 --> 2:57:56.440]  They want to keep you frozen and scrabbling in debt so that you're always never able to reach for the stars.
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:57:58.440]  I'm going to go to break it, I promise.
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:03.440]  I'm going to go to John in Texas and then I'm going to go to Trenton and Carlos and everybody else.
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:09.440]  People say, oh, listen, these platitudes and all these big things, all these big words, but that's what it is.
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:13.440]  The mystery, the majesty of life, the consciousness, the universe, all of this.
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:18.440]  It's fantastical and we're obsessed with Brad Pitt and how much skin cream he uses.
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:21.440]  I mean, Brad Pitt's incredibly boring, all of them.
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:22.440]  It's a joke.
[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  Who cares?
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:24.440]  None of it.
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  NBA stars, NFL, crap, arrogant narcissist idiots, most of them.
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:35.440]  But a woman and a child in her arms or just life, all of it's magic.
[2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  It's all just gifts from God.
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:43.440]  Our number four and Trump's big speech as he drives a dagger to the heart of the New World Order.
[2:58:43.440 --> 2:58:46.440]  World government on its knees straight ahead.
[2:58:46.440 --> 2:59:11.440]  Our number four, tell your friends and family.

[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:20.440]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:01:14.440]  Hello, John. How are you doing?
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:16.440]  Good, go ahead.
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:33.440]  You know, if Donald Trump is going to turn the economy around and make America great again, he's going to have to do something about inflation because if you might have noticed the price of everything has doubled and tripled within the last, you know, 10 or 15 years, look at the price of guns and ammunition, look at the price of cars and housing.
[3:01:33.440 --> 3:01:34.440]  Well, Trump knows that.
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:35.440]  Trump knows that. Here's the problem.
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:48.440]  There's such a mega debt. That's why it is. If we don't, we'll have stagflation, which they've cooked up with their Keynesian BS since the 70s, where we're going to have less jobs, but prices still going up in a recession.
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  So Trump's trying to help us blast our way out. I mean, look, the globalists are pissed. They want us poor. They want to strangle us. He's ordering the banks to loan. He's flooding cash. It's going to cause even more inflation.
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:04.440]  And Trump has decided to go the way of inflation. I mean, what else can he do?
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:06.440]  John?
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:11.440]  It's going to defeat the whole purpose. If you got to take a wheelbarrow full of money to buy a loaf of bread, then...
[3:02:11.440 --> 3:02:15.440]  Well, I mean, it's not going to go Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe.
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:22.440]  Let me do your smart guy, John. You've been calling for 18 years. Hadn't heard from him in probably six months or a year.
[3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:26.440]  Okay. I recognize your voice. You're a smart guy. What does he do then?
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:37.440]  The one thing I could think of is get rid of that $20 trillion debt, put something as a gold backing of the dollar before they can't just print money.
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:43.440]  No, I understand. But he's got to stabilize the economy first. So he's actually flooding money to the little guy.
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:49.440]  And I agree. That's got its own dangers. But if you're dying on the hospital bed, going into shock, he's injecting adrenaline.
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:59.440]  And it may kill us. But what does he do? I'm asking. I'm not mad at you. I agree with what you're saying, but he's taking the best course I believe for the patient he's got.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:02.440]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to ask John Rubberport this question and we'll go to break him up with more calls.
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:05.440]  John, you're a smart guy. What do you think? What do you mean on the economy?
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:12.440]  Rock in a hard place. You've got to create jobs and you've got to pump up the economy.
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:20.440]  But I agree with the caller. Ultimately, what you're trying to do is get serious money backed by serious substance.
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.440]  And that's how you kill the private interest manipulating things is by getting back to real based systems.
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:35.440]  Yeah, but if you try to do it right away immediately and people are starving and out of work and they're looking for jobs and you don't bring enough jobs back here, then you're in real.
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:40.440]  Yeah, Trump's trying to give them respect. He understands we have to make a world based on humans again. That's why the globalist hating.
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:45.440]  But even Ron Paul says we can't do this right away.
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:51.440]  He actually Ron Paul says, quote, Trump's doing a great job on the economy. You've never heard that at Ron Paul about anybody.
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:56.440]  He said great job on the economy. What do you think, Rubberport?
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:05.440]  Rock in a hard place again, Alex. What are you going to do in the current situation after the giant theft manipulated by the globalist?
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:06.440]  Tens of trillion dollars.
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:10.440]  Yeah, he's going to destroy everything. Yeah, trillions and trillions of dollars.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:18.440]  And so what Trump's doing is he's just far hosing money at the economy and the people finally. And it'll have its own problems, but at least he's far hosing it at us.
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:24.440]  Yeah, the same thing with his plan to rebuild the infrastructure if it could ever get by Congress or it could be funded by some private money.
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:28.440]  We're talking about several trillion dollars to put people back to work.
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:35.440]  Well, that's not what you would call free market economy either. That's like an FDR New Deal. But it's a step along the way.
[3:04:35.440 --> 3:04:39.440]  If FDR wouldn't have done that, we'd have gone full communist. I'm not even a total fan of FDR in a lot of ways.
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:43.440]  But, you know, I mean, face it, FDR, what he did, probably some of that did help.
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:44.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:47.440]  I hate to give FDR credit. It's just true, folks.
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:51.440]  John, I'm going to let you comment. We come back and we'll go to other callers, Trent Carlos, Rod and Matt.
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:54.440]  And Trump's coming up. We'll go to him as soon as he comes up.
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:05:06.440]  I'm going to make an announcement on pulling out of the carbon taxes.
[3:05:25.440 --> 3:05:29.440]  Now, three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending.
[3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:32.440]  HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross and Chris Liddell.
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:38.440]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current administration.
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:40.440]  There are two ways at which this can go.
[3:05:40.440 --> 3:05:45.440]  Either the Globals will try to bring Trump to heel or they will try to impeach him after the 2018 election.
[3:05:45.440 --> 3:05:50.440]  You can read more about this at exclusive Bilderberg Schemes to overthrow Trump on Infowars.com.

[3:06:51.440 --> 3:06:56.440]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this Republic,
[3:06:56.440 --> 3:06:59.440]  the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[3:06:59.440 --> 3:07:03.440]  A new shipment of Biotrucelinium is now available at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:05.440]  We've been sold out for months.

[3:07:19.440 --> 3:07:24.440]  But Biotrucelinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:28.440]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:32.440]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:37.440]  Biotrucelinium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine
[3:07:37.440 --> 3:07:40.440]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[3:07:54.440 --> 3:07:56.440]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[3:07:56.440 --> 3:08:00.440]  This is the time to support Infowars. That's InfowarsLife.com.
[3:08:06.440 --> 3:08:12.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:15.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:18.440]  You know, I'm glad as we wait for Trump to come out and give this speech any minute.
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:21.440]  With John Roddenport here, Rodden Shaw going to live with me no more fake news.com.
[3:08:21.440 --> 3:08:24.440]  That John in Texas I'm going to go back to so you can respond to what Roddenport was just saying.
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:27.440]  And I was saying what Ron Paul was saying here about a month ago.
[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:31.440]  Trump has to first stabilize the economy.
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:36.440]  They've been giving none of the investment money to small businesses, small corporations, companies.
[3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:38.440]  They've been making his cash pour for 10 years.
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:42.440]  That's by design. That's admitted. Same thing in Europe.
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:44.440]  And so he's ordering the Federal Reserve and others.
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:46.440]  Okay, we'll use this power of centralization.
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:48.440]  Flood the public with money.
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:51.440]  That's creating exuberance. It's creating optimism.
[3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:54.440]  It's people are hiring more people. The stock market's up.
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:56.440]  And even I know the stock market's a big corrupt rig deal,
[3:08:56.440 --> 3:09:00.440]  but that's where the capital formation is for companies and jobs.
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:03.440]  They want austerity. The globalists want a sewn-up economy.
[3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:07.440]  Goldman Sachs wants a consolidated economy and high-frequency trading where they rig the market.
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:10.440]  They admit that. They want austerity.
[3:09:10.440 --> 3:09:12.440]  That's what carbon taxes are, is shutting the West off.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:18.440]  Trump is removing all that, knowing he'll be a total rock star when the economy roars in.
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:21.440]  All he's doing is taking their foot off our neck.
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:26.440]  But we've got to get oxygen first, and then, yes, we could look at some other systems.
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:28.440]  What do you make of that, John?
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:33.440]  Yeah, I would certainly like to go back to, you know, the whole idea that Ron Paul's talking about,
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:38.440]  as we're talking about for God knows how long, audit the Fed.
[3:09:38.440 --> 3:09:42.440]  Get down to the root of this whole money corruption and straighten it out.
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:48.440]  But if you're not going to do that, or you can't do that right away, while people are suffering,
[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:53.440]  people are out of jobs, corporations leaving America to go to hell holes
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:57.440]  where they produce goods for pennies on the dollar and ship it back here.
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:02.440]  I mean, the situation is created to destroy the American economy.
[3:10:02.440 --> 3:10:04.440]  That's right, and Trump is reversing that.
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:06.440]  Look at these jobs numbers.
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:08.440]  Private sector job growth rebounds to rip roaring pace.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:11.440]  In May, ADP, nation's largest payroll services.
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:16.440]  Private payrolls add $23,000 in May versus $185.
[3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:21.440]  Americans' comfort rises on Strong's view of finances in decades.
[3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:26.440]  Bloomberg now says Trump looks like he's probably going to win his next election.
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:31.440]  In the last two weeks, I've seen a total shift of people being sick of being force-fed that Trump's the devil.
[3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:33.440]  I'm going to ask you about that in a moment, Rapaport.
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:35.440]  But right now, let's finish up.
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:37.440]  John, in Texas, I can fuse you.
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:39.440]  I said, hey, John, of course, it's John Rapaport, too.
[3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:41.440]  John, your final point.
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:45.440]  Well, what you're basically saying, Alex, is when Donald Trump inherited this country,
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:47.440]  he's basically a patient on life support.
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:49.440]  Now, he may be a brain surgeon.
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:52.440]  He'll do the right things, and he could pull us through.
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:54.440]  Or we could die on the operating table.
[3:10:54.440 --> 3:10:57.440]  It's just basically, I guess...
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:03.440]  He's basically like a surgeon and a couple nurses trying to fix it with 100 gremlins stabbing us while he tries to save us.
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:05.440]  Yes.
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:07.440]  I support Donald Trump.
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:09.440]  I expect him to be in there four years.
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:14.440]  And as long as Donald Trump supports the Second Amendment, I support Donald Trump no matter what.
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:16.440]  Well, he definitely is doing that.
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:17.440]  Thank you.
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:19.440]  Listen, I can't believe Trump's so real.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:21.440]  And he's done some things I don't like.
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:23.440]  I could see from his worldview why he's doing it.
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  But the globalist hate his guts.
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:27.440]  I'm going to go to other calls here and then let you take over.
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:31.440]  But as soon as Trump comes in, we'll get his first announcement, you know, obviously on the climate deal.
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:33.440]  But we have the talking points from the White House.
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:34.440]  He is pulling out of it completely.
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:37.440]  So that's big news, breaking it in FullWars.com.
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:39.440]  But John, I mean, you're not a conservative.
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:40.440]  You're not a liberal.
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:44.440]  You've been an investigative journalist, best-selling author, art critic, artist.
[3:11:44.440 --> 3:11:47.440]  I mean, you've been around for, you know, 30 years making films, you name it.
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:50.440]  I've never seen you be so positive about a president.
[3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:52.440]  Why have you been so positive about Trump?
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:54.440]  You're a smart cookie.
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:12:00.440]  Listen, the basic thing that attracted me to Trump and still does is that he's set out to destroy major media.
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:10.440]  You know, ever since I started working as a reporter in 1982, it was all about major media lying to the people and constructing false realities.
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:12.440]  You've always made it about the fake news.
[3:12:12.440 --> 3:12:14.440]  You always understood that it's bring down the Oz curtain.
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:16.440]  And so Trump gets that.
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:17.440]  Exactly.
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:23.440]  More than anybody, you know, in my lifetime in a position of power, for whatever reason, it doesn't matter.
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:25.440]  I don't care.
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:28.440]  It's not that I'm worshiping at his altar or anything like that.
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:34.440]  My grandfather used to always say, I don't want talk, I want results, and Trump has delivered.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.440]  Over and over, I've said two things.
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:44.440]  One is he immersively attacks major media, and two, he kept Hillary Clinton from occupying the White House.
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:46.440]  Everything else is gravy.
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:48.440]  Let's see what happens.
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:57.440]  But this is, I mean, people don't even really sometimes get the monumental achievement of keeping Clintons out of the White House.
[3:12:57.440 --> 3:13:00.440]  And then they bitch and say, oh, he met with us.
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  Yeah.
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:02.440]  You know, you know, oh, he met with the Saudis.
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:04.440]  Yeah, to get them to do what we want.
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:06.440]  I mean, he said he met with Kim Jong-un.
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:07.440]  He took us out of TPP.
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:09.440]  They want to kill him.
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:11.440]  Builderberg's own agenda is to remove him.
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:12.440]  They admit that.
[3:13:12.440 --> 3:13:14.440]  Is Trump coming in with the press conference?
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:16.440]  I just heard Trump.
[3:13:16.440 --> 3:13:18.440]  Was that a feat of something?
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:19.440]  It's not a big deal.
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:20.440]  We're live newsroom.
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:21.440]  Let's do another call here.
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:23.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in North Carolina.
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:26.440]  Thanks for holding on the air with John Rappaport at NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:28.440]  Hey, how's it going now?
[3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:29.440]  Good, go ahead.
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:33.440]  Listen, I've got a lot to say, and I'm going to try to get in real quick.
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:37.440]  Basically, well, first of all, I just made a $400 order for Info Wars products.
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:38.440]  I'm looking forward to trying them out.
[3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:39.440]  Big fan of you.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:41.440]  I apologize to Watson, Roger Stone.
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:42.440]  Thank you.
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:46.440]  Thank you to everyone of you guys in regards to something that I think would help Trump's
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  supporters as far as the media trying to portray that we've left Trump.
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:54.440]  I'm a visual effects composer, an animator, graphic designer, very skilled in all those
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:13:55.440]  areas.
[3:13:55.440 --> 3:13:57.440]  I've also sent you guys a resume, which that's not what I called.
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:02.440]  I've reached out in a bunch of Trump communities in Facebook, and I've put the idea out there
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:06.440]  of everyone coming together to show the media that we're still with Trump.
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:10.440]  However, a lot of people are proposing that we centralize in one location, which it might
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:13.440]  be a very bad idea, because most Trump supporters are workers.
[3:14:13.440 --> 3:14:14.440]  They don't have time to take off work.
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:15.440]  They can't afford to do it.
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:20.440]  But what if you guys came up with a ledger, per se, and had people sign it, and you had
[3:14:20.440 --> 3:14:26.440]  a local rally appointees to head them up in everyone's local cities, and then we could
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:27.440]  all centralize.
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:29.440]  62 million people standing for Trump.
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:30.440]  The media couldn't even do that.
[3:14:30.440 --> 3:14:32.440]  Well, I mean, I totally agree with you, Ann Cernovich.
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:36.440]  I think we need to all of us hit the streets more, because all this Democrat, you're a
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:41.440]  racist, you're a communist, you're a Russian, is intimidation, so we don't have our free
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:42.440]  will and our speech.
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:45.440]  We're Russians, because we want lower taxes and prosperity.
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:49.440]  We're communists, because we want, I mean, this is a load of horsemen.
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:50.440]  Thanks for the call.
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:51.440]  Great points.
[3:14:51.440 --> 3:14:55.440]  I don't want to talk about myself all day, but I'll tell you, I felt the disturbance in
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:14:59.440]  the force to quote Darth Vader, and I don't really believe like that, but I mean, it's
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:00.440]  always accurate.
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:01.440]  So I'm going to follow it.
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:07.440]  I was driving home last night at about six, and I really felt like I was in a fighting
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:08.440]  mode.
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:10.440]  Hillary's like a kingpin of evil.
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:14.440]  She's like, you know, a ringwraith, and I just like, man, they're really coming after
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:15.440]  me.
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:18.440]  I can really feel that serious stuff is going on, and I'm really hurting them, and I was
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:21.440]  like, please God, I hope bigger leaders come up, so I'm going to be at the tip of the
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:22.440]  spear.
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:25.640]  I mean, I want to do it, but I also am a little bit selfish for my family, and these kind of
[3:15:25.640 --> 3:15:26.640]  thoughts have my head.
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:30.440]  And then I, and Paul Watson calls and goes, Hillary Clinton just said you defeated her.
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:32.440]  The info wars is what stopped her in the election.
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:37.120]  And of course it was Drudge and all of us together and everybody, but the fact that they single
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:41.880]  me out when she talks about me, she has such hate and she is a murdering kingpin.
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:44.040]  This is Jeffrey Dahmer with an army.
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:51.880]  I mean, this is a woman that is literally supports whole combines of evil and exploitation
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:15:52.880]  of children.
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:53.880]  You name it.
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:54.880]  They've all been caught.
[3:15:54.880 --> 3:15:55.880]  Jerry Epstein, all of it.
[3:15:55.880 --> 3:15:56.880]  It is creepy.
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:15:57.880]  It's not a power trip, folks.
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:01.400]  It's not like walking some red carpet in Hollywood and people are waving at you because you're
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:02.400]  cool.
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:03.400]  I mean, that's sick enough.
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:07.520]  I don't, it's like to be in this position of where they are saying we have discovered
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:11.400]  that info wars and Alex Jones is what advises the Russians.
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:16.960]  So now it's not the Russians tell us what to think, Rapaport, it's that they get it
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:17.960]  from us.
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:22.480]  You're info wars too, John, and then we command Russia.
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.320]  And then I mean, this is, this is getting insane.
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  Yeah.
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:31.000]  I spend all my days here, you know, you can see the hammers and sickles and everything
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:34.520]  around me and so on, right.
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:37.680]  This is completely deranged out of control.
[3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:40.280]  It has been out of control for a long time.
[3:16:40.280 --> 3:16:42.240]  They keep up the same insanity.
[3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:43.240]  Yeah.
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:46.320]  We're feeding information to the Russians, right?
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:49.280]  They have one of the largest spy apparatuses in the world.
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:56.120]  The US flies on Russia, Russia spies on the US, but it's you and me that are really feeding
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:17:01.480]  the information to Russia without which they would have no idea what's going on, right?
[3:17:01.480 --> 3:17:07.720]  I mean, only a deranged person would even start to believe it.
[3:17:07.720 --> 3:17:11.840]  Well, have you heard Nigel Farage is now under criminal investigation and, and of course
[3:17:11.840 --> 3:17:15.760]  they told us two months ago, I'm under it, but then I never get called to these committees.
[3:17:15.760 --> 3:17:18.120]  Hey, FBI, come on over here, man.
[3:17:18.120 --> 3:17:19.120]  Let's go.
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:20.120]  Let's go.
[3:17:20.120 --> 3:17:23.360]  I'm not even saying the average FBI person is bad, but this is a load of horse crap.
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:27.800]  It's like saying, I'm under investigation for being a Martian, and I'm getting tired
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:29.640]  of it, man.
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:33.480]  Where's the congressional committee where you can go under oath and sit there and testify?
[3:17:33.480 --> 3:17:36.920]  They have the committees and they say, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm getting ordered around by the
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:41.160]  Russians and then they don't call me since when does this type of death testify, right?
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:45.120]  No, no, we don't want to hear what you have to say.
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:47.680]  That's the last thing we want, right?
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:55.480]  Meanwhile, I keep republishing this story over and over again, 20% of US uranium goes
[3:17:55.480 --> 3:18:03.400]  to Putin, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Fatigues, you know, on top of that
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:06.080]  whole caper.
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.040]  Imagine what would happen if it was Trump.
[3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:13.840]  I just republished the New York Times article that exposed all this two years ago.
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:14.840]  Let me translate this.
[3:18:14.840 --> 3:18:15.920]  Let me translate this.
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:22.680]  The Clintons gave the Russians more fissile material for their topos supersonic Mach 4.7
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:24.920]  missiles that we can't defeat.
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:27.280]  Russia doesn't have all the uranium we have.
[3:18:27.280 --> 3:18:29.040]  Russia is run out of fissile material.
[3:18:29.040 --> 3:18:34.640]  We gave Russia their next generation fissile material for hydrogen bombs.
[3:18:34.640 --> 3:18:36.360]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton.
[3:18:36.360 --> 3:18:39.520]  There's the article up on the screen for people that are watching.
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:41.520]  I think it was April of 2015.
[3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:46.120]  Yeah, cash flowed to Clinton's foundation of the Russian uranium deal.
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:47.600]  Imagine if Trump gave them 20, 30% of our...
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:48.600]  Exactly.
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:49.600]  This is what I was saying.
[3:18:49.600 --> 3:18:53.800]  The other day, I republished that Times article and I substituted Trump's name everywhere
[3:18:53.800 --> 3:18:55.440]  that they said Clinton.
[3:18:55.440 --> 3:18:58.440]  And I said, what would be the reaction to that?
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:02.320]  Trump would be living in a bunker under the White House, you know, trembling in the dark.
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:05.920]  I mean, they would have him up for treason to be shot.
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.520]  And here's the deal again, how the Clintons sold out US natural interests, national interests
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:11.520]  to the...
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:12.520]  National review.
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:13.520]  And I love how Trump's a real leader.
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:14.520]  Again, not kissing his butt.
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:15.520]  It's true.
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:18.720]  He tells the Russians, it is totally insane, Comey's nuts.
[3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:21.560]  Of course, we're not colluding and everybody's like groveling around.
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:24.040]  If you're not colluding, then say it's nuts.
[3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:28.360]  It's like, if they charge me with being a bank robber, if the cops showed up and said,
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:31.600]  you're a person of interest in a bank robbery, I'd laugh at him because I didn't rob any
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:32.600]  bank.
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:33.600]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:34.600]  Like, okay, great.
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:37.960]  You know, I mean, Trump's like, oh yeah, the Russians, give me a break.
[3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:39.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:19:39.520 --> 3:19:41.800]  And what about the Clintons?
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:42.800]  Let's have an investigation.
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:46.400]  Well, the big news, I have this from high level, we're mainstream news since the 90s.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:49.400]  You know, this is investigative journals, some of the top TV shows in the country, newspapers.
[3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:50.560]  But it was all over the news.
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:51.800]  They gave the missiles.
[3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:53.000]  They gave the delivery systems.
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:54.560]  They gave the Merv technology.
[3:19:54.560 --> 3:19:55.920]  They gave the reentry devices.
[3:19:55.920 --> 3:19:58.480]  They gave the miniaturization warhead technology.
[3:19:58.480 --> 3:20:03.920]  They gave them lock, stock, barrel, all of our 1960s and 70s technology.
[3:20:03.920 --> 3:20:08.360]  They didn't give them 80s and 90s, but still, we could anywhere in the world in 1960, 1970.
[3:20:08.360 --> 3:20:14.880]  They gave them a third generation, Werner von Braun, Nazi intercontinental ballistic
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:16.440]  missile technology.
[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:19.280]  The Russians wouldn't give the Chinese that.
[3:20:19.280 --> 3:20:20.280]  The Clintons did.
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:21.640]  So even so, what about the Russians?
[3:20:21.640 --> 3:20:26.280]  The Russians weren't dumb enough to give the Chinese their ICBM technology.
[3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:29.680]  The Clintons did for this much campaign cash.
[3:20:29.680 --> 3:20:31.120]  Almost nothing.
[3:20:31.120 --> 3:20:32.560]  That was the deal.
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:33.960]  There were prosecutions.
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:35.660]  There were trials.
[3:20:35.660 --> 3:20:38.360]  People refused to even think about it anymore.
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:39.360]  I'll just not cover that.
[3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:40.360]  It's not important.
[3:20:40.360 --> 3:20:44.800]  It's not important that the Clintons gave 20% of US uranium to Putin.
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:45.800]  Who cares?
[3:20:45.800 --> 3:20:46.800]  It doesn't matter.
[3:20:46.800 --> 3:20:49.320]  I mean, I'm going to be honest.
[3:20:49.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  What is the...
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:56.040]  If you give the Chinese until the 90s, could not get ICBMs off the pad.
[3:20:56.040 --> 3:20:57.520]  Most of them blew up like North Korea.
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:20:58.520]  It's not easy.
[3:20:58.520 --> 3:20:59.520]  Okay?
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:00.520]  Okay.
[3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:01.520]  The Russians and the Germans figured out how to do it.
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:04.040]  Some of the US to a certain degree, but we couldn't do rockets until we got the Germans.
[3:21:04.040 --> 3:21:07.680]  Let's just face it, the Germans are the best, then the Russians.
[3:21:07.680 --> 3:21:13.960]  We have a boost on Russian rockets today, okay, to show the slide in brainpower we have.
[3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:17.760]  They destroyed the Saturn rocket codes for whatever reason.
[3:21:17.760 --> 3:21:19.680]  That sabotage against us.
[3:21:19.680 --> 3:21:21.960]  We can't even make a Saturn rocket today.
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:25.200]  And then meanwhile, they gave this stuff to the Chinese.
[3:21:25.200 --> 3:21:27.320]  Why would the elite do that?
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:28.320]  John?
[3:21:28.320 --> 3:21:31.480]  Well, we know the Clintons did it for cash.
[3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:38.760]  Why the elites would do that is because they want to provoke a sinking of the United States
[3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:43.720]  down to the lowest possible level because, let's face it, it's really the only place
[3:21:43.720 --> 3:21:49.600]  on the planet that's left that has any idea of what freedom means and actually even has
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:51.440]  a vague concept of it.
[3:21:51.440 --> 3:21:57.160]  And that's what has to be destroyed in order for your world management system of globalism
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:21:59.440]  to take over completely.
[3:21:59.440 --> 3:22:06.520]  This is the last bastion of any idea of what you, the individual, mean and what your freedom
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:09.640]  means and your power means.
[3:22:09.640 --> 3:22:13.720]  Everywhere else, it's fading into complete oblivion.
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:16.800]  And that is why the United States is the primary target.
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:17.800]  And we're waiting for the president.
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:18.800]  I want to go to Trent.
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:19.800]  I want to go to Carlos.
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:20.800]  I want to go to Rod.
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:21.800]  And that's it.
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:22.800]  I'm going to turn the show over to John Rappaport.
[3:22:22.800 --> 3:22:23.800]  No more fake news.com.
[3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:28.400]  But is this like you're caught in a riptide and you're trying to get some air as a surfer
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:29.400]  and you get pulled under?
[3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:33.400]  Are we just getting some air with Trump and Farage and some of the nationalist movements
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:35.360]  in Brazil trying to struggle free?
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:39.280]  Or have we kind of gotten on a little little island, you know, crawled up on the beach?
[3:22:39.280 --> 3:22:42.560]  I mean, do you think we're just getting some air right now struggling for our lives?
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:45.160]  Or is this kind of a new beach head to a new beginning?
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:46.240]  Because I feel the momentum.
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:51.040]  I see it, but the globalists also are so crafty.
[3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:57.360]  Right now I would say we just we got some air and it's up to us really keep saying this
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:22:59.440]  over and over again.
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:04.600]  It's the movement of people who want freedom, determined to have it at any cost.
[3:23:04.600 --> 3:23:08.840]  Your activity kicks our legs back up to get air collectively.
[3:23:08.840 --> 3:23:09.920]  That's right.
[3:23:09.920 --> 3:23:13.920]  And if the people decide, well, we don't really want freedom, doesn't matter who's in the
[3:23:13.920 --> 3:23:17.120]  White House, doesn't matter who you support.
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:21.920]  It's the people who decided, OK, we're going to roll the dice on Trump because we hear
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:23.240]  what he has to say.
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:25.880]  We can't guarantee he's going to keep any promises.
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:28.960]  We know he could keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House.
[3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:29.960]  All right.
[3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:33.800]  But these people, these millions of people still have their own idea of what freedom
[3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:34.800]  is.
[3:23:34.800 --> 3:23:35.800]  And that's the important thing.
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:40.680]  And it's us exercising our will that that is is causing this global movement.
[3:23:40.680 --> 3:23:44.840]  So again, when Hillary says the info or beat her, you beat her and I'm not patting you
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:45.840]  on the head.
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:47.600]  You need to realize the power you have audience.
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:51.640]  I'm on my knees, my children, your children, we're in this together.
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:55.280]  I try to be an example of fearlessness because we're in a death battle.
[3:23:55.280 --> 3:23:56.840]  There's no point in being scared.
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:23:59.120]  It's all or nothing.
[3:23:59.120 --> 3:24:01.120]  It's freedom or slavery.
[3:24:01.120 --> 3:24:02.120]  That's the deal.
[3:24:02.120 --> 3:24:03.120]  That's right.
[3:24:03.120 --> 3:24:04.120]  Trent in Oregon.
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:05.120]  Trent, you're on the air.
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:06.120]  We're waiting for Trump's speech.
[3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:07.120]  Supposed to start.
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:08.120]  We're supposed to start 25 minutes ago.
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:09.120]  Right.
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:10.120]  We'll see what happens.
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:11.120]  Trent in Oregon, you're on the air.
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:12.120]  Yes.
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:14.400]  Two quick comments and hopefully allow me to plug.
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:17.720]  I'm a 14 year info warrior, first time caller.
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:20.720]  My first comment is on your video that you posted late last night.
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:26.640]  I just wanted to say that you don't have to have any fear about not winning, not succeeding.
[3:24:26.640 --> 3:24:30.880]  You've woken so many of us up, we're doing the fight for you.
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:31.880]  Well, I appreciate that.
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:36.280]  I don't want to whine about it and I'm happy because I ask for this, but every month now
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:41.240]  it's exponentially attacks and I'm fine with it.
[3:24:41.240 --> 3:24:43.280]  It's not fun, but go ahead.
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:44.280]  Yes.
[3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:49.840]  Well, a lot of us, it's going to upset people to hear this, but a lot of us would take a
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:51.840]  bullet for you.
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:52.840]  I appreciate you.
[3:24:52.840 --> 3:24:53.840]  I love you guys.
[3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:56.520]  I'm very humbled by the audience being so putting up with me because I'm pretty obnoxious
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:24:59.400]  sometimes, but I'm trying my best.
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:04.160]  My second comment is a comment you made about two months ago on the show with Roger Stone,
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:05.160]  where you made it.
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:10.600]  You had said that some of the most good people out there with the biggest heart can be the
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:15.520]  most evil and I'm here to say that really resonated with me and that the only reason
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:20.120]  a lot of these New World Order folks are still walking in God's green earth is because we
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:26.600]  have restraint and they should be thanking their lucky stars that we do have restraint.
[3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:32.920]  Yeah, it's the good guys that are the real killer machines and it's not a fun thing.
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:38.360]  It's just that evil likes to gloat, sit there and do all that stuff, but the truth is usually
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:41.360]  evil wants somebody else to do the killing for them.
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:42.360]  God bless you.
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:44.520]  Anything else, Trent?
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:49.880]  I just like to plug a great group of musicians, small leeks, sink ships.
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:53.520]  Their whole platform is about waking people up to the love of God.
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:54.520]  Say that again.
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:25:58.160]  Crushing the small leeks, sink ships.
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:25:59.760]  Small leeks, sink ships.
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:05.320]  Yep, their whole goal is to wake people up to the love of God against this satanic media
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:07.400]  that we're fighting every single day.
[3:26:07.400 --> 3:26:10.160]  God bless you in four wars and thank you very much.
[3:26:10.160 --> 3:26:11.160]  And look at all, thank you, sir.
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:15.360]  Look at all these globalists attacking Trump and the nationalist agenda, which isn't perfect,
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:17.480]  but has a good will behind it.
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:21.880]  They're the loose lips trying to sink our ship, John.
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:24.040]  They've been doing that for a very long time.
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:26.480]  I mean, look at what's happening now.
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:32.480]  Any conversation that would take place within Washington or the Trump Tower or whatever from
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:37.400]  anybody in the Trump team, it's obvious that it's going to be recorded.
[3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:43.200]  And at the pleasure of any of the intelligence agencies that are working against this administration
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:45.880]  will be leaked to the press automatically.
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:52.040]  You've even got reporters who are diehard on the left that are not only seeing through
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:57.520]  this, but screaming about it, saying, unbelievable that this is allowed to go on.
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:26:59.320]  Looks like we've got Trump here, right?
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:00.320]  Not yet.
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:01.320]  We're just waiting.
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:02.320]  We're just showing folks.
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:03.320]  Keep going.
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:04.320]  Okay.
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:09.200]  And it seems to me Glenn Greenwald, he's one of the guys that's been writing about this.
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:15.280]  This is completely insane that anything is now leakable and major media don't care about
[3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:16.280]  it.
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:18.440]  They can commit all these felonies, but if anybody else did it or Trump did it, he'd
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:19.440]  be in trouble.
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:24.920]  And notice how it's old classical liberals like Greenwald and Assange and others and
[3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:28.800]  all these old CIA people that are liberals are actually the ones defending Trump going,
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:29.800]  this is a deep state coup.
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:35.240]  This is private interest lying, running rampant, I mean, where is the old lefts?
[3:27:35.240 --> 3:27:38.640]  I mean, I would disagree with some of their stuff, but they used to be good people overall.
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:39.640]  What happened?
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:43.600]  Listen, I used to know a lot of them and they've made a shift.
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:49.520]  I mean, you guys actually, I think it was Watson who did this, just to show the level
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:53.040]  of intelligence is sunk to all time low.
[3:27:53.040 --> 3:27:54.600]  That's what's happened to the left.
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:27:59.840]  But there was a woman who was interviewed, a young woman about Brexit, you know, because
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:05.000]  all of a sudden the left and the young are saying, oh my God, if Brexit comes in, we're
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  all doomed.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.840]  She said, it's racist, it's evil, and she didn't know anything about it.
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:13.120]  And then she said, and I won't be able to go to Paris.
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:14.120]  Remember that?
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:19.720]  She said, I won't, if Brexit comes in, she's British, I won't be able to go to Paris.
[3:28:19.720 --> 3:28:20.720]  What?
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:22.920]  Total disconnect from reality.
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:23.920]  No.
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:27.360]  The EU bureaucrat, Yonker, won't be making all your decisions.
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:28.360]  That's all.
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:29.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:30.360]  The unelected.
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:33.960]  You'll be able to go to Paris as they won't flood it with 10 million more Islamists.
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:34.960]  Right.
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:36.600]  Exactly.
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:43.560]  You saw a member, went late 1990s, had all these globalists protests in Seattle and Washington
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:45.840]  against globalism, giant corporations.
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:47.720]  The left totally got it back then.
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:48.960]  The left was there.
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:49.960]  That's it.
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:53.880]  Now, they're rioting on behalf of, they don't know what, but whether they're rioting
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:58.760]  on the behalf of the very multinationals they were protesting in 1999.
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:28:59.760]  Exactly.
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:01.240]  It's a total switch around.
[3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:07.560]  And the only way to explain it is, they are so incredibly stupid and dumbed down now that
[3:29:07.560 --> 3:29:10.440]  they have no minds of their own left.
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:15.880]  They can only go along with, here's a slogan, eat it, repeat it, eat it, repeat it.
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:16.880]  That's all they've got.
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:17.880]  That's all they've got.
[3:29:17.880 --> 3:29:18.880]  You know, that's crazy.
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:24.040]  They are literally funded by the very multinational globalist that are anti-free market crony
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:30.240]  capitalist that they were, the left was like good protesting WTO, taking away American
[3:29:30.240 --> 3:29:33.760]  sovereignty, exploiting workers that they were doing a great job.
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:38.600]  And now they look at us and call us Nazis, because we don't want Obama's secret TPP that
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:39.600]  Hillary wrote.
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:42.000]  I mean, it's just like crazy.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:44.160]  We'll be back with Rod and Carlos.
[3:29:44.160 --> 3:29:45.160]  Carlos, you're up next.
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:46.160]  The president's about to speak.
[3:29:46.160 --> 3:29:47.760]  He's 30 minutes late though.
[3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:50.160]  The word is he's going to pull out, we're going to see what happens.
[3:29:50.160 --> 3:30:01.280]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:06.040]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year.
[3:30:06.040 --> 3:30:09.960]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:14.200]  election have come to pass and the elites now see their power base crumbling before
[3:30:14.200 --> 3:30:15.600]  their very eyes.
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:20.200]  Among some of the subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration and can he
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:23.280]  be heel also the rise of populism.
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:26.360]  Elites are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling.
[3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:31.280]  Now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending HR McMaster, Wilbur
[3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:33.360]  Ross and Chris Liddell.
[3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:38.000]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  administration.
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:40.720]  There are two ways at which this can go.
[3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:44.200]  Either the Globals will try to bring Trump to heel or they will try to impeach him after
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:45.880]  the 2018 election.

[3:31:10.000 --> 3:31:14.200]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[3:31:14.200 --> 3:31:18.400]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[3:31:18.400 --> 3:31:23.720]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[3:31:34.640 --> 3:31:37.360]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:31:37.360 --> 3:31:41.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[3:31:41.640 --> 3:31:44.320]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[3:32:00.840 --> 3:32:04.520]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[3:32:04.520 --> 3:32:06.760]  in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:32:06.760 --> 3:32:08.600]  Search across the board is clear.
[3:32:08.600 --> 3:32:12.560]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[3:32:12.560 --> 3:32:13.960]  clots and heart attacks.
[3:32:13.960 --> 3:32:18.560]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[3:32:18.560 --> 3:32:21.320]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:21.320 --> 3:32:25.760]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[3:32:25.760 --> 3:32:28.400]  iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:32.920]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[3:32:32.920 --> 3:32:37.600]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath, just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen
[3:32:37.600 --> 3:32:43.720]  by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more due to requests
[3:32:43.720 --> 3:32:47.760]  from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[3:32:47.760 --> 3:32:51.480]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.

[3:33:00.000 --> 3:33:07.720]  All right, perfect timing, the president from WhiteHouse.gov is walking up live right now
[3:33:07.720 --> 3:33:12.320]  on pulling us out of the world government 100 trillion per decade global carbon tax.
[3:33:12.320 --> 3:33:18.920]  Here is President Trump, this is devastating to the enemy, ladies and gentlemen, this is
[3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:23.960]  unbelievable, this is a tax on what plants breathe selectively by the globalist through
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:24.960]  total control.
[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:30.560]  Thank you very much, thank you.
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:38.480]  I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:48.200]  We're closely monitoring the situation and I will continue to give updates anything happens
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:54.040]  during this period of time but it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout
[3:33:54.040 --> 3:33:57.080]  the world with terror.
[3:33:57.080 --> 3:34:04.880]  Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:12.480]  Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:18.920]  absolutely tremendous economic progress since election day on November 8th.
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:25.560]  The economy is starting to come back and very, very rapidly.
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:33.000]  We've added 3.3 trillion dollars in stock market value to our economy and more than
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  a million private sector jobs.
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:43.520]  I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly 350 billion dollars of
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:49.840]  military and economic development for the United States creating hundreds of thousands
[3:34:49.840 --> 3:34:50.840]  of jobs.
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:54.720]  It was a very, very successful trip.
[3:34:54.720 --> 3:34:55.720]  Totally delivering.
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:34:56.720]  Totally delivering.
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:34:57.720]  Thank you.
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:58.720]  I mean, he's delivering.
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:34:59.720]  Thank you.
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:01.880]  In fact, we have the British Member of Parliament.
[3:35:01.880 --> 3:35:09.600]  In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:16.440]  that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:21.720]  We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and perhaps even peace between
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:24.680]  the Israelis and the Palestinians.
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:32.360]  Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up and you see that, you see it all over.
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:36.440]  From the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:44.160]  contributions to the fight against terror, big, big contributions are being made by countries
[3:35:44.160 --> 3:35:49.040]  that weren't doing so much in the form of contribution.
[3:35:49.040 --> 3:35:53.240]  One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to American people during my campaign
[3:35:53.240 --> 3:36:00.800]  for president, whether it's cutting job-killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:08.600]  Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:15.200]  in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:24.200]  into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:27.120]  And believe me, we've just begun.
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:31.440]  The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly, even more so.
[3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:32.800]  Wow, this is incredible.
[3:36:32.800 --> 3:36:38.400]  On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments and I don't want
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:42.680]  anything to get in our way.
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:47.880]  I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:49.920]  He's under total attack.
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:37:00.960]  Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:10.040]  States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:12.040]  Thank you.
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:20.760]  It's amazing, John.
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:21.760]  Thank you.
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:24.360]  Go ahead and say, John, we can talk about this a little bit.
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:35.320]  But begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or in really entirely new transaction
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:41.720]  when terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people.
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:42.720]  I told Moncton this today.
[3:37:42.720 --> 3:37:43.720]  It's taxpayers.
[3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:45.200]  I said, it's all a fraud.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:46.200]  So we're getting out.
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:47.200]  160 countries are exempt.
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:48.200]  But we're not in it.
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:53.200]  We're going to start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.
[3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:55.800]  And if we can, that's great.
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:57.040]  And if we can't, that's fine.
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:37:58.600]  Yeah, it's decided the industrializers.
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:37:59.600]  Bye.
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:00.600]  He's out.
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:06.640]  As president, I can put no other consideration before the well-being of American citizens.
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:08.400]  Wow, this is so evil to President Glomers.
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:13.680]  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:22.320]  that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:30.320]  American workers who I love and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs,
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:38.400]  poor wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:40.320]  The economic war on America's overflows.
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:47.800]  As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:48.800]  Accord.
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:50.000]  That's right.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:55.080]  And the draconian financial and economic burdens, the agreement imposes.
[3:38:55.080 --> 3:38:58.320]  So Obama put us under this even though we didn't ratify.
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:06.920]  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution, and
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:15.080]  very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast
[3:39:15.080 --> 3:39:16.600]  fortune.
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:21.440]  That pays for the Caprio's planes, the flight of the PR events, and all the caviar.
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:26.080]  Appliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the owner's energy restrictions that
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:34.200]  is placed in the United States could cost America as much as $2.7 million lost jobs
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:37.200]  by 2025.
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:42.080]  According to the National Economic Research Associates.
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:48.600]  This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, but we need, believe me, this is not
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:40:00.240]  what we need, including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:05.480]  on which countless communities rely.
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:11.840]  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:19.000]  According to the same study by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:26.440]  previous administration would cut production for the following sectors.
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:33.680]  Paper down 12%, cement down 23%.
[3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:35.480]  Hell there's taxes on beef.
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:50.720]  Carbon and steel down 38%, coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86%, natural
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:53.800]  gas down 31%.
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:41:02.320]  The cost of the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and $6.5
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:13.440]  million in industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and in many
[3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:19.080]  cases much worse than that.
[3:41:19.080 --> 3:41:26.800]  Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to
[3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:33.360]  live up to our environmental ideals as someone who cares deeply about the environment which
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:34.360]  I do.
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:35.360]  It doesn't make China cut.
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:40.080]  I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States, which is
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:42.800]  what it does.
[3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:52.040]  The world's leader in environmental protection while imposing no meaningful obligations on
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:41:56.480]  the world's leading polluters.
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:06.040]  China, for example, under the agreement China will be able to increase these emissions by
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:09.480]  a staggering number of years, 13.
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:17.560]  They can do 21 for 13 years, not us.
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:25.600]  Contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:29.040]  developed countries.
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:36.720]  There are many other examples, but the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:42.080]  at the highest level to the United States.
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:49.080]  Further while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America,
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:56.160]  which it does, and the mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks,
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:02.640]  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places, a big opening of a brand new mine
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:06.080]  that's unheard of for many, many years that hasn't happened.
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:10.680]  They asked me if I'd go, I'm going to try.
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:16.680]  China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants, so we can't build
[3:43:16.680 --> 3:43:17.680]  the plants.
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:22.160]  Yeah, but they can, according to this agreement.
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:25.160]  India will be allowed to double its coal production.
[3:43:25.160 --> 3:43:26.160]  His dad had nothing.
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:32.040]  I think he had to fight in New York for it, that's why Trump relishes this, beating the
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:33.040]  big guys.
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:34.040]  He's a billionaire.
[3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:38.240]  Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:43.320]  In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out
[3:43:43.320 --> 3:43:49.280]  of America and the United States and ships them to foreign countries.
[3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:51.760]  God, it's like I wrote these talking points, this is awesome.
[3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:59.280]  This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial
[3:43:59.280 --> 3:44:02.000]  advantage over the United States.
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  They sold us out.
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  God, Trump gets the whole story out.
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:10.040]  The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement.
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:12.560]  All you anti-American haters, it's overdone, asses.
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:13.560]  They were so happy.
[3:44:13.560 --> 3:44:14.560]  Even if he killed Trump.
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:21.840]  The simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:26.840]  love, to their American haters, very, very big economic disadvantage.
[3:44:26.840 --> 3:44:27.840]  We're American lovers.
[3:44:27.840 --> 3:44:31.840]  See, it's all, it's not that we have the same talking points, we just believe the same thing.
[3:44:31.840 --> 3:44:33.000]  It's common sense.
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  And their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:45.600]  major economic wound.
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:47.600]  Wow.
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:50.000]  We would find it very hard to compete.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:53.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's not just evil.
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:54.800]  You are looking for the turn of America.
[3:44:54.800 --> 3:44:55.800]  Trump is real.
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:58.000]  We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet.
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  They are out to get him.
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:00.640]  I can't believe he's this good.
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:06.480]  This is so real that every degenerate force on earth, Islam, radical Islam, the pope,
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:13.120]  says it's an insult if you don't do this to me, with the hijacked Catholic church.
[3:45:13.120 --> 3:45:16.360]  Taking away the great wealth of our nation, it's great wealth.
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  It's phenomenal.
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:19.280]  And if folks want to hear Trump by himself, that's fine.
[3:45:19.280 --> 3:45:20.960]  We give live commentary on the radio.
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:23.680]  We have no idea we had such wealth.
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:29.320]  And leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
[3:45:29.320 --> 3:45:30.320]  Which they do on purpose.
[3:45:30.320 --> 3:45:31.320]  Wow.
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:39.480]  This agreement is a massive redistribution of United States' wealth to other countries.
[3:45:39.480 --> 3:45:42.640]  Hey, Soros.
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:51.400]  At 1% growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand.
[3:45:51.400 --> 3:46:01.160]  But at 3% or 4% growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy
[3:46:01.160 --> 3:46:03.160]  or our country.
[3:46:03.160 --> 3:46:06.440]  Yeah, they blew our energy sector.
[3:46:06.440 --> 3:46:09.080]  It calls totally clean now.
[3:46:09.080 --> 3:46:12.200]  We'll be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts.
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:18.240]  Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases.
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:25.960]  And the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished
[3:46:25.960 --> 3:46:27.320]  quality of life.
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:29.000]  This is the rebirth of America.
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:36.360]  Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations,
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:49.600]  it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree, think of that, as much Celsius reduction
[3:46:49.600 --> 3:46:59.120]  in global temperature by the year 2100.
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:08.000]  In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America,
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:15.840]  and this is incredible statistic, would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:24.200]  reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:32.600]  lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:35.640]  and for our homes.
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:46.160]  As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning, the reality is that withdrawing is in America's
[3:47:46.160 --> 3:47:54.200]  economic interest and won't matter much to the climate.
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:48:00.760]  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:06.560]  environmentally friendly country on earth, we will be the cleanest, we will have the
[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:13.360]  cleanest air, we will have the cleanest water, we will be environmentally friendly, but we're
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:18.400]  not going to put our businesses out of work, we're not going to lose our jobs, we're going
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:19.400]  to grow.
[3:48:19.400 --> 3:48:36.000]  And I think you just read, it just came out minutes ago, the small business report, small
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:42.320]  businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people, one of the best reports they've seen
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:44.880]  in many years.
[3:48:44.880 --> 3:48:51.760]  I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:49:01.040]  Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate
[3:49:01.040 --> 3:49:05.600]  a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.
[3:49:05.600 --> 3:49:06.600]  And this is the new deal.
[3:49:06.600 --> 3:49:10.720]  Let me just say this while rapping towards here, we'll go to the President, obviously
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:13.280]  want to hear his full speeches on him for us, without me talking over it.
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:16.800]  Obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructed.
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:21.320]  This is such history happening, we sold out America's industrial wealth, half the world's
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:25.600]  wealth in the last 50 years to these globalist interests, they've been screwing us over on
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:29.560]  purpose, making us poor to control us, and Trump is destroying it.
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:34.880]  This is like World War II or something, this is as important as anything in our history.
[3:49:34.880 --> 3:49:37.040]  This is 1776 part two.
[3:49:37.040 --> 3:49:41.920]  What he's saying is so revolutionary, is so damaging to them, because none of the media
[3:49:41.920 --> 3:49:46.280]  would ever say it, it's just logic, it's just common sense that it's irrevocable.
[3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:49.120]  Like you said it was the biggest thing in history at that point, when I went on Pierce
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:52.520]  Morgan and called Lee Manos, it was all fake, it was true, not that I was great, just that
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:53.840]  nobody ever challenged him.
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:58.160]  With Trump it's like that every day, I mean is this not the curtain falling?
[3:49:58.160 --> 3:50:07.080]  This is gigantic, the whole hoax coming down, the hoax on which was built the idea of destroying
[3:50:07.080 --> 3:50:13.680]  the American economy and other nations, and which he hasn't mentioned yet, lowering the
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:17.320]  total of energy production all over the world, in all countries.
[3:50:17.320 --> 3:50:19.280]  To reduce population.
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:23.760]  Which would inevitably reduce population, that's what's behind all this stuff about
[3:50:23.760 --> 3:50:24.760]  reducing pollution.
[3:50:24.760 --> 3:50:30.800]  Yeah, sure, you're going to reduce pollution by reducing energy production, that was the
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:35.480]  whole model, it still is, and he's saying bye bye.
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:40.280]  And let me throw this in, we'll go back to the president.
[3:50:40.280 --> 3:50:43.040]  We all want to sit here and go oh he's not perfect on this, he's not perfect on that
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.280]  to be purist, but I feel like I'm lying to the audience, if I don't just say I loved
[3:50:48.280 --> 3:50:52.320]  Donald Trump but he's a hero.
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:50:56.360]  He's in so much, they're probably going to kill him, my gut says he's dead in two years.
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:50:59.680]  Maybe sooner, they're encamped outside DC, openly saying they're going after him, they're
[3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:03.640]  coming after me hard, and I'm like one one hundredth of what Trump's doing, they just
[3:51:03.640 --> 3:51:07.360]  kind of see me as like another archetype of the publics, they want to destroy me to scare
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:10.440]  people, it's not that I'm that important.
[3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:13.760]  Trump's important, Trump's real, there's no way he's not real, my gut always said he
[3:51:13.760 --> 3:51:16.480]  was real and I didn't like my gut.
[3:51:16.480 --> 3:51:21.160]  This is irrevocable damage to the world government, okay, who are the worst people on earth.
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:26.040]  I mean Trump, let's just wrap it up, with this and the TPP and the other stuff, he's
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:29.560]  done some other things that aren't perfect because he's got his weird kind of old-fashioned
[3:51:29.560 --> 3:51:34.480]  throwback right-wing New York stuff going but you know kind of you know Roy Cohn stuff
[3:51:34.480 --> 3:51:38.440]  but other than that, the point is he's real, he means what he's doing, he's pure of heart
[3:51:38.440 --> 3:51:40.400]  even though we may disagree with him on some issues.
[3:51:40.400 --> 3:51:47.480]  I think Donald Trump may end up, if he's successful, he's George Washington 2.0.
[3:51:47.480 --> 3:51:55.160]  I just say look at the effects, kill the TPP and now kill this fake climate treaty in Paris.
[3:51:55.160 --> 3:51:56.400]  That's even bigger.
[3:51:56.400 --> 3:51:59.440]  Yeah, much bigger, much bigger.
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:01.600]  And then he explains how it's a total fraud.
[3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:04.840]  He doesn't argue that the temperature data is fake, we all know that.
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:09.440]  He shows, why is all these communist countries exempt, bullcrap man.
[3:52:09.440 --> 3:52:12.320]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting, go ahead and go back to the president.
[3:52:12.320 --> 3:52:18.680]  No, no, no, I agree with you, you know, he's saying, okay, we can't do this but they can.
[3:52:18.680 --> 3:52:22.200]  We can't pollute here but they can.
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:23.520]  You know, what does that mean?
[3:52:23.520 --> 3:52:27.320]  And then they're running dirty smokestacks without scrubbers, ours is totally clean.
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:29.760]  Water vapor carbon dioxide that we need.
[3:52:29.760 --> 3:52:33.240]  They're running all this dirty crap and then it's just crazy how the globalists are out
[3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:34.720]  to get us because they hate us.
[3:52:34.720 --> 3:52:35.720]  We're bitter clingers.
[3:52:35.720 --> 3:52:37.360]  Let's go back to the president.
[3:52:37.360 --> 3:52:43.720]  And global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.
[3:52:43.720 --> 3:52:45.600]  See, he's talking about the carbon tax, wow.
[3:52:45.600 --> 3:52:49.040]  They don't put America first.
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:50.040]  Oh my God.
[3:52:50.040 --> 3:52:52.440]  I do and I always will.
[3:52:52.440 --> 3:52:53.440]  Wow.
[3:52:53.440 --> 3:52:58.200]  Junker just came out and said he's going to defeat us, I mean, this is World War III.
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:04.400]  The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively
[3:53:04.400 --> 3:53:15.760]  cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lacks contributions
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:19.800]  to our critical military alliance.
[3:53:19.800 --> 3:53:20.800]  You see what's happening?
[3:53:20.800 --> 3:53:25.320]  I got to put my hand on my heart because this is like, this is like the Star Spangled
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:26.320]  Banner talking about.
[3:53:26.320 --> 3:53:27.320]  At what point does America get to be?
[3:53:27.320 --> 3:53:28.320]  He's totally screwed.
[3:53:28.320 --> 3:53:29.320]  He's saying it all.
[3:53:29.320 --> 3:53:30.400]  It's irrevocable damage.
[3:53:30.400 --> 3:53:33.600]  At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?
[3:53:33.600 --> 3:53:34.600]  Oh, there they is.
[3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:41.480]  We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxes.
[3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:42.720]  He is really representing us, John.
[3:53:42.720 --> 3:53:50.040]  We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore and they won't be.
[3:53:50.040 --> 3:53:52.080]  I can't believe it.
[3:53:52.080 --> 3:53:59.320]  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[3:53:59.320 --> 3:54:00.320]  It's unbelievable.
[3:54:00.320 --> 3:54:01.320]  God, this is incredible.
[3:54:01.320 --> 3:54:04.320]  This is going to hurt them so bad.
[3:54:04.320 --> 3:54:08.840]  Thank you, God.
[3:54:08.840 --> 3:54:18.400]  I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests.
[3:54:18.400 --> 3:54:23.160]  Any trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:29.120]  Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation.
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:36.080]  The process has begun from day one, but now we're down to business.
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:41.280]  Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another
[3:54:41.280 --> 3:54:50.120]  scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:55:00.080]  Fund, nice name, which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:07.880]  countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments.
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:14.520]  We're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we're already
[3:55:14.520 --> 3:55:17.520]  way ahead of anybody else many of the other countries have.
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:18.520]  The global government spent anything.
[3:55:18.520 --> 3:55:20.520]  I'm going to stop there because we've got to end the broadcast.
[3:55:20.520 --> 3:55:25.160]  I promise I've talked to Carlos from Montreal and just final comments to John Rabaport.
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:26.160]  Please financially support us.
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:27.600]  I'm trying to build a network to block these people.
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:29.120]  We've already had such big success.
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:30.800]  Hillary says we lost for the election.
[3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:31.920]  You lost for the election.
[3:55:31.920 --> 3:55:33.640]  We have the Memorial Day Special going through this weekend.
[3:55:33.640 --> 3:55:38.960]  I've extended it 65% off or 67% or whatever it is on much of the products.
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:40.480]  We've never done specials like this.
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:45.080]  65% off colloidal silver, 40% off super metal, 47% off the new tropic, brain force.
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:46.080]  M4slife.com.
[3:55:46.080 --> 3:55:49.800]  I don't know how you couldn't try these products.
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:50.800]  They're so good.
[3:55:50.800 --> 3:55:51.800]  Everybody needs colloidal silver.
[3:55:51.800 --> 3:55:53.720]  X2 is one of a kind product.
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:56.560]  We've got the great CNN terrorist stuff.
[3:55:56.560 --> 3:56:02.480]  I didn't get into Kathy Griffin, but it's such a time to be alive.
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:04.360]  So I want to go to Carlos.
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:07.360]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada, you're our last caller.
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:08.360]  Thanks for holding.
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:09.360]  Thank you.
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:13.200]  June 1st, 2017, a very happy Thursday.
[3:56:13.200 --> 3:56:14.680]  I can feel it.
[3:56:14.680 --> 3:56:15.680]  I can see it.
[3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:16.680]  This is a big day.
[3:56:16.680 --> 3:56:17.680]  Yes.
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:26.600]  Alex, when on February, Adroll suspended syndication for M4 wars, I applied a technique
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:31.520]  that I've developed over the years based on my analysis, what I call analysis of the
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  tea leaves.
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:40.320]  And just to make a long story short, it's called semantic analysis of the main trends.
[3:56:40.320 --> 3:56:44.280]  And to make a long story short, I can call you another day and discuss it further, but
[3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:50.200]  I just want to let you know that we came with the idea of a sentence that describes
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:57.440]  exactly the trends of the Democratic Party lost at the election, and they were effectively
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:00.760]  behaving as an analysis shows, so are losers.
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:06.600]  Now, the term losers come up in the last few days, which it just confirms our analysis.
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:13.480]  And so the message for a t-shirt that would carry to the election, the next election,
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:18.440]  would be better deplorable than sore loser.
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:24.400]  If you were to put that on a t-shirt, we did some analysis with 30 states that Trump won.
[3:57:24.400 --> 3:57:29.760]  The estimated number of t-shirts that would be bought from here to the election are between
[3:57:29.760 --> 3:57:32.000]  $600,000 and $800,000 t-shirt.
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  Well, that's exciting.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  I'll look into it.
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:36.000]  God bless you, Carlos.
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  That's a great idea.
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:39.280]  But it's better to be deplorable than to be a slave.
[3:57:39.280 --> 3:57:40.880]  I think what you said is on target.
[3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:43.520]  I'm just telling you, I don't care if Trump isn't real.
[3:57:43.520 --> 3:57:45.520]  I'm not hitched to him.
[3:57:45.520 --> 3:57:47.920]  It's popular to attacking.
[3:57:47.920 --> 3:57:54.360]  But he's doing things that are devastating the anti-human projects that are devastating
[3:57:54.360 --> 3:57:57.280]  to globalism and that have them all wanting to kill him.
[3:57:57.280 --> 3:57:58.760]  And I just can't believe it's this good.
[3:57:58.760 --> 3:58:00.960]  He's in combat, John Rappaport.
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:07.480]  This was an historic giant blow right here that we saw delivered.
[3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:14.360]  Gigantic blow against, God knows how many billions of dollars of sheer propaganda about
[3:58:14.360 --> 3:58:15.480]  so-called climates.
[3:58:15.480 --> 3:58:16.880]  Over 100 billion.
[3:58:16.880 --> 3:58:20.960]  Gigantic money giveaways, job giveaways.
[3:58:20.960 --> 3:58:24.480]  I mean, let's just say it, Trump is literally, he's the real John Wayne.
[3:58:24.480 --> 3:58:26.400]  I mean, he's what John Wayne wishes he was.
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:27.400]  This was devastating.
[3:58:27.400 --> 3:58:30.840]  He just blew off the table, just said, nope, we're not going to do that, we're not going
[3:58:30.840 --> 3:58:31.840]  to do that.
[3:58:31.840 --> 3:58:32.840]  He just blew up their whole program.
[3:58:32.840 --> 3:58:33.840]  John, thank you so much.
[3:58:33.840 --> 3:58:34.840]  Nally Newsnight, 7 o'clock.
[3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:35.840]  Oh, wow.
[3:58:35.840 --> 3:58:36.840]  No more fake news.com.
[3:58:36.840 --> 3:58:37.840]  Infowars.com.
[3:58:37.840 --> 3:58:38.840]  Please spread our links.
[3:58:38.840 --> 3:58:39.840]  Run or attack.
[3:58:39.840 --> 3:58:40.840]  Wow.
[3:58:40.840 --> 3:58:59.440]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
