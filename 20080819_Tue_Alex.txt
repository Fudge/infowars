[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.280 --> 00:18.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.840 --> 00:22.840]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.840 --> 00:32.160]  coming up in about 30 minutes we have the superintendent of schools in a
[00:32.160 --> 00:38.840]  particular school district here in Texas where they are arming the teachers he
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.840]  will be joining us in about 30 minutes Cindy Sheehan he is going to be on with
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.280]  us in the fourth hour today dealing with her run for the House of
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.680]  Representatives against the Speaker of the House's seat Nancy I love war and
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.240]  corruption and the police state Pelosi we will also have wide open phones
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.280]  throughout the broadcast today there's also an interesting little esoteric
[01:04.280 --> 01:09.880]  item that's up on Jones report dot com right now an exclusive that I'll be
[01:09.880 --> 01:15.120]  going over a little bit later that's Jones report dot com only nukes
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.320]  unlikely to be affected by Musharraf leaving office and that's because it is
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.000]  a military puppet dictatorship with US troops guarding those facilities in the
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.280]  same ruling 10 council that he's been a puppet for through the US and England is
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.840]  in control of the nuclear weapons but we'll be going over that ambush of
[01:35.840 --> 01:41.760]  French paratroopers near Kabul kills 10 in Afghanistan and the more US and
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.880]  quote coalition troops are dying now in Afghanistan then in Iraq Russian general
[01:47.880 --> 01:55.080]  says that Georgia may commit false flag terrorist attacks we even even have him
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.840]  saying this up on Russia today because that is a main tool of government
[02:00.840 --> 02:04.600]  staging terror attacks the Russians have done it throughout history but not as
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.600]  much as the British are the folks in the United States or the Israelis they
[02:09.600 --> 02:16.960]  just absolutely love it the Nazis were big supporters of that form of
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.480]  warfare and until the public realizes that most of the terror attacks and
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.960]  events you see our state sponsored to be blamed on their enemies I mean who has
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.720]  the motive all the Republican memos and Democratic memos and statesmen on both
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.600]  sides if you can call them that's a big New
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.320]  Brzezinski on the left and you've then got all these neocons on the right
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.800]  but they're all in the same team saying how great false flags are to show the
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.200]  public how to give up their rights and accept wars and basically not question
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.400]  their activities but top Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.480]  terror attacks we're gonna cover that out of the break that's a prison planet
[02:57.480 --> 03:01.760]  calm exclusive in the Western media we picked up on that in the Russian news and
[03:01.760 --> 03:07.500]  it's all detailed therefore you at prisonplanet.com Joe Biden who they're
[03:07.500 --> 03:12.880]  now reporting the AP and others is probably who Barack Obama is gonna tap
[03:12.880 --> 03:18.280]  if it's not Hillary Clinton in fact the Las Vegas is in a dead heat the people
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.280]  betting that it'll be Joe Biden or it will be hair Hillary Clinton both
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.400]  massacre criminals Joe Biden promises Georgia a billion dollars to quote
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.840]  rebuild after the vicious premeditated dastardly sneak attack of the Russians
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.760]  of course that isn't what happened but hey so what you know the public police
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.520]  fluorides good for them and mercury is good for them credit crunch may take
[03:42.520 --> 03:49.280]  out large US bank warrants a former IMF chief some financial news they're also
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.200]  Japan to label goods carbon footprints the AP's reporting and that's similar to
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.880]  what's happening in California and other places once you can label something
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.760]  you can begin taxing people on their choices and to tax you have to track
[04:01.760 --> 04:09.400]  and chronicle also Arctic ice sheet grows by 30% in one year at record
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.280]  levels since they've been recording the Arctic's growth doesn't matter the
[04:14.280 --> 04:20.360]  public can't find the Arctic and so I'm not being mean here they can just tell
[04:20.360 --> 04:24.120]  them that the polar bears can't swim there's more reports of that they're
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.480]  reporting on the news that polar bears are grounding because the ice all melted
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.880]  folks polar bears are the greatest swimming land mammal the great they can
[04:31.880 --> 04:37.440]  swim 300 miles they routinely swim 150 200 hunting does it matter they can't
[04:37.440 --> 04:42.120]  swim the public believes that they also believe Russia attack Georgia oh my god
[04:42.120 --> 04:46.400]  but they tell you except global tax regulate every facet of your life

[08:27.320 --> 08:37.720]  there is the visible world geopolitical jockeying different power structures
[08:37.720 --> 08:49.360]  colliding but then there is the unseen or the occult the the hidden and I want
[08:49.360 --> 08:57.520]  just briefly get into the hidden before I get into the scene we know that the
[08:57.520 --> 09:06.760]  ruling elite of the planet have been guarding knowledge of the
[09:06.760 --> 09:19.520]  agents for thousands of years the knowledge of architecture the knowledge of farming agriculture military
[09:19.520 --> 09:26.200]  knowledge organizational knowledge behavioral knowledge on how to govern
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.400]  populations how to manipulate populations that is just a historical
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.360]  fact that statecraft was developed to a high science four thousand years ago in
[09:37.360 --> 09:44.160]  Egypt and of course in Mesopotamia and other areas of the Middle East and
[09:44.160 --> 09:55.280]  Central Asia India China and the general public has been convinced at least in
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.360]  the past to believe that there is no hidden hand there are no elites there
[09:59.360 --> 10:04.480]  is no subterfuge going on there is no deception going on governments good the
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.720]  world's a wonderland everything's happy everything's fine just fall asleep at
[10:09.720 --> 10:15.800]  the wheel and just enjoy yourself life is a merry-go-round meanwhile carnage and
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.120]  death and destruction goes on all around us continually in the third world and
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.680]  different globalist bodies like the UN and others have been caught paying to
[10:24.680 --> 10:30.320]  have women sterilized and the old euthanized and one child policies and
[10:30.320 --> 10:40.560]  babies killed and all of that goes on and now instead of denying that China has
[10:40.560 --> 10:44.520]  quote secret torture prisons where they took not just demonstrators but people
[10:44.520 --> 10:51.920]  who didn't look right who might embarrass the Chinese government they take
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.240]  them to these facilities according to mainstream news and torture them and
[10:56.240 --> 11:01.960]  kill them and take their organs and in every major city they have 24 mobile
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.520]  execution vans per city that drive around around the clock just grabbing
[11:07.520 --> 11:15.360]  people and murdering them and does the US government say that's bad now no they
[11:15.360 --> 11:20.400]  did just 10 years ago 20 years ago does the British government to cry that no
[11:20.400 --> 11:29.280]  does the citizenry even really decry that no and now we get secret jails and the
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.040]  police were confronted a week and a half ago about we hear you've got federal
[11:32.040 --> 11:35.240]  funds to build this secret detainment facility for 5,000 people oh that's a
[11:35.240 --> 11:39.560]  conspiracy theory that's not going on and then it turns out they had built it
[11:39.560 --> 11:47.520]  it was going on I mean if they're gonna have some mass detainment facility why
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.520]  not just be honest about the fact you have it no it's all about secretiveness
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.040]  this this culture of secretiveness that that's all occult means is secretive
[11:57.040 --> 12:04.360]  hidden and we think of one of the vestigial arms of the occult is guys in
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.000]  pointy hats and witches and brooms that's a very small part of it it just
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.360]  means upper knowledge higher knowledge walled off knowledge secreted knowledge
[12:15.360 --> 12:24.480]  cloistered knowledge guarded knowledge and this is what they traffic in and
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.200]  their evil cannot stand if we simply become aware of it you know going back
[12:29.200 --> 12:38.160]  on the subject of China they've had fake fireworks displays they've had fake
[12:38.160 --> 12:48.280]  superimposed TV productions that they put out worldwide and several real showing
[12:48.280 --> 12:57.040]  God stepping into the arena on 888 at 888 in the afternoon with 888 drummers all
[12:57.040 --> 13:03.000]  playing at the same time all occultic mixing bizarre Germanic death cult
[13:03.000 --> 13:12.360]  druid rituals of the Olympics that Hitler revived for the 36 Olympics he drew
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.560]  the rings he came up with the torch the name everything is Adolf Elois Hitler a
[13:17.560 --> 13:21.120]  giant black magic ritual I mean you don't believe me just go to the encyclopedia
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.600]  it's admitted every time I throw that out that Hitler especially years ago
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.960]  when nobody seemed to know now it's more popularized it's even been on seeing in
[13:30.960 --> 13:35.000]  how good emails and calls going I thought you were crazy and I looked it up
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.800]  and it's true it's a weird Nazi black magic ritual well of course it is see
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.480]  that's all any of these people believe in they obsess on it it's constant mixed
[13:46.480 --> 13:54.880]  in with a bunch of bizarre Chinese mystery religion 5,000 year old weirdness
[13:54.880 --> 14:04.440]  numerology and so with that backdrop there have been scores of films scores of
[14:04.440 --> 14:16.400]  newspaper articles you in announcements speeches there was a Phillips TV ad where
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.960]  it says on 9 11 everything changes and this was in 1999 and it shows to have
[14:21.960 --> 14:29.520]  16's drop 2,000 pound bombs on the world trade centers and blow them up and it
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.680]  says Phillips changing your world what I mean that's not even veiled Tom Clancy
[14:34.680 --> 14:39.840]  comes out a year and a half before 9 11 and writes a novel about hijackers
[14:39.840 --> 14:44.840]  hijacking jet to fly them into the world trade centers Tom Clancy writes the
[14:44.840 --> 15:00.920]  script for the ghost troop ghost recon video game and in it
[15:03.800 --> 15:12.240]  in the middle of 2008 the video game was made in 2001 US forces backing
[15:12.240 --> 15:23.560]  Georgians attack Ossetia South Ossetia and are repulsed you see it's so
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.680]  important to them to flaunt it and throw it in your face and if you study black
[15:27.680 --> 15:35.320]  magic which I have done it's I mean I've read quite a few books on the
[15:35.320 --> 15:43.480]  subject if you study the occult by black magic that they just believe that they
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.200]  are actively for their own selfishness changing the world going out and
[15:48.200 --> 15:52.120]  interfering with others dominating others that's black magic or the left hand
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.760]  path the other right hand path which all these quote white magicians are into
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.320]  whether you believe it's real or not the elite really do believe in this and they
[16:01.320 --> 16:08.760]  believe that by putting out totems and signets and signs ziggurats or markers
[16:08.760 --> 16:14.120]  the Vikings did it the Egyptians did it the Aztecs did it they all do it but
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.720]  they're about to have a battle that the Vikings and the Aztecs and the Romans and
[16:19.720 --> 16:25.040]  and everybody else would march up with a stone or a wooden idol a standing stone
[16:25.040 --> 16:29.960]  and place it in the ground as a marker and they believe that that projected the
[16:29.960 --> 16:36.320]  God's strength into them for the attack I was just at the Capitol with family the
[16:36.320 --> 16:45.560]  Texas Capitol this weekend showing them around and we went into the Senate
[16:45.560 --> 16:49.160]  chambers that have all those famous paintings of battle of San Jacinta
[16:49.160 --> 16:56.640]  battle ago we had battle of the Alamo and on two of the major paintings to the
[16:56.640 --> 17:01.560]  one from photos of it I meant to put it on the web from San Jacinta and the
[17:01.560 --> 17:08.320]  Alamo there is the flag of the goddess and they're carrying it before them so
[17:08.320 --> 17:16.800]  this has been passed on since ancient times and that's that's what it is when
[17:16.800 --> 17:25.480]  you see all of these movies and all of these programs and and and I mean
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.880]  there's hundreds of them but I want to open a thread up on the prison planet
[17:28.880 --> 17:33.840]  dot-com forum last night when Aaron called me about this latest information
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.640]  discovered I just said I know you're real busy trying to finish up the
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.200]  encoding and the upload of fabled enemies for the members at prison planet
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.320]  dot TV in all these different formats and qualities I said but I want you to go
[17:46.320 --> 17:49.560]  ahead and write a blurb he said sure me and I said well don't spend hours on it
[17:49.560 --> 17:55.600]  just put the lone government and the Simpsons and this new one in there but
[17:55.600 --> 18:00.040]  we need to add a link on the prison planet dot-com forum so that our
[18:00.040 --> 18:04.160]  listeners can because I can't even remember all the hundreds of totems or
[18:04.160 --> 18:13.600]  or lesser magics the spells is what these are where they show you you know
[18:13.600 --> 18:20.960]  the Masonic U.S. Mint in the years before 9-11 creates the money where you
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.760]  can fold it and show the towers and the Pentagon and when they're hit when
[18:24.760 --> 18:30.360]  they're on fire when they collapse and then within an hour of 9-11 that was on
[18:30.360 --> 18:33.760]  the internet already people saying look you can fold money this way well those
[18:33.760 --> 18:39.080]  that were involved in the attacks they put that out when that was leaked out on
[18:39.080 --> 18:41.960]  the message boards within one hour of the attack no one would have noticed that
[18:41.960 --> 18:46.200]  no one would have known that you see this is important to them in this ritual
[18:46.200 --> 18:53.920]  magic that they are engaging in they believe that they need to leave tokens
[18:53.920 --> 19:06.280]  in the real world of what they're doing and they are doing and they do this over
[19:06.280 --> 19:11.440]  and over again now this latest piece of hundreds and I want listeners to go in
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.120]  and contribute there in the prison planet forum there's a link up on
[19:15.120 --> 19:17.840]  prisonplanet.com to the forum if you haven't been there and let's create a
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.720]  thread and let's there's hundreds I mean I'm thinking of them right now there's
[19:21.720 --> 19:27.360]  so many I could think of three Hollywood movies where they cut to a clock

[24:32.240 --> 24:37.640]  matrix and other 9-11 Hollywood symbolism Jones report dot com Aaron
[24:37.640 --> 24:41.720]  Dykes insiders love bragging to one another about being on the inside
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.680]  perhaps that's one explanation for the abundance of Illuminati symbolism and
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.320]  mainstream media and corporate logos among these interesting references the
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.360]  9-11 that have been uncovered in media release before 9-11 is a passport for
[24:54.360 --> 25:01.520]  Neo in the blockbuster film the matrix released in 1999 the passport in Neo's
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.680]  file shows an expiration date of September 11th 2001 seemingly now an
[25:07.680 --> 25:12.360]  eerie coincidence found in the smallest of details but guess when his passport
[25:12.360 --> 25:20.160]  was issued you know passports are issued for 10 years it was issued in on
[25:20.160 --> 25:28.040]  September 11th 1991 when George Herbert Walker Bush gave his state of the union
[25:28.040 --> 25:34.800]  speech calling for a new world order and a thousand points of life light and a
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.560]  new world coming into view a big idea so you see that over and over again it's
[25:41.560 --> 25:48.040]  issued on the day he calls for the new world order his passport expires on 9
[25:48.040 --> 25:55.120]  11 2001 and and what scene is this it's in the movie when the agents that he
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.800]  thinks their FBI doesn't know it's a matrix grab him and take him and then
[25:59.800 --> 26:08.480]  put that bug remember it literally a bug in his stomach to track him remember
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.440]  that and it's in that key scene while he's being interrogated and they're
[26:13.440 --> 26:22.680]  looking at his United States of America quote capital city USA and of course
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.720]  they say the real capital of the United States is New York City they call it the
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.920]  capital world so capital city USA September 11th 2001 passport agency
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.680]  United States of America and they throw it down on the counter in front of him
[26:37.680 --> 26:43.760]  you have to flip the the video over on its head which is more occultism and
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.800]  then you can see it straight on so it's backwards and the date is September 11
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.960]  2001 now this in and of itself is not that strong but when you then find out
[26:56.960 --> 27:04.000]  that Chris Carter in the X files six months before 9 11 put out a TV program
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.720]  the lone gunman the spinoff of the X files where the government a criminal
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.840]  element within the Pentagon hijacks a jet by remote control to fly into the
[27:13.840 --> 27:18.840]  World Trade Center using remote control and blaming it on hijackers locking down
[27:18.840 --> 27:22.920]  the communications of the plane and then you find out they plan to fly it into
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.360]  the towers to blame it on Afghanistan and launch a war in Central Asia and the
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.320]  Middle East and he starts talking to his father he's one of the you know high
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.240]  level shadow government people and he says one alone gunman he says dad you
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.880]  know how are they gonna cover this up how are they gonna do it he says an
[27:38.880 --> 27:47.440]  anti-terrorism exercise the government will be caught off guard because it's
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.920]  gonna be done as part of an anti-terror exercise tonight so exactly what happened
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.080]  six months later the government did run drills of the World Trade Center Pentagon
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.720]  being hit by hijacked jets that day and that was used as the cover and don't
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.800]  forget they had tripod two of an anthrax attack going on where they had
[28:05.800 --> 28:08.600]  already days before moved out of building seven and moved to mobile
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.400]  command centers so they could continue to organize and run everything even when
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.000]  they blew their own buildings up I mean it is just amazing and then you look at
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.080]  seven seven the exact trains being bombed at the exact same time at the
[28:23.080 --> 28:29.440]  exact same locations one out of 23 plus Tretagillian billions of times all the
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.960]  grains of sand in all the world but then you see all the other 9-11 symbolism in
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.960]  TV and movies leading up to 9-11 then you have a long kiss good night in 97
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.600]  big Hollywood movie where a secret government group of defense contractors
[28:46.600 --> 28:50.320]  have tried to blow up the World Trade Center in 93 which is really what they
[28:50.320 --> 28:53.560]  did that came out the New York Times and they say but this time you know the
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.960]  terrorists didn't do a good job for us so we're just going to blow it up
[28:55.960 --> 29:01.120]  ourselves how else are we going to get a war in the Middle East so later in the
[29:01.120 --> 29:04.840]  show I'm gonna get back into this and play some of those clips or our great
[29:04.840 --> 29:08.120]  YouTube directors out there welcome to take my analysis right now and put it
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.120]  in with all those clips of the Matrix and the lone gunman and all of this and
[29:12.120 --> 29:14.720]  and because I don't have the personnel if you want to really wake people up
[29:14.720 --> 29:20.680]  that'll be a top viral video whoever makes that but but this is what we're
[29:20.680 --> 29:26.840]  dealing with here and we've got some other examples up on jonesreport.com
[29:26.840 --> 29:33.440]  the second story from the top at jonesreport.com now as I said we're
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.520]  gonna get into armed teachers in Texas I think it's a good idea of its handle
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.400]  grind we'll find out what you think later superintendent joining us scheduled
[29:41.400 --> 29:46.120]  to and then we're going to get into the whole geopolitical situation and then
[29:46.120 --> 29:51.720]  back into the esoteric and then Cindy Sheehan stay with me we're on the march

[33:10.560 --> 33:16.040]  if you look at the unified crime statistics of the Department of Justice
[33:16.040 --> 33:24.200]  1991 school shootings have dropped around 25% and most of those are gang
[33:24.200 --> 33:28.840]  bangers shooting each other in some of the worst areas the country Chicago LA
[33:28.840 --> 33:33.440]  New York and normally they're in victim disarmament zones where the general
[33:33.440 --> 33:37.520]  public has been disarmed there's very strict victim disarmament known as gun
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.160]  control but still the media hypes it up toward national studies show the average
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.560]  American believes there's an epidemic of school shootings there have been a lot
[33:47.560 --> 33:51.800]  of cases that should be famous but aren't in Louisiana and Texas and
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.840]  Arkansas and New York just scores of cases of where a teenager comes in and
[33:57.840 --> 34:01.440]  start shooting and may wound one or two people may kill one person some cases
[34:01.440 --> 34:06.280]  get shoots but misses and a teacher has broken the quote law and had a gun in
[34:06.280 --> 34:09.880]  the briefcase or they've run out of their car quickly and gotten a firearm and
[34:09.880 --> 34:14.800]  shot them or driven them off so the police can get there and it'll be in
[34:14.800 --> 34:20.400]  original news but never national news now my father grew up of course in East
[34:20.400 --> 34:23.440]  Texas and a pretty good size rural school district and he would during quail
[34:23.440 --> 34:27.880]  season or dove season he'd take a shotgun to school he would you know get
[34:27.880 --> 34:31.160]  dropped off or ride the bus in and he was friends with all the coaches and he
[34:31.160 --> 34:34.120]  would go hunting with them and you know some of the other football players and
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.280]  they had and just until a few years ago even New York City still had a shooting
[34:38.280 --> 34:44.040]  club for the people never had a problem in every one of the mass shooting cases
[34:44.040 --> 34:52.200]  Harrison Clybold Kinkhole the latest cases that the the crazy man up in
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.920]  Blacksburg Virginia they're all on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and of
[34:56.920 --> 35:02.280]  course it's admitted on the Prozac insert and all other serotonin reuptake
[35:02.280 --> 35:06.880]  inhibitors drug sheets fact sheets admit it causes psychotic breaks and violent
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.200]  outbreaks it's a hallucinogen and so some days you're having a good trip some
[35:10.200 --> 35:13.000]  days you have a bad trip so what we really should control is that in young
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.360]  people but that's not going to happen because the drug companies are pushing
[35:16.360 --> 35:19.000]  and more than ever to the new freedom initiative in the schools for quote
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.960]  mental health screening but that's the real root of so much of this but going
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.040]  to our guest we there have been student groups and colleges and teacher groups
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.600]  who've been calling for being able to be armed or taking a course or letting it
[35:33.600 --> 35:36.960]  be at the discretion of the superintendent schools the principal to have a
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.840]  instant access pistol safe now which only they can access in their desk and I
[35:41.840 --> 35:47.840]  think it's a fabulous idea and it's it's been proposed Texas school district to
[35:47.840 --> 35:53.360]  let teachers carry guns a Texas school district will let teachers bring guns to
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.480]  classes in north Texas the district superintendent said on Friday in what
[35:57.480 --> 36:00.760]  experts that appear to be a first in the United States and I don't like Rick
[36:00.760 --> 36:03.040]  Perry because he's not a real conservative but I do like what he's done
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.800]  here Texas Governor Rick Perry okay but teachers staff carrying guns at school so
[36:07.800 --> 36:16.800]  this is precedent setting and we are joined by the Harold ISD superintendent
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.240]  David Tweet and David we appreciate you coming on sir man I'm glad to be here I
[36:22.240 --> 36:25.840]  kind of preface that with some of the history tell us about your school
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.880]  district your decision to do this or how this occurred and where you see all
[36:30.880 --> 36:34.320]  this going well you know actually whatever we're looking at the history
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.080]  school shooting and you're talking about him but I think when we go back to the
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.960]  95 and the Brady Bill and not allowing guns and schools I think we created a
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.200]  killing zone and that's when all these major school shootings have occurred
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.320]  when we started looking at security we decided obviously we needed to do
[36:51.320 --> 36:54.840]  something passive and that's the first thing we did we installed the one
[36:54.840 --> 36:58.480]  entry school with the electronic entry all the teachers have fobs they can
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.520]  wave in front of a magnetic strip unlock the door etc we also installed in that
[37:02.520 --> 37:06.240]  system a panic system in the administrative offices it can be a
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.720]  button can be pushed all those doors can be locked sirens go off and we also have
[37:10.720 --> 37:14.120]  state-of-the-art cameras so we spent a lot of money making sure that we have
[37:14.120 --> 37:18.480]  every passive system in place to avoid things but then several things
[37:18.480 --> 37:21.640]  started happening the first thing that happened was in October 06 you will
[37:21.640 --> 37:25.960]  remember the shooting in pencilvania with the Amish that was very disturbing
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.640]  and what was disturbing about that was that was a known entity who came into
[37:29.640 --> 37:32.920]  the school I believe he was a melt delivery man wasn't he and he came in
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.800]  and shot and so they let him in the door he said they welcomed him and so we
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.480]  could have a situation where we welcome somebody a delivery man somebody who's
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.720]  normally there somebody who for any number of reasons becomes evil or starts
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.560]  acting that way the next thing that was disturbing was the Virginia Tech now
[37:49.560 --> 37:53.200]  obviously part of our plan in many emergency plans is that the teachers
[37:53.200 --> 37:58.240]  locked those doors bring that killed children and and protect them well in
[37:58.240 --> 38:02.160]  that case he just the chain the door shut and then I think he went and knocked
[38:02.160 --> 38:06.120]  the doors down and went and shot him in the classroom so they basically what we
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.480]  had to say is what happens if somebody gets in our building and that's he it's
[38:10.480 --> 38:14.400]  not too hard to do they're gonna break in they're gonna do something to work
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.240]  their way in around our passive security or you can with the passive have the
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.880]  other form like we just saw at that mega Baptist church out in Colorado where
[38:24.880 --> 38:28.960]  the security guard was armed and so he was stopped dead in his tracks instead
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.520]  of killing 50 people that's right but here we are 30 minutes from law
[38:32.520 --> 38:38.640]  enforcement so you know how much killing can be done in 30 minutes a lot and not
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.040]  just that but many of us have our own children in that school and we could and
[38:43.040 --> 38:47.080]  we live nearby we could but but you know somebody comes in the door I'm gonna
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.280]  run out of the building leave my children there to go get a gun well you
[38:50.280 --> 38:54.520]  know that's that's a hard decision and I don't think I can make that so we had to
[38:54.520 --> 38:58.840]  come up with some solution so we started researching the policies and of course
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.000]  obviously when anybody research gun violence and and the real statistics
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.840]  around it you're gonna find that there's a whole lot of hype just like you said
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.760]  in Hollywood and anybody else and you found we found out that you know the
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.280]  guns aren't dangerous really what's killing kids is transportation and
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.520]  the bathtubs and swimming pools and many other things and football football
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.640]  accidents kill more each year in school shootings right so I mean there's a lot
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.320]  of things that we are willing to take risks for and so we decided to go the
[39:32.320 --> 39:35.840]  concealed route because obviously the state legislature allows that now we've
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.760]  taken several precautions concealed handgun is needed I mean a concealed
[39:39.760 --> 39:43.920]  license is needed for the teacher then they have to be approved by the board
[39:43.920 --> 39:49.480]  by name not position but by name and then they would go we we were working
[39:49.480 --> 39:56.960]  training hostage taking a bit room clearance shooting again a wide gambit
[39:56.960 --> 40:01.240]  extensive training okay and then we're talking about having to be concealed on
[40:01.240 --> 40:05.360]  that person at all times and it must be frangible ammunition it's got to be
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.720]  ammunition that breaks apart when it hits a hard on the steer safety slugs you
[40:08.720 --> 40:12.160]  don't want to go under a wall and killing children on the other side so it's the
[40:12.160 --> 40:17.560]  type that are basically plastic bullets that have a metal casing around it
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.960]  devastating to whoever you shoot but it won't go through a wall right so we
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.800]  taken lots of precautions and people have talked about I know have several
[40:26.800 --> 40:30.400]  reporters asking me what if somebody takes that guy well first of all let's go
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.960]  back historically and you were talking about the east Texas stories there's
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.160]  all kinds of stories before 95 guns were allowed on campuses and many school
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.040]  districts had individual rules but basically there were guns on campuses
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.280]  and and there were no there's no documented anything documented from 95
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.320]  back exactly exactly and literally when my father grew up this was even in big
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.320]  cities not just small towns I mean during deer season during other hunting
[40:58.320 --> 41:01.960]  seasons there were just guys everywhere walking around putting their shotguns
[41:01.960 --> 41:04.640]  and their lockers because they would all get together and go hunting and you
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.840]  never had accidents because safety was taught that we were a better country than
[41:08.840 --> 41:13.360]  I guess and then I take the guns away and it creates a big giant red flashing
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.200]  sign saying victim is on its own come here and you'll have a bunch of passive
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.480]  people because you're a coward and you know you can carry out your evil on a
[41:22.480 --> 41:26.360]  post that's right and this is not just in Texas I've heard a story of somebody
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.080]  up in the 60s and 70s in New York City and they were in a shooting club and they
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.480]  remember carrying their gun on the subway to school coming to school and
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.480]  showing their teacher their new gun and the teacher a woman says oh that state
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.120]  look at the pistol I just bought and pulled one out of her purse I said this
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.600]  is stuff is going on this was what happening hey I'm not that old but I
[41:44.600 --> 41:48.160]  remember you know up there with the with the history teacher and also be the
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.680]  football coach you know showing off who's got the best old Henry pocket
[41:52.680 --> 41:56.760]  knives you get caught one of those now they're probably hanging well what we've
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.560]  done is vilify the tools not the people and we need to do that and and and what
[42:01.560 --> 42:05.120]  makes me mad about the the the liberal path somebody tried to question me the
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.760]  other day about police officers missed two-thirds of the time well that's
[42:08.760 --> 42:12.640]  that's only half the statistic Alex you know what you really need to say they're
[42:12.640 --> 42:19.320]  coming in to a situation on stop 14 million crimes a year bottom line guns
[42:19.320 --> 42:23.960]  guns have saved us just millions of people every year and then all the facts
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.360]  are there that's right that's right and and and obviously here we have it if
[42:28.360 --> 42:32.880]  somebody can tell me if somebody can tell me another solution when you have an
[42:32.880 --> 42:36.440]  active shooter I can lead them away from a fire I can lead them away from a
[42:36.440 --> 42:39.960]  tornado I can lead them away from a toxic spill on the railroad they run
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.760]  near my school I cannot lead them away from an active shooter you don't take a
[42:43.760 --> 42:47.360]  knife to a gunfight what else do you take if somebody can tell me the
[42:47.360 --> 42:52.400]  technology I'll take it well three or four teachers that are armed you know
[42:52.400 --> 42:54.840]  they're gonna come at you with this they're gonna say one of one of the
[42:54.840 --> 42:57.920]  teachers goes nuts well that could happen anyways and they're gonna bring the
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.040]  gun they're gonna get in God forbid we don't really have any cases of that but
[43:02.040 --> 43:04.440]  good they're they're gonna say that they're already saying that well the
[43:04.440 --> 43:08.240]  answer is yes if a trusted person who normally there gets through with it
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.720]  we're gonna have other people that are armed who can checkmate them that's
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.960]  exactly right you know let's do a statistical thing let's say that we
[43:14.960 --> 43:18.440]  don't do anything with drug I mean the gun free zones for the next decade and
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.400]  we have as many shootings as we've had let's say that there are 10 in a 10-year
[43:22.400 --> 43:27.160]  period and let's say that we average on down average 10 deaths each time that's
[43:27.160 --> 43:31.400]  a hundred students that have died let's say that we implement some gun safety
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.760]  and that stops the shootings but we actually have some two accidents let's
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.000]  say we killed two or three people we'll just looking at the hard-cold facts we
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.480]  would have saved 97 I agree but bottom line it's about are we men or mice are
[43:44.480 --> 43:48.680]  we women or mice is this a free country do we have a second amendment are we
[43:48.680 --> 43:52.680]  gonna give into terrorists give into criminals give in schizophrenic violence
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.640]  schizophrenics or are we gonna go back to the culture of Davy Crockett and self
[43:56.640 --> 43:59.920]  reliance that made this nation great we're gonna teach our children that
[43:59.920 --> 44:03.560]  we're cowards and we just dial 911 and wait to die or we're gonna teach them to
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.400]  stand up and take action you're preaching to the choir well it's beautiful
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.720]  and what do you think when you got a positive response mainly from this I
[44:12.720 --> 44:18.200]  mean I've seen the national polls it was almost 50 50 15 years ago that the gun
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.800]  grabbers had kind of brainwashed the public now most polls show around 75% of
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.960]  the people are sick of the gun control the victim disarmament and arming teachers
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.560]  arming college students are having guns and dorms it's now becoming popular and
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.480]  the gun grabbers are really getting frustrated right now I was overwhelmed
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.000]  with the with the with the response that I'm getting I'm getting emails all over
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.200]  the place and and I'm getting a few negatives obviously you know what half
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.920]  the negatives are from Europe and other places like UK and the Netherlands who
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.560]  don't believe in guns but it's overwhelming Alex and I would like to
[44:50.560 --> 44:53.880]  thank your listeners who are listening who have sent those into me because it's
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.960]  been very encouraging because the liberal press is trying to put a bad spin on
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.240]  this and I'm not gonna let them because the arguments are not there the
[45:01.240 --> 45:04.440]  evidence isn't there all they can say all they can do is put through the idea
[45:04.440 --> 45:07.400]  but they cannot bring up evidence all they can say is this is the most
[45:07.400 --> 45:12.520]  dangerous idea in history as a file on this saying down in Houston but you
[45:12.520 --> 45:15.840]  know what she's not an expert on it well you know what I don't want to hear
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.080]  about it because give me some reasons I can take reasons they are scared of the
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.160]  precedent that we are allowed to defend ourselves and that we have a right to
[45:24.160 --> 45:28.120]  defense they are scared of and listen if we would just have been implemented
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.480]  guns in the cockpits instead of taking them out as they did a few years before
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.320]  9-11 if we would have implemented guns in the schools instead of taking them
[45:37.320 --> 45:40.720]  out in 95 as you said when all this started then we wouldn't need to have
[45:40.720 --> 45:44.360]  these schools be little many prisons and our children basically being you know
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.880]  trained to be in these little prisons instead of all the passive stuff we
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.200]  needed to so listen you are really doing something revolutionary here which
[45:52.200 --> 45:56.000]  just gets back to our American roots that's right well you know it's sad
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.320]  that it's it that it has to be this way why in the world did we ever get to this
[46:00.320 --> 46:03.240]  point and you know I want to know what we did before we had police officers I
[46:03.240 --> 46:08.160]  don't think they came along until like the the 1870s that's what we do before
[46:08.160 --> 46:15.280]  that the New York started the first force in 1866 right so and and that's
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.480]  where we got the word copper because they had worked copper badges and then we
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.200]  copied them after London and here's another interesting stat about London
[46:22.200 --> 46:27.000]  Bobby's they didn't carry guns until the 1970s or 80s until they started
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.080]  disarming their people and then the crime rate has exploded to the highest in
[46:32.080 --> 46:35.520]  Europe now now we have more murders in the US per capita but they have more
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.760]  muggings and woundings they have now hundreds of knifes a week in England
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.240]  murders to look at Japan where these killers go in the shopping malls and
[46:45.240 --> 46:49.280]  you know kill 15 people the knife the answer is letting the people defend
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.040]  themselves instead of setting this monopoly of power or only the state has
[46:53.040 --> 46:56.520]  it plus sir there's the danger of only having the government with the guns
[46:56.520 --> 47:01.840]  that always leads to tyranny that always does and that's not I loved I love some
[47:01.840 --> 47:06.400]  blog it said the second amendment needs to be adjusted oh my goodness I want to
[47:06.400 --> 47:09.680]  know how come we have to go to classes for the second amendment but we don't
[47:09.680 --> 47:12.920]  have to do it for freedom of speech or religion you know we don't have to go
[47:12.920 --> 47:16.680]  to classes in order to practice freedom of speech this that the amendments are
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.000]  there you know you can't be talking about wanting to adjust them without
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.240]  changing well the very way that we think in America look at the highest crime
[47:23.240 --> 47:29.360]  rates where they have victim disarmament Chicago DC New York where they have
[47:29.360 --> 47:32.760]  crime rates in some cases a hundred plus percent higher I mean you don't have a
[47:32.760 --> 47:35.400]  lot of home invasions in Texas because they don't go in your house when you're
[47:35.400 --> 47:39.120]  there like they do in New York because they know half the households have got
[47:39.120 --> 47:41.520]  somebody waiting on the other side with the gun and look where they've
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.840]  implemented concealed carry in Florida in Texas and in a dozen plus other
[47:45.840 --> 47:52.680]  states on averaging pull these numbers up a 24% drop in carjackings in home
[47:52.680 --> 47:58.720]  invasions within one year yeah yeah it's immediate it the evidence is all
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.120]  there so sir did you form this plan I mean what was the zenith or the
[48:03.120 --> 48:08.520]  genesis of this idea I just you know it just made sense I mean it's just a
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.480]  matter of thinking things through I I've always been a outside the box thinker
[48:12.480 --> 48:15.040]  and this is not the only thing we've done outside the box I think we're the
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.400]  only school this size I started reading research how that reading music and
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.720]  playing an instrument raises IQ 10 to 15 points permanently and so we started
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.560]  the jazz band program not a marching band we don't need the numbers we wanted
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.800]  the music and this year we started a K through 4 individual piano lessons we've
[48:32.800 --> 48:37.000]  think outside the box what's gonna work let's do something that is actually
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.960]  gonna work and that's what we did now have you been contacted by other school
[48:41.960 --> 48:45.000]  districts around the country or Texas that are interested in and seeing what
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.360]  you've done no I think I think that you know it's really interesting in
[48:49.360 --> 48:55.640]  education that obviously there there is a certain amount of we want to stick
[48:55.640 --> 48:58.600]  together a lot of stuff but I think a lot of folks are kind of watching and
[48:58.600 --> 49:01.720]  seeing to see what happens and I think a lot of people don't understand and they
[49:01.720 --> 49:06.080]  bought into all of the all of the propaganda that guns are gonna kill and
[49:06.080 --> 49:09.080]  I mentioned it one of my friends and I that I we were going to do it and he
[49:09.080 --> 49:11.800]  said well what about the safety and I said what do you mean the safety he goes
[49:11.800 --> 49:15.760]  you mean are you talking about guns in the school yeah okay automatically you
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.720]  think oh my gosh you have a gun there it's gonna go off things are gonna
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.880]  happen oh they think they think they think they think guns like have feet and
[49:23.880 --> 49:30.480]  crawl out of their holsters and like have some evil agency to them well look I
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.880]  wouldn't put my children in any major city public school because they're
[49:33.880 --> 49:38.280]  federalized they're dumbing them down the drugging the unhealthy food the the
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.440]  the commercialism there are some rural schools I'm aware of that if I did live
[49:42.440 --> 49:45.360]  in a rural area I might even have them go to public school because I know some
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.200]  of the principals and people they're involved and that those are the schools
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.720]  that continue to get the high scores almost as good as private and home
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.560]  schooling because they're not under this federal model but I'll say this this
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.520]  goes a long way towards making it a public school that you could put your
[50:00.520 --> 50:04.240]  children in knowing that it's not a victim disarmament zone a shooting
[50:04.240 --> 50:10.160]  gallery all the media hype advertises the schools as a place for a nut to go
[50:10.160 --> 50:13.680]  to do this go ahead all right I mean just it's a side note that I just funny

[53:01.880 --> 53:06.280]  the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this
[53:06.280 --> 53:10.840]  country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[53:10.840 --> 53:15.000]  the lot and this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have to look
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.680]  to Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.800]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States some
[53:23.800 --> 53:27.720]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[53:27.720 --> 53:33.320]  spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[53:33.320 --> 53:38.120]  detained in London's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.760]  Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network warnings and war
[53:41.760 --> 53:46.440]  games the shadow government and much much more fabled enemies get the DVD at
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.840]  info wars dot com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other
[53:50.840 --> 53:56.120]  titles at prison planet dot TV either you are with us or you are with the
[53:56.120 --> 54:06.760]  terrorists final segment with superintendent Harold ISD in North
[54:06.760 --> 54:13.000]  Texas David Tweet David in closing what you're the reason what you're doing is
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.600]  so important is it does set a precedent and it shows great courage in this in
[54:17.600 --> 54:23.760]  this gilded emasculated society the establishment the UN has said in treaties
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.400]  with the United States they want a monopoly of power by the state and
[54:27.400 --> 54:31.040]  tyranny always comes in the form of a uniform in a government disarming its
[54:31.040 --> 54:35.560]  people and this slide towards disarming us in threatens our entire way of life
[54:35.560 --> 54:38.720]  but also threatens the safety of our citizens and so I want to thank you for
[54:38.720 --> 54:42.840]  being a true trailblazer I'm so proud that so much of the trailblazing we're
[54:42.840 --> 54:47.680]  seeing is happening in Texas what was the response of the parents I mean as you
[54:47.680 --> 54:51.120]  first proposed us to the school board was just done in an open meeting setting
[54:51.120 --> 54:56.760]  I went to this debate about doing this start I think it started well we passed
[54:56.760 --> 55:00.560]  it in October 22nd 2007 and I think the debate started about a year and a half
[55:00.560 --> 55:04.240]  before that as we discussed it and looked at it we discussed it several
[55:04.240 --> 55:08.880]  times I think like I said what drove us over the edge was first of all the
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.240]  Amish and then I think Virginia Tech is what was I think there was the final
[55:13.240 --> 55:16.520]  straw and as we started looking at solving the real problems and it was
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.880]  passed unanimously by our board and the parents of our district which aren't very
[55:20.880 --> 55:28.480]  many but they they have they they they supported hundred percent I well I say
[55:28.480 --> 55:33.840]  mostly a hundred percent there's a few that that have qualms but again you know
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.560]  I think it's because again they have been duped by the the media and they
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.080]  haven't listened to the arguments but a lot of our a lot of our students come
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.120]  from outside the district they choose to come here well they liked it
[55:46.120 --> 55:51.080]  I'm sure sure when I traveled to England or I traveled to New York or
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.120]  Chicago you see the criminal thug types all over the streets they're arrogant
[55:55.120 --> 55:59.000]  they look aggressively at you you see them intimidating women you know as we
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.640]  said hundreds of times higher muggings and killings and then you go to another
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.920]  Texas City or Arizona City or Vermont City or Florida City where you've got
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.520]  armed citizenry and the crooks are scared I mean what can't the domesticated
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.440]  people out there who've never been around a gun understand about that I mean
[56:15.440 --> 56:18.680]  why do they feel safe when they see a police officer with a gun but then they
[56:18.680 --> 56:21.560]  don't feel safe when they see it I mean now even in Texas you try to drive with
[56:21.560 --> 56:25.600]  a deer rifle in your gun rack the cops pull you over I mean how do we overnight
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.240]  turn into this thing this idea of guns being in citizens hands are so scary
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.640]  and I see you turning the tide I don't know I really wish I knew I think as
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.200]  you've talked about it we just want to be a bunch of victims we don't want to
[56:39.200 --> 56:44.520]  take the the the power back into our own lives but you know what an in rural
[56:44.520 --> 56:48.520]  America we we have to do that we have to take care of business we can't wait
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.880]  around for somebody else to solve the problem for us we are our only solution
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.320]  and we help each other out but you know you have to protect yourself and we
[56:57.320 --> 57:00.480]  have seen some nuts in rural areas this where a lot of your shootings have
[57:00.480 --> 57:04.320]  happened and it's very important what you're doing and I think you can get
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.240]  rid of the prison door and no look at the cameras I know you're doing that
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.680]  because that's what the feds called for what was pushed the money that was
[57:10.680 --> 57:14.520]  offered but I really think if you arm four or five teachers your problem
[57:14.520 --> 57:20.320]  solved we can go back to Mayberry RFD we really commend you David Tweet
[57:20.320 --> 57:25.200]  Harold ISD superintendent and Godspeed thank you Alex appreciate it you bet
[57:25.200 --> 57:34.280]  God bless okay folks there he goes and I appreciate my producer getting him on
[57:34.280 --> 57:41.960]  the broadcast is gonna be on Glenn Beck today later so we got him first okay I
[57:41.960 --> 57:49.400]  got a big stack of important news here that I want to go over there has also
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.080]  been more dangerous disinformation in the Patriot movement aimed at myself and
[57:54.080 --> 57:58.480]  Ted Anderson and so at the bottom of this hour I am just gonna in a nebulous
[57:58.480 --> 58:05.600]  fashion briefly address it because it is this type of rotgut poison that stalls
[58:05.600 --> 58:10.240]  and brings down movements at least on a local front so I'll have about a two
[58:10.240 --> 58:17.960]  minute comment on the I don't know delusional treasury craziness a lot of
[58:17.960 --> 58:20.960]  people are so obsessed with me it's getting worse and worse I mean I'm
[58:20.960 --> 58:25.880]  really getting to where I don't want to go to events I don't want to even do
[58:25.880 --> 58:30.400]  this anymore sometimes because I hate being the center of attention and I
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.320]  can't stand all these other people in the movement who literally eat drink and
[58:34.320 --> 58:37.840]  sleep Alex Jones and so they want to hate me so they invent stuff to hate me
[58:37.840 --> 58:40.000]  about

[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:24.560]  Alex Jones. Sydney Sheehan running for the House of Representatives against
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:32.520]  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi joins us in T-minus two hours. I have a whole
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:37.960]  bunch of thermite explosives experts and intelligence operatives running it a
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:42.880]  couple months ago their final report was leaked and they admitted it was their
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:47.120]  report and we're very mad about it being leaked by leaked their website was
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:53.400]  basically hacked and it was brought forward so we already have the report
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:57.120]  and then they scurried around and we're trying to revise it that is coming out
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:03.400]  Thursday now they said they were going to release this in 2005 2006 2007 early
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:07.400]  2008 and then now they're saying they're doing and they've announced before
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:09.680]  they're going to release it in a few days and then they have to get their lies
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:14.800]  straight and don't but it'll probably be very similar to the last draft report
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:18.120]  they're calling this one a draft it's always a draft so they can change lies
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.640]  in the report they say that they don't know why the towers fell and it wasn't
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.480]  the fuel oil tank it wasn't bad construction it wasn't fire we'll see
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:33.040]  what they do here also that 25% of the building was not scooped out that's all
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:36.120]  admitted back then fabled in as we have the front of the building they say was
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:38.800]  scooped out nothing scooped out a few windows are knocked out on the bottom
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:43.640]  floor boy that's scooped out we have video inside of there it's just
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:47.360]  incredible deception I'm lining up Kevin Ryan Stephen Jones and others talk
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:51.600]  about this Thursday and Friday we're gonna have Burma's pop in all next
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:58.480]  week Burma's is gonna be in studio I am going to be driving out to Denver this
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:01.880]  weekend and I'll be there on the ground because that's gonna be probably where
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:05.960]  the fireworks are for the police state the secret camp and the rest of it and
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:08.960]  I pray I don't get arrested I really get tired of getting manhandled and taking
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:13.640]  to jail and slammed around but we'll see what happens this country so far gone
[1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:17.360]  you try to videotape cops from 100 yards away they just come over and talk to
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:23.280]  you like you're a pile of horsemen are and then just with pleasure arrest you
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:27.600]  so I just feel sorry for them when they're doing it this country so far gone
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:36.480]  I just want to resuscitate it I was having nightmares all last night I was
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.120]  on coast to coast AM and then I went to sleep and I was just having these
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:46.800]  nightmares all it was like case after case you know you ever have dreams where
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:50.680]  they just go on all night so I just glimpses of dreams it's like long drawn
[1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:56.960]  out dreams and it wasn't my children except in one of the dreams being grabbed
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:04.360]  by CPS it was other people's children and the dreams were so detailed it'd be
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:11.240]  like I have a bird's-eyed view of a guy pulled over who has an expired driver's
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:16.960]  license for whatever reason and the police find out he's got an expired
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:21.520]  driver's license and then they take the two you know three and five years old
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.880]  it looked like children out of the back of the car they're crying they put them
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:31.960]  in a CPS van and the father is taken to jail in the cars and pounded and then it
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:40.880]  would be inside the CPS facility with these sacks of pus and I'd be looking
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:44.360]  at their faces in the dream and watching them interrogate the kids and not give
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:48.360]  them food till they lie about their parents and the CPS with dolls saying
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:54.240]  do they touch you here and then of course children have all been cleaned or
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:57.400]  had their diapers changed they say yes and then the children being taken and
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.920]  then it would cut back on the dream of the parents crying and freaking out and
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:04.800]  and went on it was like it was like years of this last night I was just
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:08.280]  seeing all this evil of course it was a manufacturer in my mind but it was all
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:14.440]  based on real cases of what they really do then I woke up at like 638 saying I

[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:52.600]  significant impact on how Pakistan's nuclear weapons are controlled experts
[1:07:52.600 --> 1:07:56.360]  say a 10-member committee and not just the president make decisions on how to
[1:07:56.360 --> 1:08:02.080]  use them and how to complete meltdown and governance and only a complete
[1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:06.160]  meltdown and governance still a distant prospect in Pakistan could put the
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:10.920]  atomic bomb in the hands of extremist Pakistan's nuclear assets are not one
[1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:14.960]  man's property said Maria Sultan a defense analyst and director of the London
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:20.720]  Bay South Asia Strategic Stability Institute any politician and transition
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:25.000]  in Pakistan will have no effect on Pakistan's nuclear assets because it
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:30.320]  has a very strong custodial control the committee known as the National Command
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:35.360]  Authority is served by a military dominated organization with thousands of
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:40.480]  security forces and intelligence agents who personnel are closely screened the
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:44.840]  nuclear facilities are tightly guarded now let me just give you the facts you
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:51.280]  can go pull all this up if you'd like the United States in England as well as
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.920]  some help from Israel but mainly England the US in the mid 90s began giving a Q
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:02.520]  con laboratories based in Pakistan as their front and the components the
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:08.600]  centrifuges the materials to successfully build atomic bombs then the
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:14.400]  West England the US Israel again helped give them the medium range of missiles
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:23.760]  that have 3,000 kilometer ranges that's more than 2,000 mile ranges you can draw
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:30.880]  a 2,200 300 mile circle and go look at different geopolitical and
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:34.640]  governmental sites that break this down you can see are just typing to Google
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:39.920]  the nuclear reach of Pakistan's missiles or the reach of Pakistan's nuclear
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:45.720]  tip missiles you can pull up all those maps but they can hit a lot of countries
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:51.680]  they can hit Russia they can hit India they can hit China they can hit Iran but
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.360]  they can reach out further than that they can hit Israel but that's supposedly
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:02.320]  okay that's supposedly alright if they can hit Turkey it's okay if they can hit
[1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:07.720]  Georgia it's okay if they can hit Afghanistan and scores of other
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:16.320]  nations that's alright it's a nuclear Iran that we have to worry about the
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:20.640]  media tells us when Iran has been totally inspected by the UN given in the
[1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:24.680]  global government has no nuclear program but the AP and everybody else from these
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:30.960]  receptive headlines every day saying Israel may attack Iran's nukes and then
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:35.640]  the bottom of the article it says peaceful reactors that can't be used to
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:43.440]  purify uranium to a level to be used in the crudest of weapons just a fact but
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.240]  why give the public the facts when you can tell them that Russia attacked Georgia
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:51.080]  or you can tell the public that there's never been mercury in vaccines and
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.920]  later admit there's mercury in vaccines and say it's good for you I mean they
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:59.680]  just lie lie lie or say that vaccines are the law to take when it's not the law
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:04.840]  and I use those as an example just of the or there are WMD's in Iraq and create
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:11.320]  fake Niger uranium documents they just lie lie live you had a neighbor you had a
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:18.080]  spouse if you had a cousin if you had a business partner who lied and lied and
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.280]  lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:26.000]  and cheated and backstabbed wouldn't you stop dealing with them well actually
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.840]  know it's not just that we become acclimated to accepting lies by our
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:35.400]  own government and lies by our local governments we've now accepted lies from
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:39.520]  our bosses and lies from our employees and lies from our spouses and lies from
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:45.120]  our neighbors and lies from the media it's just become a yeah they all lie but
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:48.040]  then no one really knows what the truth is and just doesn't do any studying and
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:51.200]  just kind of says oh you can't believe anything and that's the more astute
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:59.200]  people more often than not you run into populations who say well I choose the
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:04.880]  reality I want to believe I choose to believe Barack Obama I choose to believe
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.080]  John McCain I choose to believe that they run things or that's one lie or I
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:12.000]  choose to believe they're not puppets I choose to believe they're good guys I
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:17.920]  choose to believe that George Bush is a good Christian conservative I choose to
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:21.000]  believe Bush when he tells me that they're not having warrantless spying on
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.920]  American people and he promised in press conferences then it came out a month
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.840]  later he was lying and then said okay we are spying on you retroactively pass a
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:34.760]  loss or not felons we accept the lies when Denver says there's no secret camp
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:38.280]  a week and a half ago that's a conspiracy theory that was in the news oh
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:43.160]  there's rumors of secret roundup plans and secret attention centers people said
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:46.760]  well wait a minute there's federal grants for this oh they found the location to
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:51.320]  the grant they went out there local independent media we are changing others
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:55.920]  and there they are can hold 5,000 people barbed wire fences inside
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:02.120]  Constantino wire and it says electro shock devices used in this area letting
[1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.760]  you know we're gonna shock you there's signs up we're gonna put you in a camp
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:09.640]  you couldn't keep dogs or horses in and we're gonna shock you we're gonna drive
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:13.120]  buses in and run them to make you sick and the cops stand around laughing
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:17.560]  outside everybody vomits we're gonna hit you with carbon monoxide we're gonna
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:21.560]  people go to the hospital we're gonna put you in a 70 year old bus terminal
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.360]  with three inches of chemicals on it and I went to the New York jail and they
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:30.760]  were releasing them after two days in the camp pure 57 and I watched the huge
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:37.880]  boils and red chemical burns and it's all real funny and I'd walk up a hundred
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:43.320]  something yards all in martial law 911 rise the police state cop comes over
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:47.160]  I'm across two streets behind barricades videotaping runs over goes what are you
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:51.320]  doing get the hell out of here what are you doing here well we're here for this
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:14:02.480]  I told you shut up I told you shut up that's America they did the same thing
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:08.880]  though we are change they told CBS get out of here this is secret you the
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:14.760]  slaves you see the police call us civilians that's a military terminology
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.600]  mayors call us governors call us civilians they've been introduced to a
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.600]  military terminology military culture now the FEMA emergency centers are in
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:28.360]  every city merging the police departments under federal control with the
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:33.480]  firemen and emergency management the Washington Post comes out Friday and
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.720]  says yeah they're about to pass a law openly turning the local departments
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:41.200]  into intelligence agencies to spy on the citizens it's already going on
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:45.040]  criminally they're already breaking the law having the military and the state
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:49.400]  police spy on anybody and everybody unless they're real terrorist I mean if
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:54.440]  you're real hijackers you know working at military bases and riding around with
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:58.600]  Nick Berg later got his head shot off and all the rest of this oh that's all
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:02.760]  ignored if you call the FBI 50 times saying these people are hijackers they
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:06.720]  plan to attack the FBI was told stand down because no they were those were
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:10.480]  just agents out to parrot and quote test securities what they've been told just
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.200]  like the Navy SEALs and the FBI and others practice attacking their own
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:17.560]  embassies practice trying to sneak bombs through airports see that's the cover
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:20.920]  story and if I was you police and military I wouldn't take part in those
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:24.240]  drills because sometimes they're gonna have you really go on the plane and then
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.320]  it's gonna blow up and they're gonna say Tom Jones or Bill Simon or whatever
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:32.360]  the hypothetical name is yeah he was a white American al-Qaeda he went on the
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:36.720]  plane and blew it up and you're taking part in the drill that's one of their
[1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:46.960]  favorite ways to set you up we're dealing with some smart devils here but
[1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:53.200]  already digress Pakistan is completely run by US and British intelligence the
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:57.200]  military runs it Musharraf was just a front man the people don't want him
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:02.760]  anymore so they're gonna put a new front man in front of everybody's eyes
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:14.200]  period period the committee known as the National Command Authority is
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:17.920]  served by a military-dominated organization with thousands of security
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:21.720]  forces and intelligence agents his personnel are closely screened Britain's
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:24.560]  been running that country for 150 years the nuclear facilities are tightly
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:28.000]  guarded the reality is the Pakistan's government exists on different levels
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:33.040]  one is the level existed and works in the control of its nuclear weapons see
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:36.640]  that's the shadow government that's the continuity of government same thing here
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.560]  and it was cotton new government that ran the 9-11 attacks with their clients
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.320]  out of England and Israel and some major defense contractors and that's what

[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:26.320]  lives are over or 10 French pear travers because they've got to guard the
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:31.280]  opium and pull up the international numbers on this eightfold increase as
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:34.960]  of last year's numbers the new ones aren't out and it grows every year record
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.360]  biggest ever in the hundreds of years they've been shipping opium out of
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:46.840]  Afghanistan now that has then turned into heroin purified concentrated it is
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:56.280]  just pouring out smack heroin is just pouring out all over the streets of the
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:00.720]  western Europe eastern Europe Asia the United States and I've talked to the
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:03.840]  troops that come home but it's come out in news and it shows the images they'll
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:12.120]  spin and say US Marines US Army French troops guard poppy fields from the
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:17.400]  Taliban and you read it just kind of hidden right out in blame view like
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:22.160]  Richard Grassobe head of the New York Stock Exchange in 99 in Reuters and
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:25.160]  other newspapers he went down had a meeting with the Farquhar Ellis they
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:27.680]  finally killed the guy they promised they would have he didn't invest the drug
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:31.440]  money out of Columbia the communist drug money in the New York Stock Exchange you
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:34.000]  know it's legal for drug money to be invested as long as it's offshore and
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.240]  brought in that's right if they have all special rules for themselves and Richard
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.960]  Grasso hugged ahead of the far can set investor tens of billions a month with
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:45.280]  us or you'll be invaded and he didn't go along with it so us troops then
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:50.760]  invaded and thousands of us troops have died there it's all just kept quiet but
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:54.800]  talk to any of the troops that come back oh it's hardcore combat every day out
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:00.040]  there and then if a missionary tries to fly in you know they shoot down any
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:03.880]  small aircraft they don't have transponders but the US aircraft take
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:10.280]  off every every few minutes with cocaine on board just all just taking off but
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:13.600]  any other little planes land or take off oh gunships come in they got
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:18.600]  mercenaries shooting everybody down it's just fighting over that cocaine
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.240]  fighting over that heroin and then police are in the schools telling your
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:26.560]  children title on your parents what's in the medicine cabinet you ever see them
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:31.080]  roll a cigarette tell us about it you'll get $200 yeah mommy and daddy will
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:35.800]  be going to jail yeah we gotta we gotta have secret police and spy and have
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:41.960]  checkpoints to stop the drugs while the government openly guards the opium and
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:50.080]  ships it in and openly runs the cocaine now does that mean there aren't smaller
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:54.840]  cartels and drug rings and cowboys they got a kill and hunt down arrest does that
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:58.680]  mean they don't like snacks and don't bust little local cocaine dealers who are
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:07.600]  cutting in on the cops drug dealing absolutely they there it's a war so see
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:11.040]  they need to have rugs illegal so they can monopolize it and I'm making a
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.800]  monopoly in jack so prices it's called a business and he is daddy raise him to be
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:25.520]  a business man cold ruthless powerful focused and you've got a nation a world

[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:36.120]  it no doesn't exist because you're scared to face it you're concerned with
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:40.120]  your instant gratification and with protecting yourself for the moment and
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:46.400]  so you lose the war for liberty because you never take the field because you're
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:50.040]  so scared of the evil at the back of your mind oh that's just crazy conspiracy

[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:40.680]  a few well-known cases and the FBI shows up and says that's ours thank you and
[1:28:40.680 --> 1:28:43.520]  they're not gonna stop and they know that you're waking up to them so they

[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:36.560]  as an excuse to declare martial law did you see the Twin Towers in New York go

[1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:55.160]  it's a place for regages and the days of ancient Greece walked down through the Middle Ages
[1:32:55.160 --> 1:33:01.160]  planet Earth kept going through changes and in the Renaissance came and times continued to change
[1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:06.160]  nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades like you said before
[1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:10.160]  Tom Payne and the Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, they were renegades
[1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:15.160]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen I want to get into more of what's happening with the Georgia-Russia situation
[1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:21.160]  and you take some of your phone calls, Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag terrorist attacks
[1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:28.160]  big news, up on prisonplanet.com
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:38.160]  okay, I said I would address some stuff only for audiences that even know what I'm talking about
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:44.160]  because I'm not going to give attention on this international program that members of the Japanese parliament listen to
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:49.160]  and German defense ministers, former defense ministers, Hollywood folks, people in banking
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:53.160]  because we know what's going on, we got our head screwed on straight, we bring the best guests
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:57.160]  this is a very important radio show
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:34:04.160]  and that is a huge responsibility that I have and that's why I work so hard
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:10.160]  I am constantly being attacked by the national media, alternative media
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:14.160]  every lie you can imagine has been invented against me
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:19.160]  down to hundreds of videos editing my audio online
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:22.160]  with me saying I hate America and things like that
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:27.160]  I mean it is so legion, the things that are done to me
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:32.160]  and it doesn't really bother me because it lets me know we're growing, we're affecting change
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.160]  we're reaching out to more people
[1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:40.160]  I know human nature, at least I think I do, I'm always amazed at just how bad it really is
[1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:44.160]  it always works and I thought there's also always better than I thought
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:48.160]  there's also so many great people and wonderful people and so many dedicated people
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:53.160]  with so much creativity and passion and love and honor
[1:34:53.160 --> 1:35:00.160]  but I don't gossip on the telephone
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.160]  I don't have time to do it
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:09.160]  I mean I have frankly, I'm not even very good at the business of expanding what I'm doing here
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:14.160]  when I have people worth hundreds of millions of dollars that call me up
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:19.160]  and want to do projects with me and I'm so busy kind of down in the dirt doing my daily radio show
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.160]  making films, I'm so focused on the task at hand
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:27.160]  I'm so task oriented that I'm not even good at asking people for money
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:31.160]  they're like I want to give you a bunch of money and I'm like I don't know about any strings or anything
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:34.160]  I don't know if I could use that right away or what I'd do with that
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:37.160]  let me get to the next level and then maybe
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:41.160]  and I know that's things that other people would kill for those type of contacts
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:45.160]  but see people of substance, people of quality
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:51.160]  get an instinct for who the little backstabbing cowardly scum are
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:58.160]  and so they don't ever really associate with a lot of the other people in the quote patriot movement
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.160]  who were in this for the wrong reason, they're in it for personal power, they're in it for grandstanding
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.160]  for vanity fair, you know, imagining how big and great they are
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:12.160]  and basically pretty much everybody that I think of
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:16.160]  that you don't hear on this show, that'll give you a little tip, you don't hear somebody on the show
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:20.160]  that you can get an idea of what I know about them
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:26.160]  they are just totally obsessed with Alex Jones, 24-7
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:32.160]  and I'm always learning of the new evils I've supposedly committed and the new things I've supposedly done
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:35.160]  and after you hear that and then document it
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:41.160]  from eyewitness after eyewitness you just say well why do I let these people suck off of me and use my name
[1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:46.160]  and use me to go out and represent themselves as my bosses
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:50.160]  you know why am I involved in that, so I say just get out of my life, just get away from me
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:53.160]  get out of my way, go do what you're going to do
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:58.160]  stay away from me, leave me alone
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:02.160]  and one of the worst areas in my life because I can't ignore it completely
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:08.160]  I can't avoid it completely is locals here in Austin, Texas
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:13.160]  and I mean local people kind of in the little petty hierarchy and all those that have flooded into Austin
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:17.160]  and moved into Austin who I gave red carpet to all of them
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:21.160]  and then every time I turned my back a large knife would be placed squarely between my ribs
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:24.160]  and so I just say hey you're ostracized I don't want to hear from you
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:28.160]  I don't want to see you, I don't want to be around you
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:34.160]  I just go and don't go away mad just go away and they will not do that folks
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:37.160]  and they want to be in my business, in my life
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:40.160]  doing things that you just couldn't believe to me if I told you
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:45.160]  just unbelievable stuff and I ignore it
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:49.160]  and then they invent new things to get people to feel sorry for them
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:53.160]  people to quote come to them and demonize me
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:56.160]  but I always learn about after the fact
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.160]  and they demonize other good people who've been nothing but good to them
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:03.160]  and then even when those individuals come to them and publicly say well that's not true
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:06.160]  that's not even been discussed it's like well we'll see
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:11.160]  we'll see if that's the truth you know it's just it's horrible
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:15.160]  I've had people call me up and say you better do what we say
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:20.160]  you better play ball with us or we're going to bring out bad things we know about you
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:24.160]  and I just said go ahead there's nothing bad about me
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:27.160]  what does you see me falling down drunk before
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:31.160]  that was the little blackmail thing and one other
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:34.160]  you know I've made no bones about that
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:38.160]  that I don't probably drink eight nine months out of the year and sometimes I end up going to a party
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:42.160]  so I don't go to parties and I end up having four drinks, five drinks, six drinks
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:45.160]  seven drinks, ten drinks
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:49.160]  I mean that's the kind of unbelievably wicked stuff
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:54.160]  that I have seen and I just sit here and I take it and I take it and some other guy
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:59.160]  goes out and says I'm a drug dealer on the air
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:02.160]  and says they have witnesses to make it sound real and then of course never present them
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:06.160]  and I have to sue them behind the scenes to make them stop doing it
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.160]  and then they swear they're not going to say anything else about me ever
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:10.160]  and they do it again and I just turn the other cheek
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:12.160]  I mean this isn't a game folks
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:14.160]  you're not going to stop what I'm doing
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.160]  and you're not going to stop the people I'm reaching out to
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:21.160]  and you're not going to stop the work I'm doing okay
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:24.160]  it's just not going to happen the government's not going to stop me
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:26.160]  the death threats aren't going to stop me
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:28.160]  the audits aren't going to stop me
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:30.160]  none of it is going to stop until somebody kills me
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:32.160]  and there are people talking about that now
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.160]  well I'm going to beat the hell out of them
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:36.160]  well I'm going to come kill you
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.160]  and these are people signing their names to it
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:41.160]  because of made up lies and crap
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  let me explain something to the local peanut gallery
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:51.160]  and the local people who want to be the grand poobos of this movement
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:56.160]  I don't think about you until you crap on my porch basically
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:00.160]  until I have to scoop up every week the latest bull
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:03.160]  you have deposited and just throw it in the trash can
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:05.160]  hold my nose throw it in the trash can
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  feel sorry for you and move on
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:13.160]  now I'm going to tell the locals this and I mean it
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:16.160]  any more slander about me any more crap I'm going to sue you
[1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:18.160]  and you're going to lose because in a court of law
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:23.160]  it's going to be shown you're completely full of crap
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:25.160]  I'm not involved in your petty infighting
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:27.160]  I'm not involved in your tiny pipe dreams
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:29.160]  I'm not involved in your little world
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.160]  do you read me
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:34.160]  I've got rock stars calling me up
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:36.160]  that I haven't even called back
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:38.160]  because I'm doing my little thing
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:40.160]  I do my task
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:42.160]  I don't care about it
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:44.160]  I get invited to all sorts of things
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:46.160]  I don't go
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:48.160]  I get invited to address a parliament
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:49.160]  I don't go
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:51.160]  I'm not into myself
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:53.160]  I don't frankly like doing this
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:54.160]  I do it too much
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:55.160]  I'm sick of it
[1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:58.160]  and I sure don't care
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:01.160]  about local people
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:04.160]  folks you've seen this a million times
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:06.160]  if somebody's got the hot restaurant in town
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:09.160]  and the other restaurants down the street are pissed off
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.160]  because they don't have a good chef
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:13.160]  they start claiming the other restaurant has cockroaches
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:15.160]  the size of beagles in it
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:17.160]  and that's said about me
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:19.160]  and I just
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:20.160]  I'm tired of it
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:22.160]  I told John Villarreal at Axis TV
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.160]  that I wasn't going to let him hand it over to Time Warner
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:25.160]  and shut it down
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:26.160]  and I had to sue them
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.160]  and I had to have PIs
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:30.160]  and I sent him to prison for stealing
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:32.160]  and I had to show him
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:35.160]  and I had to sue three other stalkers over the years
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:37.160]  because they messed with my sister
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:38.160]  the other one came to my house
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:39.160]  I told you
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.160]  I'm not playing games with them
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:42.160]  they had to be drawn into court
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:43.160]  believe me
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:44.160]  I don't want to spend the time
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.160]  or spend the 20 grand doing it
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:48.160]  I don't care what your delusions are
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.160]  and what your lies are
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:53.160]  and what your attention getting crap is
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:56.160]  any more slander or lies about me
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:58.160]  I am going to litigate you into the ground
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:00.160]  any of you
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:01.160]  you
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:03.160]  I understand you eat, drink and sleep Alex Jones
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:04.160]  that's all you think about
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:06.160]  because your head is not in the right spot
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:08.160]  and I understand it's hard for you
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:10.160]  to understand I'm not part of your life
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:11.160]  or part of what you're doing
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:13.160]  and I don't care about what you're doing
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:15.160]  but because I'm in Austin
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:17.160]  I have to constantly deal
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:20.160]  with the treachery that is a million feet long
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:21.160]  now
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:23.160]  you've been warned
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:25.160]  you've been warned
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:27.160]  leave me alone
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:28.160]  let me do what I'm doing
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:29.160]  and stay out of my way
[1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:30.160]  now I apologize to stations
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:32.160]  and affiliates and people
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:34.160]  but I know anybody that owns a radio station
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:35.160]  knows the crap they deal with
[1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:36.160]  and the weirdos
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:37.160]  and the weird people
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:39.160]  and I know anybody who's in business and life
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:40.160]  knows about these things
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:43.160]  I will be left alone
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:45.160]  and I will not be drawn into your
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:46.160]  I mean imagine
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:48.160]  people need to invent fights with me
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:49.160]  they need to invent their importance
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:50.160]  they need to cry wolf
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.160]  and cry out for help
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.160]  so I can find out how I'm attacking people
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.160]  and I don't even know about what they're engaged in
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:58.160]  or what they're doing
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:42:59.160]  other than saying
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:01.160]  stop representing yourself as me
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:04.160]  stop representing yourself as my radio show
[1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:05.160]  I can't even do that
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:07.160]  I do that and then all these lies
[1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:09.160]  are represented about me
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:11.160]  because people have to invent crap
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:14.160]  to sell the gullible public
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:16.160]  the same public last week
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:18.160]  that I just mentioned on there
[1:43:18.160 --> 1:43:21.160]  I said that looks like a costume
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.160]  a suit
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:25.160]  and it came out that the big foot thing
[1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:26.160]  is a costume
[1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:28.160]  you can look at it and tell it's a costume
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:29.160]  I mean I'm not that smart
[1:43:29.160 --> 1:43:31.160]  why can I tell how everything works
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:32.160]  why do I understand things
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:33.160]  why do I know human nature
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:36.160]  why can I predict what people are going to do
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:38.160]  I keep thinking everybody else is like me
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:39.160]  I keep thinking everybody else
[1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:40.160]  really loves green fields
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:41.160]  and blue skies
[1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:42.160]  and happiness
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:43.160]  and camaraderie
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:44.160]  and friendship
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:45.160]  and niceness
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:46.160]  but building people up
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:47.160]  giving people a hand
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:49.160]  helping other people as I've done
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:51.160]  nine times out of ten
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:52.160]  they come after you man
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:54.160]  they try to stab you in the back
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:55.160]  like I'm the emperor
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:58.160]  and they're throwing me down off the throne
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.160]  I am not the emperor of all this stuff
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:02.160]  yes am I the biggest thing in the truth movement
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:03.160]  am I the biggest 9-11 guy
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:05.160]  am I the person with the biggest websites
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:06.160]  the biggest radio show
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:07.160]  yes yes yes
[1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:11.160]  you understand what a burden that is
[1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:13.160]  and I tried to work with everybody
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:14.160]  I tried to be nice
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:16.160]  give people red carpet
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:17.160]  and all I got was hatred
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.160]  and duplicity and backstabbing out of it
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:24.160]  and then new lies for old
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:25.160]  now I don't want
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:27.160]  I don't want to get into gossip and attacks
[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:29.160]  and all the rest of the crap
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:31.160]  I will not be discussed on my show
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:33.160]  and people are going to ask me
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:34.160]  what the hell is Alex Jones talking about
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  and that's just what my enemies want
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:38.160]  is that attention
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:40.160]  and I'm just going to tell them again
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:42.160]  I am going to defeat you if you mess with me
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:44.160]  if you attack me anymore
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:45.160]  and then lie and say I'm attacking you
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:46.160]  classic
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:47.160]  they attack Russia
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:49.160]  say Russia attack them
[1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:51.160]  they attack Serbia
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:53.160]  they say Serbia attack Albania
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:54.160]  Kosovo
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:56.160]  I mean this is what our culture
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:44:57.160]  as above so below
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:44:59.160]  that's what the culture does
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:01.160]  it's a culture of lying and crap
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:03.160]  I'm sorry I got a great mother
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:05.160]  just a wonderful purehearted classy
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:07.160]  I thought growing up with people
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:08.160]  that told you what they thought
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:10.160]  and who were good and loving and honorable
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:12.160]  and who read poetry to me
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:13.160]  poetry to me when I was little
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:15.160]  and who took me to the symphony
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:16.160]  and who took me fishing and hunting
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:18.160]  and loved me
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:20.160]  and I didn't know how good my father was
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:22.160]  a good honorable man
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:24.160]  who I watched people cheat and steal from
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:26.160]  and take his goodness and turn it against him
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:28.160]  and I didn't have any idea
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:30.160]  that my family
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:32.160]  all of them are honorable
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:34.160]  good hardworking salt of the earth
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:36.160]  and I never realized what a treasure I had
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:38.160]  I never realized that most people
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:40.160]  were scum and trash
[1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:42.160]  I never realized how sick and degenerate
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:44.160]  our society was
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:46.160]  and how stupid the public was
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:48.160]  people in our own movement to buy crap
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:50.160]  and bull
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:52.160]  I never realized just how bad this society
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:54.160]  is
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:56.160]  but we're people who will go out
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.160]  and kill our own children
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:00.160]  and then think nothing of it
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:02.160]  go out get an abortion
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:04.160]  go out to the bar that night
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:06.160]  hell get pregnant again
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:08.160]  have another abortion
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:10.160]  men pressuring their girlfriends to have it
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:12.160]  because they're lazy because they don't want to get married
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:13.160]  they don't want to have to work an extra job
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:15.160]  they want to have children
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:17.160]  they want to go around screwing other women
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:19.160]  instead of being a man
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.160]  it's a society of lack of responsibility
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:23.160]  and a delusional society
[1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:25.160]  that lies to themselves
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:27.160]  and invents whatever they need
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:29.160]  to rationalize
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:31.160]  the evil and the bull
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:33.160]  that they're involved in
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:35.160]  I'm going to tell you one more time
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:37.160]  I got work to do
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:39.160]  I've got issues and things to take care of
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:41.160]  but this flare up
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:43.160]  and the maggots
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:45.160]  that infest Austin
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:47.160]  that have come
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:49.160]  that have come streaming into here
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:51.160]  I don't care
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:53.160]  you can run around and do what you want
[1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:55.160]  just forget I exist
[1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:57.160]  and do not lie about me anymore
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:46:59.160]  you and your delusional
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:01.160]  can't followers
[1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:09.160]  it's like a child keeps running
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:11.160]  out on the street and you go
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:13.160]  you're going to get in trouble if you do that one more time
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:15.160]  don't do that again
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:19.160]  it's the same thing with some bullies
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:21.160]  got you cornered shoving you push you
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:23.160]  come on punk
[1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:25.160]  and you just go man I don't want to do this
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:27.160]  I don't want to do this
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:29.160]  I don't want to do this
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:31.160]  that's another situation analogous to this
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:35.160]  I mean you want to jump the shark
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:37.160]  just realize
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:39.160]  you're not successful because of who you are
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:41.160]  you're not successful because
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:43.160]  your spirit is wrong
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.160]  you're not successful because you're in this for the wrong reasons
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:47.160]  and in me
[1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:49.160]  you can't put all your problems
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:51.160]  on somebody who doesn't care about you
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:53.160]  doesn't think about you
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:55.160]  and doesn't give a damn what you're doing
[1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:57.160]  just do what you want
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:47:59.160]  do it over there
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:01.160]  I'm out of your life
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.160]  okay
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:05.160]  some of the other news
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:07.160]  that I have here
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:09.160]  in front of me
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:15.160]  Russian general says Georgia
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:17.160]  this is what this show is really all about folks
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:19.160]  Russian general says Georgia may
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:21.160]  commit false flag terror attacks
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:23.160]  deputy chief of the Russian
[1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:25.160]  general staff
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:27.160]  Antonoli
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:29.160]  and I'm going to pronounce this wrong
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:31.160]  Mavisin
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:33.160]  warns that Georgia may be planning to
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:35.160]  commit false flag terror attacks by using
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:37.160]  mercenaries dressed in Russian
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:39.160]  uniforms as Russia moved to guard sensitive
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:41.160]  infrastructure against terrorist attacks
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:43.160]  this is so serious folks
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:45.160]  this is what we need to be focused on
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:47.160]  the depression that's coming
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:49.160]  world war three that could be forming
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:51.160]  and the police state they've said this is
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:53.160]  life and death
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:55.160]  in a news briefing Monday
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:57.160]  he said I cannot rule out
[1:48:57.160 --> 1:49:02.520]  clad in the uniform of a Russian serviceman in order to commit subversive acts both on
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:08.280]  Ossetian and Russian territory. In response to the threat, Russia has station troops around
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:18.480]  the hydroelectric plant viewed as a potential target in Hungary. The general second command
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:23.480]  warned that Georgia may resort to subversion. Oh, false flags, screaming that someone's
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:29.080]  attacking you when you're really attacking them. Hmm, we see that below as well as above,
[1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:35.240]  don't we? He warned that Georgia may resort to subversion in order to enhance its well-groomed
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:39.880]  image of being the victim. We see that a lot in life, don't we? Remember in high school
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.040]  or junior high some girl would ask you out and you wouldn't go out with her and next
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:48.520]  she would start telling people that you'd grabbed her butt in the parking lot? Same crap
[1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:53.000]  these losers do over and over again. Warning that Georgia might resort to subversion in
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.840]  order to enhance its well-groomed image of being the victim of a war that it started
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:04.360]  with a horrific bombardment of civilian targets in South Ossetia. Oh, we attacked you and
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:09.840]  now you're standing up to us. Don't, don't be a schmuck. It's like that in life, isn't
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:16.440]  it? Good people have to stand up. Have you heard about American Free Press? American

[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:17.080]  Here I am at a gathering of friends minding my own business when one of our buddies Bob
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:21.680]  walks up to me. Very concerned. He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline crisis lately?
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:25.240]  I said, oh, of course. Whoo, they're high. He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:29.480]  do? I've got a truck. There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market. I really
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:33.840]  need the truck for my job. It uses more gas than I can afford. I've got to find a way
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:37.480]  to come up with some extra money. I got a wife with four kids at home. I don't know what
[1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:43.000]  to do. I said, Bob, relax, I know what to do. Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.840]  web at efoodsdirect.com. They will deliver food, really good, high quality, nutritional,
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:52.600]  delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house for about

[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:12.440]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633. Do it now.
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:17.400]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:21.720]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:25.720]  for the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:29.720]  engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the C.F.A.R.
[1:52:29.720 --> 1:52:35.320]  We sit down and shadow. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:38.920]  allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:44.920]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:48.920]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:54.920]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:57.920]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:03.920]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:08.920]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:11.920]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:36.920]  Chris in Florida, Tom, Mike, Mark, Rashid, Kevlin, their calls are coming up. Don't forget we've got to keep our eyes on the prize.
[1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:43.920]  I think the scientific dictatorship, the criminal architecture that is all around us.
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:51.920]  But this story is so big. I mean, we've got Gary Hart sending a letter to Iran and publishing it in the newspaper saying the U.S.
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:55.920]  government will stage terror attacks if you don't submit to them.
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:57.920]  Thinking the public's so dumb he can issue open threats.
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:03.920]  All the neocons and joint chiefs of staff recordings and rum-shelled recordings about how great another terror attack would be.
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:08.920]  What are the tutorials they write saying that? This is after 9-11.
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:18.920]  Comes out in New Yorker magazine, top investigative journalist, Sy Hur, saying, Cheney, plan to attack our ships with Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians in fake Iranian patrol boats.
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:26.920]  That's coming out. Top Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag attacks in one of the biggest publications in Russia.
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:29.920]  And in a press conference that they have intelligence of this sea.
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:36.920]  False flag is now being exposed. Self-inflicted wounds.
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:43.920]  It's now being exposed everywhere.
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:46.920]  The top attack by Russians.
[1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:51.920]  And now the international news crews have gone in and it's not true. It's been proven to be a fraud.
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:55:01.920]  In reality, 70% was destroyed, whereas Goree suffered relatively little damage according to the United Nations aid convoy.
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:08.920]  So the capital of South Ossetia was almost completely destroyed, 70% is devastating, and Goree suffered relatively little damage.
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:13.920]  The Russians went in and dismantled their military.
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:24.920]  This is TV channel Zavida, which has five camera crews working in the capital of South Ossetia, aired the same footage two days before on Monday.
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:34.920]  Sky News showed its reports with no sound, whereas the people showed and the Russian report could be heard speaking Russian and Ossetian dialects.
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:46.920]  The crying people shown in the report were heard cursing Georgian President Shakasvili for destruction and manslaughter.
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:49.920]  So you watch the same video and they're cursing Georgia.
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.920]  Hey, doesn't matter in America and England, they just play the video and say it's Russians being cursed.
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:58.920]  Works quite nicely, doesn't it? You attack somebody and then make up lies about them and say you've been attacked.
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:00.920]  Very nice tactics.
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:04.920]  After the controversy came to light yesterday, the Sky News clip was quickly pulled from the YouTube.
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:10.920]  In addition, CNN last week showed Georgian forces attacking Russian civilians in the capital of South Ossetia, the provincial capital,
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:15.920]  but then claimed it showed Russians attacking Georgians in the town of Goree.
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.920]  I remember Friday, two weeks ago, when this first broke, a week and a half ago in 888, we were watching CNN going and it's showing Russian missile launchers.
[1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:31.920]  And we figured out by the next day that it was Georgian, but the point is that I can't even grasp the level of lies.
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:34.920]  It even suckered me.
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:41.920]  I mean, it's just so amazing that they are able to do this.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:48.920]  A 12-year-old American girl who was caught up in the brutal assault of Georgia in South Ossetia attempted to tell the truth about who the real aggressors were during a live Fox interview,
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:50.920]  but she was quickly silenced by the host.
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:58.920]  Western media coverage of the conflict has reflected a virulently pro-Georgian bias since the start of the war,
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:06.920]  once again proving that the press is not independent, but simply a mouthpiece of the same Anglo-American power structure from whom Georgia is merely another client state, a proxy.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:20.920]  Good job. All Watson. Incredible article on PrisonPlanet.com. Don't forget this Matrix 9-11 tie-in that's up on JonesReport.com right now. Incredible videos still up there. We'll be right back with your calls.
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:31.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:38.920]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:42.920]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:44.920]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:47.920]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:54.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:57:54.920 --> 1:58:01.920]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:05.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:12.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:16.920]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:24.920]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:50.920]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:58.920]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:08.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:11.920]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:20.920]  Now, in to the third hour, fourth hour, Sydney C. in joining us. Wide open phones in this hour and a bunch of other news like Joe Biden promises Georgia billions of dollars.
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:28.920]  Ambush of French paratroopers kills 9 in Kabul. Credit crunch may take out large U.S. bankwarns IMF chief.
[1:59:28.920 --> 1:59:33.920]  Japan-labeled goods, carbon footprints, officials say. Arctic ice sheet grows 30% last year.
[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:37.920]  But first, we're going to take calls. Chris in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:44.920]  Hi, Alex. Yesterday, I had Burmese and Rowan, and they were talking about the R&D concerts.
[1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:48.920]  I'm sorry, not yesterday, but this... I think it was Friday. I think that's the week, yeah.
[1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:58.920]  And I want to ask if you've seen the YouTube video of the Illuminati symbolism that's being worn by the rap artists like Kanye West, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Skull and Bones,
[1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:12.920]  Velbuckle, and Nas, who just came out badmouthing Fox News on the Cold Bear Report I saw a couple weeks ago with a bunch of petitions in grandiose, bombastic fashion I thought was a little suspicious.
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:19.920]  Well, look, I'm not involved with the stuff coming up in New York other than letting them show the two films I just produced, Truth Rising,
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:22.920]  and Fabled Enemies for free to give firefighters and police money.
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:29.920]  I'm not going to New York because I can't go to Denver and then leave again my family. It's got to stop. I'm working too much.
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:34.920]  It's like I worked so much I can't get off the treadmill. It's like I've got to somehow slow down, but let me just finish here.
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:39.920]  The style for the last three years has been skull and crossbones everywhere.
[2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:43.920]  Now, when Arnold wears an authentic Nazi belt buckle, that's different.
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:53.920]  But when, I mean, Burmese has got a couple of his girlfriend who's up in New York and really messes him. She sent him a few weeks ago a couple of shirts she bought at Target and one of them had a skull on it.
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:59.920]  And I told Burmese that people are going to think we're the Illuminati. Please don't wear that around the office because the public sees that and thinks that.
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:08.920]  But you go to Target, you go to these stores, and it's just skull and crossbones everywhere, kind of like before that it was all camouflaged for a few years.
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:15.920]  And they admit that a lot of the fashions are set by, you know, by Madison Avenue, by the architects.
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:22.920]  I mean, so that's going on. But to say that, I know there's a lot of videos, people don't have discernment.
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  I've seen a lot of anti-New World Order videos where they show all seeing eyes, where they show New World Order stuff and they're identifying it and saying it's bad.
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:42.920]  And then people see it. Oh, who's that big guy who did some 9-11 videos about 9-11 being an inside job? He's huge. He's a white rapper from Michigan.
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  What's his name? I don't pay attention to it.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:51.920]  Eminem. Yeah, I know I've talked to folks that know him. He's a fan of this show. Sorry Eminem, I just don't keep track of it.
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:57.920]  The point is people thought he was being New World Order there. He isn't being New World Order. I mean, here's another example.
[2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:07.920]  My films, Police State 2, it's Terror, Storm and Endgame, when I'm talking about the New World Order, I show pyramids. I show all seeing eyes.
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:13.920]  I show that as the transitions. I'm talking about them. I'm saying New World Order and I show you their symbol.
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:18.920]  And there's all these websites. Oh my God, look what he did. It's programming. It's subliminal.
[2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:24.920]  I mean, you'll have a 10-second clip of it all seeing eye. That's not subliminal. I'm identifying our enemy's flag.
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  If I show a Nazi flag, it doesn't mean that I am for the Nazis. I'm identifying their symbol.
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:44.920]  This is how humans communicate. Here's an example. We're redesigning PrismPlanet.com and the great designer, and she makes, you know, Hollywood posters, record covers.
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:49.920]  She hates the New World Order. She's made a bunch of designs for the header for the new Prism Planet. We're about to have another one the next two weeks.
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:54.920]  People don't like this current design. That's fine. If some do, some don't. Point is we're going to make it even better.
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:03:00.920]  And her new thing is it's the earth with a rising sun coming up behind it. And I know Obama uses that.
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:07.920]  And it looks so good. That's an archetypal image. They expropriate these basic geometric shapes and ideas.
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:15.920]  It's a prison planet. But even though it looks good, I may have that sun taken off the back just so people don't sit there and say that.
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:19.920]  And I'm going to give you another example. Stay there. I'm going to come back and give you another example of this.
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:30.920]  So we have to have discernment. I mean, if there's a hundredth of a frame of an all-seeing eye in some TV ad, I mean, you know it's subliminal.
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:37.920]  But they're not doing that in subliminals. It's out in the open. So these symbols permeate our society. We'll be right back.
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:47.920]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:52.920]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:58.920]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:02.920]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:50.920]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:05:50.920 --> 2:05:55.920]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:05:55.920 --> 2:06:06.920]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.

[2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:10.920]  Okay Chris, let me finish up and I'm going to let you have your piece.
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:17.920]  I don't even frankly know who these rap groups are and people other than Paris that's coming who I think is a great guy.
[2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:19.920]  What's that a lot of good info?
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:29.920]  I'm sorry I'm just not that hip to New York. I know Luke's a good guy, others trying to get big acts there to raise money for 9-11 first responders and get media attention.
[2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:36.920]  I know they want to get Cynthia McKinney and Cindy Sheehan to go. I think they are going. Last time I heard it's tentative.
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:45.920]  And so I really don't know what to say you're saying. Some of these people wear sculling bones shirts and was sculling crossbones and Illuminati symbolism.
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:52.920]  But I'll give you an example. I need to call him. Last time I mentioned this on air. He was listening. This producer was listening. Good friend of mine.
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:59.920]  I'm just so busy I have no life. All of this work. I did a couple interviews yesterday in my own show and video editing and then tried to spend some time with my family and it's insane.
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:11.920]  But a couple weeks ago there was all these YouTube videos about Alex Jones and scanner darkly Illuminati symbolism everywhere.
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:20.920]  And back when I was consulting on that film, I had a limited role consulting Tommy Pallotta invited me in, Rick Linkletter invited me in.
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:25.920]  I've been in another film Tommy had produced with Rick Linkletter, Waking Life.
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:33.920]  And you know you've heard Rick here on the air speak out against the New World Order in secret societies and he really researches it.
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:51.920]  Rick told you, Rick told you before it was in Vanity Fair six months before that on the set of another film he was making with Bruce Willis that Bruce Willis had seen Marshall Law and Terror Storm in the trailer with Rick.
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:56.920]  And had said that while I'm not going to be a neocon anymore now I know both parties are controlled.
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:06.920]  I know that the same people that did 9-11 the ones that killed Kennedy and Rick told you that word for word and then I don't know five, six, I don't remember how many months, eight months, I don't know it was like a half a year later.
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  He's interviewed out in Turks and Caicos with his ex-wife and her new husband.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:19.920]  That's how what a cool guy is with a family just wants his mother's children there so he doesn't care.
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:27.920]  And he's there going yeah the same people you know that killed Kennedy are the ones that are running the current police state and basically did 9-11.
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  And remember when Rick said that everybody went on air and the neocon blog said it was a lie that oh no Bruce Willis didn't say that.
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:42.920]  Of course his agent didn't say it was a lie it was just some made up person that claims they know him from the set who nobody knows said Bruce Willis lied.
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:53.920]  But then Bruce Willis went in vanity fair you know I'm not even star chasing for this show though I should because it really builds the movement and people pay attention to it.
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:56.920]  I can get a hold of Bruce Willis I ought to try to get him on.
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:10:06.920]  I think I'm going to do that but I almost cringe to do it because as this show gets bigger it just freaks everybody out you know in the quote movement who want to be the big shots then they make up more crap.
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:20.920]  The goal here is to win the goal is to take over the country and restore things to be winners with a winning attitude to not be a bunch of weird creeps running around talking trash about each other and back stabbing.
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:30.920]  So I'm going to go back to you just a second I want to finish this part okay stay there I'm going to go to you just a minute I know I was pausing there take a drink of my coffee.
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  But I want to finish this it's key so I'm on scanner darkly.
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:49.920]  And then my consulting role was only we think this is what in 2014 what cell phone tower hubs that scan and control and track the entire population is what we've gotten from dark DARPA documents.
[2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:53.920]  What do you think of our research and I just said my God it's as good as mine or better.
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:11:03.920]  And then you know what do you think of this artist rendering what do you think of this idea what do you think of you know this type of face scanning system you know does this look realistic to you of what it'll be in 10 years.
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:05.920]  It was like 2005.
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:09.920]  You know nine 10 years and I was like yes yes yes yes yes yes.
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:24.920]  This is set in Southern California they said also we want to show people that it's the New World Order running this and shipping in the drugs to basically control the population we want to that's what Philip K Dick believe it's what you know his family believe.
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:27.920]  So we want to you know show a true rendering of his book a scanner darkly.
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:29.920]  But then you know add some new items to it.
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:30.920]  You know some new.
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:33.920]  And I said yeah and so it's not subliminal.
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:41.920]  When Morton Downey Jr. not his name I met him a couple times by one of the guys I didn't really get to know on the set good wearing the.
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:51.920]  He's in the new Tropic Thunder movie and Iron Man and all that big actor I'm embarrassed I can't remember his name properly you know wearing an all seeing eye on his shirt that's not subliminal.
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  They're showing you when they show an Illuminati eye on the wall they're showing you so it goes two ways when I am one of my videos and I was consulted on that and had a little bit of input on that.
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:11.920]  I was taken over to this mock house they have or the druggies live addicted to the substance D and hung out with Keanu Reeves you know and looked at the set and was asked what I thought of it and.
[2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  You know and it was my fans were the cameraman and the set builders and the women on it who were building the sets.
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:29.920]  And I was like a little mini celebrity out there and it was really great to get to know Keanu Reeves and I still know him and know his assistant and they get my films and we're very private folks that's all I'll say and they're nice folks and I.
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:39.920]  Got to know Woody Harrelson still talk to him every once in a while and I got to know one on a rider boy she was something else I'll just leave it that.
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:44.920]  Even more pretty in person I'll tell you and very.
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  Forward but you know I mean they were nice people.
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  And they don't like the New World Order.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:59.920]  So what does it mean that Keanu Reeves.
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:09.920]  Is in the matrix 1999 film and they put in the Wachowski brothers you know I mean in their third movie it's all about the Illuminati in the New World Order and Lucifer the great architect and.
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  Keanu Reeves is like Jesus at the end I mean obviously the whole things are called but the Keanu Reeves know about all this I'll tell you this.
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:27.920]  Keanu Reeves is really smart in person he just doesn't trust the public or trust anybody and he's totally closed lips so they say he's retarded on the news.
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:34.920]  And the Keanu Reeves doesn't like the New World Order and that's why he made that film because it was anti New World Order for nothing.
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:41.920]  Oh little tip yeah I think it was paid $45,000 and that was just to pay for his assistant.
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  Basically you know he did that they all did that for nothing because they wanted to expose the New World Order.
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:59.920]  And then they're bad they're bad because they are overtly showing you that just like I'm bad with Terror Storm saying the New World Order and showing a pyramid with an all seeing eye.
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  So I mean there you know there has to be some level of discernment we show you a power pyramid and one of my videos segmented with the different elites.
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:12.920]  That is not subliminal programming.
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.920]  Okay now I'm gonna shut up at that point and now let's you have the floor go ahead Chris.
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  Well I wouldn't have brought it up if I hadn't been using some discernment but you know you know more than I do in the area of Illuminati symbolism and geometric symbols and such like that which I wanted to talk about.
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  And in the Matrix the new story I have on that but in the YouTube videos I don't know if you've seen the Kanye West, Jay-Z and Nas they have lyrics and they do expressions with their hands that are tied to having the basic masonic symbol with your hands over your left eye for example.
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:15:03.920]  But you know if you look at some of their lyrics they're a little bit expressive of their pro Illuminati stance especially Jay-Z but I just can't type that right now I didn't transcribe the lyrics but what I was really calling out.
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:15.920]  I know Jay-Z is real big and I just don't, yeah I mean they're just trying to get people that believe 9-11's an inside job are prominent to come to the thing but I would add people mimic power.
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:31.920]  They mimic whoever is the biggest, I mean listen to all the other talk show hosts and every other little patriot outlet it's all info wars, info wars, info wars, the info war where they mimic all my nomenclature so above, so below is the motto of the world, the model of the new world order.
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:44.920]  And certainly you're going to have these rock stars and people who are waking up and who've been in an evil culture and so then fluttering over towards the light and wanting to come out for 9-11 truth or whatever does that mean they're perfect?
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:53.920]  I mean I have Jesse Ventura on this show and we kind of become friends I can call him up at his house if I want I don't but you know we talk for a while and he asks me questions I ask him questions you know.
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:16:11.920]  I don't want to brag you know he asks me advice and stuff and a really nice guy getting to know me and you know I met him almost 2 years ago and gave him some films that really started him off and I don't agree with him on his stance on you know a few things on abortion and stuff like that
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:27.920]  but I mean it's like we put out our message but we're nice to people did you see Jesus saying I won't hang out with a prostitute or a money you know changer or a collector or a tax collector or no he went and then he changed them but he did in a loving way
[2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:42.920]  and I mean I'm not perfect man I have been promiscuous in high school and college I have never done really hard drugs I've tried a few here and there and hated them but I mean I've probably gotten drunk 200 times in my life and I'm not a big drinker
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:17:03.920]  how to stay away because I like it too much I smoke cigarettes off and on I mean I've never been perfect I was I mean I just we have to be reasonable and try to reach out and grow our numbers and then take them over to our side not just be judgmental about everybody do you see what I'm saying
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:17.920]  well yeah so I want to ask whether your judgmental about these symbols I want to point out that these symbols are turned upside down as you mentioned in the matrix clip and a symbol like the star the Christian cross the swastika
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:37.920]  or which the Nazis used the male swastika rather than a female you know in combination to masculinize the state and of course you know the fascist is a demasculinization of the people but I wanted to mention say that these symbols are ancient and the sacred geometry comes from a Buddhist monks Hindus
[2:17:37.920 --> 2:17:57.920]  Tibetan llamas and yogis they're not in league with world domination and these symbols are seen in meditation but the state in my belief takes them and these very inspiring and uplifting symbols that you see you can see in meditation and multitudes as well you know as well as other phenomena
[2:17:57.920 --> 2:18:20.920]  but these pictures the other pictures that are similar to fractals pictures like the Hubble telescope yes there are archetypal powerful images of God's sacred geometry that the new world order the devil mimics and counterfeits and so I agree those symbols in and of themselves are not evil
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:29.920]  they're being used because they're powerful and they speak to the subconscious okay do you agree with that
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:38.920]  they intimidate the menace us by taking natural order and turning it on its head and that's their whole intention but if you're aware of it then you can counteract that yourself
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:40.920]  anything else you want to add
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:43.920]  stay there I'm gonna come back to you then Mike and others
[2:18:43.920 --> 2:18:50.920]  have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs I continue to hear stories about property seizures
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:59.920]  frozen bank accounts confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:13.920]  unfortunately with the drug and money laundering act the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the trading with the enemy act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933 some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention

[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:54.920]  the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:55.920]  bin Laden
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:56.920]  this is his ammo
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:19:59.920]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden

[2:20:06.920 --> 2:20:13.920]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:17.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:20:17.920 --> 2:20:19.920]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:21.920]  the hijackers ties to the FBI

[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  and everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:05.920]  Big John
[2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:08.920]  Big John
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:11.920]  Big Bad John
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:14.920]  Big John
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:20.920]  nobody seemed to know where John called home he just drifted into town and stayed all alone
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  didn't say much kind of quiet and shy but if he spoke at all he just said hi to Big John
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.920]  somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and I
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:38.920]  crashed and blow from a huge right of hands in Louisiana
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:41.920]  all right going back to Chris then I'm going to hurry to the other caller Mike and
[2:23:41.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  Rashid, Kevin, Mark, Nate and others
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:49.920]  okay go ahead and finish up Chris
[2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:53.920]  well I can know I would say that these world leaders are insane they are mad
[2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:57.920]  because they have tried to take some of these sacred symbols
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:04.920]  that would normally raise one's awareness of their miraculous potential
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:09.920]  and turning that to show off to try to influence others
[2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  rather than seeing the priority of introspection
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  and communion with God and love and giving their way is apparently from their symbolism
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:25.920]  and their actions like as explained their physical expressions
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:33.920]  are drawing in from the left hand which in Chinese medicine and acupuncture
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:37.920]  the energy most people flows in from the left side so they're more about taking
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:44.920]  or as the more I guess what you might say white magic or which I don't practice
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:49.920]  I would say more of a yogi myself but the white magic seems to be more of the right hand
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  or giving where the energy flows from the person
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  and these world leaders are mad because they see the need to show off
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  a little bit of their power rather than seeking more
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  and using these symbols that would normally uplift turning them upside down
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:13.920]  it's just so arrogant they are not aware of the impact that it has on their own psyche
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  in their attempt to influence others they're not aware of how they're being used
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:24.920]  and they rely on the creation for power rather than love rather than the creation
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:29.920]  well I have just found in life not getting into all this ethereal you know ethereal
[2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  all this ethereal stuff I just love to give
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:37.920]  and then I found with so many people the whole not just the elite but the population is in darkness
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:41.920]  and I'm certainly not perfect myself but I have these you know pinnacles in my life
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:46.920]  in my psyche of very you know altruistic you know very deep spiritual love and brotherly love
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:52.920]  and sisterly love that but then it you try to give and they take that as weakness
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:56.920]  and then like and then try to overtake you're like oh here let me give
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.920]  and bite your hand off and you know and it's it's like oh my gosh
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  I'm punished and I know what you mean no good deed goes unpunished of
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  you know it's like when you cast pearls before swine but you know that's what I think you're so brave
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:15.920]  is that you take that risk with such as it was so many people that you're in my opinion
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:21.920]  I would call your Dharma that you've taken on your sense of duty to go after
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:27.920]  things that would disrupt your peace so much and you've taken on the duties of other people
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  I feel like it's a great degree but you know I wanted to
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  well you know that's what Alex means it means defender of man
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:41.920]  wow and that's always what I wanted to do
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  and I just can't believe I love seeing other people do well
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:50.920]  and I didn't figure out I was a teenager most people hate seeing you with a nice car
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:53.920]  nice house most people hated to be got a good looking girlfriend or wife
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:56.920]  or husband they hated to be got nice children
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:02.920]  I mean I've had it's it's sick I have people come say we're jealous that your children are so healthy and look so good
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:06.920]  and then you'll see people actually covetly looking at your children I mean it's
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:08.920]  I don't understand it
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:13.920]  Living well is the best revenge of the French say and because you're doing well they can only blame you
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:17.920]  I guess like because of the comparison but you know the polarity
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:22.920]  and the the idea in these eastern cultures and meditation is to raise the
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  Kundalini I know Joe Rogan mentioned that on your show and a caller a couple weeks ago
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:30.920]  kind of bad mouth that he wasn't well I know this whatever it is
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:33.920]  you can certainly get in different you know areas of your mind your soul
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:37.920]  and Joe Rogan is a lot less worldly and arrogant than when I first knew him
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:41.920]  gosh it's been ten years and I still hung out with him a few you know
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:45.920]  I don't know ten times or something he's a nice guy he's real but he's still real arrogant
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:50.920]  a lot of you know whatever you'd call it and now he's not as bad as he used to be
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:53.920]  but a lot of that comes with actually getting power
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  a lot of that comes with when you finally know a bunch of movie stars and
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:59.920]  all these women are throwing themselves at you and you're on the international television
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:03.920]  and have a number one TV show and the number one host of ultimate finding
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  you kind of figure out that that's not where it's all at
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:11.920]  say and then you realize is see people that haven't gotten real success
[2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:14.920]  they don't realize it's really nothing do you see what I'm saying
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:17.920]  change is good yeah yeah they think it's something they'll never attain
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:21.920]  and that's the one thing I don't like it's all the envy man it's just
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:26.920]  what are you envious of I'm nobody folks everybody is somebody
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:29.920]  but compared to you I'm nobody it's okay
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  on September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to

[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:45.920]  wake up Protestant America
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:48.920]  there is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state
[2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:52.920]  this confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations
[2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:54.920]  will form one huge political voting block
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:30:58.920]  their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation
[2:30:58.920 --> 2:31:02.920]  our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom
[2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:03.920]  liberty of conscience
[2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:06.920]  history and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state
[2:31:06.920 --> 2:31:08.920]  must be kept separate
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:12.920]  it must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:14.920]  this will change the character, not civil enforcement
[2:31:14.920 --> 2:31:18.920]  from history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:20.920]  religious intolerance resulted
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:23.920]  this union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation
[2:31:23.920 --> 2:31:26.920]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda
[2:31:26.920 --> 2:31:29.920]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late
[2:31:29.920 --> 2:31:31.920]  the prophecies are fast fulfilling
[2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:33.920]  Jesus is coming soon

[2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:27.920]  No, I wanted to talk over to Shane and you just hung up
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:30.920]  Mike and Tennessee and Kevin, Mark, Nate, George, Ed and others
[2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:32.920]  Go ahead, Mike
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:34.920]  Good afternoon, Alex
[2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:37.920]  Quick before I get to the issue, I want to talk about
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:39.920]  you can get a thumb drive that's got a digital voice recorder
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:41.920]  you can wear around your neck on a lanyard
[2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:44.920]  if they take your camera, you've got the thumb drive rolling the audio
[2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:46.920]  and you can record up to 36 hours
[2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:49.920]  so if they detain you, you can record everything they're saying
[2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:51.920]  Oh, yes, I actually have those
[2:32:51.920 --> 2:32:53.920]  Well, I've had several times
[2:32:53.920 --> 2:32:55.920]  I don't have a thumb drive that does 36 hours
[2:32:55.920 --> 2:32:58.920]  I have little video drives that do like 45 minutes, I think
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:01.920]  I don't have the video, I probably need that
[2:33:01.920 --> 2:33:04.920]  I have cameras taken, I've had them shut off, I've had them thrown away
[2:33:04.920 --> 2:33:06.920]  just you name it
[2:33:06.920 --> 2:33:08.920]  Oh, I'd love to hear these stories, where has that been done?
[2:33:08.920 --> 2:33:10.920]  Tipton County, Tennessee
[2:33:10.920 --> 2:33:13.920]  I got fed up with the corruption when we moved here 10 years ago
[2:33:13.920 --> 2:33:16.920]  I actually ran for office two years ago
[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:19.920]  we got the black boxes and at 947
[2:33:19.920 --> 2:33:21.920]  I had 4282 votes
[2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:24.920]  a sizable margin, I had 79% of the votes
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:27.920]  I went to bed the next day, I woke up and I had less than 3,000 votes
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:29.920]  That's how it works
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:31.920]  If you start complaining, the cops around you
[2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:34.920]  go get in your car and leave, boy, this ain't your town
[2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:36.920]  We wrote things here, huh?
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:38.920]  Is that what happened?
[2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:40.920]  Oh, yeah, I've been charged with four felonies
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:43.920]  They shot and killed my dog, shot at me and my wife
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:45.920]  the buddy of the guy I ran against is the old boy
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:48.920]  Oh, listen, they're killing sheriffs and other cops all the time
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:51.920]  in the south, that's Boss Hog World, man
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:54.920]  I went to the, get this, I went to the grand jury
[2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:57.920]  to indict the sheriff's deputy who lied
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:00.920]  the guy that shot my dog, obviously, and the assistant DA
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:03.920]  for giving false information to the grand jury
[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:06.920]  the jury foreman who's always the jury foreman for years
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:09.920]  same guy, went out and told the DA what I was doing
[2:34:09.920 --> 2:34:12.920]  10 minutes later, they arrested me for four counts of aggravated kidnapping
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:16.920]  I said, really, let me see the document, they didn't even have a blank piece of paper
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:19.920]  they were calling a warrant with no signature
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.920]  Oh, listen, I've been at the hospitals when they're snatching people's children for no reason
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:27.920]  and they'll swear out a five-year-old document with a totally different name
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:30.920]  saying it's a three-year-old child when it's newborn
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:34.920]  I mean, it's all just totally fake, lawless crooks
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:38.920]  Right, it gets better, I was giving my father the stuff I had
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:43.920]  from the grand jury presentment and my, calling my wife
[2:34:43.920 --> 2:34:46.920]  the deputy said I could call my wife and immediately
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:49.920]  five of these guys around me and start saying, stop resisting
[2:34:49.920 --> 2:34:52.920]  stop resisting and escalated the volume
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:54.920]  one of them jumped on me and started choking me
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:58.920]  so I'm just standing there and I turned my head to keep from being choked
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:00.920]  and they arrested me for resisting arrest
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:03.920]  Well, don't they know, though, that, see, there's bigger criminals above them
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:07.920]  that are going to hurt them and their family? No, see, they don't understand
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:10.920]  they think they can take, take, take and never be paid back
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:12.920]  but they're going to be paid back so bad
[2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:14.920]  They don't understand that, though
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:17.920]  these people barely have a high school diploma
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:21.920]  this is a rural community where there's, I had Toyota looking at bringing their truck plant
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:25.920]  to Covington, Tennessee, they shut down the operation that they were going to move
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:27.920]  to Marion, Arkansas because of me
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:30.920]  they were looking at moving to Tipton County, but when I lost the election
[2:35:30.920 --> 2:35:33.920]  and they saw that the election was rigged, they pulled out
[2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:38.920]  and, you know, there are no good companies going to move to a corrupt community
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:42.920]  that's why all these little bitty towns have just a few little employers
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:45.920]  because they want it that way, it's total power control
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:47.920]  Oh, listen, I've worked in living in these towns
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:51.920]  and there's always, you know, the kids of the officials get to beat up whoever they want
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:56.920]  they stomp around on these just unbelievable power trips
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:58.920]  everyone groveling to them
[2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:03.920]  and the police just literally swagger and people actually bow to them
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:06.920]  and that's what America is now
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:08.920]  it's going to be like that everywhere
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:10.920]  Well, everybody needs to get involved
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:12.920]  but everybody needs to be aware of the consequences
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:14.920]  and just like being a Christian
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:17.920]  it's not the easy life when you stand up and speak out for truth
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:19.920]  and you shine the light on these issues
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:23.920]  people are going to come after you so be prepared and hide your family well
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:25.920]  Well, people say, where's the corruption?
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:28.920]  You go scratch the average town or city, it's just rotten
[2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:30.920]  there's a new coat of paint on it
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:32.920]  but under it, it is rotten flesh, man
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:35.920]  it is just any direction you go in
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:37.920]  just crime, thieving, stealing
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:39.920]  and that's why they're building this police state up
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:42.920]  because they've sucked it so dry, they know it's about to collapse
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.920]  and then they want to sit on top of the collapse thing as the king of the hill
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:49.920]  and you mentioned about possibly leaving and where to go
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:52.920]  I'm not going to leave, the point is my instinct is
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:55.920]  leave, leave, I wake up in the morning, leave, get out of here
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:36:58.920]  my instinct is get out, get out, get out, get out
[2:36:58.920 --> 2:37:01.920]  like Jesse Ventura said, you can't help these people
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:04.920]  he told me on the phone, he said they don't want my help
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:06.920]  they don't want me to run, they want to be slaves
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:08.920]  I don't totally agree with that
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:11.920]  but I understand why he's just going to Mexico
[2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:13.920]  and he's not even saying he's running to liberty
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:15.920]  he's just saying you can't help them, they want to be lied to
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:18.920]  I know of two families that have moved to Bolivia of all places
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:21.920]  but I don't know the politics or the culture there
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:22.920]  it's horrible
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:25.920]  but they believe it's going to be a safer outcome
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:28.920]  but I think we need to stand and take our stand here
[2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:31.920]  and as you're doing educated as many people as possible
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:33.920]  and get people to have a backbone
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:36.920]  don't be afraid to stand up, I had 15 witnesses
[2:37:36.920 --> 2:37:39.920]  that observed me being attacked in the courtroom
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:42.920]  and not a single person is willing to step up
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:45.920]  because it's like the lady who wrote the bond for me said
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:48.920]  if I say anything, I'll be floating down the river
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:49.920]  everybody in the town...
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:51.920]  are you kidding, every few months I hear about them
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:54.920]  some evil bosshog sheriff will be thrown out
[2:37:54.920 --> 2:37:56.920]  and then they just kill the new sheriff
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:37:59.920]  oh that's right, the last sheriff that was replaced
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:02.920]  he's now over security in the school system
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:05.920]  they created a job for him and covered up his crimes
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:08.920]  and the one before him supposedly was involved
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:11.920]  in some murder and they, you know
[2:38:11.920 --> 2:38:14.920]  wasn't charged with just, you know, slowly moved aside
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:16.920]  and somebody else comes in
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:18.920]  and the whole thing is a cover-up
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:20.920]  the administration covers for each other
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:22.920]  it's an old-boy network and that ladder
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:24.920]  they know they can get to a certain point on that ladder
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:27.920]  and they're comfortable and as long as you have people
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:29.920]  with that mentality
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:32.920]  people need to wake up and people need to stand up
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:33.920]  and they need to...
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:35.920]  it is a nation of yes men
[2:38:35.920 --> 2:38:37.920]  and nice people tend to let people push them around
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:39.920]  and push and push and push and I've just found it's better
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:42.920]  not to lay down, it's better to push back
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:44.920]  thanks for the call, I appreciate it
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:48.920]  now I'll tell you where I've gotten to in my life is
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:52.920]  just, you know, recommitting ten times harder against evil
[2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:55.920]  and, you know, I'm the quote biggest thing
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:38:58.920]  in the anti-new world order movement in the world
[2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:00.920]  well, what a statement, what a fact
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:05.920]  what an incontrovertible finding a fact
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:08.920]  but does that mean I'm big, does that mean I'm bad
[2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:09.920]  does that mean I have a lot of power?
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:10.920]  no, the contrary
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:12.920]  you know what it's like to know
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  I'm like a little bitty gunboat
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.920]  going up against a fleet of aircraft carriers and battleships
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:23.920]  and there's all these people around me in tin cans
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:25.920]  griping and bitching about my patrol boat
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:28.920]  and I'm like trying to get them into patrol boats
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:29.920]  to fight the new world order
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:31.920]  they're just busy saying I'm the new world order
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:32.920]  my little patrol boat
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:35.920]  with a 50 caliber machine gun and two torpedoes on the side
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:38.920]  I mean, you know, it's amazing
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:40.920]  if we can get the people moving though
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:42.920]  that's a lot bigger than the enemy's formation
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:44.920]  and folks think if they grovel and lay down
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:45.920]  that that makes them safe
[2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:47.920]  no, that does the opposite
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:49.920]  that brings whole societies down
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:53.920]  it leads into real enslavement
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:55.920]  okay, oh my call list here
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:39:57.920]  Kevin, Ian Delaware, you're on the air
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:00.920]  hey Alex, hey, don't let those people out there get you down
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:02.920]  you've touched a lot of lives
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.920]  and you've inspired a lot of people including me
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.920]  I've created a lot of crazy glommers on
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:11.920]  and stalkers and just unbelievable
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:14.920]  and every day I kick myself for people I built up
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:16.920]  that turned out to be just trash of the earth
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:17.920]  but go ahead
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  no, don't get down
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:19.920]  I wanted to let you know
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:21.920]  I called the FCC back
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:25.920]  because I was kind of wondering what was going on with the...
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:28.920]  oh, saying kill my 11th readers, kill Mark Dyson
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:30.920]  yeah, exactly
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:32.920]  and this guy on the phone, he's telling me
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:34.920]  well, first he starts out, he says
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:38.920]  well, you know, that's not really what this complaint form is for
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:41.920]  you know, you're kind of, you're using it wrong
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:42.920]  you can't say the poopy word
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:45.920]  but you can hire out killings
[2:40:45.920 --> 2:40:47.920]  so I just, you know, kind of asking
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:49.920]  well, you know, what's wrong?
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:52.920]  I mean, I was reading him the exact rules about
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:54.920]  you know, how...
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:56.920]  what made it a legitimate complaint
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:59.920]  and he said, those rules are for you, slave, not for us
[2:40:59.920 --> 2:41:00.920]  exactly
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:01.920]  so...
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:02.920]  what did he say?
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:04.920]  he kind of tries a different tactic
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:07.920]  and he's saying, well, you know
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:09.920]  let me get back to you, I'm gonna...
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:11.920]  no, you're telling, you will file the complaint
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:13.920]  so they're not letting the complaints be filed
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:15.920]  they're breaking the law
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:16.920]  well, I just wanted to...
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:18.920]  you go to the affiliate station
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:21.920]  and you file it with his affiliates at the station
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:22.920]  that's how it's done
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:24.920]  and it goes in the permanent file
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:27.920]  so they cannot avoid filing the complaint
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:29.920]  well, I wanted to kind of just get other listeners
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:31.920]  anyone out there who filed something
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:33.920]  to let them know that, you know
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:35.920]  they can't just expect us to, like, forget about it
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:36.920]  and be distracted by that
[2:41:36.920 --> 2:41:39.920]  but did he refuse to take your complaint?
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:40.920]  I'm sorry?
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:42.920]  did he refuse to take your complaint?
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:44.920]  well, I mean, I had already lodged
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:46.920]  I was kind of asking about the status of it
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:49.920]  and he was kind of saying that
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:50.920]  well, you know, it wasn't...
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:52.920]  that's not what this is for
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:53.920]  they never filed it
[2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:56.920]  you have to send it registered mail
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:41:59.920]  I guess I'll have to go back and do that
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:02.920]  yeah, that went in the circular file
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:04.920]  but good job making the call
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:06.920]  well, just anyone out there who did it
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:07.920]  don't let them, you know
[2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:09.920]  don't let them think that we forgot about it
[2:42:09.920 --> 2:42:10.920]  I hear you
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:11.920]  let me tell you how radio works
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:13.920]  I appreciate your call
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:15.920]  you file them with the local radio station
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:17.920]  and has to go in their FCC permanent file
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:19.920]  but everything is about the people's ignorance
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:22.920]  and they play it off
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:24.920]  everything is about the people's ignorance
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:26.920]  they have to put that complaint
[2:42:26.920 --> 2:42:28.920]  in their permanent file
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:30.920]  at the radio station
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:33.920]  so you file it both places
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:35.920]  it's kind of like you go in
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:36.920]  and they say your child must take vaccines
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:37.920]  and they'll be arrested
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:38.920]  and then ask them, why would we be arrested?
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:39.920]  well, because we're going to kick them out
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:40.920]  they're going to be true
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:42.920]  wait a minute, but I don't have to take a shot
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:43.920]  they don't have to take a shot
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:45.920]  but then you falsely accuse
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:47.920]  and then falsely kick my child out
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:48.920]  you're the one committing the crime
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:51.920]  give me that waiver form out of your desk right now
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:53.920]  and I'll go, oh, you know about that?
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:54.920]  here it is
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:57.920]  see, all criminality, all lies, all fraud
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:42:59.920]  a nation, see, it's not just the government that lies
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:01.920]  it's we're a nation of liars
[2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:03.920]  we've become evil
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:05.920]  we were prosperous, we were never perfect
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:06.920]  we've always had problems
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:07.920]  but we were prosperous because
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:09.920]  we had Anglo-Saxon common law
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:11.920]  and people that would fight
[2:43:11.920 --> 2:43:12.920]  and now we've lost that
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:13.920]  we have corporate fraud law
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:16.920]  and a nation that's learned how to lie and be scum
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:17.920]  till we're now just a nation of parasites
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:20.920]  trying to feed on each other
[2:43:20.920 --> 2:43:23.920]  and God forbid you be a productive, smart, intelligent, dynamic person
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:26.920]  the parasites come out of the woodwork
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:28.920]  okay
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:31.920]  Mark and Georgia, you're on the air
[2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:32.920]  hello
[2:43:32.920 --> 2:43:34.920]  hey, Mark
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:36.920]  can you hear me?
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:37.920]  I sure can
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:39.920]  oh, God bless you, brother
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:41.920]  as you heard me say before
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:43.920]  you're ever in our prayers
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:45.920]  and you are an answer to a prayer
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:48.920]  I heard something and I want you to understand
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:50.920]  comparing to respond to this person in your defense
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:52.920]  you've got a lot more allies
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:54.920]  in the truth
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:43:56.920]  I don't want to get into people's lies and rumors here on the air
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:43:58.920]  there's nothing to say and I
[2:43:58.920 --> 2:44:01.920]  look, I'm not going to get into the thousands of slanders out there against you
[2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:03.920]  that only adds to it
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:05.920]  okay, I had to put people on notice though
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:06.920]  that's all that was earlier
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:08.920]  so if you want to get into something else, that's fine, sir
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:10.920]  the thing is
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:13.920]  my approach to it is that honest people make honest mistakes
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:15.920]  and as I say, as you've loved me as a brother in Christ
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:17.920]  please show me where I'm wrong
[2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:19.920]  because we're all wrong about something
[2:44:19.920 --> 2:44:21.920]  and the thing is that
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:23.920]  this person
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:25.920]  I don't know the context
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:27.920]  I don't know your side of it
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:29.920]  what happened recently with
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:31.920]  listen, sir, I'm not involved
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:33.920]  with all that stuff
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:35.920]  Ted Anderson
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:37.920]  cannot allow other people
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:39.920]  to take our shows and then represent
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:41.920]  that they own that show
[2:44:41.920 --> 2:44:43.920]  that they have that show
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:45.920]  and then go out and do that while
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:47.920]  all I said to Ted was
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:50.920]  I don't like the fact that I don't want to think about these people
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:52.920]  and they keep lying about me
[2:44:52.920 --> 2:44:54.920]  and doing things to me
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.920]  and I said, why are you allowing this to go on?
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:44:59.920]  someone to hold out that they are us
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:01.920]  and he said, you know, you're right
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:03.920]  I just figured I'd be nice a few years ago
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:04.920]  and let that happen
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:06.920]  and then he went and did something else with somebody completely different
[2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:08.920]  and then those people made up lies about him
[2:45:08.920 --> 2:45:11.920]  because they couldn't counter him on the right of something he has the right to do
[2:45:11.920 --> 2:45:13.920]  so things had to be invented
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:15.920]  okay
[2:45:15.920 --> 2:45:17.920]  and so that's just basically it
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:19.920]  it's just people want to eat my lunch
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:21.920]  man, they want to come in and take over my office
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:23.920]  they want to be us, they want to run it all
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:25.920]  that's what they do
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:27.920]  I mean the last time
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:29.920]  this other group was fighting with some other group
[2:45:29.920 --> 2:45:31.920]  I was not involved in any way
[2:45:31.920 --> 2:45:33.920]  didn't care
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:35.920]  it was internal other network
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:37.920]  them fighting with each other
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:39.920]  and the nut case running that
[2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:41.920]  said that I was do running that
[2:45:41.920 --> 2:45:43.920]  and I had to take the person to court
[2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:45.920]  so they would see that that wasn't true
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:47.920]  it wasn't true
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:49.920]  now the other group that this person accused me of running
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:51.920]  is all fighting
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:53.920]  with itself and doing all this stuff
[2:45:53.920 --> 2:45:55.920]  and they've sucked me in to say I'm involved
[2:45:55.920 --> 2:45:57.920]  in their fight and it's not true
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:45:59.920]  it'd be like if you had two neighbors fighting with each other
[2:45:59.920 --> 2:46:01.920]  in the front lawn
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:03.920]  of their house
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:05.920]  and then you walk outside with your kids to go to school
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:07.920]  and they say he's behind it, he did it
[2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:09.920]  and you're like what's going on
[2:46:09.920 --> 2:46:11.920]  craziness
[2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:13.920]  it's taught so I'm like
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:15.920]  well god all I've done is nice things for you
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:17.920]  I don't want to be associated with you
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:19.920]  a den of vipers
[2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:21.920]  a den of vipers
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:23.920]  this is my radio show
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:25.920]  I own my radio show
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:27.920]  okay
[2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:29.920]  and the platform my radio show on is with Ted Anderson
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:31.920]  and
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:33.920]  I'm not going to allow people to take my show
[2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:35.920]  and hold it out as theirs
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:37.920]  that's for AM and FM affiliates
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:39.920]  other hundreds of internet people
[2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:41.920]  putting it out and flapping
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:43.920]  and slapping their stuff on it
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:45.920]  we were so nice we did that
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:47.920]  and all it did was breed contempt because that wasn't enough
[2:46:47.920 --> 2:46:49.920]  letting people
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:51.920]  hold themselves out as us
[2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:53.920]  letting people pose as us
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:55.920]  letting people take our advertisers and do it wasn't enough
[2:46:55.920 --> 2:46:57.920]  because it wasn't enough for them
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:46:59.920]  they're like we want it all
[2:46:59.920 --> 2:47:01.920]  give it to us all
[2:47:01.920 --> 2:47:03.920]  you didn't make us successful
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:05.920]  you didn't slit your throat and bleed into our mouths
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:07.920]  we're going to invent BS about you
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:09.920]  to attack you because we're trash
[2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:13.920]  I can bring out
[2:47:13.920 --> 2:47:15.920]  it's unbelievable the crap I put up with
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:17.920]  that I should have never put the other stuff
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:19.920]  it's unbelievable and that's what people want
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:21.920]  they want their loser lives empowered
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:23.920]  by somebody like me that's a real workhorse
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:25.920]  that is not what this show is about
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:29.920]  good god you people
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:31.920]  the economy is plunging
[2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:33.920]  the currency is falling apart
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:35.920]  the Russians are saying the US through Georgia
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:37.920]  may stage false flag attacks
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:39.920]  millions of people are brain damaged
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:41.920]  from mercury in the vaccine
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:43.920]  sodium fluoride is killing people
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:45.920]  and injuring and brain damaging people
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:47.920]  all around us
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:51.920]  and the whole
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:53.920]  world is diseased
[2:47:53.920 --> 2:47:55.920]  in other businesses
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:47:57.920]  in other things everybody is in fighting
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:47:59.920]  and going crazy and neighbors are fighting
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:01.920]  and men and women are fighting
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:03.920]  and the economy is degenerating
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:05.920]  I come on the radio
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:07.920]  and I cover news and I cover information
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:09.920]  and people can't stand that
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:13.920]  and so they want
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:15.920]  to sabotage what I'm doing
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:17.920]  and they make stuff up
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:19.920]  and then they force me to stand up against it
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:21.920]  they're delusional
[2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:27.920]  it doesn't matter it means nothing
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:29.920]  all these
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:31.920]  fake radio networks
[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:33.920]  have the listenership
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:35.920]  of one tiny YouTube channel
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:37.920]  there's probably 30-40 YouTube channels
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:39.920]  that put my show up every day
[2:48:39.920 --> 2:48:41.920]  where they put up 10, 15, 20, 30 videos a day
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:43.920]  each one getting thousands of views
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:45.920]  within a day
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:47.920]  that's just YouTube I'm on every video channel

[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:01.920]  they all get in my business
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:03.920]  they constantly make crap up about me
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:05.920]  they say I'm a drug dealer
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:07.920]  they call up and say

[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:17.920]  the only issue is
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:19.920]  is that I'm here in Austin
[2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:21.920]  there's stuff going on 10 times worse
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:23.920]  in other places but I don't have to sit here

[2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:19.920]  and create fake controversies
[2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:21.920]  it's what a loser society does
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:23.920]  and that's all people do and I'm sick of it man
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:25.920]  I mean it's literally like
[2:53:25.920 --> 2:53:27.920]  in a scale it's like somebody one inch
[2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:29.920]  tall running around

[2:53:31.920 --> 2:53:33.920]  I mean there's just thousands of groups
[2:53:33.920 --> 2:53:35.920]  and websites that are Alex Jones
[2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:37.920]  they don't fight the new world order
[2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:39.920]  they make crap up about Alex Jones
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:41.920]  and I'm tired of this show
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:43.920]  being about me I got stacks of news
[2:53:43.920 --> 2:53:45.920]  huge guest I want to bring you
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:47.920]  I want to try to get people going
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:49.920]  I want to fight and I guess it's constructive
[2:53:49.920 --> 2:53:51.920]  if
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:53:55.920]  you know to illustrate all of this
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:53:57.920]  so people don't keep falling into the trap
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:53:59.920]  we have people to warn
[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:01.920]  we have people to wake up
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:03.920]  we have issues to cover
[2:54:03.920 --> 2:54:05.920]  we have things we need to do
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:07.920]  and we never take
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:09.920]  responsibility for what we've done
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:11.920]  I try to do that and it doesn't mean I always do
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:13.920]  but I've just
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:15.920]  discovered today about more horrors
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:17.920]  with locals in fighting with each other
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:19.920]  and I'm going to be blamed for that
[2:54:19.920 --> 2:54:21.920]  and I'm like you go tell those people
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:23.920]  I'm not involved in that
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:25.920]  you tell what the hell is going on now
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:27.920]  because I'm always the author of everything

[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:51.920]  because I've got a bunch of news I want to get to
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:53.920]  and we've also got solutions that need to be discussed
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:55.920]  ladies and gentlemen

[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:03.920]  that gets them into the whole new water system
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:05.920]  breaking information
[2:55:05.920 --> 2:55:07.920]  fabled enemies I produced that was directed by Jason Bermas
[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:09.920]  and I also consulted on it and worked on it here
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:11.920]  with Aaron and Rob
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:13.920]  they did great jobs
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:15.920]  we're really going to be sad that Bermas is going to be leaving us in about two weeks
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:17.920]  to go back to New York
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:19.920]  he's going to come back down in about six months
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:21.920]  and we're going to hire more editors then because he's got my top editors
[2:55:21.920 --> 2:55:23.920]  and I got kind of held up a project
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:25.920]  he's been working with us again on another film
[2:55:25.920 --> 2:55:27.920]  I love Bermas, he's a good guy
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:29.920]  and we're going to try to build him up
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:31.920]  and you know
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:33.920]  it's been a long time
[2:55:33.920 --> 2:55:35.920]  and I think I can say he's somebody we can finally trust
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:37.920]  but
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:39.920]  he's a good guy
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:41.920]  and Bermas' new film, Fabled Enemies
[2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:43.920]  is coming out
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:45.920]  on September 1st
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:47.920]  and it addresses the big kahuna, the Israeli situation
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:49.920]  in 9-11
[2:55:49.920 --> 2:55:51.920]  the Pakistani time with the British and the Israelis
[2:55:51.920 --> 2:55:53.920]  how they did it, what happened
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:55.920]  taking a big step for us as big as we are
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:57.920]  it's easy for some 2-bit site with 100 hits a month
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:55:59.920]  to cover this subject for us, it's a big deal
[2:55:59.920 --> 2:56:01.920]  and we're doing it
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:03.920]  recovering the facts, we're just going with the truth
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  and
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:07.920]  we'll be attacked from all sides for that
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:09.920]  but it is Fabled Enemies, I hope you pre-order the DVD

[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:25.920]  to pay for that
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:27.920]  and it's $5.95 a month
[2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:29.920]  it should be at 3 months free
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:31.920]  it's like $50 or something

[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:41.920]  while we fight off the Lillipolis
[2:56:41.920 --> 2:56:43.920]  as they try to time the Lillipolis
[2:56:43.920 --> 2:56:45.920]  you know the little people trying to tie the big guy down
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:47.920]  and all their little mindless battles
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:49.920]  that's a good analogy for all of this
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:51.920]  and I'm just like being friendly and they're like
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:53.920]  he's plotting against us and I was like
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:55.920]  I don't care, it's like
[2:56:55.920 --> 2:56:57.920]  tell me these YouTube channels that have like
[2:56:57.920 --> 2:56:59.920]  tens of thousands of members and that have all this stuff
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:01.920]  and I go oh no you're doing much better

[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:15.920]  I know we can defeat the new world order
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:17.920]  we can do that with one more nail in their coffin
[2:57:17.920 --> 2:57:19.920]  with fabled enemies

[2:58:52.920 --> 2:58:54.920]  by an amazing individual
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:56.920]  her determination to go and
[2:58:56.920 --> 2:58:58.920]  live for months on end
[2:58:58.920 --> 2:59:00.920]  out on the scrub brush
[2:59:00.920 --> 2:59:02.920]  next door to Gordon Bush
[2:59:02.920 --> 2:59:04.920]  his compound his fake cowboy set
[2:59:06.920 --> 2:59:08.920]  really became a focal point
[2:59:08.920 --> 2:59:10.920]  of a woman they couldn't attack
[2:59:10.920 --> 2:59:12.920]  she lost her son
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:14.920]  he bravely fought in Iraq
[2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:16.920]  she's been a great leader to all of us
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:18.920]  a great example
[2:59:18.920 --> 2:59:20.920]  she's also become a 9-11 truth leader
[2:59:20.920 --> 2:59:22.920]  in the last year
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:24.920]  and I know myself
[2:59:24.920 --> 2:59:26.920]  Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura
[2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:28.920]  talked to behind the scenes about her
[2:59:28.920 --> 2:59:30.920]  just admire her and think of her every day
[2:59:30.920 --> 2:59:32.920]  and we just appreciate her
[2:59:34.920 --> 2:59:36.920]  running against that monster
[2:59:36.920 --> 2:59:38.920]  Nancy Pelosi
[2:59:38.920 --> 2:59:40.920]  that deceiver who said that they would
[2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:42.920]  bring justice in the war
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:44.920]  impeach Bush and all they've done is protect him
[2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:46.920]  all they've done is fawn after him
[2:59:46.920 --> 2:59:48.920]  and it's just unbelievably
[2:59:48.920 --> 2:59:50.920]  evil hundreds of thousands have died
[2:59:50.920 --> 2:59:52.920]  in Iraq since they got in
[2:59:52.920 --> 2:59:54.920]  almost two years ago
[2:59:54.920 --> 2:59:56.920]  and if we were to listen to Cindy Sheehan
[2:59:56.920 --> 2:59:58.920]  and the other mothers and fathers
[2:59:58.920 --> 3:00:00.920]  of these dead troops
[3:00:00.920 --> 3:00:02.920]  close to a million people
[3:00:02.920 --> 3:00:04.920]  wouldn't be dead right now
[3:00:04.920 --> 3:00:06.920]  Cindy Sheehan thanks for coming on with us
[3:00:06.920 --> 3:00:08.920]  and I'm so glad you're running for the house
[3:00:08.920 --> 3:00:10.920]  seat of Nancy Pelosi
[3:00:10.920 --> 3:00:12.920]  Hi Alex it's great to be on your show again
[3:00:12.920 --> 3:00:14.920]  it's great to have you there
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:16.920]  tell us why you're running
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:18.920]  how we can support you and let's break down
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:20.920]  what's happening in the current world and your take on it
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:22.920]  well
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:24.920]  I'm running and I've been on your show
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:26.920]  excuse me
[3:00:26.920 --> 3:00:28.920]  of course a couple times I think since I announced
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:30.920]  but I'm running because
[3:00:30.920 --> 3:00:32.920]  just what you said Nancy Pelosi has failed to hold
[3:00:32.920 --> 3:00:34.920]  the criminals
[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:36.920]  the war criminals
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:38.920]  the criminals against our own constitution
[3:00:38.920 --> 3:00:40.920]  responsible
[3:00:40.920 --> 3:00:42.920]  the Bush regime
[3:00:42.920 --> 3:00:44.920]  and she has failed to use her power
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:46.920]  to bring the troops home
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:48.920]  from Iraq in Afghanistan
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:50.920]  and as a matter of fact
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:52.920]  an appropriated
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:54.920]  bill with
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:56.920]  $163 billion
[3:00:56.920 --> 3:00:58.920]  that would fund the occupations
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:00.920]  through next June
[3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:02.920]  so I think that
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:04.920]  the Democrats and the Republicans
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:06.920]  are co-equally responsible
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:08.920]  for what's happening in the world today
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:10.920]  from the degradation
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:12.920]  of the environment
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:14.920]  to the collapse of our economy
[3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:16.920]  to the astronomical energy prices
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:18.920]  to
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:20.920]  the
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:22.920]  destruction of our constitution
[3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:24.920]  and we have to realize that
[3:01:24.920 --> 3:01:26.920]  that we have to
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:28.920]  break away from
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:30.920]  just blind party loyalty
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:32.920]  to if we're ever going
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:34.920]  to solve these
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:36.920]  these horrible problems
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:38.920]  that are plaguing our nation and our world right now
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:42.920]  well you're absolutely right
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:44.920]  and the last time I had you on was probably
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:46.920]  6-7 months ago when you were considering
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:48.920]  if she didn't move to end the war
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:50.920]  impeachment to run
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:52.920]  but now you're officially in the heat of this battle
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:54.920]  that was a year ago
[3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:56.920]  that was a year ago Alex
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:01:58.920]  I announced July 23rd
[3:01:58.920 --> 3:02:00.920]  of last year
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:02.920]  that I was going to run against her
[3:02:02.920 --> 3:02:04.920]  and yeah we are definitely
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:06.920]  in the right
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:08.920]  and we've been in San Francisco now for
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:10.920]  over a year
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:12.920]  we've been consolidating our support
[3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:14.920]  we just went through
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:16.920]  a task to collect
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:18.920]  10,198 signatures
[3:02:18.920 --> 3:02:20.920]  to get me on the ballot
[3:02:20.920 --> 3:02:22.920]  and now we're ready to rock and roll in this campaign
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:24.920]  and just be very aggressive
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:26.920]  well I'll tell you this if there's not election
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:28.920]  I mean there's not election fraud
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:30.920]  you should win what are the polls
[3:02:30.920 --> 3:02:32.920]  trending what are they showing
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:34.920]  well we haven't had any polls
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:36.920]  done yet we haven't been able
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:38.920]  to afford to do any polls
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:40.920]  but we're looking into that now
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:42.920]  because fortunately
[3:02:42.920 --> 3:02:44.920]  you know
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:46.920]  Nancy's performance or non-performance
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:48.920]  our
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:50.920]  our donations
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:52.920]  have gone up so we're
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:54.920]  going to check in the polls
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:56.920]  and
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:02:58.920]  I already know what's important to the people of San Francisco
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:00.920]  and I'm fully
[3:03:00.920 --> 3:03:02.920]  100% behind there
[3:03:02.920 --> 3:03:04.920]  as to election fraud
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:06.920]  that's always a
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:08.920]  major issue
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:10.920]  but we're going to have hundreds of people out on election day
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:12.920]  sitting on polls
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:14.920]  a team of lawyers
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:16.920]  an election fraud hotline
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:18.920]  and we're going to do everything that's possible
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:20.920]  to try and prevent that
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:22.920]  well Nancy Pelosi is really starting to run
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:24.920]  scared right now
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:26.920]  our guest is Cindy Sheehan
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:28.920]  and
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:30.920]  she is running against
[3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:32.920]  the monster
[3:03:32.920 --> 3:03:34.920]  that is the speaker of the house
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:36.920]  Nancy Pelosi we're going to talk more with her
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.920]  on the other side of this quick break
[3:03:40.920 --> 3:03:41.920]  hi there
[3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:43.920]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:44.920]  hangover
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:45.920]  I know I know
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:47.920]  as the makers of drink and made hangover defense tablets
[3:03:47.920 --> 3:03:49.920]  we hear it every day
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:51.920]  grown respectable adults don't get
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:52.920]  hangovers
[3:03:52.920 --> 3:03:54.920]  hangovers are what you got in college
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:55.920]  don't get
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:56.920]  hangovers
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:03:58.920]  hangovers are what you got in college
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:00.920]  when you had about 10 too many at the frat house
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:02.920]  and then rolled out of bed bright and early
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:04.920]  at the crack of noon the next day
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:06.920]  well sure sometimes you'll have a couple drinks
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:07.920]  with dinner
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:09.920]  and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:11.920]  feeling just a bit queasy
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:13.920]  but that's not really a hangover is it
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:15.920]  well call it what you want but now you don't need
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:16.920]  to get one
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:18.920]  thanks to drink and made hangover defense

[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:22.920]  into a glass of water just after you have
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:23.920]  a couple drinks
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:24.920]  they taste great

[3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:45.920]  a day unlike any other in the long course
[3:05:45.920 --> 3:05:46.920]  of American history
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:48.920]  a terrorist act of war
[3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:50.920]  against this country
[3:05:50.920 --> 3:05:52.920]  the enemy struck America on September 11
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:05:54.920]  but who is the enemy?
[3:05:54.920 --> 3:05:55.920]  bin Laden
[3:05:55.920 --> 3:05:56.920]  this is his MO
[3:05:56.920 --> 3:05:57.920]  we have to look to the Middle East
[3:05:57.920 --> 3:05:59.920]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[3:05:59.920 --> 3:06:01.920]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[3:06:01.920 --> 3:06:02.920]  to take a close look
[3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:04.920]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:06:04.920 --> 3:06:06.920]  inside the United States
[3:06:06.920 --> 3:06:08.920]  some US investigators believe
[3:06:08.920 --> 3:06:09.920]  that there are Israelis again
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:11.920]  very much engaged in spying
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:13.920]  in and on the US
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:15.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:17.920]  have been detained
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:19.920]  in Laden's connections to the CIA
[3:06:19.920 --> 3:06:21.920]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:22.920]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[3:06:22.920 --> 3:06:24.920]  the Israeli intelligence network
[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:26.920]  warnings and war get the DVD
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:27.920]  infowars.com
[3:06:27.920 --> 3:06:29.920]  foresee it in super high quality
[3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:31.920]  along with hundreds of other titles
[3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:33.920]  at prisonplanet.tv
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:35.920]  either you are with us
[3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:37.920]  or you are with the terrorists
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:43.920]  from his central Texas command center
[3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:45.920]  deep behind enemy lines
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:47.920]  the information war continues
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:49.920]  it's Alex Jones
[3:06:49.920 --> 3:06:51.920]  and the GCN radio network
[3:06:52.920 --> 3:06:54.920]  let's talk turkey
[3:06:54.920 --> 3:06:56.920]  Barack Obama is run by the same globalists
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:06:58.920]  same neocons
[3:06:58.920 --> 3:06:59.920]  control George Bush
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:01.920]  he is going to continue all this
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:03.920]  John McCain is going to continue it all
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:05.920]  they are co-guilty
[3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:08.920]  Cindy Sheen was just saying
[3:07:08.920 --> 3:07:10.920]  and the democrats
[3:07:10.920 --> 3:07:12.920]  in the house they voted for the secret
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:14.920]  warrantless spying on American people
[3:07:14.920 --> 3:07:15.920]  I got a Washington Post article
[3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:17.920]  limiting all the police state upgrades
[3:07:17.920 --> 3:07:18.920]  the federalization
[3:07:18.920 --> 3:07:20.920]  it's all being seamlessly
[3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:22.920]  transferred to whoever gets elected
[3:07:22.920 --> 3:07:24.920]  the military industrial complex
[3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:26.920]  the bomb makers
[3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:28.920]  want it that way it's going to be that way
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:30.920]  you have 80 plus percent of the American people
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:32.920]  in most polls some say 75
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:34.920]  that's still the majority who don't want more wars
[3:07:34.920 --> 3:07:36.920]  who don't want all this to happen
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:38.920]  now the US through Georgia
[3:07:38.920 --> 3:07:40.920]  has attacked Russia
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:42.920]  the public soap brainwash
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:44.920]  that they are being told Russia started it
[3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:46.920]  I mean this is dangerous
[3:07:46.920 --> 3:07:48.920]  and all these top generals and experts have said
[3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:50.920]  this could start World War 3
[3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:52.920]  it's common sense it's constitutional
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:07:53.920]  it's the will of the people
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:55.920]  we need to hold them accountable
[3:07:55.920 --> 3:07:56.920]  and how do we do that?
[3:07:56.920 --> 3:07:57.920]  electing
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:59.920]  and that will be a major defeat
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:01.920]  if we take out these evil democrats
[3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:04.920]  and put real anti-war people
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:05.920]  like
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:07.920]  the great lady we are talking to
[3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:08.920]  and I don't care if the republic or democrat
[3:08:08.920 --> 3:08:09.920]  get us out of the war
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:11.920]  give us back our liberties and freedoms
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:12.920]  we are taking them back
[3:08:12.920 --> 3:08:14.920]  can you comment on that Cindy Sheen
[3:08:14.920 --> 3:08:15.920]  how important it is
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:17.920]  for everybody to give you support
[3:08:17.920 --> 3:08:19.920]  this is one of the most key
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:21.920]  house races that I've ever heard of
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:22.920]  ever thought of
[3:08:22.920 --> 3:08:24.920]  I mean you are going right for
[3:08:24.920 --> 3:08:27.920]  one of the twin heads
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:29.920]  that is allowing this mass murder
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:31.920]  to continue in Iraq
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:33.920]  that's absolutely right
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:35.920]  like we were saying before
[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:37.920]  there is very little difference
[3:08:37.920 --> 3:08:39.920]  between John McCain
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:41.920]  and Barack Obama
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:43.920]  on many key issues that
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:45.920]  are really important to
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  this country and the world
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:49.920]  militarism of course
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:52.920]  Barack Obama wants to increase militarism
[3:08:52.920 --> 3:08:54.920]  he wouldn't be where he was
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:56.920]  unless he has sold out to the military
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:08:58.920]  industrial complex
[3:08:58.920 --> 3:08:59.920]  and APAC
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:02.920]  which John McCain also has
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:04.920]  and he wouldn't be where he is
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:07.920]  if he wasn't a puppet
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:10.920]  or a tool of the war machine
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:13.920]  so it's so important to elect independent
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:15.920]  people like me to congress
[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:17.920]  to hold these people accountable
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:19.920]  and I could have walked into
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:22.920]  many districts in this country
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:24.920]  and won easily
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:27.920]  I could have beaten a republican
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:29.920]  or a blue dog democrat
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:31.920]  in many many districts
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:33.920]  and it would have been an easy race
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:36.920]  but this is hitting them where it fundamentally hurts
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:38.920]  Nancy Pelosi
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:40.920]  no matter what people say
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:42.920]  how she's a right wing liberal
[3:09:42.920 --> 3:09:45.920]  or whatever she's not
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:47.920]  she's also part of the system
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:49.920]  that suppresses us
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  and keeps us in these wars
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:53.920]  and attacking them
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:55.920]  right there is attacking them right
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:09:57.920]  in the gut in the very
[3:09:57.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  you know
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:01.920]  I think it is extremely
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:03.920]  and it's an extremely important election
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  and if we take Nancy Pelosi
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:07.920]  out of her seat
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:09.920]  that means that there's going to be
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:11.920]  534 members of congress
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:13.920]  that know that the American public
[3:10:13.920 --> 3:10:14.920]  means business
[3:10:14.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  and that we want true
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:18.920]  a true change in direction
[3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:20.920]  not just empty rhetoric
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:22.920]  but a true change in course
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:24.920]  and I think this will be
[3:10:24.920 --> 3:10:26.920]  very very significant
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:28.920]  and a very historical
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:30.920]  moment for our country to
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:32.920]  really become
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:34.920]  the country that
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:36.920]  people say we are
[3:10:36.920 --> 3:10:38.920]  and to
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:40.920]  create a new paradigm
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:42.920]  of peace, accountability
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:44.920]  and economic equality
[3:10:44.920 --> 3:10:46.920]  well I'll say this Cindy
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:48.920]  I've come from quote the right
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:50.920]  but I don't believe in the left right paradigm anymore
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:52.920]  exactly but growing up
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:54.920]  but I have to say
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:56.920]  Democrats wouldn't wake up to some of Bill Clinton's corruption
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:10:58.920]  and attack on Serbia
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:00.920]  but Republicans
[3:11:00.920 --> 3:11:02.920]  have really shown themselves to be slavish
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:04.920]  to George Bush and all of his evil
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:06.920]  that isn't even conservative
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:08.920]  in the classical sense but just fascist
[3:11:08.920 --> 3:11:10.920]  and I have to say I'm really glad to see a lot of people
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:12.920]  quote on the traditional left
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:14.920]  really shattering their paradigm
[3:11:14.920 --> 3:11:16.920]  and really getting it and getting a lot of courage
[3:11:16.920 --> 3:11:18.920]  and understanding the anti-war movements
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:20.920]  infiltrated which has come out
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:22.920]  by military intelligence and others
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:24.920]  to neutralize it and foundation money
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:26.920]  who realized and are saying yeah
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:28.920]  a lot of terror is provocative terror
[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:30.920]  government sponsored and I'm seeing
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:32.920]  a lot of real courage
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:34.920]  by what you'd call the traditional left
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:36.920]  right now can you speak to that
[3:11:36.920 --> 3:11:38.920]  what do you want from her
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:40.920]  well you know the
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:42.920]  I'm not exactly sure
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:44.920]  what you're talking about
[3:11:44.920 --> 3:11:46.920]  well I understand some folks just got in your car
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:48.920]  and what I'm saying is
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:50.920]  I'm seeing more resistance
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:52.920]  to this
[3:11:52.920 --> 3:11:54.920]  and it being non-partisan
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:11:56.920]  from people I see on the left
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:11:58.920]  the biggest awakening I'm seeing
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:00.920]  is on the left they're not being taken for a ride
[3:12:00.920 --> 3:12:02.920]  by the Democratic party
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:04.920]  for year after year being lied to
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:06.920]  gullible to their own party
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:08.920]  as Republicans are
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:10.920]  I'm seeing a little shift in that
[3:12:10.920 --> 3:12:12.920]  when I first announced
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:14.920]  last summer that I was leaving
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:16.920]  the Democratic party and then I announced
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:18.920]  I was running against Nancy Pelosi
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:20.920]  as an independent
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:22.920]  you know I got so much
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:24.920]  so smeared and attacked
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:26.920]  so badly by the so-called left
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:28.920]  that I see that
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:30.920]  they feel the same sense of betrayal
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:32.920]  by this two-party system
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:34.920]  that many of us haven't seen
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:36.920]  for quite a long time
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:38.920]  and it's just because
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:40.920]  things like Nancy Pelosi
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:42.920]  giving immunity to telecoms
[3:12:42.920 --> 3:12:44.920]  and giving George Bush
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:46.920]  the power to spy on us
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:48.920]  without warrants
[3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:50.920]  they see that Nancy Pelosi
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:52.920]  was
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:54.920]  briefed on torture in 2002
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:56.920]  and she didn't do anything about it
[3:12:56.920 --> 3:12:58.920]  and they see that the Democratic Congress
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:00.920]  has the lowest approval rating
[3:13:00.920 --> 3:13:02.920]  in Congress in history
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:04.920]  it has passed the fewest amount of bills
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:06.920]  as any Congress in history
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:08.920]  its only job is
[3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:10.920]  to fund the federal government
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:12.920]  it hasn't even done that
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:14.920]  and it has used
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:16.920]  this power unwisely
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:18.920]  to fund these illegal memorial occupations
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:20.920]  and to not hold George Bush
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:22.920]  into changing accountable
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:24.920]  so people are starting to wake up
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:26.920]  well that's what I was going to say a year ago
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:28.920]  when you said you were going to run
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:30.920]  I should have been talking about it for a year and a half
[3:13:30.920 --> 3:13:32.920]  but now we're here
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:34.920]  you did get attacked up front
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:36.920]  but then it kind of sunk in
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:38.920]  like Mark Twain said in the beginning
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:40.920]  a man or woman
[3:13:40.920 --> 3:13:42.920]  a patriot is a scarce thing
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:44.920]  hated and feared and scorned
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:46.920]  but in time when their cause succeeds
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:48.920]  or when the proof is in the pudding
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:50.920]  the Tim would join him
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:52.920]  because then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:54.920]  like Cindy Sheehan
[3:13:54.920 --> 3:13:56.920]  and now we're a year plus
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:58.920]  and that's what I'm saying
[3:13:58.920 --> 3:14:00.920]  I'll be honest with you Cindy
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:02.920]  I'm seeing liberals
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:04.920]  even former congressman Dan Byrd
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:06.920]  he believes in the Second Amendment
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:08.920]  because he understands government's tyrannical
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:10.920]  I'm just seeing the paradigm smash
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:12.920]  particularly with the left
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:14.920]  and really
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:16.920]  intellectually getting it
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:18.920]  I'm just impressed with it
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:20.920]  are there still throngs of
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:22.920]  Barack Obama zombies
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:24.920]  and Pelosi zombies sure
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:26.920]  I have to give credit where it's due
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:28.920]  and I have to say that the left
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:30.920]  is really impressing me that's all I'm saying
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:32.920]  well I think that
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:34.920]  I do see that and I agree with you
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:36.920]  and I don't feel as lonely as I did
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:38.920]  a year ago but then again
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:40.920]  when I first started speaking out
[3:14:40.920 --> 3:14:42.920]  that this war was a legal memorial
[3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:44.920]  and George Bush was a liar
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:46.920]  and George Bush was a murderer
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:48.920]  and George Bush was a terrorist
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:50.920]  I felt lonely then
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:52.920]  but most of the country eventually caught up with
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:54.920]  so I think that
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:14:56.920]  it takes somebody like me
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:14:58.920]  who I don't say I encouraged
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:00.920]  but I don't really have a whole lot
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:02.920]  left to lose and I
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:04.920]  can go out for it
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:06.920]  and I can take
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:08.920]  the smears, I can take the attacks
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:10.920]  because I've buried myself
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:12.920]  and if they think that there's anything
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:14.920]  that the left or the right or the middle
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:16.920]  or anybody can do to me that's worse than that
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:18.920]  that's not going to happen
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:20.920]  what did Janice Joplin say?
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:22.920]  just another word for
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:24.920]  nothing left to lose
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:26.920]  absolutely
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:28.920]  and I think with the attacks
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:30.920]  on our constitution, with the attacks
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:32.920]  on our rule of law, with the attacks
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:34.920]  like you said it's
[3:15:34.920 --> 3:15:36.920]  becoming a fascist police state
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:38.920]  and most people don't even realize
[3:15:38.920 --> 3:15:40.920]  how close we are
[3:15:40.920 --> 3:15:42.920]  to
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:44.920]  any second
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:46.920]  it's time to get past the partisan
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:48.920]  it's time to get past the partisan
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:50.920]  bull where you put a Republican hat on
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:52.920]  so you can't talk to anybody else
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:54.920]  outside that or ever think
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:15:56.920]  or you put a Democrat hat on
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:15:58.920]  and then you can't talk to anybody or think
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:00.920]  we've got to end that
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:02.920]  not talking, not debating, not being involved
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:04.920]  well and I think
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:06.920]  also you said that the left has
[3:16:06.920 --> 3:16:08.920]  started to awaken to that fact
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:10.920]  and I believe that just because
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:12.920]  someone has a D after their name
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:14.920]  that they must be good because we know that's not true
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:16.920]  we know that Bill Clinton
[3:16:16.920 --> 3:16:18.920]  was responsible for killing
[3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:20.920]  right now maybe as many
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:22.920]  as the Iraqis
[3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:24.920]  as George Bush has
[3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:26.920]  that he and his policies
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:28.920]  were just continuing
[3:16:28.920 --> 3:16:30.920]  the fascist police
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:32.920]  state from the Reagan
[3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:34.920]  administration and the George Bush administration
[3:16:34.920 --> 3:16:36.920]  so
[3:16:36.920 --> 3:16:38.920]  that it is nonpartisan
[3:16:38.920 --> 3:16:40.920]  it's a nonpartisan fascist control
[3:16:40.920 --> 3:16:42.920]  of our government so we have to join
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:44.920]  together in a nonpartisan way
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:46.920]  to challenge them
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:48.920]  and it's also people
[3:16:48.920 --> 3:16:50.920]  on the right and Ron Paul was able
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:52.920]  to energize a whole
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:54.920]  an entire generation of young people
[3:16:54.920 --> 3:16:56.920]  who are willing now
[3:16:56.920 --> 3:16:58.920]  to stand up for our Constitution
[3:16:58.920 --> 3:17:00.920]  and stand up for the rule of law
[3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:02.920]  and I don't agree
[3:17:02.920 --> 3:17:04.920]  with every policy of Ron Paul
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:06.920]  but there's many places
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:08.920]  we interconnect
[3:17:08.920 --> 3:17:10.920]  being anti-war, anti-imperialism
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:12.920]  and anti-police state fascism
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:14.920]  and that's what we have to work together
[3:17:14.920 --> 3:17:16.920]  we have to overlook our differences
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:18.920]  to
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:20.920]  confront this because there's
[3:17:20.920 --> 3:17:22.920]  so few of them and there's so many of us
[3:17:22.920 --> 3:17:24.920]  and we have to reclaim our power
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:26.920]  Yes, Cindy we're going to come back
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:28.920]  in the final segment with you
[3:17:28.920 --> 3:17:30.920]  maybe it could be a little bit longer
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:32.920]  I know you're in your car and you need to get into a meeting
[3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:34.920]  but before we go to break in one minute
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:36.920]  fire out the website, the phone number
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:38.920]  volunteers, money, people want to help you
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:40.920]  bring down Nancy Pelosi
[3:17:40.920 --> 3:17:42.920]  what's the war going on?
[3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:44.920]  CindyForCongress.org
[3:17:44.920 --> 3:17:48.920]  CindyFORCongress.org
[3:17:48.920 --> 3:17:50.920]  all the contact information
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:52.920]  our address, our phone number
[3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:54.920]  is on the website
[3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:56.920]  and people can give nationwide
[3:17:56.920 --> 3:17:58.920]  they can give nationwide
[3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:00.920]  we've been able to raise
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:02.920]  almost $100,000 now
[3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:04.920]  and it comes from donations from $5
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:06.920]  all the way up to the maximum donation
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:08.920]  from just people
[3:18:08.920 --> 3:18:10.920]  we won't take any money from
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:12.920]  corporate lobbyists
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:14.920]  who earn their money
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:16.920]  from oppressing people and violence
[3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:18.920]  you know Cindy, I don't want to waste any of my time
[3:18:18.920 --> 3:18:20.920]  with you
[3:18:20.920 --> 3:18:22.920]  I'm going to skip this 4 minute break
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:24.920]  and then come back right up to the bottom of the hour
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:26.920]  at 30 after
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:28.920]  so we've got exactly 10 minutes left with Cindy Sheehan
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:30.920]  we're going to skip this break for all the infowars.com
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:32.920]  stream listeners
[3:18:32.920 --> 3:18:34.920]  that exclusive stream, got to go there
[3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:36.920]  not the GCN stream but the info war stream
[3:18:36.920 --> 3:18:38.920]  that you're watching on PrismPlanet.TV
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:40.920]  we'll be right back
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:42.920]  Cindy, let's continue
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:44.920]  with grassroots
[3:18:44.920 --> 3:18:46.920]  what people can do
[3:18:46.920 --> 3:18:48.920]  who are in California, who are on the west coast
[3:18:48.920 --> 3:18:50.920]  particularly but also nationwide
[3:18:50.920 --> 3:18:52.920]  people can call into talk shows
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:54.920]  if they're in New York they can call
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:56.920]  San Francisco talk shows
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:18:58.920]  explain your district
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:00.920]  there's so much letter writing campaigns
[3:19:00.920 --> 3:19:02.920]  postcards
[3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:04.920]  if everybody does a little bit
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:06.920]  yeah, awesome
[3:19:06.920 --> 3:19:08.920]  tell folks about that right now
[3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:10.920]  we're still on air
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:12.920]  I just skip the break
[3:19:12.920 --> 3:19:14.920]  okay, awesome
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:16.920]  well
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:18.920]  let me see
[3:19:18.920 --> 3:19:20.920]  where do we start
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:22.920]  first of all, we accept donations
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:24.920]  no amount is too small
[3:19:24.920 --> 3:19:26.920]  we put every dollar
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:28.920]  to work
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:30.920]  in our campaign office
[3:19:30.920 --> 3:19:32.920]  we are going to have a grassroots section
[3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:34.920]  that's coming up really soon
[3:19:34.920 --> 3:19:36.920]  where people from outside the district
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:38.920]  like you said could phone bank for us
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:40.920]  they can send postcards
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:42.920]  inside the district
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:44.920]  to people explaining why they support me
[3:19:44.920 --> 3:19:46.920]  we are
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:48.920]  going to have canvassing
[3:19:48.920 --> 3:19:50.920]  and voter registration
[3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:52.920]  there's so many people in San Francisco
[3:19:52.920 --> 3:19:54.920]  who are not registered to vote
[3:19:54.920 --> 3:19:56.920]  that are
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:19:58.920]  they're qualified to be
[3:19:58.920 --> 3:20:00.920]  registered to vote but they're not
[3:20:00.920 --> 3:20:02.920]  left out of the process
[3:20:02.920 --> 3:20:04.920]  for the last few decades
[3:20:04.920 --> 3:20:06.920]  when the corporate control
[3:20:06.920 --> 3:20:08.920]  and the established elitists
[3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:10.920]  have taken control of the country
[3:20:10.920 --> 3:20:12.920]  and that's the only people that Nancy Pelosi represents
[3:20:12.920 --> 3:20:14.920]  she doesn't represent
[3:20:14.920 --> 3:20:16.920]  my neighbor on the street
[3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:18.920]  who can't afford to buy gas
[3:20:18.920 --> 3:20:20.920]  they're losing their homes
[3:20:20.920 --> 3:20:22.920]  and their jobs
[3:20:22.920 --> 3:20:24.920]  so we're going to do a very
[3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:26.920]  targeted grassroots voter registration
[3:20:26.920 --> 3:20:28.920]  get out the vote
[3:20:28.920 --> 3:20:30.920]  we're going to give people
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:32.920]  Nancy Pelosi always brags
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:34.920]  that she gives 80% of the vote
[3:20:34.920 --> 3:20:36.920]  she gives 80% of about
[3:20:36.920 --> 3:20:38.920]  20 to 25%
[3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:40.920]  of the people who actually come out to vote
[3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:42.920]  so that's a very, very
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:20:44.920]  small percentage
[3:20:44.920 --> 3:20:46.920]  so we're going to energize people
[3:20:46.920 --> 3:20:48.920]  who haven't voted
[3:20:48.920 --> 3:20:50.920]  for a long time to go back to the polls
[3:20:50.920 --> 3:20:52.920]  to give them a reason to go back and vote
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:54.920]  we collected almost
[3:20:54.920 --> 3:20:56.920]  20,000 signatures
[3:20:56.920 --> 3:20:58.920]  that's halfway
[3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:00.920]  to what we need
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:02.920]  to defeat Nancy Pelosi
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:04.920]  in November
[3:21:04.920 --> 3:21:06.920]  and we haven't even started campaigning yet
[3:21:06.920 --> 3:21:08.920]  so I think that with the help
[3:21:08.920 --> 3:21:10.920]  of people around America
[3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:12.920]  who realize the historic
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:14.920]  of this election
[3:21:14.920 --> 3:21:16.920]  who realize that they have to do more
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:18.920]  not
[3:21:18.920 --> 3:21:20.920]  write your congressperson now
[3:21:20.920 --> 3:21:22.920]  not
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:24.920]  support the two-party duopoly
[3:21:24.920 --> 3:21:26.920]  that really is just one party
[3:21:26.920 --> 3:21:28.920]  but
[3:21:28.920 --> 3:21:30.920]  work for a candidate
[3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:32.920]  who will bring
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:34.920]  to fundamental change
[3:21:34.920 --> 3:21:36.920]  who will start
[3:21:36.920 --> 3:21:38.920]  I'm a supporter of the Constitution
[3:21:38.920 --> 3:21:40.920]  I believe that we have
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:42.920]  I believe in the Second Amendment
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:44.920]  that we have a right to keep them bare arms
[3:21:44.920 --> 3:21:46.920]  and we know
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:48.920]  historically that was
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:50.920]  to protect us from the government
[3:21:50.920 --> 3:21:52.920]  but I am
[3:21:52.920 --> 3:21:54.920]  I believe that we have an armed revolution
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:21:56.920]  against this government
[3:21:56.920 --> 3:21:58.920]  they have black water
[3:21:58.920 --> 3:22:00.920]  they have every conceivable
[3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:02.920]  weapon that they
[3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:04.920]  well Nancy, studying the history of warfare
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:06.920]  they will lose if that physical fight starts
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:08.920]  but what we might get out of the revolution
[3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:10.920]  may be an even worse government
[3:22:10.920 --> 3:22:12.920]  is what history shows
[3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:14.920]  we can certainly win it
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:16.920]  every time we've gotten a worse government
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:18.920]  so I believe that
[3:22:18.920 --> 3:22:20.920]  taking out Nancy Pelosi
[3:22:20.920 --> 3:22:22.920]  is an amazingly
[3:22:22.920 --> 3:22:24.920]  peaceful revolution
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:26.920]  we want something like Gandhi did
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:28.920]  we want what Gandhi did
[3:22:28.920 --> 3:22:30.920]  we want a bloodless revolution
[3:22:30.920 --> 3:22:32.920]  we all know it really wasn't totally bloodless
[3:22:32.920 --> 3:22:34.920]  we're going to come back to the full audience
[3:22:34.920 --> 3:22:36.920]  right now we were behind the scenes just on the internet
[3:22:36.920 --> 3:22:38.920]  now we're going to come back
[3:22:38.920 --> 3:22:40.920]  I want to talk about is Nancy Pelosi scared of you
[3:22:40.920 --> 3:22:42.920]  and where this is going here we go
[3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:44.920]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:46.920]  proudly presents
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:48.920]  the Alex Jones show
[3:22:48.920 --> 3:22:50.920]  the war on for your mind
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:54.920]  we are streaming this live
[3:22:54.920 --> 3:22:56.920]  as television over the internet
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:22:58.920]  at prisonplanet.tv
[3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:00.920]  nmfullwars.com
[3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:02.920]  and we just came back out of the break
[3:23:02.920 --> 3:23:04.920]  we skipped that break
[3:23:04.920 --> 3:23:06.920]  some stations though carried that break
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:08.920]  in the time we've got left
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:10.920]  such incredibly eloquent things there
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:12.920]  Cindy Sheehan
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:14.920]  people should support you right now
[3:23:14.920 --> 3:23:16.920]  I'm going to support you
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:18.920]  I'm going to run out of time here
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:20.920]  is Nancy Pelosi starting to get scared
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:22.920]  is she concerned
[3:23:22.920 --> 3:23:24.920]  because we know that you're wildly popular
[3:23:24.920 --> 3:23:26.920]  especially in that area of California
[3:23:26.920 --> 3:23:28.920]  well Nancy Pelosi
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:30.920]  she's on her book tour
[3:23:30.920 --> 3:23:32.920]  in her very ironically titled
[3:23:32.920 --> 3:23:34.920]  Know Your Power
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:36.920]  when she has advocated her power
[3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:38.920]  or like we said used her power
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:40.920]  just to support the status quo
[3:23:40.920 --> 3:23:42.920]  the fascist police state
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:44.920]  but at her book signing
[3:23:44.920 --> 3:23:46.920]  in San Francisco
[3:23:46.920 --> 3:23:48.920]  I heard I wasn't there
[3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:50.920]  but I heard that people chanted
[3:23:50.920 --> 3:23:52.920]  Cindy Cindy Cindy for five minutes
[3:23:52.920 --> 3:23:54.920]  and just the way they started
[3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:56.920]  to
[3:23:56.920 --> 3:23:58.920]  invalidate our signatures
[3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:00.920]  and starting to scrub the voter rolls
[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:02.920]  in San Francisco from the people
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:04.920]  who support me
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:06.920]  I think that they're very terrified
[3:24:06.920 --> 3:24:08.920]  they're terrified and all they care about
[3:24:08.920 --> 3:24:10.920]  is retaining their power
[3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:12.920]  and all I care about
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:14.920]  is what I've been doing since my son died
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:16.920]  I've specified everything
[3:24:16.920 --> 3:24:18.920]  to make this country
[3:24:18.920 --> 3:24:20.920]  the country that they say Casey died for
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:22.920]  for my surviving children
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:24.920]  for my new grandchild
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:26.920]  not just for them but for the children
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:28.920]  and grandchildren
[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:30.920]  and everybody all over the world
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:32.920]  when America is healthy
[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:34.920]  then the rest of the planet will be healthy
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:36.920]  and I think that
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:38.920]  with your support
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:40.920]  with the support of your listeners
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:42.920]  from America that I can do it
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:44.920]  and I don't feel like I'm there by myself
[3:24:44.920 --> 3:24:46.920]  I don't call it my campaign
[3:24:46.920 --> 3:24:48.920]  I call it our campaign
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:50.920]  if there's ever been a campaign in American history
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:52.920]  that was the people's campaign
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:54.920]  this is it
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:24:56.920]  well Cindy I agree and
[3:24:56.920 --> 3:24:58.920]  look at the cost they're not going to stop
[3:24:58.920 --> 3:25:00.920]  they're trying to start war with Russia
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:02.920]  they're trying to reignite the Cold War
[3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:04.920]  I mean this craziness isn't going to end
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:06.920]  until we put our foot down
[3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:08.920]  and I just appreciate you as a champion
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:10.920]  and by getting the word out
[3:25:10.920 --> 3:25:12.920]  we'll give that side out in a moment before you leave us
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:14.920]  but getting back into the fascist police state
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:16.920]  PDD 51
[3:25:16.920 --> 3:25:18.920]  all these police state measures
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:20.920]  the John War Defense Authorization Act
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:22.920]  camps for the American people
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:24.920]  a secret prison in Denver
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:26.920]  all of that's happening
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:28.920]  are you concerned about another false flag
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:30.920]  or another stage 9-11 as a pretext
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:32.920]  or even with a new administration
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:34.920]  so the military industrial complex
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:36.920]  could continue to move forward
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:38.920]  as you know the presidential directive
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:40.920]  51
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:42.920]  it gives George Bush
[3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.920]  the right to declare martial law
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:46.920]  without congressional
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:48.920]  approval but it doesn't have to be
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:50.920]  nuclear I mean it doesn't have to be
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:52.920]  a terrorist attack
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:54.920]  it could also he could declare martial law
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:56.920]  economic
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:58.920]  economic or
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:00.920]  a natural disaster
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:02.920]  so you know yes
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:04.920]  that's very terrifying and many people think
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:06.920]  that they're not going to even allow the elections
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:08.920]  to happen in November
[3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:10.920]  so if there was ever a time
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:12.920]  that the people need to take back their power
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:14.920]  today you're right this is the time to be vigilant
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:16.920]  this is the crossroads
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:18.920]  this is when the global system is liquid
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:20.920]  things are changing fast for good
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:22.920]  or ill we're going to be the difference
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:24.920]  we want to see in the world like Gandhi said
[3:26:24.920 --> 3:26:26.920]  look in the mirror every day
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:28.920]  and that's where you're going to find the solution
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:30.920]  with our creators help and with great champions
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:32.920]  out there like Cindy Sheehan
[3:26:32.920 --> 3:26:34.920]  9-11
[3:26:34.920 --> 3:26:36.920]  investigation
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:38.920]  now all these Republican memos come out saying
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:40.920]  we need a new 9-11
[3:26:40.920 --> 3:26:42.920]  9-11 would be great Sy Hirsch reports
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:44.920]  that Dick Cheney just proposed
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  attacking our own ships with
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:48.920]  fake PT boats with navy
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:50.920]  seals dressed up like Iranians
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:52.920]  would you like to see a bigger investigation of that
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:54.920]  well you know I have always called
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:26:56.920]  for
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:26:58.920]  a valid
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:00.920]  investigation into 9-11
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:02.920]  that has nothing to do with the government
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:04.920]  that has experts
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:06.920]  and subpoena power
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:08.920]  and that we
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:10.920]  these people need to swear
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:12.920]  that just cracks me up
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:14.920]  because they don't care about swearing
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:16.920]  you know it means nothing to them
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:18.920]  but yes definitely
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:20.920]  and I have
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:22.920]  families of 9-11
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:24.920]  to call for that the 9-11 investigation
[3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:26.920]  that we had was a joke
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:28.920]  and what do you think of the courage
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:30.920]  of Willie Nelson
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:32.920]  and Jesse Ventura and the former Italian president
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:34.920]  and the best actress
[3:27:34.920 --> 3:27:36.920]  this year winner
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:38.920]  all coming out saying inside job
[3:27:38.920 --> 3:27:40.920]  what do you think about that
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:42.920]  well you know I think that takes a lot of courage
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:44.920]  and as you know Alex I've never been
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:46.920]  I've never said inside job
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:48.920]  I've never been convinced
[3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:50.920]  by anybody that it wasn't inside job
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:52.920]  you just say it needs to be investigated
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:54.920]  you know that I think
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:56.920]  that there's so many
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:27:58.920]  priorities and so many questionable things
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:00.920]  that happen
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:02.920]  that I'm not ruling inside job out
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:04.920]  at all
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:06.920]  but I haven't been convinced of that
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:08.920]  but did you hear two weeks ago
[3:28:08.920 --> 3:28:10.920]  that Cheney wanted to attack our ships
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:12.920]  with fake Iranian boats
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:14.920]  I heard that
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:16.920]  that's bombshell isn't it
[3:28:16.920 --> 3:28:18.920]  that's what they wanted to do for a lot
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:20.920]  tell you what I'm going to skip this break Cindy
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:22.920]  stay there for three more minutes
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:24.920]  we're talking to Cindy Sheehan
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:26.920]  behind the scenes at info wars.com
[3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:28.920]  okay Cindy we got
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:30.920]  three minutes left here this is going on over the internet
[3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:32.920]  and it's put up on YouTube and everywhere
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:34.920]  continue finishing up with that
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:36.920]  I mean that's a big deal
[3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:38.920]  well I think they wanted to
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:40.920]  they wanted to provoke the dawn
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:42.920]  into attacking us because they knew they couldn't
[3:28:42.920 --> 3:28:44.920]  get the UN resolution
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:46.920]  White House memo
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:48.920]  these people will stop at nothing
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:50.920]  to have all the power
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:52.920]  all the money
[3:28:52.920 --> 3:28:54.920]  all the resources
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:28:56.920]  and I don't
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:28:58.920]  I wouldn't put it past them if 9-11
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:00.920]  was an inside job
[3:29:00.920 --> 3:29:02.920]  but I think that we really just need
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:04.920]  a very
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:06.920]  a very strong
[3:29:06.920 --> 3:29:08.920]  investigation into 9-11
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:10.920]  well exactly that's what I'm saying
[3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:12.920]  that we have Cyhurst saying
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:14.920]  oh my White House source they plan to attack
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:16.920]  12 targets one of them was to create
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:18.920]  fake Iranian boats in our shipyards
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:20.920]  put navy seals on board and have them attack
[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:22.920]  ships and have a shoot out
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:24.920]  and then somebody in the White House overruled him
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:26.920]  my point is
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:28.920]  then we have the White House memo flying
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:30.920]  US planes low painted like UN
[3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:32.920]  but this is even worse though
[3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:34.920]  to actually attack our own ships
[3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:36.920]  I mean that's Cyhurst that's Keith Oberman
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:38.920]  I mean we need to make a I mean you've got a big voice
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:40.920]  Cindy I know you're bringing that up but will you bring
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:42.920]  that up to the media
[3:29:42.920 --> 3:29:44.920]  well you know I have
[3:29:44.920 --> 3:29:46.920]  whenever I have an opportunity
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:48.920]  no I know you just got a lot of power
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:50.920]  I'm glad I have the opportunity today
[3:29:50.920 --> 3:29:52.920]  well you're just awesome
[3:29:52.920 --> 3:29:54.920]  I mean did that blow you away when you
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:29:56.920]  heard that Cheney was planning that
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:29:58.920]  you know nothing
[3:29:58.920 --> 3:30:00.920]  nothing that these people do blow me away anymore
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:02.920]  you know what blows me away
[3:30:02.920 --> 3:30:04.920]  is that we have
[3:30:04.920 --> 3:30:06.920]  allowed them to get away with it
[3:30:06.920 --> 3:30:08.920]  yes that blows me away
[3:30:08.920 --> 3:30:10.920]  absolutely well you're not letting
[3:30:10.920 --> 3:30:12.920]  them get away with it and we just
[3:30:12.920 --> 3:30:14.920]  appreciate you give out the congressional website
[3:30:14.920 --> 3:30:16.920]  one more time
[3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:18.920]  Cindy for congress.org
[3:30:18.920 --> 3:30:20.920]  Cindy F-O-R
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:22.920]  congress.org
[3:30:22.920 --> 3:30:24.920]  I don't want to put you on the spot I know you're in a car
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:26.920]  waiting to go into an event on the campaign trail
[3:30:26.920 --> 3:30:28.920]  but do you have the phone number
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:30.920]  because we have a lot of AM and FM
[3:30:30.920 --> 3:30:32.920]  shortwave satellite listeners that aren't at computers
[3:30:32.920 --> 3:30:34.920]  and don't have computers that want to call you
[3:30:34.920 --> 3:30:36.920]  a lot of elderly people
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:38.920]  yes I do

[3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:50.920]  it's already set up
[3:30:50.920 --> 3:30:52.920]  but I don't want to announce it until a little bit
[3:30:52.920 --> 3:30:54.920]  in October with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura
[3:30:54.920 --> 3:30:56.920]  maybe we can fly you in here
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:30:58.920]  or get you in there to be a speaker
[3:30:58.920 --> 3:31:00.920]  I want to put too many speakers in there I'll end up not having time to speak
[3:31:00.920 --> 3:31:02.920]  but maybe we'll get you into Austin Cindy
[3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:04.920]  and I'll call your

[3:31:50.920 --> 3:31:52.920]  you know I'm going to play part of two songs
[3:31:52.920 --> 3:31:54.920]  let's play top ranking
[3:31:54.920 --> 3:31:56.920]  because I've been skipping so many breaks I need a break
[3:31:56.920 --> 3:31:58.920]  to go to the lavatory the boys room as they say
[3:31:58.920 --> 3:32:00.920]  and then I know we played it once on there
[3:32:00.920 --> 3:32:02.920]  I know you've got it in queue that Janice Joplin freedom
[3:32:02.920 --> 3:32:04.920]  whatever the name of the song is
[3:32:04.920 --> 3:32:06.920]  freedom's just another word
[3:32:06.920 --> 3:32:08.920]  for nothing else to lose
[3:32:08.920 --> 3:32:10.920]  and there's nothing there's nothing
[3:32:10.920 --> 3:32:12.920]  of you ain't free or whatever she says
[3:32:12.920 --> 3:32:14.920]  try to cue that up but get me top raking I need to
[3:32:14.920 --> 3:32:16.920]  it's ready the point is I love this song so bad
[3:32:16.920 --> 3:32:18.920]  I won't even have time to get out of here I have to sit here and listen to it
[3:32:18.920 --> 3:32:20.920]  this says it all again
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:22.920]  I have always built people up
[3:32:22.920 --> 3:32:24.920]  brought countless people on to raise
[3:32:24.920 --> 3:32:26.920]  money
[3:32:26.920 --> 3:32:28.920]  given given given we have come on here
[3:32:28.920 --> 3:32:30.920]  selflessly to build up other talk shows other filmmakers
[3:32:30.920 --> 3:32:32.920]  everybody
[3:32:32.920 --> 3:32:34.920]  and we just
[3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:36.920]  all need to come together and fight the new world
[3:32:36.920 --> 3:32:38.920]  order and stop killing each other
[3:32:38.920 --> 3:32:40.920]  that's what they want they want is fighting fussing
[3:32:40.920 --> 3:32:42.920]  and fighting and killing each other
[3:32:42.920 --> 3:32:44.920]  and I have so much brotherly love for people
[3:32:44.920 --> 3:32:46.920]  but I do get just
[3:32:46.920 --> 3:32:48.920]  not even in rage it's like disgusted
[3:32:48.920 --> 3:32:50.920]  with the fact that
[3:32:50.920 --> 3:32:52.920]  so many bad people know that there's power
[3:32:52.920 --> 3:32:54.920]  in the anti-new world order movement
[3:32:54.920 --> 3:32:56.920]  and get into it and we have to identify these wolves
[3:32:56.920 --> 3:32:58.920]  and we have to route them out but then
[3:32:58.920 --> 3:33:00.920]  that itself becomes a self-fulfilling
[3:33:00.920 --> 3:33:02.920]  prophecy of just in fighting
[3:33:02.920 --> 3:33:04.920]  let's just listen to the
[3:33:04.920 --> 3:33:06.920]  words of the rasta man
[3:33:06.920 --> 3:33:08.920]  Mr. Naughty Dredd
[3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:10.920]  here it is
[3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:14.920]  they don't
[3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:16.920]  want to see us
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:18.920]  unite
[3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:20.920]  no I want to see us fussing and fighting
[3:33:20.920 --> 3:33:22.920]  all they want us
[3:33:22.920 --> 3:33:24.920]  to do is
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:26.920]  keep on fussing
[3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:28.920]  and fighting
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:32.920]  let's see us live together
[3:33:34.920 --> 3:33:36.920]  all they want us
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:38.920]  to do is
[3:33:38.920 --> 3:33:40.920]  keep on killing one another
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:42.920]  top ranking
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:44.920]  top ranking
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:46.920]  top ranking did you mean
[3:33:46.920 --> 3:33:48.920]  what you said

[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:29.160]  In a few minutes, but Russian general says

[3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:38.160]  U.S. backed forces may pose as Russian military
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:40.160]  And stage false flag events
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:41.160]  Now, the Russians are non-angels
[3:45:41.160 --> 3:45:43.160]  Just remember they can do that as well
[3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:46.160]  Just be aware of the false flag type operation
[3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:50.160]  Also speaking of Georgia, Joe Biden promises

[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:04.160]  Shakashvili and Georgia
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:06.160]  The United States will consider providing
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:07.160]  One billion emergency aid to Georgia
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:09.160]  A top U.S. lawmaker said today
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:11.160]  On his return from a visit to the
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:12.160]  Conflict Horn Nation
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:14.160]  Reports at Dow Jones Newswire
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:16.160]  When Congress reconvenes, I intend to work
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:18.160]  With the administration to seek congressional approval
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:20.160]  For one billion emergency assistance from Georgia
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:22.160]  Said Biden, this money will help the people of Georgia
[3:46:22.160 --> 3:46:24.160]  Recover from the damage that has been inflicted
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:27.160]  On our country, our economy, and send a clear message
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:29.160]  That the United States will not abandon
[3:46:29.160 --> 3:46:31.160]  This young democracy
[3:46:31.160 --> 3:46:33.160]  Actually, Biden has promised to jack
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:35.160]  The debt up another billion or so
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:37.160]  The U.S. debt is now over 100 trillion
[3:46:37.160 --> 3:46:39.160]  So that a mere billion the government says
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:42.160]  Is debt is only 10 trillion
[3:46:42.160 --> 3:46:45.160]  But the Federal Reserve and the Federal Express
[3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:48.160]  Says it's closer to 100 trillion
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:52.160]  Which means it is over that amount
[3:46:52.160 --> 3:46:54.160]  At any rate, Biden is simply taking orders
[3:46:54.160 --> 3:46:55.160]  From the globalists
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:57.160]  Biden is the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
[3:46:57.160 --> 3:46:59.160]  It might well be called
[3:46:59.160 --> 3:47:01.160]  The Council on Foreign Relations Committee
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:04.160]  Because that's where the marching orders come from
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:06.160]  Russia punched some pretty big holes
[3:47:06.160 --> 3:47:08.160]  In the globalist plan for little Georgia
[3:47:08.160 --> 3:47:11.160]  And the CIA created client state
[3:47:11.160 --> 3:47:14.160]  So the American people have to ante up
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:18.160]  And it goes on a little bit more from there
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:21.160]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:24.160]  Credit crunch may take out
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:26.160]  Large U.S. bank
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:29.160]  Warren's former IMF chief
[3:47:29.160 --> 3:47:31.160]  They told us eight months ago that the bank
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:33.160]  For closures and the bank collapses were over
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:35.160]  And the housing for closures were over
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:37.160]  And it just got worse two months later
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:39.160]  And then they told us six months ago it was getting better
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:41.160]  It's got worse and got worse last month
[3:47:41.160 --> 3:47:43.160]  And it's worse this month
[3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:47.160]  The deepening toll from global financial crisis
[3:47:47.160 --> 3:47:49.160]  Could trigger the failure of a large U.S. bank
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:52.160]  With months of respected former chief economist
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:54.160]  Of the International Monetary Fund claimed
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:58.160]  Today fueling another battering for banking shares
[3:47:58.160 --> 3:48:01.160]  Professor Kenneth Rogoff, a leading
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:04.160]  Academic economist said that there was yet
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:07.160]  Worse news to come from the worldwide
[3:48:07.160 --> 3:48:09.160]  Credit crunch and financial turmoil
[3:48:09.160 --> 3:48:11.160]  Particularly in the United States
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:14.160]  And that a high profile casualty
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:16.160]  Among American banks was highly likely
[3:48:16.160 --> 3:48:19.160]  The U.S. is not out of the woods
[3:48:19.160 --> 3:48:22.160]  What is it, Bank of America? Is it Citibank? Who's next?
[3:48:22.160 --> 3:48:24.160]  I think the financial crisis is at the halfway point
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:26.160]  Perhaps I would even go further to say
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:28.160]  That the worst is yet to come
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:31.160]  Professor Rogoff said at a conference in Singapore
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:33.160]  In an ominous warning he added
[3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:35.160]  We're just not going to see
[3:48:35.160 --> 3:48:37.160]  Mid-sized banks go under
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:38.160]  We're not just going to see
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:40.160]  Mid-sized banks go under the next few months
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:42.160]  We're going to see a whopper
[3:48:42.160 --> 3:48:44.160]  We're going to see a big one
[3:48:44.160 --> 3:48:46.160]  One of the big investment banks
[3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:48.160]  Or the big banks, he said
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:51.160]  Rising anxieties over
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:48:53.160]  Worse to come in the credit crisis
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:56.160]  Since shares tumbling in Europe and Asia
[3:48:56.160 --> 3:49:00.160]  And then it gets into all of that
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:02.160]  News and information for you
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:04.160]  When we come back I want to get into the latest
[3:49:04.160 --> 3:49:07.160]  Global warming, which means global tax
[3:49:07.160 --> 3:49:09.160]  Global regulation, social workers
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:11.160]  Managing every fantasy of your life
[3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:13.160]  Taxing and tracking everything you do
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:15.160]  We'll come back and hit some news on that
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:17.160]  And wrap up this transmission
[3:49:17.160 --> 3:49:19.160]  Stay the course, and as I said
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:22.160]  I covered so much key information
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:25.160]  In the first hour on the whole esoteric agenda
[3:49:25.160 --> 3:49:27.160]  And this new connection to the first Matrix movie
[3:49:27.160 --> 3:49:29.160]  Two, nine, eleven
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:31.160]  So that will be covered during the rebroadcast

[3:53:04.160 --> 3:53:05.160]  To a great extent
[3:53:05.160 --> 3:53:07.160]  Created communism
[3:53:07.160 --> 3:53:09.160]  To con the serfs back into slavery
[3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:12.160]  It's all declassified all public
[3:53:12.160 --> 3:53:15.160]  Put Mao in, Lenin, Stalin, all of it
[3:53:15.160 --> 3:53:18.160]  Now they need a new way to con people
[3:53:18.160 --> 3:53:20.160]  Into giving up control of their land
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:21.160]  What they do
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:23.160]  Taxing the air we breathe
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:25.160]  One of the four life giving
[3:53:25.160 --> 3:53:27.160]  Things that are needed on this planet
[3:53:27.160 --> 3:53:30.160]  Water, sunlight, oxygen and carbon dioxide
[3:53:30.160 --> 3:53:33.160]  And they're going to put on the side of your car
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:35.160]  On the sticker in California
[3:53:35.160 --> 3:53:36.160]  What its carbon footprint is
[3:53:36.160 --> 3:53:38.160]  They're starting to put it on products
[3:53:38.160 --> 3:53:40.160]  Shaming you for your great crime you've committed
[3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:42.160]  Meanwhile, thousands of true environmental things
[3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:43.160]  Are going on that are horrible
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:44.160]  Doesn't matter
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:48.160]  Japan's doing it, AP reports
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:50.160]  Japan, this is AFP
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:51.160]  Excuse me, Agency French Press
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:53.160]  Japan to label goods
[3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:55.160]  Carbon footprint, official say
[3:53:55.160 --> 3:53:57.160]  Japan is planning to label goods
[3:53:57.160 --> 3:54:00.160]  To show their carbon footprint in a bid
[3:54:00.160 --> 3:54:02.160]  To raise public awareness about global warming
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:04.160]  An official said Tuesday
[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:06.160]  Onto the plan, a select range of products
[3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:08.160]  From beverages and detergent will carry markings
[3:54:08.160 --> 3:54:10.160]  On the carbon footprint of how much gas
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:12.160]  Responsible for global warming has emitted
[3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:14.160]  Through production and delivery
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:16.160]  And so this is you got to label something
[3:54:16.160 --> 3:54:18.160]  Before you start taxing it
[3:54:18.160 --> 3:54:20.160]  And they're going to have your carbon credit car
[3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:22.160]  This has all been announced globally
[3:54:22.160 --> 3:54:24.160]  Through your nation that will
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:27.160]  You will pay taxes on when you go over
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:29.160]  That carbon allotment
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:31.160]  So just absolutely amazing there
[3:54:31.160 --> 3:54:35.160]  Also, Arctic ice grows 30% in a year
[3:54:35.160 --> 3:54:37.160]  Another Paul Watson article
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:39.160]  Predictions of ice-free summer for the first time
[3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:41.160]  In history, completely debunked
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:42.160]  Alarmist scientists who predicted
[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:44.160]  That the North America could be ice-free this summer
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:46.160]  As a result of global warming have been embarrassed
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:48.160]  After it was revealed that Arctic ice
[3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:51.160]  Has actually grown by around 30%
[3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:54.160]  In the year since 2007, back in June
[3:54:54.160 --> 3:54:56.160]  Numerous prominent voices in the scientific community
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:54:58.160]  Express fears of mass melting in the polar ice caps
[3:54:58.160 --> 3:55:00.160]  And they show the ignorant public ice flows
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:02.160]  And they think that's it breaking up
[3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:04.160]  It always does it every summer
[3:55:04.160 --> 3:55:06.160]  Including David Barber at the University of Manitoba
[3:55:06.160 --> 3:55:08.160]  Who told National Geographic magazine
[3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:09.160]  We're actually projecting this year
[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:11.160]  That the North Pole may be free of ice
[3:55:11.160 --> 3:55:13.160]  For the first time in history
[3:55:13.160 --> 3:55:15.160]  Then it goes on with the satellite photos
[3:55:15.160 --> 3:55:17.160]  And all the documents that it's actually gotten
[3:55:17.160 --> 3:55:19.160]  30% bigger growing at record rates
[3:55:19.160 --> 3:55:21.160]  See, people don't know that it rains on top
[3:55:21.160 --> 3:55:24.160]  The glaciers and on top the Arctic and Antarctic
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:26.160]  The North and South and that they get bigger
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:29.160]  And then the weight of the mountains
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:31.160]  It pushes out and then sloughs off and breaks off
[3:55:31.160 --> 3:55:34.160]  So it rains in the Arctic and the Antarctic
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:36.160]  And it builds them up, you see
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:38.160]  And then in the summer it heats up
[3:55:38.160 --> 3:55:40.160]  And the edges melt off and fall
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:42.160]  And they go, look, it's breaking off
[3:55:42.160 --> 3:55:44.160]  It's melting, polar bears are drowning
[3:55:44.160 --> 3:55:46.160]  And look, it's on a little bitty eye
[3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:49.160]  Look, it's on a little bitty eye, it's hunting
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:52.160]  Hunting beluga whale, it's hunting seals
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:54.160]  These things swim hundreds of miles just hunting
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:57.160]  I mean, all over the news, drowning polar bears
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:02.160]  They treat you like you are complete and total morons
[3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:04.160]  In closing, ladies and gentlemen
