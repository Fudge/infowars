[10:59.440 --> 11:05.840]  to defend it and b uh the killing of eric garner looks like manslaughter to me
[11:05.840 --> 11:12.720]  and if they're going to have a poster child against police brutality and murder then he
[11:12.720 --> 11:19.200]  would be a lot better or a kelly uh who's the guy's uh yeah kelly thomas out in california
[11:19.200 --> 11:26.480]  begs for daddy for 15 minutes all they tell him they would be a lot better examples to pin your
[11:26.480 --> 11:35.920]  movement on than michael brown they've released the federal autopsy signs of a scuffle just as they
[11:35.920 --> 11:43.360]  have the medical report on the officer uh and uh signs that well we're going to get into that whole
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.640]  report michael brown shooting federal autopsy shows evidence of scuffle and brown's death
[11:48.640 --> 11:56.160]  close range shot showing that the officer was shooting him as he ran towards him i'm sorry
[11:56.160 --> 12:02.640]  folks it looks like the cop told the truth so i wouldn't make it the poster child to try to
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.400]  reform the police be michael brown i wouldn't make it be cases where they shoot some innocent
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.000]  person in the back or where they taser an old lady to death or where they choke poor father of six
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.120]  eric garner to death and you know who they kept arresting garner for selling things on the street
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.720]  swap meets without a license selling cigarettes without a license the guy would just go out an
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.200]  entrepreneur in the neighborhood and so they just kept arresting and that's what you can hear him say
[12:31.200 --> 12:38.160]  man i'm sick of being arrested hold on a minute boom grab his hands put put him in a choke hold
[12:39.360 --> 12:44.880]  tell him to put his hand behind his back when he's in a wrestler hold and can't do it and then
[12:44.880 --> 12:56.480]  can't do it and then promptly killing and the cop that did it got off now there is injustice in this
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.280]  country there's injustice anywhere and the globalists are trying to ride this to a political
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.880]  distraction away from the power grabs away from the unemployment doubling in the black community
[13:06.880 --> 13:12.240]  away from the fact that obama cares a giant screw job they want to get gruber out of the headlines
[13:12.240 --> 13:15.840]  they want to get fast and furious out of the headlines they want to get obama ruling by
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.040]  executive power out of the headlines they want to get open border executive amnesty end of america
[13:21.040 --> 13:30.880]  north american union treason out of the headlines and how they do that is getting the nfl and the
[13:30.880 --> 13:39.600]  nba and late night tv shows and democrats and hollywood all endlessly hyping as if the only
[13:39.600 --> 13:46.960]  thing in the world is some of the cases of bad cops doing the wrong thing and killing people
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.880]  bully cops beating people up bully cops choking asthmatic teenagers but i'm telling you folks
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.760]  they're doing that because one man's death is a tragedy ten thousand is a statistic as joe
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.920]  stolin said they want to distract us with the soap opera that will never reform anything and
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.080]  is a political football of police brutality because they know there's a giant anti-government
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.200]  sentiment out there they want to scapegoat it at the enforcers so the enforcers will then go
[14:15.200 --> 14:22.160]  into full gang mentality accept the federalization and militarization and come out against the
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.920]  american people so they want to harden the police against the american people that is the criminal
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.040]  political class that's raping us from every angle it's a very simple equation in fact i should
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.400]  break it down on a chalkboard into some type of mathematical equation with a graphic to explain
[14:38.400 --> 14:43.200]  this to people because it's very elementary but sometimes it's good to have visual cues

[16:54.800 --> 17:01.360]  the people are it's like asking why have you you know invaded germany in world war two and you

[17:22.560 --> 17:26.880]  debating who the best patriot is that's the official white house cognitive infiltration plan
[17:26.880 --> 17:33.120]  to make us chase our tails but waking people up creating memes creating audio clips capturing
[17:33.120 --> 17:39.040]  video clips putting out articles putting out blurbs commenting that's the real video game

[24:21.360 --> 24:25.760]  the testimony is still ongoing this morning we're going to play some of the clips they're
[24:25.760 --> 24:32.640]  coming in as we speak in the next segment of jonathan gruber one of the main architects
[24:32.640 --> 24:40.000]  of the scam of how to phase in obama care to keep the constituents from knowing that it's
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.120]  really a monumental screw job a private tax to offshore banks that own the major insurance
[24:45.120 --> 24:53.360]  companies that's coming up in the next segment we're also going to look at an amazing article
[24:57.840 --> 25:01.600]  where the federal government has been caught we talked about this a long time ago and we
[25:01.600 --> 25:08.400]  knew that it was being organized and focused outside of law but now the house panel investigation
[25:08.400 --> 25:12.640]  led by representative darrell issa republican of california and representative jim jordan
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.280]  of ohio cites confidential briefing documents and we have copies of those that show senior
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.960]  just department officials informing attorney general eric holder that a consequence of
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.120]  operation choke points banks are exiting lines of business deemed high risk by regulators and
[25:31.120 --> 25:38.960]  then outside of law it's meant to shut down gun shops gun dealers you name it it targets quote
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.920]  legal businesses this is outside of law such as short-term lenders and even if you disagree with
[25:43.920 --> 25:50.160]  short-term lenders like i do change the laws don't target them firearms and ammunition merchants
[25:51.040 --> 25:54.880]  coin dealers tobacco sellers and home-based charities
[25:54.880 --> 26:01.920]  and see they do that to make it sound like they're moral breaking the law but it is illegal to have
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.880]  the feds doing that critics of the program argue that equating legal industries such as ammunition
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.680]  and lottery sales with explicit illegal or offensive activities such as pornography and
[26:11.680 --> 26:18.960]  racist materials transforms the fdic into the moral police was a better word it's called the
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.800]  thought police and there's copies of the emails in the article that's up on info wars dot com
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.440]  and then we have an actual link to the house of representatives committee on oversight and
[26:33.440 --> 26:41.520]  government reform darrell issa and it's got all the documents in the report for you to read them
[26:41.520 --> 26:49.200]  for yourself and we know they're doing this with uh not just the gun industry or the self-defense
[26:49.200 --> 26:56.240]  industry the independence industry they're doing it to the tea party they're doing it to pro-lifers
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.120]  they're doing it to evangelicals remember last year even fox news had the headline that
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.320]  at four hood we first broke this we were leaked the information they were calling them in and
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.200]  telling the non-commissioned officers your people may be court-martialed if they go to a tea party
[27:13.200 --> 27:20.720]  event off duty or if they even give money to it or are evangelical christians well evangelical
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.520]  christians are one of the biggest christian blocks in this country are very milk toast on average
[27:25.520 --> 27:32.480]  and and leave the government alone but even if they were radical i mean the the military has no
[27:32.480 --> 27:41.200]  right to tell soldiers what god they worship people say yeah why is that such a power grab
[27:41.200 --> 27:46.080]  that's the whole point of a power grab take a million miles and no matter how far we push back
[27:46.080 --> 27:52.080]  maybe they gain 200 000 now there's the headline for the hood soldiers told it christians tea
[27:52.080 --> 27:59.040]  partyers a radical terror threat and threatened with court-martialing click the fox news article
[27:59.040 --> 28:07.920]  right there that's the type of garbage that we're dealing with and and i go back to this
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.560]  what does it say when david rockefeller when malsey tongue died in the 70s wrote an op-ed piece
[28:14.560 --> 28:19.120]  for the new york times about how great communism was and how wonderful malsey tongue was malsey
[28:19.120 --> 28:26.400]  tongue killed over 80 million people conservatively why would the richest guy in the us at that time
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.720]  basically come out and say i love communism well again gary allen we have the graphic on the front
[28:32.720 --> 28:40.400]  page of info wars dot com with a banker business suit with a communist lapel pen and under it it says
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.720]  if one understands that socialism is not a share of the wealth program but is in reality a method
[28:46.720 --> 28:51.600]  to consolidate and control the wealth then the seeming paradox of super rich men promoting
[28:51.600 --> 28:58.800]  socialism becomes no paradox at all gary allen and the reason i mentioned this is if you understand
[28:58.800 --> 29:07.040]  that you understand the entire inshawata the cosmology the compendium the worldview of the
[29:07.040 --> 29:14.000]  mega elite they want monopolies they want state control that's why they had an outgoing president
[29:14.000 --> 29:23.040]  of china basically appointed by their uh inner party presidents even oxymoron not elected
[29:23.680 --> 29:27.840]  say that communist china is the ultimate expression of capitalism i'll never forget that
[29:27.840 --> 29:33.600]  quote in bbc and they were saying what a crazy quote it makes no sense no it makes perfect
[29:33.600 --> 29:41.040]  sense they mean crony capitalism by the way we sell the little soft cover book from 1972

[33:27.120 --> 33:44.320]  well the future king of england took time to meet with king james as he calls himself
[33:46.160 --> 33:52.240]  lebron james again demonstrates social conscience with i can't breathe shirt and i've got the photo
[33:52.240 --> 34:00.160]  of him here uh meeting uh with prince charles his son and he is cute little wife that we're all
[34:00.160 --> 34:06.560]  supposed to love and buy into and get little royal coffee cups and add insult to injury the articles
[34:06.560 --> 34:16.640]  up on info wars dot com pierce morgan has come out and said that america needs a monarch says obama
[34:16.640 --> 34:25.200]  will thankfully bow and scrape at feet of royals i don't think obama has found royals uh that he
[34:25.200 --> 34:36.160]  doesn't bow to that story is up on info wars dot com with the full quote by pierce morgan
[34:37.280 --> 34:42.240]  who'd already seen his rating slide in the year he took over from larry king but after i went on
[34:42.240 --> 34:48.400]  there two years ago he was just annihilated and they now admit in major publications like the la
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.520]  times and others that his slide began when i got in his face and said you were a traitor
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.800]  here to enslave us and disarm us it's not about children's safety i will not have your fake debate
[34:59.920 --> 35:04.960]  and of course a lot of the weasels and cowards out there at first said how discrediting of alex
[35:04.960 --> 35:11.680]  jones he should have talked in a proper british accent back to him and debated him on his field
[35:11.680 --> 35:19.200]  instead of going all the way over him how an american to get in someone's face yeah that's
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.320]  right paul revere would have just pulled out a blunderbuss shoved it his chest and pulled the
[35:24.320 --> 35:33.280]  trigger i am a weak little weasel compared to paul revere and then you've got americans mad at me
[35:35.840 --> 35:41.040]  that i dare go look it's about taking our guns you know it is and you're on notice you try to
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.640]  take them 1776 we'll commence again scumbag but the truth is most americans got it it resonated
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.840]  and it was like the imper's new clothes being announced or he's caught with his hand in the
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.720]  cookie jar or todo pulls back to curtain everybody went whoa we're here being lectured
[35:59.920 --> 36:08.400]  by a sycophantic royal worshiping twit who's got armed bodyguards at his home in la about how
[36:08.400 --> 36:18.160]  we shouldn't have guns we're done and it wasn't just that one interview he doubled down and brought
[36:18.160 --> 36:24.080]  a train of people on to basically excoriate him as well and the whole tone changed and and now
[36:24.080 --> 36:31.040]  there's a lot of analysis out there that that began the final implosion of cnn from being number two
[36:31.040 --> 36:40.080]  on cable behind fox to now being way in the end and essentially no longer exist they're just keeping
[36:40.080 --> 36:47.760]  it on the air to save face for time warner for its stock it's gone it's being dumped off cable all
[36:47.760 --> 36:54.400]  over the place dumped off different satellite systems it's a joke and have they stopped though
[36:54.400 --> 37:01.600]  they've increased the royal coverage of the royal carriage almost every time i see cnn it's the queen
[37:01.600 --> 37:07.840]  of england graciously though oh we love you new they won't have that british reporter on going
[37:07.840 --> 37:12.880]  they're probably having pea soup and something proper meal and again i'm not an anglophone
[37:12.880 --> 37:18.960]  ladies and gentlemen i love england love a lot of the culture it's amazing led with the magna
[37:18.960 --> 37:25.520]  card and the and the real renaissance worldwide so much has come out of the british isles but
[37:25.520 --> 37:32.080]  not the globalist and the transylvanian royal family perched like giant stinking vultures on
[37:32.080 --> 37:42.880]  the carcass of the uk but i'll tell you who who's into royalty scum narcissistic pimps
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.480]  that's why so many of the gangster hip hop mindless rappers will call themselves
[37:49.280 --> 37:57.760]  you know prince this king that the god this the god that king james all this arrogance
[38:00.400 --> 38:05.600]  and of course you'll find king james meeting with prince turdly or whatever his name is
[38:05.600 --> 38:15.680]  and don't worry obama has met with the prince oh the graciousness of it sorry i need to get into
[38:15.680 --> 38:24.880]  news here prince william and dot just dot just dot just kate
[38:24.880 --> 38:34.160]  it kickoff us trips with visit to white house you know almost anybody who's
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.600]  got a last name like gresham or a last name like jones or i mean there's a whole i mean i mean if
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.760]  you know somebody that's got a name like that a whole bunch of names has some connection back to
[38:45.760 --> 38:52.000]  royalty in england there's been a whole bunch of royal houses there uh there's been um of course the
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.600]  england sacksons and then the norman that took over and 1100 and all the subsequent things that
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.560]  happened but when you look at this group of people nothing against romanians or germans
[39:03.200 --> 39:11.360]  but they're not even british that's what's so frustrating that's what's so nauseating about it
[39:11.360 --> 39:18.080]  i mean at least the little bit of royalty i'm connected to you know got into the royal house by
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.880]  being in battles and chopping people's heads off and defending the king and stuff like that
[39:22.880 --> 39:28.880]  at least i can trace back my lineage to nobility in england but they all got there from killing
[39:28.880 --> 39:35.760]  people in battles not by being transylvanians of course the transylvanians got there because
[39:37.280 --> 39:43.200]  ended up leveraging all of europe to keep the muslim invasions down starting with vladi and
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.880]  paler so i guess they got there from violence as well but it's just it's just everyone's stepping
[39:48.880 --> 40:00.000]  and fetching to imbred mentally ill degenerate royalty makes me want to throw up absolutely
[40:00.000 --> 40:16.080]  totally disgusting on so many fronts and looking at the photos and videos of obama meets with prince
[40:16.080 --> 40:22.960]  william i mean who cares it's embarrassing i love all the people that have refused the
[40:22.960 --> 40:34.240]  knighthoods like steven hawking and so many others i think it's a badge of of being absolutely
[40:34.240 --> 40:40.240]  pathetic when you do that but don't worry lebron was honored to play before the royals these people
[40:40.240 --> 40:47.360]  think were so stupid and i'll tell you something being chumped and being into royalty because of
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.600]  all the made for tv shows and movies and when i'm at the grocery store at the checkout line there's
[40:51.600 --> 40:57.760]  almost always two or three magazines about the royals that women buy let me tell you my litmus
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.680]  test for a woman if she likes royal families and is in once the teacups and stuff other than a joke
[41:04.240 --> 41:11.200]  something's wrong with them but it's anglophile brainwashing that's gone on this country for
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.240]  a hundred years you know the thirst and how the third fake accent from gilligan's island that
[41:16.240 --> 41:25.680]  thirst and how i love it have some champagne that is the atlantic accent that's about 150 years old
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.520]  where the blue bloods that got their money from british industrialists mainly would go to classes
[41:32.240 --> 41:41.840]  to re-adopt a british american style atlantic accent to be accepted into british royal houses
[41:41.840 --> 41:46.480]  and they would end up having homes in london and living there half the time so there was a major
[41:46.480 --> 41:55.360]  recolonization of our republic with this british royalty anglophile crap i mean people get tired
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.520]  of israel trying to manipulate the internal activities the u.s and i don't like it and i
[41:59.520 --> 42:06.320]  criticize it but does anyone talk about the british colonization and i don't mean the british people
[42:06.320 --> 42:13.520]  of that thing that monarchy in the big banks of the city of london that owns much of our federal
[42:13.520 --> 42:20.160]  reserve you want to know who wrote obama care these people they want to run our lives they want to

[42:53.280 --> 42:56.560]  together for the nightly news tonight that'll air tomorrow on the radio show where we're going to
[42:56.560 --> 43:01.280]  show all the where he says he's the architect where obama says he's an architect where polosi says
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.680]  he's an architect where harry reid says he's an architect and then obama's saying he never
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.320]  was the architect didn't know him and then saying how he steals everything from him i mean we're
[43:10.320 --> 43:15.680]  going to really be able to show the fraud here because he they want to just give up and accept
[43:15.680 --> 43:19.200]  the fraud and go okay you've been lied to a thousand times why not a thousand times more no we're
[43:19.200 --> 43:25.360]  going to always celebrate your lies celebrate trampling you and showing how pathetic you are

[43:29.920 --> 43:37.280]  up that's who wins the fight who has the moral authority and who won't give up george washington
[43:37.280 --> 43:44.880]  for seven years lost almost every battle but wouldn't give up and won the war perseverance is power
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.040]  never giving in having will setting your will against the globalist if you just spiritually

[43:57.760 --> 44:02.480]  just like that it's a free will decision you want to know how to fight tyranny ask god
[44:04.160 --> 44:07.440]  you want to know how to stand up and how to reclaim your life and your children
[44:07.440 --> 44:13.680]  ask god say i'm willing to do whatever you direct me to do i turn myself over to you via free will

[44:18.960 --> 44:24.880]  to accept it by increment not the god of the universe you've got to you've got to want it
[44:26.400 --> 44:34.960]  now let's go to gruber the arrogant sycophant the harvard you know it's tactician now at MIT
[44:34.960 --> 44:40.240]  who bragged that i met behind closed doors and they said we can't let the public know it increases
[44:40.240 --> 44:47.280]  prices and impenalizes healthy people and so what we did was is we deceived them and then he adopted
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.680]  my plan and the other academics look at him nodding approvingly oh the technology of lying
[44:53.680 --> 45:01.200]  and being disreputable and now they replace old lies with new as the gruber denies that he's an
[45:01.200 --> 45:08.800]  architect and apologizes for his hateful arrogance endangering the foreign banks attempt to finally
[45:08.800 --> 45:14.640]  break america's back here it is i did not draft governor romney's health plan and i was not the
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.840]  architect president obama's healthcare if he later got indicted by a grand jury which he may be for
[45:19.840 --> 45:25.520]  fraud they'll say oh i'm not the architect i did not draft it and it'll come out that there were
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.880]  a bunch of lawyers like like thomas jefferson drafted the the the constitution and the declaration
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.640]  of independence of the bill of rights but by drafted they had a bunch of people there together
[45:34.640 --> 45:41.440]  he came up with it after they agreed on the basic architecture so you know we don't know who the
[45:41.440 --> 45:48.800]  thomas jefferson was of this monstrosity but gruber came up with a bunch of the key fake
[45:48.800 --> 45:55.200]  numbers for congress and how to screw job people and he bragged about it so see that's his lawyer
[45:55.200 --> 46:00.800]  speak right there let's go back to the start and here uh and if you're a radio listener you got to
[46:00.800 --> 46:05.920]  see how he looks go to info wars dot com four plus show to see the little weasel uh they're falling
[46:05.920 --> 46:13.600]  on his sword for bragging in front of the slaves here it is i did not draft governor romney's health
[46:13.600 --> 46:20.480]  plan and i was not the architect of president obama's healthcare plan after the passage of the aca
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.640]  i made a series of speeches endeavoring to explain the law's implications for the u.s health care
[46:24.640 --> 46:30.000]  system from the perspective of a trained economist that's impossible he gave speeches a democrat
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.640]  policy wonks and professors on how to declare war and engage in deception and fraud you are a general
[46:39.280 --> 46:47.200]  teaching the the phd students and the other professors how to better mob rape america
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.440]  and screw over poor people let's just aside for what you just said you little piece of garbage
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.600]  let's go back to him over the past few weeks a number of videos have emerged from these appearances
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.920]  and excerpts of these videos i'm showing making a series of glib thoughtless and sometimes downright
[47:01.920 --> 47:08.640]  insulting comments let's hit pause they weren't glib they weren't thoughtless you were bragging
[47:08.640 --> 47:15.200]  about how you ran a major campaign against america and successfully shoved a dagger right in our main
[47:15.200 --> 47:22.000]  aorta and now they want to fully yank it through and terminate us for good we're trying to pull the
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.720]  knife out and get that aorta sutured and we're using your evil as a way to get the energy to
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.120]  pull the knife back out and to get in there and you're they're fighting them no don't pull it out
[47:33.120 --> 47:39.760]  drag it down through finish the job what did you do grover we almost had him chain down you torture
[47:39.760 --> 47:45.440]  the enemy once they're chained down grover don't brag until we've got them till we've got their guns
[47:45.440 --> 47:53.040]  grover then we celebrate let's go back to him i apologize for the first these videos earlier
[47:53.600 --> 47:57.440]  but the ongoing attention paid to these videos has made me realize that a fuller accounting is
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.360]  necessary i'd like to begin by apologizing sincerely for the offending comments that i've made
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.040]  in some cases i made uninformed and glib comments about the political process behind health care
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.440]  reform that his wife behind him i'm not an expert on politics and my totem plot i was which is wrong
[48:15.440 --> 48:19.440]  in other cases i simply made mean and insulting comments which are uncalled for in any context
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.920]  i sincerely apologize for conjecturing with the tone of expertise and for doing so in such a
[48:25.920 --> 48:31.120]  disparaging fashion it's never appropriate to make oneself seem more important or smarter
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.880]  by doing that's a favorite word of weasels i knew better i know better i'm embarrassed and i'm sorry
[48:36.880 --> 48:42.240]  oh that's enough that's enough uh let's play a clip of obama talking about how wonderful groober
[48:42.240 --> 48:48.080]  is and how he has liberally taken from him let's go to that clip you've already drawn some of the
[48:48.080 --> 48:56.000]  brightest minds from academia and policy circles many of them i've stolen ideas from liberally
[48:57.040 --> 49:04.480]  people ranging from robert gordon to austin ghoulsby john grover my dear friend jim wallis here
[49:04.480 --> 49:11.040]  who can talk i think who can inform what are sometimes dry policy debates with a prophetic voice
[49:12.480 --> 49:16.160]  all right let's go to the really powerful ones coming up but groober the critics
[49:16.800 --> 49:23.520]  i spoke against my expertise no you bragged about in all these closed door meetings with the president
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.480]  deciding how to deceive people and you wrote a report to congress so that you think by the
[49:28.480 --> 49:33.520]  way weasel do you really think you deceived a bunch of lawyers in congress they needed you to write
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.440]  the fraudulent report so they could lie to their constituents and act like they didn't know
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.000]  you really think you deceived that pack of devils in congress you little moron
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.480]  let's go you fool you weren't dumb enough to write the fraudulent report for them so they could play

[56:46.560 --> 56:50.960]  him being grilled this morning mr gruber that you believe that your statements were inexcusable
[56:50.960 --> 56:56.160]  insulting but they do appear to be true you're not here recanting today your statements with
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.960]  respect to the tax aspect of obamacare are you i'm here today to say that any conjectures i made
[57:02.960 --> 57:08.080]  about political this is not a conjecture mr gruber i mean conjecture is i believe it may have been
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.840]  someone may have been thinking perhaps they were perhaps it was this is your straight up statements
[57:13.840 --> 57:22.560]  these are not conjecture is it your purpose today to recant obamacare as a tax it is my purpose
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.040]  today to come forward and elaborate and straighten out the interpretation of a series of comments
[57:29.040 --> 57:34.080]  that i made into apologize excellent let's do that then let's clarify it mr gruber you made these
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.360]  statements did you not if i don't recall exactly but you don't recall now one of them we actually
[57:39.360 --> 57:45.440]  saw in video do you recall that one yeah right okay well these statements will enter them for the
[57:45.440 --> 57:49.840]  record and i can't imagine how you don't recall your own statements because the american voter
[57:49.840 --> 57:54.240]  has seen them over and over again as you've called them stupid do you deny making these
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.800]  statements mr gruber even though you don't recall them do you deny calling obamacare a tax
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.520]  if you're reading my actual quotes then i don't deny it i don't have i am reading your actual
[58:03.520 --> 58:10.560]  quotes then i don't deny it okay so you're not here to recant it or deny it i'm here to explain
[58:10.560 --> 58:15.840]  that a number of those comments were made in a tone of expertise that i don't have when i was
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.480]  talking about mr gruber do you know what a tax is i mean you do have you know expertise and
[58:20.480 --> 58:26.480]  economics do you know what a tax is yes okay so you would not deny today that in these statements

[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:08.080]  trends forecaster in the second hour right now let's go back to some more of this clip from just
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.240]  earlier today with jonathan gruber let's just start this at the beginning because it's it's
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:21.920]  pretty powerful uh doesn't recall his statements here it is statements were inexcusable insulting
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.040]  but they do appear to be true you're not here recanting today your statements with respect
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:33.920]  to the tax aspect of obamacare are you i'm here today to say that any conjectures i made about
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.560]  political this is not a conjecture mr gruber i mean conjecture is i believe it may have been
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.320]  someone may have been thinking perhaps they were perhaps it was this is your straight up statements
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:53.040]  these are not conjecture is it your purpose today to recant obamacare as a tax it is my purpose
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.520]  today to come forward and elaborate and straighten out the interpretation of a series of comments
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.560]  that i made into apologize excellent let's do that then let's clarify it mr gruber you made these
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.840]  statements did you not if i don't recall exactly but you don't recall now one of them we actually
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.920]  saw in video do you recall that one yeah right okay well these statements will enter them for the
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.320]  record and i can't imagine how you don't recall your own statements because the american voter
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.720]  has seen them over and over again as you've called them stupid do you deny making these
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.280]  statements mr gruber even though you don't recall them do you deny calling obamacare a tax
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  if you're reading my actual quotes then i don't deny it i don't have i am reading your actual
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.040]  quotes that i don't deny it okay so you're not here to recant it or deny it i'm here to explain
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.320]  that a number of those comments were made in a tone of expertise that i don't have when i was
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.960]  talking about mr gruber do you know what a tax is i mean you do have you know expertise and
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.960]  economics do you know what a tax is yes okay so you would not deny today that in these statements
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:02.480]  that you made that obamacare is a tax would you obamacare is a large piece of legislation with
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:09.200]  many parts and is one of those parts of tax mr gruber there there are some taxes in obamacare
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.080]  well the president as you know argued that obamacare was not a tax until it went before the
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:19.680]  us supreme court as to whether or not obamacare was a tax and then the administration argued that
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.200]  it is a tax in order to be able to save it from being declared unconstitutional so i would assume
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.440]  that you agree with the us supreme court that obamacare provisions include taxes right the us
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.080]  supreme court ruled on a particular provision of obamacare you do not disagree with them do you
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.480]  i'm sorry it's that you don't disagree with them that that there are elements of obamacare that
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.120]  constitute tax i don't agree with their conclusion about the mandate
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.480]  excellent interesting um different than what you you said at these hearings but now i have a question
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.920]  for you that i i'd like you to to think back you said i mean this bill was written in a tortured
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:02.160]  way to make sure cbo did not score the individual mandate as taxes did you ever speak to anyone
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.960]  in the administration who acknowledged that to you or to explain that to you or who assigned a
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.480]  problem with you with the construct with the construct of that we have to draft this in a
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:17.360]  torture way so that we make sure cbo did not score the individual mandate as taxes and you are
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.360]  under oath mr gerber did anybody in the administration have that conversation with you that was an
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.760]  inexcusable term used by i'm not asking you about how you believe that whether or not you should have
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.080]  said that or not it's a factual statement you're making did anybody in the administration ever
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.120]  have that conversation with you i do not recall anyone using the word tortured no did they ask
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.960]  did they have the conversation with you that it had to be drafted in a way that the cbo did
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.880]  not score the individual mandate as taxes anyone in the administration acknowledge it explain it
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.760]  or assign aspects to you within that construct i don't you're under oath i honestly do not recall
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:57.200]  he does not honestly recall bragging everywhere that he helped come up with the fraud see there

[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.080]  meeting with stupid prince william and his duchess duchess kate kicking off their tour
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.080]  meeting with obama that's what edward bernays who wrote the book propaganda the nephew of
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.920]  sygman freud who worked for the department of war and had the name changed the department of defense
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.800]  he's the reason you eat bacon with eggs in the morning he's the guy that convinced women that
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.160]  smoking cigarettes would be cool and rebel against their man and he's the guy that has affected our
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:17.840]  lives probably more than anybody else in modern history and he talked about mixing politics with
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:24.560]  hollywood and the stage back in the 20s and 30s and they've done that successfully and then hollywood
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:31.600]  can sell the agenda that the family's bad that strong men are bad that freedoms bad that defending
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:38.640]  yourself is bad they can sell this anti-human agenda so that we just stand down and become slaves
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.880]  now i wanted to get alex newman on because he's an international journalist educator author
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:50.240]  and consultant uh he writes for the new american magazine and world net daily and the website is
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.800]  the new american dot com i've gone over the different permutations of the un treaty i remember
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:04.160]  their small arms treaty they try to get ratified by the u.s in 2001 the july 7th copy said quote
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.360]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.360]  now that's a very true statement except for one word legitimate civilian ownership of firearms
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:23.760]  threatens the power monopoly of the state that's a true statement not civilian ownership of firearms
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:31.600]  threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state mouse a tongue said that political power
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:40.400]  political power grows out of the barrel of a gun and the chinese historians believe he killed 84
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.280]  million people the cia says it's 66 million the cia and i'd always heard this from the folks of
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.360]  the john bursa side of the new american and whistleblowers and their business group some congressional
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:58.240]  testimony but it was classified 15 years ago and has even been on history channel that the cia did
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:05.680]  send rifles with no firing pins or bolts to shan kai shek and the nationalist that they did secretly
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:12.160]  arm mouse a tongue and there was even a faction of u.s government people there from army intelligence
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:18.560]  and others that they helped people like john birch who they killed tortured and killed that's what's
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.160]  called number society roll up and put the communist in charge and david rockefeller wrote his famous
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:33.200]  op-ed when i think it was 76 or 77 when mal died praising what he did he killed about triple what
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.520]  hitler did and about double what stalin did greatest mass murderers in history mouse a tongue
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:47.040]  joe stalin vi lennon adolf hitler has fourth place ladies and gentlemen fourth place
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:55.760]  fourth place and they praise him and the and the guys just found the op-ed piece
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.360]  from the new york times was my history right that it was 76 i forget what year was 77 we can
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:08.080]  put that back on screen that new york times from a china traveler david rockefeller
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.480]  and if you blow it up it'll save the day but the point is david rockefeller went in before
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.240]  nixon made his deal with china publicly and set all this up to leverage planetary government
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.720]  between china and the us to bring in this new system and now with the trans specific partnership
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.480]  and with all these treaties and obama saying he'll sign and implement treaties outside of congress
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:41.600]  ratifying them open borders that's part of the un treaty in esco the transfer that the trans texas
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.040]  corridor is part of the north american union integration by stealth plan all of this is
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.560]  happening and we see obama trying to ban the importation of guns and ammo citing un policy
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:59.600]  and previous treaties so joining us to discuss the attack on the second amendment is alex newman
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.040]  then at the bottom of the hour specifically a discussion of the un now i want to explain
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.200]  some people always say get us out of the un get rid of the un it's the problem it is the problem
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:16.000]  but robber barons in our country in europe and in china and in the u k created it the
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.120]  rockefellers gave the land in new york they financed it and more than a hundred other
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.080]  globalist organizations to bring in this planetary corporate government where the ultra rich are
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.200]  above the law and i've read this quote twice today from gary allen journalist gary allen who
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:38.160]  wrote an undare call a conspiracy if one understands that socialism is not a share the wealth program
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.760]  but is in reality a method to consolidate and control the wealth then the seeming paradox
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:51.280]  of super rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all and his son has joined the dark
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:14:00.960]  side and runs and founded politico just like ron paul knew and i guess could call him friends
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.760]  alan greenspan in the 70s when he wrote books and libertarian books published like three of them
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:15.440]  that i've read personally and assays about the federal reserve the new world order world government
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.360]  planetary regime how gold standard or silver standard was the answer and they went and hired
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:30.240]  alan greenspan see a lot of folks end up deciding to kneel to emper palpatine to use that allegory
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:40.960]  rise you are now being known as goth veta let's go ahead and go to alex newman joining us alex i
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.640]  tell you they are really bold they're moving fast right now let's break down exactly what's in this
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:53.760]  treaty because uh there's a new congressional report out today uh where the feds are in emails
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.720]  admitting they're shutting down gun shops by ordering banks not to let them have bank accounts
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.920]  and they're shutting down major gun websites even have accessories outside of law isn't that
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:10.080]  like the nazis throwing stuff through jewish shopkeepers windows and outside of law not letting
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.840]  them have businesses you know you're absolutely right that the attack on gun rights is coming now
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.080]  fast and furious uh it's it's been uh accelerating recently and the united nations now is at the
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.960]  point where they're just brazenly uh and openly saying that you know our gun rights our second
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.960]  amendment is a human rights violation we need to get rid of self defense we need to get rid of
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.800]  stand your ground uh and most recently after Ferguson and after the police shot that 12-year-old boy
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.680]  they again attacked gun rights so that's four or five times in the last year or so and they're
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.560]  just getting so so brazen about it now that they're you know putting out press releases
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.960]  attacking our gun rights and the obama administration of course is fully on board with this um
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:57.120]  um so the attack on gun rights is becoming very brazen uh you know now the un is pushing
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.520]  for expanded background checks under the guise of human rights uh and you know that's so extreme
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.200]  that even the democrats couldn't get it through the senate when the democrats control the senate
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.440]  so that should give people a hint about how extreme these un positions are uh but you know
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.600]  it's far for the course for the un day just a few years ago they were helping the government
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:20.160]  down in venezuela disarmed citizens there the law-abiding citizens of course uh the government
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:26.960]  gets keep its monopoly on on power and it's just in my opinion it's unbelievable that we're at a
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.400]  point now where the un feels like they can openly attack our gun rights as a human rights violation
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.480]  and get away with it and it's only because the obama administration it's so anti-gun
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.920]  i think that this is uh able to proceed so openly like this but it's it's becoming brazen they have
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.760]  the arms trade treaty coming into effect on december 24th um like you said obama is talking
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:53.200]  about implementing these un treaties without even getting approval from the senate uh as is required
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.040]  and the senate has as you know the senate the senate has had to threaten obama that he better
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.640]  not try that but then they never fall through when he does what he wants the un has criticized obama
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.080]  for not opening the borders up enough meanwhile they don't criticize north korea they don't
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:16.000]  criticize communist china they don't criticize china uh selling and trafficking in human organs
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.840]  they only criticize countries that have free market economics yeah that's right and i'm
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.240]  actually doing a big report on this right now for the printed version of the magazine uh i mean
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.000]  this entire human rights bureaucracy at the un uh is beyond a sick joke i mean you have communist
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.040]  dictators on there the regime in china sits on the human rights council the regime in saudi
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.840]  arabia that beheads people for converting to christianity uh the the cuban regime that's
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.000]  enslaving the people of cuba uh so these are the human rights people that are now lecturing the
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.880]  united states uh but she said something before that i think is right on the money uh you know the
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.280]  un would not be able to get away with this stuff if the globalists in our country and the globalists
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.400]  in europe were not fully behind the entire thing i mean we could just laugh off the un as a ridiculous
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.480]  joke uh if it wasn't for the fact that we have the obama administration and the globalists behind
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040]  him and the council on foreign relations uh empowering i call it the dictators club a lot
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.480]  of people call it the dictators club and that's an accurate description of what we're talking about
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.480]  here uh you know just in bob way su dan mass murdering regimes uh can can sit on the human
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:24.960]  rights council gadoffy chaired the human rights commission in 2006 so we have here an outfit
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.840]  that literally should be ridiculed by the entire world and you're exactly right rather than attacking
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.320]  countries that actually do have human rights violations they put the worst human rights
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.600]  violators on the human rights council and then have them attack the united states for our actual
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.960]  rights like our gun rights and our self defense rights and our rights to free speech they want
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.640]  hate speech laws uh so it would be a cruel and ridiculous joke except for the fact that our
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:55.280]  globalists here in the united states and in europe are fully behind this organization i'm no fan of
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.880]  the police state i'm known for being the guy that criticizes it is trying to stop it but it
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.160]  doesn't mean i'm against the individual police themselves we can see classic communist liberation
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.560]  theology with the democratic party and others trying to have class warfare now between the general
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:16.720]  public and the police i mean this is so transparent yeah that's exactly what's going on alex i'm so
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.240]  glad you mentioned that uh you know they're trying to stir up any tensions and any hatred that they can
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.080]  just keep the public distracted from the real criminals uh you know have the police and the
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.840]  citizens at war with each other the blacks and the whites at war with each other the rich and the
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:35.680]  poor the men and the women any kind of division arbitrary ridiculous whatever zealots exploited
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.320]  as long as it keeps the attention off of them and off that's right because the globalists are an
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.440]  enemy alien operation and what would an enemy do it would divide the people so it could take them
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.480]  over alex neumann let's look at this treaty and the fight that's coming up in the house and in the

[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:24.640]  wars dot com alex shones billboards in florida and arkansas and texas and new jersey and in
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.920]  missouri just all over and radio stations have bought us billboards and citizens have done it
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.760]  here and there it's happened probably hundreds of times but whoever's doing this has done a whole
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.520]  bunch of them and i had a caller last week who told us who it was and then i asked them to give
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:45.360]  the number and i don't think it got followed or happened so i want to discover who you are if you
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.280]  want to be known and have you on the show and talk about it because i think it's an example of what
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:55.680]  other people could step up and do especially if there's a local m or f m in the area to tell
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:00.080]  folks to also tune into that station this is just another great way to get the word out
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.760]  because if you come listen to the show you will find out exactly what's going on
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:17.120]  very exciting so we salute whoever's doing it email us contact us who who is the mysterious
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:24.320]  info warrior posting billboards nationwide info wars billboards mysteriously appear on america's
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.800]  interstates and i'm told they're all over the place commenters are going yeah i'm in new york
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:37.760]  yeah i'm in illinois yeah and it's the same one it's a good looking billboard and if more citizens
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:44.160]  stepped up and did that it could be a huge effect a huge effect i'm gonna now move back to our guest
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:51.680]  but that's what this broadcast is is a watchman on the wall a watch woman on the wall telling you
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.840]  what's going on and even if i'm bombastic sometimes fine i got all these great reporters
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.000]  all these great guests all these other researchers it's about the information i'm just here blowing
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  the trumpet sometimes i don't like the way it sounds but i'm raising the alarm we need you
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.320]  to raise the alarm we have the power to change things one arrogant case like gruber calling
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.640]  us dumb fools and how they ripped us off could bring them down and these people can't change
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:25.360]  their spots they keep acting arrogant alex i think that's a big part of the reason i'm confident
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.280]  is history shows tyrants and their minions love to brag they always go too far they never
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.400]  stop pushing they think they're going to hide their world government but it's so big it's so
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.480]  out in the open now they don't laugh at us when we talk about the federal reserve being private
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.200]  they don't laugh at us when we talk about world government when mainstream media criticizes me
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.080]  they don't even say he's nuts and thinks there's a plan for world government they say he criticizes
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:57.120]  the move to world government i mean we've come so far since the days that mr welch founded the
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.720]  group that has your magazine talk about where you see the world right now that i want to come back
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.360]  and drill into the treaty itself and take phone calls the toll free number to join us specifically
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:17.440]  on the un and on this treaty is 800 259 92 31 we're discussing the stealth but also extra judicial
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.800]  move to take our guns 888 253 3139 this is only a few minutes left in the short segment alex
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.480]  what do you think the real state of the world is right now uh you know i think thanks to patriots
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.040]  like you and you're doing a really great service to humanity alex a lot of people have woken up
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.720]  because of the work that you're doing uh but you know with what you're doing and what the whole
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.840]  alternative media is doing uh it's shifted the debate and the globalists know this uh i don't
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.800]  know that they're scared yet but they realize that people are waking up right and left every day
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.520]  that's why we see the drive to censor the internet and you know to pass hate speech laws to censor
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:58.560]  the truth and censor criticism of the political class uh so i think they're nervous i think they
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.960]  realize that humanity is waking up um and you know as we get closer to this criminal world
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.400]  government that they're trying to set up it's going to become more and more obvious to more
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.160]  and more people it's going to step on people's toes it's going to force people to come out of
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.720]  their high their comfort zone you know tune out the football for a little bit and realize that
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.440]  what's happening here is serious and it's going to affect every one of us so i think the globalists
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.080]  realize this and i think the patriots realize this now uh you know it's it's a race against time but
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:31.440]  with god on our side i i'm very confident that the globalists can be uh at least it defeated and held
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.240]  back uh for a significant amount of time uh and you know they think they're they're moving into their
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.280]  new world order they call it the new world order they think it's coming soon but uh i beg to differ
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:48.320]  let's try to planetary corporate anti-free market anti-human total surveillance grid cutting off our
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:55.760]  resources i mean this is total enslavement everyone should take it personal and should make it one
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.800]  of the main focuses of their lives to study it to know we're telling the truth and then to move
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.120]  against it but people always want some silver bullet alex that's going to fix it all overnight
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:10.080]  there is no silver bullet it is resisting it speaking out against it and withdrawing our consent
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.800]  that's right and you know what you do alex is exactly what people need to be doing get
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.600]  information out there get the truth out there educate your community educate the electorate
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.040]  that's how we're going to get good politicians in office that's how we're going to restore the
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.920]  constitution and that's how we're going to bring justice to criminals who want to take our guns for
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.560]  example or build a criminal world government so we need awareness we need education and you're

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.520]  tend to downgrade using my memory for some reason i'm very inaccurate almost always
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:07.680]  downgrading things as folks have actually tracked and looked into what i say it's not on purpose
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:14.720]  it's just that it's 120 capsules suggested you start by taking four capsules with an eight ounce
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.640]  glass of water on an empty stomach before going to bed if you do not achieve three to five movements
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:27.040]  the following day increase your serving the two capsules each night until three to five are achieved
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.680]  each day continue in this quantity for six consecutive days rob do didn't have that
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.720]  big of an effect at four he's a big guy like six foot three he went to seven capsules and it was
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:48.800]  spectacular okay i'm going to shut up now for best results add the juice of one half
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.160]  lemon preferably organic to your water when taking the capsules drink plenty of water during the day

[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:18.240]  and it supports the transmission all right i'm going to shut up now and give uh alex newman
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.880]  of the new american magazine dot com the floor to talk about the treaty uh the trans specific
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.040]  partnership and why he thinks they're moving on so many fronts right now then we're going to go
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.080]  to chad jim kevin nate leon and others that are patiently holding uh again the new american dot
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:42.480]  com alex you've got the floor basically there's a number of really important treaties that are
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.800]  moving through the process right now that people need to be aware of each of them impringes on our
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:53.440]  sovereignty and on our in on our in the alienable god given rights uh i think the arms trade treaty
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.240]  is one of the most important uh article two right there basically defines for us that citizens do
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.600]  not have a right to own guns or ammunition or any type of self-defense weapon uh that's listed in
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  there article three deals with ammunition um and initially at least the treaty mandates the
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.920]  national government's form of registry with the eventual goal of confiscation because as the treaty
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:20.800]  explains uh the idea is that only authorized state parties uh should have access to firearms and
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.760]  and weaponry uh now when people think of authorized state parties i want them to think of you know
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.440]  mugabians and bobway uh chairman mao you were talking about before you know mass murders uh
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.720]  the sudans omara basher uh you know genocidal guy killed a bunch of people in darfur so these
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.440]  are the authorized state parties that we're talking about kim jong-un in north korea fidel castron
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:48.080]  raul castron cuba uh these are the people that the un thinks deserve to have guns and us citizens
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.880]  we don't get any guns and the un has made that clear for a long time uh they like i said before
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.760]  they recently helped that disarm the people of venezuela uh who are as you as your listeners
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.000]  probably know living under a regime that also does not really respect uh freedom and human
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.360]  rights and god given rights so the arms trade treaty that's a big one the un says it's going
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.960]  to go into effect on december 24th uh of course the senate has not ratified it but obama is always
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:17.440]  esteeming to implement at least parts of it without ratification uh then we have of course
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:23.040]  a trans specific partnership uh which is an idea to merge the united states further into these
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.840]  regional building blocks of the new world order this one involves the communist dictatorship
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:32.400]  in vietnam for example uh and presumably it would eventually expand to include others
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.640]  then they're trying to merge the united states with the european union through the transatlantic
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.560]  trade and investment partnership uh you know the people who know anything about the european
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.400]  union should instantly realize why that's a terrible idea uh all of these so-called free trade
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:51.040]  agreements uh one of the things that they do is set up international tried unals that can
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:55.440]  overrule state law that can overrule federal law so basically we lose our right to govern
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.880]  ourselves we'll be governed by unaccountable international bureaucracies uh and you know
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.080]  these have nothing to do with trade i'm not opposed to free trade i think free trade is a
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.440]  good thing but we're not talking about free trade here we're talking about managed trade
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.760]  thousands of pages of regulations and international bureaucracy we're talking about government
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.960]  and that's how they set up the eu was calling it a free trade uh commonwealth that's exactly
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.320]  right and we have you know the north american free trade agreement the european union started
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.080]  with the european free trade agreement so they thought they were going to build the north american
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.520]  union here uh robert pastor the founding father of that idea uh he credited the john burt society
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:35.360]  with killing the plan but as the cfr made clear uh even recently this year uh they still have plans
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.920]  for uh you know this big north american superblock that would basically usurp the sovereignty and
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.240]  the liberties of the people of the united states and mexico and canada uh but one thing i want to
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.560]  mention about all these treaties that all sounds like gloom and doom uh one thing that needs to
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.920]  become more widely known uh treaties are not in and of themselves it's a supreme law of the land
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.000]  there's this misconception promoted by the government and by the un that you know the
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.320]  us government signs a treaty the senate ratifies it suddenly whatever it says in that treaty is
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.720]  the law of the land that's just simply not the case uh thomas jefferson you know the author of
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.040]  the declaration of independence one of the most important founding fathers uh he made that absolutely
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:16.320]  clear in his letters and his writings uh treaties do not supersede the constitution they do not grant
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.880]  any new powers to the federal government that weren't granted by the constitution and the supreme
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.920]  court has agreed with this interpretation as recently as 57 in uh read versus covert they
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.200]  said the federal government cannot assume any new powers just by signing a treaty so uh i mean
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.800]  that's really one of the big stumbling blocks here for the globalists they have to literally
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.840]  distort what the constitution says to uh to pretend like all these treaties reporting to grant the
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.920]  federal government and the un all this power are legitimate they're not legitimate they're simply not
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.880]  legitimate doesn't matter if the senate ratifies them the federal government cannot expand its powers
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.760]  with a treaty the supreme court has said so the founding fathers said so the constitution says so
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.480]  and it's very clear so if we can expose the truth and the facts and the globalists um
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.680]  you know i see uh clear skies ahead we can do a lot of good things but it's going to require
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.480]  effort from everybody to educate their legislators educate their congressmen educate their city
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:14.000]  council educate their communities about these facts so that we can avoid the future that these
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.880]  you know maniacs is a good way to call them have planned for us well you're right the constitutional
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:26.560]  scholars are legion on the fact that a treaty does not trump uh a domestic law but regardless of
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.320]  that obama is saying he will order agencies to follow treaties even if congress doesn't ratify
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.440]  let me ask you this question what do you make of mitch mcconnell's and uh john bainer and others
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.400]  refusing to repeal obama care refusing to go after him refusing to impeach him uh refusing to
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.720]  shut down the government to force him uh to not have executive amnesty i mean this really shows us
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.200]  that the globalists are controlling the leadership of both parties uh you got a lot of great grassroots
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.400]  people that just came into office i don't know how they think they're going to get away with this
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:07.280]  and having people like jonathan gruber traipsing around admitting it's a you know way to socially
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.560]  engineer and raise taxes uh and then his own party running from him but still defending the
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.040]  legislation we have to come to grips with the fact that we really are dealing with a group of criminals
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.720]  mm-hmm and you know no doubt the leadership of the gop is controlled by neocons and globalists
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.440]  same council on foreign relations that controls the obama administration and the un uh and that's
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.280]  obvious just by their fruits you know by their fruits you shall know them we can look very clearly
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.760]  at congress they just got a huge republican majority and that they're relying on the ignorance
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:41.280]  of the american people and on republican voters in particular to not understand that they have
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:45.840]  the complete and total power to stop any of this all they have to do is refuse to provide funding
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.240]  for it all funding has come from the house of representatives if the house does not approve
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.520]  funding for obama's imperial decrees for the un climate they're not even calling it a treaty now
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.000]  because obama knows you won't get it ratified but they can deny funds for any of this and all
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.560]  of all do is kick and scream so they're relying on our ignorance to get away with this kind of
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.560]  stuff but if we can educate the american people show them that you know the house has the power
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.680]  to cut the funding for any of this the whole charade crumbles and i hope that you know a lot
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:18.000]  of these new grass roots republicans that got elected i hope that's right go down well that's
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.400]  why congress keeps playing dumb like we didn't know uh the groober's plan to us was a lie we
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:28.880]  didn't know well now they know it's a screw job they need to repeal it let's play this clip of
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:35.920]  elijah comings savaging groober comings is really good at acting like he doesn't know that he supports
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.080]  stuff that is basically double black unemployment in maryland here's the clip
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:50.000]  and then we're going to groober for stupid i mean absolutely stupid comments he made
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:47:01.680]  over the past few years and then drill and grill administrator taverner about what appears to be
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:11.120]  an inadvertent mistake in reporting aca enrollment numbers this may be good political theater
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:19.600]  but it will not help a single american get health insurance it will not help a single
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:26.640]  person get well it will not help a single person get the care that they need doesn't
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:32.000]  i talk to you like you're five years maybe clear i'm extremely frustrated with dr groober's
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.280]  statements your screwed jobs getting exposed they were irresponsible
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.280]  incredibly disrespectful well for telling the truth about what you're involved in and did not
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:47.840]  reflect reality and they were indeed insulting i was in congress when this law was debated
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:54.320]  and dr groober does not speak for me or the or the chairman of the other committees who work
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.080]  tirelessly or the 12 000 pages of changes that you debated this legislation for nearly a year
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.960]  you debated it was finally passed and signed by the president did you read any of it we held 79
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:12.480]  hearings and markups in the house of propaganda and baloney never once did i believe
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.360]  or did anyone suggest that we were somehow hiding our goals from the american people
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.720]  yeah you don't want our guns but first of all dr groober's statements gave republicans a public
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:33.280]  relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down the aca eliminate health
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.840]  republicans self-righted american republican leadership many republicans now allege you mean
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:43.360]  good republicans some kind of democratic conspiracy citing the praise for dr groober's work from
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:49.600]  president obama and other democrats but that too is completely wrong let me highlight some additional
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:55.360]  praise dr groober received for his work dr groober received the following thanks for his
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.520]  contributions to health care legislation and i quote jonathan groover at mit devoted hours and
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:08.640]  hours to an essential economic model let's not play any more of these lies what do you make of
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.680]  this type of arrogance and humorous then we're going to skip this network break and go to phone
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.600]  calls you know i i think it's symptomatic of everything that's going on in washington dc it's
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.880]  constant it's all about deceiving the stupid voters as groober put it if they couldn't deceive the
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.600]  stupid voters they couldn't get away with this kind of arrogant crimes free hence common court
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.560]  it is it you know it's it's all across the board if you look at education health care
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.400]  all of it relies on deceiving voters who they think are stupid and you know that makes our job
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.240]  very clear we need to educate the electorate and get these people out of office so that they'll
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.520]  stop destroying our country stop trampling on our rights and stop selling us out to organizations
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:51.440]  like the united nations that are being used to take our guns to fringe on freedom around the
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:56.960]  world is that simple well they're just mafias that come in and hijack free economies cut them up
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:02.480]  divide them up and then have a new scam to fix all the problems they've created before and comings
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:06.960]  knows full well what he's done everybody knows what's in that bill up there in congress and and
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.840]  see now they're like the republicans want to get rid of what we've got no no bainer and and mcconnell
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:17.680]  don't see because when it all comes out that they're together on it then they lose the democrats
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.800]  the only reason the democrats are supported is because they think the republicans want to take
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.440]  their free goodie away and they've you know they've had an imaginary victory that's why you checkmate
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:31.120]  them when you actually bring out its bipartisan screw job jim in missouri thanks for holding
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.480]  you're on the air worldwide hey thanks uh mr newan i'd like to direct this question you're
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:41.440]  got a couple points i'd like to make first of all you know i believe that the local law enforcement
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:48.000]  is the biggest hurdle the government has in gun confiscation but i'm wondering if uh the obama
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.400]  administration will use these latest uh cases of police brutality oh yeah they're trying to start a
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:00.400]  civil war and so the un can come in and demand that the citizens and local police are disarmed
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:08.640]  that's in the un original unidire treaties and state apartment random 7277 is to disarm the people
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:14.960]  then the police then the federal police and only have un peacekeepers a monopoly of power by the
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:20.240]  world government sorry call her go ahead well i just you know i see we keep seeing these uh
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:24.240]  these police brutality cases in the government the obama administration especially jumps on
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.960]  these things and and whether they're true police brutality or whether they're not they're they're
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:34.000]  criticizing the local law enforcement and i just i just see this as a way for the obama
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.680]  administration to uh turn the people against local law enforcement to help them further
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:44.800]  federalize uh the the local law enforcement uh to be able to do whatever they want you know i
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.560]  believe that that local law enforcement is one main thing standing in the way of gun control
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.640]  because we've got a lot of sheriffs and police department has a lot of force it but if the
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.560]  federal government has federalized local law enforcement then they can do whatever they
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.280]  want and that's it that's it don't you just what you said is a hundred percent true alex any comments
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:08.080]  on that yeah you know uh we've been running for decades at the campaign support your local police
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.880]  and keep them independent uh and it's for exactly this reason you know local law enforcement is not
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.600]  the enemy obviously there's you know some bad apples whatever you want to call them and then
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.480]  you find that all across society it's not unique police department the biggest problem is the the
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.680]  federal control over local law enforcement the militarization of law enforcement that's being
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:32.720]  carried out from washington dc uh so really the source of these problems tracks back to the
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.960]  unconstitutional machinations by the federal government and then you have people like obama
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:42.080]  who have been showering military equipment on local police stepping in and saying oh look police
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:47.120]  militarization so there's a very sinister agenda here uh the un is exploiting the same thing they're
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:51.680]  trying to demonize local law enforcement here in the united states as you know some kind of
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.480]  gung ho racist lunatic wackos and that's just not the case the local law enforcement that's our
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:01.280]  friends that's our neighbors uh they're part of our communities and the globalists and obama
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.560]  and all of these they understand that this is one of the big hurdles to implementing their agenda
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.880]  well there's certainly some rotten areas in the country but but when the globalist
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:17.920]  weaponized media is attacking local police 24 7 and hollywoods involves you know it's bad i mean
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:22.960]  it's a no-brainer when the enemy's doing something i can intellectually track why it's bad like
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:30.720]  uh jim just said like you just said but it's just obvious it's so outrageous anything else jim
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.000]  yes i would also like to make the point i'm a pastor here in missouri and uh i would just
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:43.440]  like to to say to all the pastors and christians that are listening uh we have an an obligation
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.560]  to let people know what's going on to any any pastor or church member that believes that politics
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.760]  do not belong in church i'm going to encourage you to read is equal 33 we are the watchman
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:58.880]  and our blood their blood is going to be on our hand uh the blood of the people is going to be on
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.000]  our hands if we let uh all this happen and don't warn people about what's going on you're absolutely
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.160]  right they want civil war in this country that's how the communists take over and again it's powerful
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:15.840]  rich people that want to set offshore and bring the country down that are financing a classical
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.960]  communist takeover in america it's incredible and then they give all the federal training and these
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:26.800]  armored vehicles knowing it makes local police look horrible then they come back in and go we'll
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:31.040]  train them how to use these tanks right while the people throw in the bottles work for the
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:37.360]  justice department on record i mean it's just it's sick uh kevin in west virginia you're on the
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:46.480]  air go ahead hi um how are you both alexis um my question is um my family is nothing but hunters
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:53.040]  um and and this whole disarmament treaty i don't quite understand it um simple do you
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.560]  think a tiger or a lion wants a gazelle or a ding ding it's going to eat some little deer do you
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:05.040]  think it wants it to have like big ten inch fangs no it eats it because it's it'll roll over so
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:12.000]  that's why they're trying to take your guns well i mean we're hunters and what scares me is that um
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.400]  are we going to wake up christmas morning with with the gestapo at the door saying turn them in
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.840]  yes and it's being done in california new york incrementally for little regulations and veterans
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:27.520]  where they bloom bird says the headline last year gun confiscation has begun in california
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.960]  i appreciate your call comments how do you see them rolling this gun control by stealth
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:38.560]  i think they the globalists and the obama administration have figured out that straight
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:43.120]  you know frontal attack on gun rights is not going to fly uh so it looks to me like what
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.080]  they're doing first they want to get them registered and this is how the un treaty
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.720]  outlines that it should be done as well you need a national control list of all the weapons who
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:55.280]  owns all the weapons what type of weapons what type of ammunition and just like all dictatorships
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.200]  throughout history once they have the guns registered is when they'll come for the guns so
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.360]  the first step will be registering that's why you saw this huge push for the expansion of the
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.440]  background checks they don't care about background checks in fact they love it when a nut job goes
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.480]  and shoots somebody of course they want a list of everybody who owns weapons so that they can come
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.720]  and by the way the violence policy center the brady center the austin proteam mayor
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.400]  mike martinez said in speeches we're going to register and then we're going to confiscate their
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:26.000]  guns and then he laughed he laughed at the gun owners and said yeah we are coming for your guns
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.720]  just like groober they love to let us know yeah so if people don't fight back there's uh you know
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.440]  serious serious struggle ahead for gun rights but uh i think they've realized the globalists have
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.840]  realized now that you know americans aren't going to sit back and take an attack on gun rights lightly
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.760]  so they're trying to sell it as you know oh just background checks who could be opposed to more
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.160]  background checks and they want to chip away at it little by little until they can exploit a crisis
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.760]  to come out and grab them all after they were registered that's right great points chat in
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.360]  washington you're on the air with alex newman of the new american magazine oh well yeah the last
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.400]  caller basically asked what i was going to ask i just was hoping he could explain a little bit
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.560]  more uh i remember who said it but somebody was saying if a state doesn't really comply or the
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:20.560]  populace doesn't comply then they'll send in un troops pretty much the disarm people i was hoping
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:25.360]  he could just explain a little that's after the civil war see first they destabilize the country
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:31.200]  then they send the un in to mop up later alex you know people think it's ridiculous the idea
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.840]  that un troops might someday be in the united states it's not ridiculous at all and if you look at
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.280]  what the un troops are doing around the world now i've written on this extensively because
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.840]  they in my opinion it's one of the worst atrocities going on in the world and nobody's paying attention
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.520]  to it these un peacekeeping troops are systematically raping slaughtering and pillaging the populations
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.360]  they're supposed to be protecting it doesn't matter if you're looking in Haiti the ivory coast
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:58:00.240]  sudan uh samalia the congo any place where you find marma asia literally being a news
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:07.040]  town for 22 years 20 years on air no army in modern history has been more villainous
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:12.560]  larcenous murderous than the un so-called peacekeepers i mean it is an army of evil
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:18.160]  it is it's mind-boggling and the media doesn't want to pay any attention to it but the idea that
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:22.400]  they would be in the states is not as ridiculous as it sounds look at the un and sex trafficking of
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:26.640]  kids and women that they're the main driver of that do five more minutes with us if you can alex

[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:24.640]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.120]  alex newman of the new american magazine dot com i'm gonna take a few final calls for you right
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:36.160]  now but any other points you want to make about the un treaty a little christmas gift that obama
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:41.920]  says to implement by fiat yeah one thing that i think is important for people to understand
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:47.360]  the un is more of a tool of the globalist than a danger in and of itself but with that said
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:52.480]  drawing from the united nations and defunding the united nations would set the globalist spec
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.520]  decades they are thinking to use the united nations as the nucleus of this global tyranny that
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.400]  they're trying to impose and they're doing it on all fronts human rights global warming all of these
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.040]  pseudo uh you know pretext for global government are being exploited so if we could get the united
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:11.520]  states out of the un and there's a bill in congress to do it right now hr 75 restore american
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.160]  sovereignty act by a representative brown in georgia if we could get the united states out of
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.880]  the united nations we would set the the globalist spec by maybe generations and so i think it's a
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.440]  very worthy goal it's a good goal for all of us to aspire to we need to educate our communities
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:31.120]  about the danger of the un and we can use that momentum to defund and then withdraw from the
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:37.280]  dictators club and that's what it is that's what really exposes the un they never criticize
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:42.640]  dictators and horrible regimes it's always christians family groups private property
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:47.680]  and then it's a bunch of corrupt billionaires on top of it like george soros telling someone
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.960]  that makes a hundred thousand dollars a year how they're a greedy pig uh leon in utah thanks
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:59.600]  for holding your own the year with alex newman hey alex uh hey mr newman and uh fellow uh

[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:15.040]  we can see that things are you know they're expanding in a way that beyond our comprehension
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:20.080]  in in terms of they they want to just you know knock on our doors and say hand over you or your
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.960]  guns you know what we know that people are going to stand their grounds and we know that
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.760]  you know people are going to defend themselves and it's going to be a bloodbath to be honest with
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:35.120]  you that it's it's it's something that we all have to understand and many people they i feel
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.080]  like they lack discipline because they don't listen they don't they're not aware of the things that
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.960]  are going on around us i mean just a couple of days ago i guess you know russia or even today
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.200]  they're threatening that you know that they're saying that america's sounding off the drum for
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.360]  world war three i mean you can obviously tell that things are they're not right here and i mean
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.880]  we know that violent protests take us nowhere um and you know they obviously don't agree with the
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.520]  self-protection and uh so what what what's the plan what do we what kind of action are we supposed
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:14.240]  to take aside from petitioning and you know and uh you know protests what what what what's the answer
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:21.840]  here to me what they can do um i always say first of all resist calls for violence most of the time
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.720]  those are probably going to be coming from federal provocateurs and globalists anyways resist calls
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.440]  to this divide and conquer it's not about race it's not about class it's not about any of these things
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.400]  it's about globalist criminals versus the people of the united states their liberties and all that
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.800]  is right and good in the world now in terms of what to do we have a lot of tools available to us one
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:44.800]  of the most important is educating our communities we still have our free speech we still have the
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.840]  internet so we can get the information out and that is going to be key we have the ballot box we
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.480]  can vote uh bad politicians who don't obey their oath of office out of office uh we have the jury
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.360]  so you know don't convict your fellow citizens for trumped up crimes that the federal government
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:06.400]  or you know whatever imagines have been committed so we still have all the tools that we need that's
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:11.920]  right if the people become motivated and highly active and know what's happening if all of you
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:18.240]  become media folks in your own area or activist or jury activist whatever the case is there's
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:24.640]  no way the globalist can be successful if you just point people at new american magazine or in

[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:50.160]  politicians silence nine-year-old over posting photos of school lunch do you want to know what
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:56.880]  some kids are being served at school every day a classic example of tyranny and it goes through
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:02.480]  the fact that school says you're not allowed to take photos of the food that the school has
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.640]  and you're going to get in trouble if you continue that and that sounds like something
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:14.560]  innocuous who cares well they then they can feed them prison style food if that's the case
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  and by the way the photo of the hamburgers we have on there is not the school food
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.520]  the school food looks like prisoner food when you go look at the photos and it's reversing
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.880]  the michelle obama boondoggle all over the country that people can see the photos so their answer is
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:39.360]  don't make it high quality food or end federalization of the food no just end free speech interesting

[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:23.360]  people arrested and executed for using the internet improperly they claim and now they're trying to
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:29.680]  learn obama's been meeting with them how to do this here facebook ceo mark zuckerberg that calls
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.400]  his users dumb efforts for trusting him lauded the virtues of socialism during a recent meeting
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:40.160]  with lou wee the czar of china's draconian internet censorship system we can scroll down
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:43.920]  and show you a nice picture of him as mouse a tongue having previously met with the state
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:51.600]  department official kathrina novelli who urged the two countries to work together as friends

[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:12.720]  of china sitting on zuckerberg's office desk leading zuckerberg to comment i bought this
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:17.440]  book for my co-workers i want them to understand socialism with chinese characteristics and went

[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:44.560]  about 10 years ago the state department came out and said it was a rumor even though the

[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:14.640]  harvesting just come out and call it a conspiracy theory even though the bbc now has this headline

[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:56.080]  all our dough traders this guy groober you could keep going after one after another and go back
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:05.920]  again to zuckerberg talking about china let's go back to two weeks after 9 11 go look at what oil
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:13.920]  prices were back then and they were in the 20 a barrel range and then when any everybody wasn't

[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:34.640]  york that only about a billion dollars who's funding it the chinese national or the chinese bank
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:41.040]  communist government you go look what's going on over there in portugal you know they're privatizing
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.920]  everything private and my problem i mean i want to get into what real privatization is but the
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:51.200]  communist chinese already every month i see where they're controlling tv shows movies what can be
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.000]  published uh michael savage couldn't even get his book promoted anywhere the publisher wouldn't
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.480]  promote it because the chinese threatened him because he criticized i mean the communist china
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:07.680]  is a big fat censor that's my problem well again they're communists i mean i grew up most of my
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:13.360]  life teaching us to hate communists hey those russians they're no good but those chinese
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:20.960]  commies our kind of guys gee i wonder why couldn't be because of all of the american manufacturers
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:26.880]  that sold us out and and be bought all their cheaper their product over there to be made by
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:33.920]  slave labor so the chinese communists are good commies all those cubans they're bad commies too
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:40.320]  there's only good commies and bad commies it's all about business alex and that's what i want to
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:47.920]  talk about the business of business is china and china's buying up the world and you'll look at the
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:54.320]  numbers as i said privatization going on all throughout europe it's not privatization it's
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:28:01.680]  selling more valuable public assets at bargain baseman prices to do dirty deals with your pals
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:06.800]  it would they just had a big auction in portugal you know what the major language was of the people
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:13.360]  bidding mandarin you look what's going on in canada look what's going on in the united states
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:19.600]  the chinese economies collapse the smart money over there knows it they have 70 million that's
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:27.120]  right million vacant luxury apartments entire cities that are vacant their bubble has burst
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:33.040]  look they lowered interest rates 40 basis points trying to pump this thing up goes back to the
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:41.680]  trends of 2015 one of them is called price wars why because there's oversupply and over capacity
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:48.400]  of just about everything it's not only oil prices that are going down because of oversupply
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:57.680]  and and less demand it's copper prices it's corn prices it's it's iron ore you could buy rebar
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:05.360]  reinforcement rod a ton of reinforcement rod over in china costs less than a ton of cabbage
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:12.880]  so what they're doing they are aware of the collapse that's coming you're taking their money
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:19.280]  and they're buying up the world you better learn how to speak chinese and learn how to be a better
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:27.840]  kami because the politicians in this nation are have sold us out and continue to do so and they love

[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:21.120]  destabilize it they're trying to cut off their pipelines they're trying to screw up their deals
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.600]  they're lowering oil prices to try to bankrupt them so that then there'll be no competition they
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:32.560]  can jack it up as high as they want in my view and a lot of mainline analysts not just you or
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:39.760]  dr. pulkard roberts for myself are saying this could lead to actual war is there no amount of
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:49.120]  hubris out of these harvard mafia people that though they act like miscreant weasels are in
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:56.400]  control of the nuclear arsenal well they again you know we're looking at who they are and everything
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:02.560]  they do they turn to disaster there's not one thing that anybody could point to this says look
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:09.600]  at the great job that the dc gang has done whether it's in health care whether it's in education
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:16.960]  whether it's in military whether it's in the environment whether it's in food safety go up
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:24.240]  and down the list and before i go on i want to also encourage all the listeners of info wars
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:31.600]  to support what you're doing as you know that we do and we advertise an info wars magazine
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:36.160]  because you're one of the few people out there along with a number of us that are concerned with
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:42.880]  the truth and the truth is an abstract i'll give you an example why it's not abstract begins with
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:50.000]  our conversation today about the cia quote misleading it's not misleading it's lying
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:00.080]  is a lie and a truth it's not about banks misleading or or misdeeds it's about corruption
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:07.280]  and thievery so there is a truth and when enough people support the truth then the truth as they
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:14.720]  say shall make us free so i really encourage everyone during this holiday season to do what
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:21.760]  they can to keep promoting your voice of freedom and as we look at the whole situation of what's
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:29.840]  devolving and the bigger picture the bigger picture is that we see in 2015 is this is the year of the
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:37.440]  game changer look what's going on in the markets as we're speaking all of a sudden the markets are
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:44.880]  now under pressure the shanghai index today lost over five percent it down over two percent across
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:52.320]  europe again what's going on in oil yes it's an oversupply issue but it's a lack of demand issue
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:58.240]  because when you go through all of the commodities again whether it's corn whether it's iron ore
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:05.680]  whether it's copper you're looking at five-year lows you're looking at a global slowdown and the
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:14.080]  way they get your mind off the global slowdown is with war and going back to russia how they've
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:20.240]  taught us how to hate russia and you well know we were on top of this we saw it coming with the
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:29.760]  soxi olympics again prior to the destabilization of the ukraine hey alex don't go to soxi because
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:36.480]  if you get on one of those airplanes watch out for those toothpaste bombs who can make this
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:46.960]  stuff up i'll tell you who a bunch of sick sobs hey alex don't go to soxi not if you like animals
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:54.080]  because they're shooting all those stray dogs and don't drink the water no no no it's all yellow
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:03.760]  yeah and hey those hotel rooms they're garbage they started a deep they started to defame russia
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:14.720]  before it happened by the time the olympics began america's perception of russia was at a 1994 low
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:21.520]  i'll tell everyone out there listening you want to get into a good business you could do it cheaply
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:28.640]  doesn't have to make any sense and you can make a lot of dough doing it propaganda that's the
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:37.280]  business to get into watch out for those isis fear and hysteria all of the propaganda coming out
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:46.960]  against russia let's put this into perspective every week if not every day we keep hearing about
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:55.600]  russian troop movements russian tanks russian armored vehicles flooding over the russian border
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:05.680]  into ukraine hey alex have you seen any pictures yet nothing they show us nothing hey this world is
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:14.240]  selfies you can't show us one photo no i'll tell you why because they're liars they're sociopaths
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:24.800]  they are leading us to war the global economy is collapsing only a psychopath would want to put
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:31.280]  sanctions on russia that only hurts really the europeans because we don't do that much business
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:40.320]  with them at a time when the european economy is in the crapper oh that's right unemployment in italy
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:50.080]  yeah it's at record lows you know over 13 percent there's a oh oh look what happened today in the
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:58.880]  greek stock market now you turn on cbs bloomberg you see the little prostitutes come out there
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:06.000]  and say hi there's recovery over there in greece they're out of a recession she wonder why the
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:16.320]  markets down 11 percent today so you can see only a moron a psychopath and a sociopath would put
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:23.280]  sanctions on russia now that russians are putting sanctions on the europeans and who is it hurting
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:30.240]  well it's hurting the small people in europe yeah the ones that used to sell product to russia so
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:38.400]  they're destroying the global economy and when i said before alex this isn't a throwaway line
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:47.120]  that obama who's launched a war against syria that's dropping bombs on a sovereign nation
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:54.640]  and you remember the line about that humanitarian mission that we're not going back in iraq no no
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:43:01.600]  no we are there on a humanitarian mission to save those christians on the mountain and then
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:09.040]  yazidis you know what a yazidis i'm sure you got them all over san antonio we got to save them too
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:15.760]  no no it's not all those bombing runs they're doing every day and who's he doing it with
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:23.360]  doesn't even ask congress congress doesn't even care they're traders these people are committing
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:31.440]  treason they're treasonous acts and no one wants to call it what it is they're treasonous acts
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:39.200]  of war they're treasonous acts that are robbing us of our constitutional rights of our bill of
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:49.040]  rights and our money because they make up things one of the top trends oh by the way we have decided
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:57.120]  we selected the people for info wars to hear our list of top 10 trends of top trends for 2015
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:04.640]  before anyone else they just went out to our subscribers as we're talking we also had a
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:11.920]  conference here in colonial kingston this last saturday a video of that is also available a
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:18.480]  five-hour conference we put on and people if they go to our website they can sign up to get that as
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:26.560]  well but we selected info wars because these are the people of all of the media that's putting
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:34.240]  out to the people freedom of speech thought and spirit no one is doing it to the level that you
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:42.720]  are so we decided this is the one we're going to first and going back to the top trends bankism
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:50.880]  people are saying this is a failure of capitalism no it's not it's bankism the banks are in control
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:56.160]  and the person that's writing this story for us in the trends journal and we have the synopsis
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:04.080]  out now is nomi prince who of course wrote that great book all the president's bankers so don't
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:11.120]  complain about capitalism four words killed it everybody knows what they are too big too fail
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:17.920]  brought to you by Henry Paulson former CEO of the Goldman Sachs gang now playing big roles as
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:27.760]  frankenstein in a freak show near you what else do we have hey the grand manipulation it is no
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:35.520]  free markets everything is rigged we know libor is rigged only to seven hundred trillion dollars
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:42.800]  that's right the interest rates but we're not going to punish anybody no no no it's just misdeeds
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:50.000]  and they misled so we'll only find them and the same thing with the forex the currency exchange
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:57.280]  of which they trade five point three trillion dollars a day on and on gold manipulation
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:07.680]  as detailed and written in this issue by dr paul craig roberts other big trend price wards get ready
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:14.240]  for it here's something this is going to go out later we just started writing about it today
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:22.160]  this is a headline if these equity markets continue to go in the direction that they are
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:30.080]  this is going to be a rocket that's going to knock Santa out of the sky and the retail
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:36.640]  sales are going to plummet look what already happened with black friday came in on the red
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:42.560]  didn't it no it didn't go up four point one percent as the national retail federation
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:52.640]  had predicted down eleven percent now you pile on that declining markets fear fear
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:47:00.640]  spreading across the world of the overblown equity markets that were only propped up because of low
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:08.720]  interest rates and trillions of dollars of phony money flooding in you're going to see a disastrous
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:17.760]  christmas which brings us to the trend price wards you're going to see 50 75 percent they're
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:24.560]  going to want to unload the garbage that they have made in china at any price they could get
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:31.680]  rather than being caught with oversupply of product you look at the sales even at the luxury end
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:40.080]  product is getting blown away one after another so when you start putting these trends together
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:46.240]  how do they get your mind off it i'll tell you how you saw what they did with isis remember
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:55.440]  they beheaded those guys ooh beheadings are bad drones away ah that's okay that's a clean blowout
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:03.680]  but man bombs fine but no beheadings and the people buy it they buy it like they buy 32 ounce
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:11.120]  phosphorescent slurpees you could sell them anything so when you start putting the trends
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.960]  together and keep looking where it's going you go back into the positive ones like you said
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:28.160]  the millennial generation they are going to be right for retrograde this is the only generation
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:35.280]  coming up where they're looking and those of us that are old enough remember that all our lives
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:43.200]  the polls used to show the future is going to be greater than the present not anymore now they look
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:50.960]  at the future they say model is bad now it's only going to get worse they're looking for a future
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:57.600]  that they're going to take from the past remember the renaissance in italy happened after the black
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:05.760]  plague ninety sixty percent of europeans were killed they were dead they realized what are we doing
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:14.960]  wrong so they went back to the past a renaissance a rebirth a rediscovery retrograde they're going
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:21.760]  to take from the past and retrofit it for the future this is one of the biggest trends that
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:28.560]  people should look into because the millennial generation a lot they're not stupid a lot of
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:35.040]  these kids are really sharp and they know they're getting shafted and they can see who the shifter
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:44.720]  is and they know they're getting it on the blunt end so manufacturers it ties into local it ties
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:51.040]  into high quality you will finding out in our research at music schools these kids aren't going
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:56.480]  back to rock and roll they're not going back to louis Armstrong they're not going back to elephants
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:04.160]  gerald they're going back to bessie smith they're going back to jango reinhardt beyond they're going
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:12.320]  back to jelly roll morton they're going back to the roots the roots of america that made this
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:19.040]  country what it was anybody can complain and i don't want to hear the stories i'm very aware of them
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:26.560]  what we did to the genocide of the indians the inequality that we did to blacks i'm very familiar

[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:20.400]  getting at does the break cut him off alex shone's here back live is that get a look at the time we
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:28.160]  lived in 250 years ago we're only taught about america's evils but when compared to other countries
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:34.880]  it was very tame in some cases and some it was very barbarous but the idea of not having a big
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:40.880]  government not having royalty that's being bowed to in the wirehouse today the idea of the little
[02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:46.800]  people having ideas and and quality and i'm already seeing this renaissance as liberal
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:51.680]  trendies that move to austin are not just going out and learn how to square dance and i'm not saying
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:58.560]  that's even good but it's it's it's good to see them trying to to do something folky or authentic
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:02.320]  now they're going out and buying guns they're going out and buying four-wheel drive trucks
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:09.920]  they are breaking with the system and becoming more libertarian more rugged and unfortunately
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:13.920]  original texans are sitting in their trailer houses watching satellite tv all day and down
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:18.480]  to heart attacks but uh i think that's what gerald's trying to get at people go into truck farms
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:23.680]  people go into organic farms people getting into going to thrift stores to get their clothes
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:28.000]  half the time it's better than a big and i'm not saying big corporate stores are you know the devil
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:33.520]  in every case but they're all lobbying to get laws passed where you can't have a farmer's market
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:39.120]  so if we shop just like the organic food market that didn't exist 20 years ago and demand it it
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:44.960]  will grow it will lower the price it will supplant the rest of the economy and and and so there is a
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:52.640]  major quest now by young people i'd say 30 and below to look for something better is that what
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:59.840]  you're getting at gerald yes that's exactly it and again going back quality look at the buildings
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:05.200]  they used to build look at the junk they put up now a big box store it's like going shopping
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:12.800]  in a large self storage unit yes so it's they're looking for quality because they know that quality
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:18.560]  is going to improve their lives beauty and quality are going to be big sellers the marketers that
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:26.800]  understand it rediscovering that beauty is wealth exactly again what was the renaissance and look
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:32.560]  what's happened and again i was saying before you know people could criticize this country
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:39.920]  we were we were the envy of the world it was the land of opportunity as i say my blood is italian
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:46.640]  but my heart is american i could never be me if i was born anywhere else the freedom that i was
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:52.800]  given that you're taking away now so going on to some other trends and it all ties together
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:57:01.680]  gold the golden age the boomers are now you know i'm born in 1946 this is one of the biggest
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:07.520]  markets to play at you were talking about all the people sitting around watching stupid television
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:15.600]  going for the gold is going to go for the golden age in exercises no not these muscle trips
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:21.920]  how do you stay healthy and live longer you go to our website we did a video on june and stanley
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:32.720]  blum they're 95 years old stanley began painting at 80 when you in other name and other in other
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:38.720]  i tell you stay alive is learning and doing new things exactly and the marketers that understand
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:44.560]  that in providing them products and services and i'm not talking about walkers and canes no
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:48.560]  treating old people like they're still people and then they'll act like people and won't decide to
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:52.480]  go die because all the studies show when old people feel like they're out needed by the tribe
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:57.120]  they go turn off and die when they're treated like elders and respected and brought in they
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.240]  become the dynamic engine that then interlocks down to the first generation below them and then
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:06.240]  that down to the young people and that's why they've targeted the youth and told them to be forever
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:10.080]  kids when they're supposed to be men and women earlier that's why they told old people oh it's
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:16.240]  your time to go to the beach and then they go and just die instead of staying alive perfectly said
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:22.400]  and so the older you get if you keep on learning the wiser you get i remember when i was a little
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:27.520]  kid my father made soul rest in peace meeting didn't he look at me and say you know sunday
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:33.200]  say youth is wasted on the young take a couple more bites and he'd say they were talking about you

[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:41.760]  that tomorrow i saw that last week is like thinking the rolling stones painted black is a call for
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:48.560]  black on white genocide insanity paul watson tweeted the articles by adan salazar texas lawmakers
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.600]  in schools yes it's legal to say merry christmas first they said don't have an official holiday
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:58.320]  christmas at the school then they told kids don't give out christmas cards well you have a right
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:03.680]  to give out any card you want as long as it's not profanity this is the totalitarianism what do you
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:09.760]  see in this attempt to create hyper political correctness in the future gerald salente well what
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:15.520]  it's doing this is keeps robbing us of more and more of our rights so that's where we're at
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:22.160]  and that's where we're going so i mean what's political correctness let's make this straight
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:29.600]  there's nothing correct about anything political these are a bunch of sellouts who are trying to
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:37.600]  run and ruin our lives it's the system and when are people going to stop letting the people in
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.320]  the system run and destroy their lives because you can name the heads of the system and how
[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:50.400]  could anybody with any self-respect or dignity believe what they said and who are why how can
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:55.440]  the first lady tell our kids what to eat and and how can the so-called liberals tell us we
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:01.840]  can't have christmas trees they can go to hell i agree i mean who are they to tell us who are they
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:06.720]  when the real discrimination is is all of us being signed on to the derivatives i'm sure you
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:14.000]  saw the new bill they have to sign us all on the derivatives as taxpayers i did and also to me it's
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:20.160]  no big deal because with or without the bill they're still going to steal our window because it goes
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:28.320]  back to the top trends one of them is bankism it's not capitalism it's a takeover when are people
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:35.680]  going to call it what it is so it's on every level i want to show you something alex when people
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:42.400]  talk about russia as i mentioned we had a conference here this past weekend this was given to me by
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:52.320]  one of the attendees it's a famous graph of napoleon's march to russia you can see the big wine going
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:59.680]  into russia how many people he had the 400 and something thousand i think believe it was yes
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:10.400]  you can see how many came out 422 thousand you know how many came back 10 000 10 000
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:19.360]  hit the launch the greatest the greatest offensive of any time in history against russia
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:27.040]  they lost do you think the guys this nato group that can't beat a bunch of
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:36.400]  lightly armed people in afghanistan can't win in iraq are going to defeat the russians
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:46.080]  they're out of their minds if napoleon couldn't do it if hitler couldn't do it you think obama is
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:55.600]  going to do it maybe he'll do it between a game of golf and basketball very well said it is that's
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:04:00.640]  the thing i don't know if the hubris makes them strong or weak but i know it makes them dangerous
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:06.880]  that like you said a bunch of white shoe boys from harvard i've had top phd's like uh dr boil

[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:37.200]  look at larry summers oh yeah well woodrow wilson brought us into world war one that wasn't america
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:43.200]  and he and the war was almost over he's the guy that brought us the federal reserve he's the guy
