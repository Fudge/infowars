[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.440]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.480 --> 00:17.520]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:24.840 --> 00:26.840]  Wow
[00:26.840 --> 00:30.760]  Do we have a lot of key information to cover today it is all
[00:31.400 --> 00:33.400]  off the charts right now
[00:34.720 --> 00:38.480]  And I'm gonna do my best on this live Sunday edition
[00:39.040 --> 00:43.080]  It's a normal the day that you pay your income tax. We didn't get till 1913
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.920]  Right out of the communist manifesto
[00:46.200 --> 00:53.460]  Check it for yourself. It's one of the planks directly to the folks that wrote the communist manifesto the private European
[00:53.460 --> 00:55.460]  money-changer bankers
[00:56.580 --> 01:04.440]  Who on record took over Europe with private central banks and fraud and fractional reserve banking and have now taken over our country in
[01:04.700 --> 01:13.020]  1913 the same year giving us the income tax to pay for the interest on creating dollars federal reserve notes
[01:15.260 --> 01:17.260]  That's what we're talking about in fact today
[01:17.260 --> 01:27.140]  I'm gonna be able here on air on the radio to talk about and for people watching at prison planet dot TV to show you a
[01:27.820 --> 01:31.780]  United States note later. I'll show you a close shot of
[01:32.620 --> 01:37.580]  This this is US note itself a fiat currency
[01:37.580 --> 01:42.820]  But no debt is created the government just issues it as a symbol of exchange
[01:42.820 --> 01:48.780]  Instead of giving Goldman Sachs one of the chief shareholders the private Federal Reserve and JP Morgan Chase
[01:49.580 --> 01:57.420]  Interest on a being allowed to have money. It makes money the economy money. They control
[02:00.340 --> 02:05.140]  You understand the level of that fraud this is how they control the society and
[02:05.140 --> 02:13.060]  And they want to raise the income taxes right now with the Buffett rule on the middle class and Nouveau rich wealthy
[02:13.180 --> 02:20.860]  Because the elite are exempt from all the major taxes and will transfer the money offshore in new banker bailouts
[02:22.860 --> 02:29.000]  And we have an article up at info wars comm red alert Buffett rule is a criminal scam
[02:32.180 --> 02:34.180]  new
[02:34.180 --> 02:36.180]  bank bailout
[02:38.020 --> 02:44.860]  To be funded with the new increase in taxes that article is red linked up at info wars comm
[02:45.460 --> 02:50.640]  So that is some of what is coming up on the broadcast today
[02:53.580 --> 02:57.700]  So red alert Buffett rule is a criminal scam
[02:57.700 --> 03:05.620]  That is up at info wars and it is so important to get out to everybody and and I will prove
[03:07.420 --> 03:10.660]  When we go over the article
[03:11.700 --> 03:16.060]  There it is a new banker bailout to be funded by giant tax hikes
[03:17.260 --> 03:24.940]  That's the headline info wars comm at prism planet comm it has the headline from the video itself red alert Buffett rule is a criminal
[03:24.940 --> 03:31.140]  Scam, I knew I'd written both headlines, but I was getting confused reading this headline because it was from prism planet
[03:31.140 --> 03:36.500]  Paul Watson took the headline that was from the YouTube and use that whereas I wrote the other headline on
[03:37.780 --> 03:39.780]  info wars comm myself
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.580]  And
[03:44.580 --> 03:50.540]  I will document that coming up how the Buffett rule could still be escaped by the highest earning
[03:50.540 --> 03:54.580]  Householders of course they wrote the legislation
[03:55.060 --> 04:00.100]  Just like the insurance companies wrote Obamacare to make everybody buy their product and change
[04:00.340 --> 04:06.460]  What health care is with the insurance companies and HMOs through federal computers tell doctors what they can do
[04:06.580 --> 04:12.980]  It's a takeover of medicine. So it's eugenics based not Hippocratic oath based do no harm based and
[04:14.220 --> 04:19.460]  It's about making you buy the product and social engineering all of society now
[04:19.460 --> 04:21.780]  I talked about this earlier in the week and
[04:22.620 --> 04:24.620]  It's in Forbes and
[04:24.980 --> 04:31.620]  It's also in Fox and the LA Times. Oh the IRS. You're not going anywhere domestic checkpoints
[04:32.180 --> 04:35.500]  And how that ties into the control group we've been talking about
[04:36.300 --> 04:42.620]  We've got the war on women going into high gear with sniveling Bill Maher the fascist posing as a liberal
[04:42.780 --> 04:46.460]  We have the feminist praising abortion and making jokes about dead babies
[04:46.940 --> 04:48.940]  very very sick
[04:48.940 --> 04:50.940]  We have massive
[04:51.740 --> 04:59.100]  massive news on the whole Secret Service situation and a new Taliban offensive in Afghanistan
[04:59.100 --> 05:04.700]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food. I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging
[05:04.700 --> 05:10.860]  But nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[05:10.860 --> 05:17.500]  And as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[05:17.500 --> 05:21.020]  Now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team dot-com
[05:21.020 --> 05:24.260]  But I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[05:25.420 --> 05:28.380]  37 pounds in just two months
[05:29.220 --> 05:31.220]  Products like beyond Tangy tangerine
[05:31.660 --> 05:36.700]  Holland burst and rebound when I started taking the Tangy tangerine and other products every day
[05:36.700 --> 05:41.180]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now that's results
[05:41.180 --> 05:47.940]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot-com and to order just three of their products
[05:47.940 --> 05:53.260]  And you will see the changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately

[06:07.300 --> 06:13.820]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:21.140 --> 06:29.660]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin, Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:29.660 --> 06:37.380]  Blasting out coast-to-coast on the AM and FM dial
[06:37.780 --> 06:44.380]  Simulcasting at info wars dot-com on the audio and video streams at prisonplanet.tv
[06:45.860 --> 06:49.300]  Thank you so much for joining us for this live worldwide
[06:50.460 --> 06:55.820]  Transmission of info wars. I am your host Alex Jones. Normally we'd be paying our
[06:55.820 --> 07:03.540]  Income tax of the private Federal Reserve today, but there's a federal occupation holiday tomorrow
[07:03.540 --> 07:09.940]  And so we'll be paying our taxes the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve on Tuesday
[07:09.940 --> 07:15.900]  And I'm gonna be breaking down the difference between the federal reserve and federal express no difference
[07:15.900 --> 07:20.300]  They're both private and dovetailing that with real u.s. Money
[07:20.300 --> 07:26.100]  Like this five dollar United States dollar bill u.s. Note
[07:26.860 --> 07:30.100]  Versus a federal reserve note. I'm gonna explain to people
[07:30.700 --> 07:36.700]  Now we've been under banker occupation for a long long time and they're now openly announcing a dictatorship
[07:37.260 --> 07:39.900]  Over Europe. I'm gonna show you those headlines
[07:39.900 --> 07:48.340]  But first let me just give you a smattering of what's in the one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
[07:48.340 --> 07:52.940]  Sixteen stacks some of these stacks or 20 stories are more thick. Okay?
[07:53.700 --> 07:59.100]  This is why I get so crazy by the time I get on air. It's out of frustration. It's ever-turning to even cover this
[08:00.340 --> 08:04.860]  Activist plan week of protest against new house cybersecurity
[08:06.500 --> 08:08.500]  legislation
[08:09.340 --> 08:15.380]  Syspa and it is worse than the SOPA bill it allows the Pentagon to
[08:15.380 --> 08:20.980]  Shot down any website without a judge jury. It is total surveillance over the entire web
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.460]  They've got
[08:23.460 --> 08:28.460]  Organizations out there like the electronic frontier foundation and others
[08:29.060 --> 08:32.020]  Explaining that it is worse than communist Chinese style
[08:32.660 --> 08:33.980]  firewalls
[08:33.980 --> 08:35.980]  against free speech and
[08:36.540 --> 08:40.140]  It is mind-blowing, but so is everything else
[08:40.140 --> 08:46.860]  That's happening in this country who would have ever believed that we've got socialist health care going in that
[08:47.540 --> 08:52.860]  Thousands of White House contributors are exempt from written by the insurance companies to rip people off
[08:53.820 --> 08:56.060]  Selling the dumb socialist that it's a free lunch
[08:57.620 --> 09:03.140]  That is coming up who would have ever believed that cloned meat is already in the food supply
[09:03.620 --> 09:07.860]  Who would have ever believed that in every major study the GMO crops that grow their own?
[09:07.860 --> 09:15.220]  Pesticide and them are causing organ failure in every species. They're fed to including humans who would have believed we've gone from one in
[09:16.100 --> 09:24.220]  25,000 people getting autism to now one in fifty something who would have believed pediatric cancers would be over
[09:24.860 --> 09:31.220]  10,000 percent more common than they were in the 1950s. Look it up all on purpose all by design. I
[09:32.260 --> 09:34.260]  Can't go to a restaurant now
[09:34.260 --> 09:39.740]  Without I mean I was in restaurants the other night and there were two children in there two separate tables in both of them
[09:39.740 --> 09:41.740]  One was obviously autistic the other had
[09:42.420 --> 09:44.420]  some type of
[09:44.420 --> 09:46.420]  Chromosomal disorder probably downs I
[09:47.820 --> 09:51.420]  Was in I mean everywhere I go. I mean that we we are being
[09:52.860 --> 09:58.660]  Absolutely soft killed devastated right now. That's the number one issue. I'm sorry. I'm looking at this story
[09:58.660 --> 10:03.980]  Well, I got a stack of them here where the just
[10:05.100 --> 10:09.380]  Now the system's killing us, but let's look at how they're teaching us to love our deaths
[10:09.380 --> 10:14.180]  I'm sure you've noticed on the newsstands or when you're even at the grocery store because I know I've seen it over and over again
[10:14.180 --> 10:16.180]  They'll have in caps
[10:16.780 --> 10:22.260]  Meaning basically it's being given away whenever you see an in cap. It's being discounted to the retailer generally
[10:22.660 --> 10:25.900]  saying life without humans the audiobook or
[10:25.900 --> 10:33.100]  The world after humans there's all these different TV shows how great it'll be how we're trash how we're scum hate ourselves
[10:33.300 --> 10:35.300]  Get into death lay down
[10:35.860 --> 10:40.140]  Children are horrible men are horrible men are supposed to be weak women are the boss
[10:40.620 --> 10:46.220]  But if a woman actually tries to raise her children and be empowered then she's trash this war on women
[10:46.740 --> 10:53.060]  You know lazy scum women like Bill Marb said a few nights ago that Mitt Romney's wife
[10:53.060 --> 10:56.300]  I mean I heard the clip today. It's all over the news. You know
[10:56.300 --> 11:00.700]  Well, she never had to get up at seven and go to a job and deal with a boss
[11:00.700 --> 11:08.140]  No, she just had to feed you know five boys and get them all dressed and do the homework and get them to the school and put up
[11:08.140 --> 11:11.740]  With problems and put up with the bullies and put and put I mean
[11:11.740 --> 11:19.100]  I'm a parent and my wife has a tougher job most days than I do and I'm at work usually till seven at night
[11:19.100 --> 11:24.260]  I mean, I was home today trying to get them to finish your schoolwork and stuff for the end of the school year
[11:24.260 --> 11:27.300]  And in dealing with cleaning the house and stuff and I mean, you know
[11:27.580 --> 11:33.260]  My kids are a little bit spoiled like most modern children, but they're good and you know what? It's it's it's frustrating
[11:33.260 --> 11:38.700]  It's easier to deal with adults all day than with children. I'll tell you right now the idea
[11:38.900 --> 11:44.260]  It's Miss magazine CIA you didn't know the CIA funded Miss magazine. It's on record
[11:44.260 --> 11:51.220]  Gloria Steinem they wanted all the women in the workforce to pay taxes of the private Federal Reserve and so the state could raise children
[11:51.220 --> 11:52.740]  If you want a career, great
[11:52.740 --> 12:00.780]  If you don't want to have kids fine if you whatever just stop bashing families and stop saying it's bad
[12:00.780 --> 12:04.820]  I mean, I've seen the stuff from the 60s and 70s on the news where they would go women
[12:04.820 --> 12:08.460]  You're pathetic if you're not working at a factory. You're pathetic
[12:10.580 --> 12:13.540]  And then of course they still talk about wage disparities with women
[12:13.540 --> 12:20.260]  Even though they have 60 plus percent the college graduates now and most of the new hiring being done is is women executives
[12:20.420 --> 12:24.500]  Hope the corporate world actually likes women that will commit and not have kids
[12:25.220 --> 12:31.460]  But the women all on average of huge numbers of them want to end up go and have kids usually by the time they're 45
[12:31.460 --> 12:34.300]  That's too late because of all the sterilants and the rest of it
[12:34.300 --> 12:38.180]  There's a whole phenomenon with that Gloria Steinem. She sure has a man and got her kids
[12:38.180 --> 12:43.460]  The point is it's about the government re-engineering families and
[12:44.140 --> 12:47.980]  It was done cold-bloodedly feminism on record
[12:48.740 --> 12:51.180]  In fact, it's covered in the film reflections and warnings
[12:51.180 --> 12:57.340]  I produced with the late great Aaron Russo and it's free online by DVD of it info wars dot com
[12:57.340 --> 13:01.100]  You want to support us and have it in higher quality, but the point is it's free reflections and warnings
[13:01.460 --> 13:06.660]  You know, it's only got a four or five million views online on YouTube. I should have 50 million, but the point is
[13:06.660 --> 13:12.020]  my banks are casting it should have 50 million not just three or four million to be at them all together and
[13:12.380 --> 13:19.540]  It goes through how the Rockefellers bragged to him big film producer how they've done this, but it's in books Gloria Steinem admits it
[13:19.940 --> 13:23.940]  Not to empower women to wreck women to take over society
[13:24.940 --> 13:31.540]  The communists always try to get the kids out of the house in China. They do this. This is the model of total control
[13:31.540 --> 13:38.020]  That's what California is trying to pass along its new single parent homes single family homes Germany's already passed the law
[13:38.020 --> 13:44.180]  They want you in communal government spy grids. This is a scientific dictatorship. Now. Look at the Daily Mail
[13:45.100 --> 13:49.820]  And I'll put this photo of this article up on screen if you're watching on prison planet TV
[13:49.820 --> 13:52.540]  If not, just search this or it's linked to info wars calm
[13:53.100 --> 13:55.100]  Got a quickie abortion
[13:55.220 --> 13:59.980]  Comedian Sarah Silverman supports pro-choice debate tweeting before and after abortion photos
[13:59.980 --> 14:05.220]  Now again first they lied and said it wasn't a baby and told her buddy was you know a right and all this or made it about
[14:05.220 --> 14:07.940]  Rape her incest when nobody was ever trying to block that and
[14:08.460 --> 14:12.460]  Then look at her. She she has her boyfriend doing it like they're happy. She's pregnant
[14:12.460 --> 14:16.420]  They mock, you know the couple saying hey, we're pregnant. You know that magic moment
[14:16.420 --> 14:22.060]  They mock that and then it shows her, you know in a sexy photo in the same outfit
[14:22.180 --> 14:27.220]  The you know the stomach small now. She killed the baby. It's exciting and she makes jokes about it
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.980]  It was a fake abortion, but the point is they put it out like it was real. They revel in it
[14:33.220 --> 14:35.220]  Let me explain something. I keep telling you this
[14:35.900 --> 14:37.900]  the Nazis on record
[14:39.180 --> 14:46.020]  You have to understand you just type in photos of Margaret Sanger founder of Planned Parenthood at clan rallies
[14:46.340 --> 14:51.580]  Her letters are public where she said I want to kill these subhuman blacks and others. How do we do it?
[14:51.580 --> 14:52.940]  We pose as liberals
[14:52.940 --> 14:55.220]  We're gonna get them, but we're gonna get everybody
[14:55.220 --> 15:00.860]  We're gonna get the poor people everybody. We've got to sell it as a right and a privilege and a wonderful thing
[15:00.860 --> 15:04.980]  We've got to end the family as it's known. They were eugenicist
[15:05.700 --> 15:07.700]  Scientific revolution look it up
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.180]  Scientific dictatorship look it up
[15:10.780 --> 15:17.020]  And this is the attitude they get off on it China sells as cosmetics the rendered
[15:17.140 --> 15:20.140]  Lard or fat of babies into the finer
[15:20.140 --> 15:25.940]  Cosmetics women have it injected into their lips and it's all a joke every drama and sitcom
[15:25.940 --> 15:31.300]  I see denigrates children denigrates men what suffice men there's Margaret Sanger delivers
[15:32.020 --> 15:35.220]  Burning speech local KKK gals hang it on every word
[15:36.220 --> 15:38.220]  Let's continue here
[15:38.940 --> 15:43.500]  Now on HBO they're showing six year olds and I'm sorry children as young as four
[15:43.500 --> 15:50.420]  performing fallatio with simulated sex objects and they're attacking conservatives that don't like it
[15:50.420 --> 15:58.900]  They want to savage our minds break our will. This is a military operation. These aren't trendy liberals. These are sick. Oh Nazis
[16:00.020 --> 16:07.020]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[16:07.020 --> 16:11.740]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[16:11.740 --> 16:17.380]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[16:17.500 --> 16:22.460]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[18:06.700 --> 18:14.060]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee

[18:59.500 --> 19:00.780]  Little over a year ago
[19:00.780 --> 19:07.520]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research
[19:07.520 --> 19:13.620]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[19:13.620 --> 19:18.180]  Industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[19:18.180 --> 19:24.540]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[19:24.540 --> 19:30.820]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young chevrolet

[20:01.260 --> 20:08.820]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[20:08.820 --> 20:24.120]  We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.720]  That's the problem is that I
[20:30.920 --> 20:34.880]  Have all these articles and if I had time to drill into this one story
[20:34.880 --> 20:38.320]  about this comedian making a joke
[20:39.400 --> 20:44.060]  about killing her baby and telling people she'd killed it and then it was fun and
[20:45.360 --> 20:48.560]  Smiling about it and hurting people's feelings. I
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.120]  Could really illustrate
[20:54.120 --> 20:56.840]  To people the type of just amazing
[20:57.720 --> 20:59.600]  Wickedness we're dealing with
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.440]  Now if you're a radio listener and couldn't see me show the photo of her tweets
[21:03.440 --> 21:08.760]  On prison planet dot TV where we're streaming video here out of the studio
[21:09.720 --> 21:11.720]  You're not seeing her with her boyfriend
[21:12.520 --> 21:17.920]  imitating that famous shot where the woman pulls up her shirt and shows her belly and smiles with
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.240]  loving, you know
[21:20.240 --> 21:26.160]  far away stare of just being in rapture and the man all looks excited and
[21:26.360 --> 21:29.560]  Then next it shows her right after the abortion
[21:29.560 --> 21:36.280]  And then she put it out saying she'd had an abortion just to show everybody that it was her right to kill the baby
[21:37.840 --> 21:42.840]  Whether you're for abortion or not don't make sick jokes about it
[21:43.280 --> 21:45.280]  But that's what this is all about
[21:45.280 --> 21:52.800]  Next I take you to the radar story and I don't even show this on TV folks and warning if you go look up the radar online
[21:53.520 --> 21:55.200]  report from
[21:55.200 --> 22:00.560]  the comedy show on HBO Angry Boys and
[22:02.000 --> 22:09.120]  It shows four or five six-year-old girls with giant sex toys
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.840]  Sucking them
[22:11.840 --> 22:15.880]  That's America and by the way, I've looked at the federal and state laws
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.400]  That is illegal
[22:19.440 --> 22:21.440]  That is illegal
[22:21.440 --> 22:28.360]  And you've got the UN Nambla is part of the United Nations, that's the North American Man Boy Love Association
[22:31.560 --> 22:37.200]  I've seen these people on the news they they all look like CPS agents because that's pretty much where they all work
[22:37.760 --> 22:44.600]  And oh, yeah, you didn't know that or the TSA another TSA got busted reportedly with kids and child porn
[22:44.600 --> 22:49.160]  And another one got busted with more prostitutes running them and other one got busted robbing people
[22:49.160 --> 22:57.120]  And I was reading were at JFK that on average they have 240 something thefts a week by the TSA. I was robbed at JFK I
[22:58.080 --> 23:01.560]  Flown into it now of it one time and I was robbed
[23:02.600 --> 23:04.000]  a
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.440]  Wrapped present was opened and the contents stolen
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  That's America
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.800]  They probably didn't like it was it was for a child it was a silver Tiffany
[23:24.560 --> 23:26.560]  Teething ring
[23:26.640 --> 23:29.680]  For my newborn daughter at the time seven years old now
[23:31.720 --> 23:34.400]  That's what America is run by a bunch of criminals
[23:36.440 --> 23:43.640]  Here's another one a shock tactic gone too far new ad features senior citizens simulating sex positions to promote use of condoms
[23:43.640 --> 23:50.420]  Again, it's not about sex with these people. It's about denigrating our normal basic human instincts
[23:50.640 --> 23:57.280]  Tearing down children tearing down women tearing down old people telling you humans or trash carbon footprints are bad
[23:58.040 --> 24:00.320]  Humans need to die they have these video games
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.400]  They show kids in Australia and in Canada that they show them in public school where it shows little animals being killed
[24:06.400 --> 24:12.760]  Simulated and don't even show it. Don't even show it to the TV viewers. It's all right. Don't even show it and
[24:16.480 --> 24:23.960]  They show the little kids animals being killed little puppies having their heads cut off and the kids cry and are taught well
[24:23.960 --> 24:26.400]  If you only live to a certain age if you commit suicide
[24:26.400 --> 24:34.840]  I'm not joking even ABC News covered this and was like ABC News of Australia should is it good to teach them that they should commit suicide?
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.800]  It's kind of like the video and this happens at public schools
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.920]  Not just that particular private school where the autistic boy is chained down for seven hours being shocked in
[24:45.080 --> 24:47.080]  Public schools they have them wearing taser
[24:48.600 --> 24:50.600]  belts and
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.280]  If you don't do what they say they they taser you
[24:54.280 --> 25:00.880]  This is all just the legalization of torture and the local news piece the Fox News was like well
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.680]  It's controversial the seven hours of being shocked. It's torture
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.560]  It's not controversial that the TSA sticking their hands down our pants. It's illegal. Oh
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.160]  Man, I tell you I
[25:14.360 --> 25:17.280]  Don't even know what to say anymore. All right, let me just try it again
[25:17.480 --> 25:19.960]  Let me just try to read you the stacks of news here
[25:19.960 --> 25:26.440]  You've got pedophilia being promoted on HBO and I am calling for a boycott of their criminal activity
[25:26.440 --> 25:28.440]  And it's all psychological warfare
[25:31.120 --> 25:33.120]  Coming up after the break red alert
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.120]  Buffett rule is a criminal scam and I'm gonna prove it's a criminal
[25:38.640 --> 25:43.440]  Operation by Warren Buffett and the globalist on the other side this massive tax increase
[25:43.440 --> 25:50.720]  They're exempt from it. They use the factor exempt from taxes with loopholes. They wrote he helped lobby for the loopholes
[25:50.720 --> 25:56.960]  They have now in the 80s and 90s then he talks about the loopholes. He had written on record. I have the articles here
[25:57.720 --> 25:58.720]  and
[25:58.720 --> 26:00.720]  then
[26:00.760 --> 26:02.760]  Buffett
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.040]  Talks about oh my gosh, it's just terrible news
[26:06.040 --> 26:13.640]  That I my secretary pays more in taxes percentage-wise than I do
[26:13.800 --> 26:20.680]  Raise taxes get me. I'm rich class warfare and it turns out he was the biggest beneficiary of the banker bailout
[26:22.360 --> 26:28.360]  Himself getting billions and the companies he's involved with in total over one trillion
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.720]  You know the banker bailout total in the US alone last time we got numbers is 27 plus drill of
[26:33.720 --> 26:39.920]  Your money and that's why they to raise your taxes now to pay for the ongoing banker bailout
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.680]  Which isn't a bailout at all. They're allowed to monetize
[26:43.200 --> 26:49.040]  Whatever debt they want and then get interest the Federal Reserve monetize this US debt. It's private
[26:49.280 --> 26:55.400]  It creates zeros and ones buys it at the open market system in other ways and then creates
[26:55.920 --> 26:57.280]  debt
[26:57.280 --> 26:59.280]  Interest debt that we've got to pay them
[26:59.280 --> 27:05.840]  We bail them out and then we go into debt to them same thing in Europe. So I'm gonna go over that
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.080]  I'm gonna give you my take on the whole Secret Service situation
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.800]  You've also got these different federal employees groups going to lavish Las Vegas parties that big scandal folks
[27:15.880 --> 27:22.320]  They always tell you about a Secret Service sex scandal or they tell you about some people going to Las Vegas and giving each other
[27:22.440 --> 27:27.520]  Cash awards and paying themselves to go to Las Vegas. That is bad corruption
[27:27.520 --> 27:33.920]  But the media that works for the big offshore banks the real government those that have hijacked this country
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.760]  I'm not just saying that we're really run by foreign banks. I'm gonna prove it coming up in the next segment
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.860]  They don't want the little weevil bugs that they've got
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.240]  Parasiting on us and minding us and running us. They don't want their slave masters
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.200]  Who are slaves themselves getting too much of the goods if there's too much waste in fraud and abuse
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.800]  They like a little bit so they can blackmail and control everybody, but if there's too much of it
[27:59.280 --> 28:00.480]  then
[28:00.480 --> 28:06.000]  They'll take over and and and and and mess up the organized looting
[28:06.800 --> 28:14.080]  And so this is also about acting like oh the real corruption is a bunch of hookers with the Secret Service and the military
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.560]  And I'm not saying that's good. It's it just shows what we've turned into or
[28:17.560 --> 28:25.960]  Or they'll talk about some employees, you know wasting millions of dollars and federal government going and having parties in Vegas when meanwhile
[28:28.680 --> 28:30.680]  Dine Corps
[28:30.920 --> 28:33.960]  There's Hillary dancing with the ladies like she always is
[28:34.840 --> 28:36.840]  Anyway, it's going back to what I was saying
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.920]  whatever
[28:39.040 --> 28:42.960]  Secret services with female hookers Hillary's out dancing the point is that
[28:42.960 --> 28:45.360]  That
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.680]  There are trillions being stolen Dine Corps Halliburton running child kidnapping rings cancer virus is being injected into us in the vaccines
[28:52.880 --> 28:56.640]  GMO poisoning us and we're hearing about the Secret Service and hookers

[30:11.720 --> 30:18.760]  How much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.960 --> 30:26.000]  Technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist

[33:00.760 --> 33:25.560]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:25.560 --> 33:34.920]  All right, we are back live coming up in the second hour. I will open the phones up today in the next segment
[33:34.920 --> 33:37.160]  I'm going to
[33:37.160 --> 33:39.160]  Play a special news report
[33:40.280 --> 33:44.920]  That info wars.com produced an association with writer director TV host
[33:45.360 --> 33:49.680]  Sean stone laying out the evidence for high crimes and misdemeanors
[33:50.400 --> 33:52.400]  Committed by Barack Hussein Obama
[33:52.400 --> 33:57.880]  And some people in the comments. In fact, here's one of them on YouTube
[33:58.600 --> 34:05.080]  On the ten minute piece. We're gonna play here on the radio said impeach Obama for what oh wait for the same things
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.600]  George W. Bush did or Clinton or any other president has done and I see this idea
[34:12.240 --> 34:19.480]  That well just cuz other people did things that were illegal or unconstitutional. It's okay for Obama to
[34:19.480 --> 34:21.480]  Know when Bush
[34:22.680 --> 34:26.280]  Ordered torture which is totally illegal. I called for his impeachment and
[34:27.320 --> 34:29.400]  Supported calls for it in the house. I
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.400]  Supported on talk radio the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton for lying under oath
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.400]  It'd be like saying well somebody else got away with murder so it's okay now and
[34:43.080 --> 34:44.680]  The point is you notice now
[34:44.680 --> 34:51.600]  It's gets worse each administration because the bureaucracy and the corporate interests that aren't free market that are monopoly groups
[34:53.760 --> 34:56.560]  They're basically mafias crime syndicates
[34:59.320 --> 35:06.240]  They want to be able to rob and steal and take whatever they want and it's bad enough to have some corruption government
[35:06.240 --> 35:14.160]  But these globalists have laid out agenda 21 on record to take control of almost all private property to raise taxes and
[35:15.040 --> 35:21.400]  Regulations to bankrupt to you and to create a post industrial post service economy
[35:21.400 --> 35:27.240]  These are quotes by Maury strong club of Rome UN Ted Turner. This is what they're doing
[35:27.960 --> 35:33.120]  They want you to go bankrupt. They want there to only be a few mega corporations
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.200]  This is the stated goal. We're being conquered by a corporate takeover
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.880]  When I say our government was taken over by private banks, I'm not just saying that
[35:49.120 --> 35:55.920]  I'm not just saying that that's what the New World Order is in David Rockefeller's own memoir
[35:55.920 --> 35:59.500]  He says the New World Order is a global corporate system run
[35:59.500 --> 36:04.700]  by international financiers, and he says surely
[36:05.700 --> 36:07.700]  That's a better system
[36:08.020 --> 36:11.020]  than the self-determination of democracies. I
[36:12.140 --> 36:15.360]  Mean go read it. Let's see. They know you're not reading
[36:15.540 --> 36:19.540]  They know I get up here and talk about this people are like, oh, that's ridiculous funny though
[36:19.540 --> 36:24.540]  People are starting to listen the Washington Post looks so silly seeing Bilderberg didn't exist all these years
[36:24.540 --> 36:30.380]  I mean even the last six years is the drudge report every year links to our reports live from Bilderberg and
[36:31.220 --> 36:36.500]  It's hundreds of you know European papers pick up our stuff a clip in the Guardian biggest paper not just in England
[36:36.500 --> 36:38.500]  But in Europe, it's the English speaking paper
[36:39.340 --> 36:41.340]  That's the unifying language over there
[36:42.940 --> 36:45.860]  And and the Washington Post in New York Times just a few years ago
[36:45.860 --> 36:53.460]  We're still saying it didn't exist. Well now they came out last week and said it exists and it's selecting Mitt Romney's running me and
[36:53.460 --> 36:59.180]  And basically said that a Rubio was meeting down there in Latin America at this summit
[36:59.740 --> 37:06.780]  At a Bilderberg steering meeting that our intel said two weeks ago with Jim Tucker. They were gonna have a steering meeting down there
[37:08.260 --> 37:12.780]  Boom why would the Washington Post be admitting that now not only it exists
[37:13.020 --> 37:17.900]  But they're running things because they look like idiots caught lying to you
[37:17.900 --> 37:21.580]  They can only lie in the dark. They can only creep up to you in the dark a
[37:21.580 --> 37:24.420]  Vampire can only creep up
[37:24.900 --> 37:26.700]  Use an analogy in the dark
[37:26.700 --> 37:31.300]  But if you're out there at high noon in the middle of the field folks vampires aren't gonna be able to creep around anymore
[37:31.300 --> 37:33.300]  They're like, okay, I'm a vampire. What's the big deal?
[37:34.220 --> 37:39.340]  Kind of like the Economist Newsweek Washington Post now. They're all world governments good run by bankers
[37:39.340 --> 37:42.500]  They know best, you know, the autocratic technocrats. They know best
[37:42.500 --> 37:47.060]  But still that Alex Jones is bad because he doesn't want us to run things. He's still bad
[37:47.060 --> 37:53.860]  Because you know, he didn't mind being made fun of all those years talking about real issues
[37:54.380 --> 37:57.500]  Give me a document a camp shot right over here, buddy. Thank you
[37:58.340 --> 37:59.860]  Fred
[37:59.860 --> 38:02.780]  look at this this note here and
[38:04.100 --> 38:06.100]  if you
[38:06.100 --> 38:08.100]  Simply go online
[38:08.140 --> 38:12.620]  If you're a radio listener in fact, I'll scan this in and put it up
[38:12.620 --> 38:16.540]  Tomorrow, in fact, I meant to do this. I meant to cover this on Monday, but I'm gonna do it now
[38:18.220 --> 38:20.620]  So I'm gonna do a whole report on this and I've done this
[38:21.500 --> 38:25.340]  Off and on over the years and I bought many of these at coin shops
[38:25.340 --> 38:30.980]  And then they always get lost around the office or whatever and all the piles of data and files and information
[38:30.980 --> 38:32.820]  But my uncle was here
[38:32.820 --> 38:36.820]  Visiting the other day and he said hey, I've heard you talk about United States notes
[38:37.500 --> 38:41.340]  Here's one of those notes. Why don't you show it? So here I am showing it
[38:41.340 --> 38:46.380]  This was reissued by Kennedy in 1963. You can zoom in right there and see nineteen
[38:47.540 --> 38:49.540]  1963
[38:50.780 --> 38:53.180]  He issued it a one month before he was killed
[38:53.180 --> 39:07.060]  And as you can see there it says 1963 and up here it says United States note
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.940]  Now
[39:15.940 --> 39:24.620]  United States note. What is the difference in that and what we have today? He was simply reissuing something
[39:25.220 --> 39:27.220]  That was in existence
[39:27.860 --> 39:34.420]  Prior to 1913 and the Federal Reserve Act. It's as federal as federal express or federal ammunition
[39:34.940 --> 39:41.260]  Yeah, it's not federal. It's a private non-governmental organization with government power. It's an NGO
[39:41.260 --> 39:45.820]  It's the same model in every country in the world the first thing they do when they
[39:46.260 --> 39:50.380]  Bomb your nation and take it over as they install a central bank controlled by them
[39:51.340 --> 39:54.940]  This money the government can issue as a symbol of exchange
[39:56.820 --> 40:03.020]  With zero interest to the government they don't owe somebody to be able to operate and again you can go online and type in
[40:04.020 --> 40:05.940]  United States note
[40:05.940 --> 40:11.940]  Issued by Kennedy and you'll see scans of them online. The guy's actually found one. Good job. There it is in high death for folks watching
[40:12.980 --> 40:15.180]  And then I hold a physical one here in my hand
[40:16.380 --> 40:21.380]  He also signed the executive order to begin the abolishment of the Federal Reserve. They blew his head off in Dallas, Texas
[40:23.940 --> 40:27.340]  And I've talked to the widow of the president and others
[40:28.580 --> 40:34.060]  LBJ and and she said that was the thing that made the elite most angry not trying to end the Vietnam War
[40:34.060 --> 40:40.900]  Not all of it that have been going covertly but to try to get rid of the Federal Reserve because again Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of
[40:40.900 --> 40:42.900]  American City Group
[40:42.900 --> 40:44.900]  Wells Fargo that I mentioned them
[40:45.220 --> 40:52.620]  Those are the banks that are the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve and all of your income tax is Ronald Reagan's
[40:52.700 --> 40:58.060]  Congressional Commission in 81 found they shot him right after his commission came out and then he went and they had some special
[40:58.060 --> 41:04.060]  Surgeries and things gave him some cold blood brain damage. He met the military base and he came out they have to get him drugged up
[41:04.060 --> 41:06.980]  Just to roll him out in front of the crowds after that. That was a soft coup
[41:08.660 --> 41:16.620]  The point is that you start talking about this as a president they kill you or incapacitate you so this is the real government
[41:18.700 --> 41:26.420]  Is the private Federal Reserve and they issue all the money they want their goal is to bankrupt you and to bankrupt all of their
[41:26.420 --> 41:32.420]  Businesses corporations that aren't part of their crony insider deal. That's the new world order and that's now admitted
[41:32.540 --> 41:35.020]  But let me show you some articles. I said I document this
[41:35.380 --> 41:40.580]  Here's my article and video red alert Buffett rule is a criminal scam a variant headline is
[41:41.180 --> 41:44.580]  Massive tax increases to be funded by Banker bailout
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.060]  With Banker bailout money red linked at info wars
[41:50.060 --> 41:56.780]  Dot-com and the video breaks it all down with the articles. What are the articles and I'll show you a document cam of this
[41:57.340 --> 41:59.340]  Washington Post Friday
[41:59.340 --> 42:01.660]  or Thursday how Buffett rule could
[42:02.180 --> 42:04.900]  Still be escaped by the highest earning households, of course
[42:04.900 --> 42:12.100]  They leave themselves trapped doors and ways to get out and then it says later in the paragraph that the richest billionaires are actually exempt from it
[42:12.100 --> 42:18.500]  Boom, why does a rich guy want to raise taxes and use class warfare because the real
[42:18.500 --> 42:23.620]  rich guys control government and got rich off government contracts and government bailouts
[42:24.940 --> 42:29.980]  Buffett is a criminal because he lobbied for the illegal and this was probably the time practice at the time
[42:30.980 --> 42:37.420]  To get rid of the Glass-Steagall act so they could sell fraudulent derivatives into the market. Here's McClatchy
[42:38.580 --> 42:42.140]  Buffett champion of bailout is also leading beneficiary
[42:42.140 --> 42:48.180]  She he wants more tax money for future bailouts, which aren't really bailouts. They hold his hostage
[42:48.180 --> 42:51.500]  They say give us unlimited tax money or we'll implode the economy
[42:51.500 --> 42:58.740]  So a bailouts really just a tax to private banks. So you they want to raise that another article the Federal Reserve wants to raise your taxes
[43:00.100 --> 43:06.620]  For five six even seven dollars a gallon according to fuel industry insiders and economic experts
[43:06.620 --> 43:13.820]  Those are the forecasted fuel prices with no end in sight fight back fuel prices with a fuel saver from air fusion systems dot-com

[43:59.320 --> 44:06.040]  Little over a year ago. I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal
[44:06.040 --> 44:12.800]  That I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here
[44:12.800 --> 44:18.720]  In the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.080]  Minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[44:25.080 --> 44:31.320]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young chevrolet

[45:01.200 --> 45:06.720]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[45:06.720 --> 45:11.440]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[45:11.520 --> 45:16.840]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again

[46:00.360 --> 46:07.240]  You've heard Alex explaining how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions
[46:07.240 --> 46:10.840]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.080]  And how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.800]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator

[47:16.840 --> 47:18.840]  It's Alex Jones
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.840]  Alright, coming up in the
[47:24.840 --> 47:32.840]  Second hour presidential advisor confirms on video that the elite is carrying out occultic rituals
[47:32.840 --> 47:34.840]  David Gergen admits it
[47:34.840 --> 47:36.840]  That video up at infowars.com
[47:36.840 --> 47:38.840]  We talk to him, we're gonna play that in the next hour
[47:38.840 --> 47:42.840]  More on Warren Buffett and how the ultra rich get your tax money
[47:42.840 --> 47:46.840]  What a scam, it's amazing, the secret service, all that's coming up
[47:46.840 --> 47:54.840]  But here is the video audio report with Sean Stone on just some of the high crimes and misdemeanors of Obama
[47:54.840 --> 48:02.840]  It is so important to hold him accountable or other presidents will go even further
[48:02.840 --> 48:08.840]  Imagine the NDAA, the secret arrest, the police state, the insider trading
[48:08.840 --> 48:10.840]  All of it
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.840]  Hiring of the lobbyists, the secrecy, the broken promises
[48:14.840 --> 48:18.840]  Hiring wars under UN command, helping Congress to go to Hades
[48:18.840 --> 48:20.840]  It's criminal
[48:20.840 --> 48:28.840]  Of this year, Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina introduced House Resolution 107 into the United States Congress
[48:28.840 --> 48:30.840]  The Resolution States
[48:30.840 --> 48:38.840]  Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's exclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution
[48:38.840 --> 48:44.840]  Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring
[48:44.840 --> 48:50.840]  That it is the sense of Congress that accept in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States
[48:50.840 --> 49:04.840]  The use of offensive military force by a president without prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress that violates Congress's exclusive power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution
[49:04.840 --> 49:22.840]  Jones intended his resolution to express the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a president without the prior and clear authorization of an act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high cry and misdemeanor under Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.840]  Why does President Barack Obama deserve to be impeached? Here are four reasons
[49:28.840 --> 49:38.840]  Doing little or nothing at all will result in even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income
[49:38.840 --> 50:06.840]  1. The Obama administration not only endorsed the 2008 bailout policy, the funds from which did not go either to homeowners or tax payers protection, but rather to the consolidation of private banks, many of them in Europe. There was no investment of any meaningful type in the physical economy, there was no protection of the American people, but rather an illegal commitment made on behalf of private banking institutions to commit the American people to paying their bills
[50:06.840 --> 50:26.840]  to commit the American people to paying a debt that the American people did not accrue. The trillions of dollars that were pledged to the private banking sector are backed by the assets belonging to the American people. This combines to represent the most clear violation of the principle of the general welfare in the preamble to the Constitution of the United States
[50:26.840 --> 50:40.840]  I also want to be clear about what we will not be doing. The United States is not going to deploy ground troops into Libya. U.S. boots are reportedly on the ground in Libya.
[50:40.840 --> 51:02.840]  2. The Obama administration conducted a war in Libya which it claimed it did not conduct, with American forces that it claimed were not involved to the purpose of overthrowing and then executing ahead of a sovereign state who was held in the custody of insurgent forces financed and militarily supported by the United States, France, Britain and other NATO countries.
[51:02.840 --> 51:18.840]  This was done despite the fact that the United States was either attacked nor threatened with attack by the nation of Libya. Only the Congress, not the President, has the authority under the Constitution to declare war, but the Obama administration believes that it has that authority.
[51:18.840 --> 51:26.840]  Do you think that you can act without Congress to initiate a no fly zone in Syria without congressional approval?
[51:26.840 --> 51:37.840]  3. The administration recently asserted that its actions are above the laws of the United States in an exchange between Obama Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama.
[51:37.840 --> 51:58.840]  4. Our goal would be to seek international permission and we would come to the Congress and inform you and determine how best to approach this, whether or not we would want to get permission from the Congress. I think those are issues we would have to discuss as we decide what to do here.
[51:58.840 --> 52:07.840]  5. What I heard you say is we're going to seek international approval and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do.
[52:07.840 --> 52:19.840]  6. The Obama administration thus does not believe that the Congress has the exclusive power to declare war and accordingly the President should be impeached.
[52:19.840 --> 52:28.840]  Let me welcome Prime Minister Cameron of the United States of New York. Obviously there is an extraordinarily special relationship.
[52:28.840 --> 52:37.840]  3. The Obama administration sides with the imperial power of Great Britain and proudly so in what has been called the special relationship.
[52:37.840 --> 52:51.840]  4. The United States has a result of the false intelligence advocated by Tony Blair, claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and conducted a preventive war against Iraq in 2003.
[52:51.840 --> 52:57.840]  4. Preventive war was declared a crime against humanity by the Nuremberg Statutes of 1947.
[52:57.840 --> 53:08.840]  5. On March 13th of this year, Barack Obama and David Cameron declared their intention to seek the removal of the Syrian regime of President Bashir al-Assad,
[53:08.840 --> 53:14.840]  a regime that has shown no intent of threatening or attacking the United States Republic.
[53:14.840 --> 53:31.840]  This shows Obama's intent to continue a policy of war, for the commission of which the Nazis were sentenced to death in Nuremberg. If President Obama intends to finance, arm or in any way militarily support the rebel factions against the President of Syria,
[53:31.840 --> 53:37.840]  he has a constitutional requirement to approach the Congress for a declaration of war.
[53:37.840 --> 53:46.840]  4. President Obama has committed us, as a country, to a policy of indefinite warfare, including on American soil.
[53:46.840 --> 54:01.840]  On December 31, 2011, Barack Obama signed into law the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, which includes provisions that state that Congress affirms that the authority of the President to use all necessary and appropriate
[54:01.840 --> 54:13.840]  military force pursuant to the authorization for use of military force includes the authority for the armed forces of the United States to detain covered persons pending disposition under the law of war.
[54:13.840 --> 54:26.840]  When Congress defined such covered persons, exempting U.S. citizens from the language, they were rebuked by the Obama Administration which told them to remove U.S. citizens from being precluded.
[54:26.840 --> 54:36.840]  As a result, U.S. citizens can also be detained by the U.S. military indefinitely without due process or civilian trial.
[54:36.840 --> 54:45.840]  This now allows the United States military to arrest and detain without trial American citizens who are deemed enemy combatants.
[54:45.840 --> 54:56.840]  It abrogates the Constitution of the United States in the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures,
[54:56.840 --> 55:10.840]  and that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentiment or indictment of a grand jury and that the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.
[55:10.840 --> 55:16.840]  All of these rights have been abandoned by the United States under President Barack Obama.
[55:16.840 --> 55:29.840]  Further, the President asks the country to believe him when he says that he will not use his power of the executive towards the arrest of U.S. citizens pursuant to the NDA of 2012.
[55:29.840 --> 55:39.840]  However, the executive branch has already ordered the execution of an American citizen in November of 2011.
[55:39.840 --> 55:52.840]  Obama administration has already assassinated an American citizen, Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was never tried in abstentia but was simply indicted by a secret court according to the executive branch,
[55:52.840 --> 56:00.840]  who then ordered his assassination, a murder which also included that of his son, a 16-year-old boy, and a family friend.
[56:00.840 --> 56:11.840]  Considering the President's willingness to assassinate American citizens, are we really ready to entrust him with the power to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens in the course of so-called combat?
[56:11.840 --> 56:23.840]  After all, our Constitution promises the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury, and such trial shall be held in a state where the said crimes shall have been committed.
[56:23.840 --> 56:34.840]  Now is the time if we choose to surrender our republic to the machinations of dictatorship for fear of external threats, terrorism, and other amorphous enemies,
[56:34.840 --> 56:47.840]  then we do not deserve the republic which was given to us by our forefathers and promised to us based on the pledge that it is republic of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[56:47.840 --> 56:56.840]  Consequently, as a republic belonging to us, we are not accountable to the President and the Congress, they are accountable to us.
[56:56.840 --> 57:06.840]  And should the President presume the pictorial powers, regardless of the state of war that he may claim we are now in, he must respond to our demands.
[57:06.840 --> 57:21.840]  To protect American citizens from unauthorized illegal detention by the military, and to annul this National Defense Authorization Act 2012, and if he does not do so, then he deserves to be impeached immediately.
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.840]  But if we say nothing today, where will we be tomorrow?
[57:26.840 --> 57:38.840]  Alright folks, we'll be back with hour number two straight ahead. We're live, it's the 15th day of April 2012.
[57:38.840 --> 57:49.840]  I'm Alex Jones, defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, fighting the offshore banker occupation of the republic.

[58:49.840 --> 58:56.840]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[58:56.840 --> 59:01.840]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[59:01.840 --> 59:08.840]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[59:08.840 --> 59:19.840]  Now there are hundreds of great products at eFoodsDirect.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:32.840]  We are blasting out worldwide coming up in the second half of this hour. I will take your calls on all the different news items I've been covering today.
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:37.840]  I need to get more into Warren Buffett and the new tax increases.
[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:52.840]  I need to also get into the IRS trying to get a bill passed. It's passed the Senate now in the House where you can't travel, can't leave the country, and it'll soon be, can't have a job if the private banker collection group says you haven't paid your taxes, no judge, no jury.
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:56.840]  This is right out of Soviet Russia.
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:08.840]  We're also going to get to Secret Service, dismiss this biggest scandal for agency, and we'll tie that in to Latin American leaders saying decriminalized drugs, it's destroyed their country.
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:15.840]  But the United States says no, because it's one of the big banks that run the drug cartels and launder the money on record.
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:29.840]  It's very, very elementary how simple all this is. If you want to go ahead and get lined up, I'd love to hear from you on this Sunday transmission. It's 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-ALIX.
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:35.840]  I'm going to be honest with you, some days we open the phones up, incredibly intelligent person after person.
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:40.840]  Other days it's folks that sound like they've drunk three bottles of nickel and aren't paying attention.
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:46.840]  If you're going to start, if you don't come out with a cogent quick point or you got a long rambling story, I've got to disconnect you.
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:55.840]  Because we don't screen calls, but then it gets taken advantage of and is weird.
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:07.840]  Because when I do screen calls by saying on this topic, on this issue, like some days I should just ask, computer specialists, what do you think of SOPA and all this new legislation?
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:11.840]  And it would all just be genius callers, thought-provoking, incredible.
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:17.840]  Or if I say police officers calling about this issue, incredible callers, incredibly thought-provoking, profound.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:23.840]  Or military call in, or doctors call in, profound, incredible, breaking news.
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:30.840]  When I just say open phones, whatever you want, it is hellish and you all know it and my listeners are complaining and I'm listening.
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:39.840]  In fact, I am two inches from kicking in phone screening and that doesn't mean if it's not left or right or not what we're looking for, you don't get on.
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.840]  It means you better know how to talk because, look, all talk radio has people that are half asleep calling in.
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:47.840]  It's just they don't let you on air.
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:52.840]  And so my total open door policy is coming to an end.
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:03:02.840]  So if you're halfway into a fifth of Jack Daniel's, like I am, I'm joking, do not call into this radio transmission.
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:03.840]  All right?
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:05.840]  I'm just telling you right now, I love you to death.
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:11.840]  I love you to death and people are like, why does he let this person go for three minutes trying to get their point or three segments?
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:13.840]  I want to revolutionize this show.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:17.840]  It's already really reaching a lot of people hitting on all cylinders.
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:24.840]  I want to go to the next level 877-789-2539 and you don't need to call in and talk bad about the callers.
[1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:25.840]  That'll now become a topic.
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.840]  It's just a crest and crew.
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:29.840]  It's not a request.
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  It is a on my knees order that you guys start slapping me upside the head about callers.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:35.840]  It's so bad.
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:38.840]  Sometimes John Harmon, you know, it's like, come on, get him off, get him off.
[1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:40.840]  Even though it's not his job.
[1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:41.840]  He's like, it's so terrible.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.840]  I mean, I'm great at some things, but I'm not at others.
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:46.840]  So prepare yourselves for that.
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.840]  That way we can get to the next person and I'll try to shut up.
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:50.840]  You can say a lot in a minute.
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:51.840]  I can give a quick comment.
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:53.840]  Move the next person.
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:55.840]  Like I said, another thing on talk radio.
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:02.840]  There's a lot of smart women out there, but I've heard a lot of radio consultants now talking saying, let women talk on talk radio.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:08.840]  And I mean, the host will sit there and it'll be some dingbat and they'll go on and on and on.
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:10.840]  Just like at a third grade level.
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:14.840]  And of course, they say that media period, you know, dumb it down, dumb it down.
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.840]  I'm not dumbing Jack squat down.
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:18.840]  You're smart.
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:19.840]  You know what's going on.
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:22.840]  You don't want a bunch of simplistic bull thrown at you.
[1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:29.840]  I mean, some of this stuff simple we cover, but a lot of it's complex because that's where reality is, is in complexity.
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:33.840]  We've gotten dumbed down and dull because we've been fed a diet of it.
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:34.840]  Me too.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:35.840]  I want to change.
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:38.840]  I want to be a better talk show host, a better fighter for liberty.
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:40.840]  And I will be.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:43.840]  Big video up at info wars.com.
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:45.840]  It's an oldie, but a goodie.
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:46.840]  It's incredible.
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:47.840]  It's like a buried treasure.
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:52.840]  Presidential advisor confirms elite occultic rituals straight ahead.
[1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:58.840]  Then the secret service scandal, the Taliban offensive.
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:05.840]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:05:05.840 --> 1:05:11.840]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:19.840]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:28.840]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:33.840]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.840]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:38.840]  Others don't.
[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:44.840]  Iron jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:49.840]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can

[1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:56.840]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:09.840]  Others don't.
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:11.840]  We are on the march.
[1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:14.840]  The Empire is on the run.
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:22.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:31.840]  789 Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:33.840]  That's the Sunday number.
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:42.840]  It's on XM Channel 166 and 1 in Orlando and many other cities.
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:44.840]  Number one in most demographics.
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:51.840]  Number two in the coveted, what is it, 18-54 in Austin on 590.
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:56.480]  not in talk radio number one period all over the place even on smaller stations
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:01.840]  the big number one juggernaut like 590 in Austin you know it's still a feat to
[1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:05.920]  be better than all the music stations and everybody combined but it is a real
[1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:11.160]  feat with things like 810 a.m. which is a good signal but a relatively new talk
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:15.120]  station that shifted from oldies that carrying us right now a few years ago
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:19.800]  to talk to go from like number five or six in most of the demographics the
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:23.600]  number one across the board I just got to say the instant people meters are
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:28.200]  really showing the power of this broadcast and again the fact that we can
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:33.680]  be on select like little stations in Tennessee 1000 waters and after a couple
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:38.520]  years being on will be number two or number one in many demographics I mean
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:47.080]  that's unheard of my point is freedom and liberty is popular I hear Republican
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.480]  talk show host going it's wrong to tax the rich they're the ones that fund the
[1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:57.120]  economy and hire employees and buy things which is true if it's a real rich
[1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:02.320]  person that develops something people wanted they're a godsend inventors
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:07.120]  artists creators sports people whatever you got money you're spending it great
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:15.640]  that is who makes the economy go to research it but the crony capitalist who
[1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:19.720]  were anti-free market the Rockefeller's the Rothschild's Warren Buffett Ted
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:25.720]  Turner to a greater extent George Soros these are people that made money out of
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:30.520]  government contracts government inside knowledge banker bailouts I mean I read
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:33.760]  to you McClatchy it doesn't get more respected I gotta tell you for mainstream
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:41.280]  newspapers McClatchy news certain newswires news services McClatchy is
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:46.440]  probably one of the only true bona fide news organizations in the United States
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:52.120]  they constantly report accurately my analysis already have it go to them it's
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:56.160]  exactly what I'd say because it's what's going on Bloomberg a little bit to know
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:59.640]  he's an anti-gun piece of garbage the person Bloomberg because it is
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:05.320]  business news businesses want real data corporations do so it's it's a little
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.920]  better to but still nothing compared to McClatchy I mean here's McClatchy and it
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:19.800]  wasn't like it was rocket science it was a fact that Warren Buffett was the
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:25.880]  biggest US beneficiary of the banker bailout that means your tax money he
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.120]  made himself some estimates well one bailout was over 2 billion another was
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:34.720]  over another billion and then these other companies he's invested in it was
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:41.400]  over a trillion bucks and he's like Jeepers Creepers Jiminy Crickets I'm a
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:45.680]  nice old man I eat ice cream every time he's on TV let me have an ice cream I'm
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:51.720]  a harmless old man I didn't get all this power by being a hardcore savage
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:56.960]  scammer no I got it by being a nice old man with Bill and Melinda Gates over
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:02.960]  there yeah yeah I'm a real nice guy and I want to raise taxes on rich people
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:07.400]  anybody make a 250,000 a year in a couple that didn't rich folks with
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:11.480]  inflation that's middle class that's upper middle class and people making a
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:17.200]  hundred and fifty thou or 125 thousand excuse me individually 125 thousand
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:22.960]  individually most municipalities pay police that now you're gonna push them
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.960]  above 40% a tax bracket all these elitists have written loopholes where
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:31.200]  they pay almost no taxes and I read to you last hour the Washington Post from
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:35.040]  Thursday how the Buffett rule could still be escaped by highest earning
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.520]  households and it goes on to say the billionaires are exempt do you think
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:44.400]  some guy like Warren Buffett living for money he always tells you he doesn't
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:47.880]  want money and puts his money in a tax-free foundation where where only
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:55.080]  the profit is taxed and then that's exempt I mean it's such a fraud Buffett
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:11:00.800]  champion of bailout is also leading beneficiary that's McClatchy.com from
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:06.260]  2009 right after the bailout and I mean look he funds the Bill and Melinda
[1:11:06.260 --> 1:11:11.120]  Gates Foundation he's given half the money to he funds most of ABC this week
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:16.160]  in fact it says underwriting they're the biggest sponsor of that show it was
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.600]  Christina Amanpour now it's the other Bilderberg minion Charlie Rose and I
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.560]  mean I don't even watch TV but I've been in hotel rooms over and over again on a
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:28.600]  Sunday waiting for an airplane to fly out of some city I'm doing stuff in and
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:34.080]  it's all I've watched it like ten times last year and every time I watch it the
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:40.240]  entire show is about rich people don't pay taxes but this angel Bill Gates and
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.040]  Warren Buffett want theirs raised and it's Warren Buffett I'm just upset I
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:48.880]  want to raise taxes I don't pay enough he's the guy that lobbied in the 80s
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:52.760]  and 90s on record I've got the articles right here to put the loopholes in where
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:59.800]  does it pay it's a total fraud oh my gosh yeah there's zero hedge Buffett bailout
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:04.400]  of BAC since stock to early August levels and it goes through the billions of
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:13.920]  bucks he got okay go read McClatchy and how he made billions actually actually
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:18.600]  one part of the bailout was 25 billion Wells Fargo to him I mean personally a
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:24.720]  couple Bill yeah he wants to raise your taxes because he loves you he takes the
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:30.920]  money through government and gives it to himself in banker bailouts if I didn't
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:34.120]  criminal I don't know what is now we're going to break and coming back with some
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:37.760]  more news than your phone calls but this hasn't been seen in years this is in my
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:44.000]  film martial law and in my film the order of death I run into David Gargan in
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:51.760]  2004 eight years ago at the RNC this is the coral robe of four administrations
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:56.000]  and I bring up a cult rituals that I that I've snuck in and videotaped I'm
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.840]  not the weirdo talking about it they're into it and he blew up at me about it
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:03.880]  because I and I showed him news articles like on screen when I talk about it I
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:06.280]  show the article where it talks about people running around naked in his
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:09.920]  quotes and it's on record Vanity Fair stuck in two years ago and got arrested
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.840]  but it was just men having sex with each other everywhere okay this is the
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:16.640]  Christian conservatives what they're doing right now because it's all fake you
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:19.400]  don't even get in the club unless you do that let's go to this clip of David
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:23.040]  Gargan blowing up at me here it is a cultic ritual the video at info wars
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:30.120]  dot com in the fall of 2004 while in New York to cover the Republican National
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:35.920]  Convention we ran into David Gergen the Carl Rove of four presidential
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:41.720]  administrations one last question I read a Washington Times article many years
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:45.560]  ago where you had a comment about the organization and then now it's been in
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:48.280]  the Wall Street Journal it's been a lot of different newspapers and that's the
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:54.960]  Bohemian Grove and back in what was it 1996 when you joined as a Clinton
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:58.280]  advisor they were the Republicans were criticizing you oh what about Bohemian
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:02.200]  Grove and then you counter and then you countered them by saying hey I don't run
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.200]  around in the woods naked what did that mean here is the before mentioned
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:09.240]  Washington Times article where he said I didn't run around naked like they do I
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:13.240]  don't I don't know what I don't know what quote you're referring to I'm not
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:20.760]  aware of any quote like that listen I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove I
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.480]  like the folks who come there and it's really inappropriate for me to talk
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:30.520]  about a the group beyond that thank have you been there for the ceremony with
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:35.720]  the cremation of care frankly that's that I don't think that's something I need

[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:53.840]  under I don't know anything about you and I don't know about your film but if

[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:01.120]  releasing that film and I don't respect you for that really I'm sorry you took
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:03.920]  an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film and you
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.360]  did you have an understanding when you went in there no did you crash it yes
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:10.360]  yeah and it has no trespassing signs there too doesn't know they put my

[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:20.080]  not that was not a gentleman anything to do but what about the ritual is the
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:22.760]  ritual gentlemanly
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:32.440]  simulated human sacrifice sir everything I don't owe you this comment

[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:53.360]  the radio right now simply go to info wars.com it's part of a two-hour film
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.400]  that I produced to great risk to my name and person and treasure that's up there
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:03.040]  for free on the site you can also buy a DVD of it the order of death is the name
[1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:08.600]  of it two films on my infiltration of the bohemian grove but here he is
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:16.440]  blowing up at me and getting getting very very upset about this well he hasn't
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:20.280]  gotten the big blow-up yet he thought I'd give it an oath to go in and be part
[1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:24.440]  of the ritual and again it's on record and they show what they've said is accurate
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:27.600]  representations of skull and bones this is like the grown-up skull and bones
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:30.840]  most of the members are former skull and bones at bohemian grove many of them
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:37.000]  are this is what the grown-ups do but if you see the Good Shepherd film that was
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:42.920]  produced and directed by Robert De Niro with Matt Damon in it about the CIA being
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:46.960]  founded out of secret societies like skull and bones the secret societies are
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:53.320]  the old name for intelligence agencies shows men naked wrestling in feces and
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:56.800]  that's what they do and they have sex with each other and the rest of it and
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.280]  and my whole issue is they claim they're these Christian conservatives none of
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:06.120]  that is even real that's a total facade to make you trust the government what's
[1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:10.960]  going on the occult means hit hidden or secret government the national security
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:16.600]  state is an occult secret society system it is a hidden state let's go to David
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:20.680]  Gergen much bigger than Carl Rove his own nickname turd blossom by the
[1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:25.320]  president because they're all into scat scatological issues let's go ahead and
[1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:33.280]  go to this clip of Gergen blowing up when I bring it up here it is sir
[1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:39.360]  everything you I don't owe you this comment you you have you this is what's
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:42.680]  called ambush journalism and I disrespect you for that as well so thank
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:50.680]  you for the original that's leave your damn business oh listen listen you go
[1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:55.920]  around and and make understandings with people and violate them you ambush
[1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:59.560]  people on the streets when that's that's inappropriate form of journalism if you
[1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:03.680]  wish to practice that's fine but don't ask others to respect you for it if you
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:06.720]  wanted to you can do your free American like anything you want if you want to be
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:10.600]  uncivil and rude and ungenerally that's up to you but don't expect the rest of
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:15.040]  us to say oh well you're Mr. Gergen I'm sorry nobody says policy in there we try
[1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:19.280]  to be gentlemen and obviously you don't belong there weaving spiders come out
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:28.720]  here yeah that is a three pointer hmm look how strangely behave when we brought
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:34.080]  it up why is he acting so secretive and why did he get so angry when he
[1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:40.160]  discovered that we snuck in you see they take it very very seriously this is one
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:45.000]  of the hallmarks of the occult and secret societies the word occult means
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.600]  secret secrecy is part of their religion they revel in it and when it's
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:58.680]  violated they become extremely angry how widespread is the occult the answer is
[1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:05.000]  extremely widespread occultism in our society and particularly in our
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.120]  government at the highest levels of corporate America is rampant it is a
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:16.160]  well-publicized fact all right that the Reagan's had every aspect of their life

[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.280]  and die by that I'm okay off record they go the public are dumb animals and
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:11.200]  don't want your help watch you're gonna help them and they'll never care they
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:17.320]  want to be slaves you should join us I've been told that repeatedly so many
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:21.640]  ways it'll make your head spin well you know what let's just say the public are
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:26.400]  like a bunch of adult children I'm not doing bad stuff just because they're a
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:33.640]  bunch of idiots because the evil of the New World Order is unbelievable and it
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:38.600]  blows back on the elites as well and you know one reason I thought of this
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:41.720]  today was I was thinking about all the real scandals governments involved in
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:44.800]  there's these scandals out where different federal agencies you know
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:49.920]  spending millions of dollars going to Las Vegas and paying themselves to go and
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:55.640]  party for days and paying themselves bonuses for planning the trips and I'm
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:00.440]  like yeah that's bad but that's not like stealing trillions of dollars and then
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:03.400]  giving it to yourself and your companies and then lecturing everyone to pay
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:07.960]  more taxes to get the rich guys to shut down the middle class when you
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:12.880]  actually just want bank or bailout money I mean we pay our income tax to the
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:17.600]  Federal Reserve through the IRS that's all Buffett's doing is it's a new scam
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.000]  of class envy hey poor people want to get the guy that's got five dollars more
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.880]  than you get taxes raised you'll show the rich guy and I guess that's why the
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:31.360]  poor get poor they're like I love something to get suckered into okay get
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:35.560]  the rich guys they're like that's right and hey support Daphne get that'll give
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:41.240]  you more jobs shut up Ross Perot it's not gonna take in their jobs Al Gore said
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:46.360]  and he was all real smug Larry remember Larry King debates this is a good deal
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:52.320]  Larry Ross pros like giant second sound it's gonna shut us down tax incentives
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:56.560]  to move offshore it's over no more let me explain economy you have no class
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:02.200]  they can buy goods they want a monopoly Larry and this isn't even about free
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:06.640]  market they want to shut down this economy this is incredible no let me act
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:13.080]  like a Nelly from Tennessee let me act trendy global warming get me money
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:16.360]  and everybody just goes oh my god he's acting trendy fall down and worship
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:22.400]  Al Gore it's the same thing oh every time guys type in Warren Buffett with an
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:26.640]  ice cream cone because I'm serious I don't I see it on magazines newspapers

[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:41.280]  of different news services reporting basically the same thing here's one oh
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:46.640]  the IRS you're not going anywhere Fox News here's another one Forbes forget
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:52.880]  travel of the other IRS and it just goes on from there that's at info wars.com
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:58.840]  now if you're not a student of just basic history only Nazi Germany and Soviet
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:03.480]  Russia would restrict people's passports if they weren't in good with the
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:08.640]  derpure first they took those before you disappeared and you know I don't have
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:11.880]  time to play cuz I want to go to your calls but the first minute in fact we'll
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:14.360]  do it at the end of the show will you guys queue up the first minute of
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:20.760]  martial law 9-1-1 rise the police state cuz I made that in 2004 and I say in the
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:25.560]  future well the narrator I wrote the PC Red the narrator says in the future they
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:28.760]  will secretly arrest citizens there'll be checkpoints on highways and you won't
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:32.680]  be able to travel outside controlled zones and I break it down how do I know
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:38.760]  because I study what Homeland Security is Homeland Security is a federal take
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:44.360]  over by foreign banks and the Federal Reserve's collection agency the IRS
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:49.040]  it's the end of the country they want to bankrupt you so so I just want to give
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:52.480]  you that message our government's had problems in the past but it had a
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:35:00.000]  policy of prosperity the rich elites we had new rising tide races all ships the
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.080]  old elites built giant museum districts in every city that ain't the way it goes
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:11.520]  now okay this is Jenna 21 we're not in Kansas anymore so I'm here to tell you
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.960]  it just gets darker it gets worse from here if we don't wake up that we got
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:21.600]  really bad people in charge okay and I'm not some naive person that thinks the
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.880]  world's ever perfect we're supposed to have Angel cake government they make us
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:29.920]  think they're on top corruption oh some people went to Las Vegas on federal funds
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:34.160]  all the secret services hiring hookers I'm not saying that's good but that's
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:39.160]  nothing compared to Warren Buffett calling for tax increases and the
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:43.600]  Federal Reserve that he works for openly says they want it to pay more money to
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:48.400]  foreign banks who then give themselves giant bonuses and it's so big even some
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:52.000]  of my own researchers go I know it's true but it's just I don't know how to
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.480]  articulate it we pay taxes and Warren Buffett gets it yes yes that's it it's
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:04.360]  just it's so over the top I get it okay I get it I know it's hard to deal with
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:09.040]  being screwed this hard but just going oh it's it's too horrible I can't look no
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:14.320]  no more taxes cut them look at Europe they have like 80% tax rates one way or
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.040]  the other in some areas of Europe and there's never enough money this country
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:24.800]  had on average on average about a 5% federal tax rate maybe a 6-7% state
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:29.760]  tax one way or the other and we had 10 12 15% growth rates that no one's
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:35.760]  matched until 1913 from our founding in 1776 1798 when our country really are
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:40.360]  1789 when it really got going through over 10% growth rates just milk and
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:44.520]  honey but just unbelievable government is a cancer government doesn't want to
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:50.800]  stabilize the economy it wants to shut it down they admit the carbon taxes are
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:55.000]  to shut it down and they say these carbon taxes will supercharge our economy
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.200]  it's the opposite so people are like Alex you got to cover the secret service
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:04.160]  with a bunch of hookers and I'm like female hookers what it wasn't like
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:07.680]  where the UN's murdering small children or blowing their heads off and making
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.720]  snuff films that no one wants to cover I don't want to hear about it I'm for
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.480]  decriminalization of prostitution not because I agree with it but because it
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:20.200]  takes the criminality and the money out of it just like Latin American leaders
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:26.880]  say decriminalized drugs legalized it to the point of regulation not full
[1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:30.920]  legalization and Europe's done it many areas crime rates get cut by about half
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:36.280]  drug use plummets but of course the US that means the banks that launder the
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.600]  money Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Wells Fargo all of them on record caught you
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:44.800]  know laundering drug money looking up hundreds of billions a year they won't
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.480]  believe it just just type in big banks caught laundering drug money and it's
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:51.800]  every one of them all the big ones just but just just Warren Buffett's outfit
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:57.880]  376 Bill in two years but he's a nice old man in fact show the image you found
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:02.360]  well I said you only found one image they go no it's thousands and sure enough
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:06.680]  it's hundreds of individual photos of him eating ice cream as a prop look I'm a
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:10.680]  non-threatening old man look I'm friendly ice cream real villains don't
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:14.680]  dress up in Darth Vader outfits or Hitler outfits anymore they dress up
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:18.000]  with an ice cream cone and act like mr. Magoo when he's really a hardcore
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.960]  eugenicist and if you don't know what that is you better look it up and I'm
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:26.960]  risking my life doing this you know Melinda Gates who heads up this hundred
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:30.120]  billion dollar foundation against humanity she came out in Germany two
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:34.520]  weeks or last week and attacked those of us saying this and and said that we're
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:38.560]  gonna cost lives talking saying they want to reduce population kind of a
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.640]  threat you know out of their old nomenclature oh I got the message honey
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:46.160]  I got you didn't think I didn't get it before I did this you didn't think I
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:52.560]  wasn't all in I'm done hold an ice cream cone up in front of me I see who you

[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:08.520]  Prometheus review online just type in Alex Jones Prometheus to see it the

[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:21.720]  sweet little old man with an ice cream cone you're wondering why almost every
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:25.280]  photo he's got a ice cream cone he'll be on the news and go hold on and start
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:35.640]  licking an ice cream cone it's all a sick gimmick see I'm an advertising guy
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:40.000]  I mean that's what I am instinctively I went to school saw it but I don't use
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.160]  tricks to sell I use the truth to sell I'm like a guy who's a magician who
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:48.120]  tells you all the tricks

[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:24.360]  covered it 17 years ago it's all declassified DNA data banks they say
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:28.440]  you're owned it's called human resources it's hidden in plain view you are seen as
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:33.880]  cold you were seen as trees yours you are seen as a resource as an animal by
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:37.400]  these people yes you're you were held as collateral by the Federal Reserve by
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:46.000]  Warren Buffett go ahead so that makes us enslaved yeah yeah and I don't like it
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.280]  I mean to be one thing of all as a slave they put cancer viruses vaccines they
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:53.600]  push on little kids these are horrible people see they've already stolen the
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:56.960]  whole world they don't like having to take care of us they want to kill us now
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:05.040]  you got that I bless you sir yes we're enslaved well said Trey God bless him
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:10.600]  David in North Dakota you're on the air well Alex thanks for taking my call
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:15.240]  here I just listening to that last caller there is just there's so many
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:19.760]  things to say here but I just want to make a couple of points as far as the IRS
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:24.880]  and especially the IRS I suppose in the Federal Reserve what people have to
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:30.960]  understand about that whole entity is that the people are actually funding
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:35.280]  their own destruction and I find it rather odd that when I talk to people
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:39.120]  that they don't understand that and they really don't understand fractal banking
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:47.120]  and how how this whole system works and they really are are you know destroying
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.200]  us I blame the elite for the conscious evil but I blame the general public
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:55.440]  because they're dragging me along with them for like going ah whatever I'm
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:00.320]  lazy folks exactly that you better find out the difference between a US note and
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:05.160]  a Federal Reserve note you better because because our forebears weren't
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:08.800]  perfect but they wanted freedom they fight to have it so look at all the
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:12.120]  liberty we got five percent of the world's population at half the wealth
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  bubble why is that that's very true see I just want to make a couple of more points here if I can you know as far as just a couple of things you know as far as laws that are passed in the
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:34.240]  that comes from Congress you know it from what I understand or from what I read
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:39.040]  about all is that any law that's passed that is unconstitutional really isn't a
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:43.920]  law yeah Marbury versus Madison plus just basic human rights Magna Carta 1215
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:49.360]  yeah Congress passes a law saying saying that Obama can can can murder
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:52.480]  children in the White House lawn it's not in void they pass the law send the
[1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:55.820]  president can secretly arrest and kill citizens it's not in void it is the
[1:42:55.820 --> 1:43:01.640]  arrest warrant for treason it is the proof of their criminality when you're
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:08.360]  out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.440]  unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a

[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.520]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.240]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:13.360]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.800]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:21.520]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:26.040]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:11.000]  is the first 50 seconds from my three-hour tour de force martial law 9-1-1
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:17.560]  rise the police state 2004 this is the voiceover I wrote by and the narrator
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:24.080]  predicting what we're now living in just eight years later here it is in the
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.640]  early years of the 21st century terrorism was used by governments across
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:37.120]  the world as a pretext to scare their populations into submission life became
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:41.440]  a surveillance grid nightmare with every individual's actions ruthlessly
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:48.680]  cataloged and recorded by the state secret arrests checkpoints and warrantless
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:55.080]  searches spread the final incremental march of the police state culminating
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:49:02.080]  an open martial law this is the story of how the elite sold their people into
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:06.760]  slavery and scared the once proud and brave people of the West and to
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:12.560]  submitting to being cannon fodder in wars for world domination
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:21.640]  all right that's martial law nine wall and rise the police state three hours
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:26.480]  of total documentation they'll watch it online just type it in it's millions of
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:32.560]  views nothing like our Valhalla Obama deception and other films but it's
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.600]  racial out of people resistance is victory let's go to Dave and North
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:43.840]  Dakota Dave you're on the air thank you Alex I just want to make one more one
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:48.720]  more point here you know you know in this info war whether whether it be a
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:54.080]  physical war or or an info war I think people need to know who their enemy is
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:58.480]  as well you know know who the enemy is so that you can win the battle I mean
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.240]  it's really hard to win a battle unless you know who your enemy is and then I
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:06.520]  encourage everyone I mean to read the Constitution Declaration depends on the
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:10.600]  bill all right and the federalist papers yeah what's going on I got a jump is
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:13.920]  totally illegal make no mistake people ask they're violating the
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:18.400]  Constitution they've already butchered it and with it all our protections were
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.800]  just like somebody in Mexico or North Korea now unless we stand up to say no
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:27.360]  I mean folks if you don't say no now you were warned good point today Eric in
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:31.880]  California got to move quick go ahead welcome yes Alex I'm thankful and
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:38.440]  proud member prison planet and my my point today is I think that we're
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:43.920]  jumping the gun with the impeachment of Barack Obama and I believe that we
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:49.800]  should be moving more towards the wrong amount is an ill ineligible incumbent to
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:53.480]  your bird sure but the courts I mean obviously he's not who he says he's got
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:59.400]  three other names everything shield it's all been proven fake but again the fact
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:02.880]  is he launched wars and Congress said you've got to get approval and he said
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:07.640]  no I don't the UN is my boss that violates the Constitution on its face
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:12.760]  totally impeachable get rid of it but don't don't you think that maybe they
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:16.880]  want him impeach so that they can keep these court appointments no they would
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:20.280]  have impeached him if they wanted him impeached do you see the establishment
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:27.320]  trying to impeach him no well listen he's probably gonna get another term I
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:32.160]  think Romney's a ringer Romney Romney supports everything he supports he's a
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:35.720]  different color he's from different area of the country but that's the only
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:38.880]  difference I mean all these conservatives going I like meant Romney
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:43.240]  he's not for Obamacare he wrote the model of it I hear people on talk radio
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:48.560]  going he'll repeal it oh man the elite want this Obama and Romney are puppets
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:53.280]  why do we then impeach a puppet to punish the globalist and let them know
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:58.400]  we're not gonna put up with it we've got to start punishing these people people
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:04.320]  like well boosted stuff like this yeah and it's getting worse under Obama what's
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:09.480]  coming next it's like well they've been taking our rights for a long time yeah
[1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:14.000]  that's getting worse good points though Eric I appreciate your calling on a
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.400]  jump Robert in Florida you're on the air go ahead Robert
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:23.000]  Alex thank you very much I have been listening to you for about five years I've

[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:13.800]  David Ike about three years before I found you but it started in the in the
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:20.520]  late 90s and traveling from Mexico up to the states my car I would pick up close
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:24.960]  to coast going through the mountains and I'd stop and listen to it and from
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:29.160]  there it grew and then I heard you on coast to coast once and there was a
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:32.760]  battle like between you and David Ike at the beginning some years back and then
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:37.120]  you reconciled which I don't know David's on Tuesday you're beautiful and I love
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:43.120]  you closing comment okay closing comment we can't stop we can't give up and we
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:46.720]  gotta get Ron Paul as president exactly well I'm gonna say something about Ron
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:50.600]  Paul and thank you for the call he wins by running and injecting ideas they
[1:53:50.600 --> 1:53:54.440]  stole the early states he was the front runner all the polls and numbers showed
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:53:57.800]  that they stole it then people say well he's not winning I'll go to Romney and
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:01.960]  so now he's not really winning but he was winning early on they did steal at
[1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:07.240]  Maine Iowa that's total fact but again we gain ground each time and we won't
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:10.440]  folks up most people now know the Federal Reserve is private people didn't
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:15.800]  know that years ago it's very very exciting and by the way a lot to coast
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:19.720]  to coast that that's one of the most common things we hear as people first
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:22.960]  learned about us coast to coast a.m. that's on many of the affiliates we're
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:29.400]  on who's up next here don't get in South Carolina go ahead hey what's up Alex
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:35.000]  worldwide transmission yeah I've been following you for about 15 years now and
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.560]  I've been walked in the New World Order for the mid 80s there's only one thing I
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:44.080]  want to say and that is that we have divorced God from our reality and we
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:47.440]  don't see God's hand in the movements that are taking no we've made we've
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:52.080]  made government our God and if you don't believe in the devil fine but this
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:56.280]  government might as well be the devil so absolutely you're right it starts when
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:00.000]  we get on our knees the problem is went to church this morning they were
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:03.520]  worshiping the police state so the churches have been taken over well
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:06.920]  that's not the point I want to make what I'm point I want to make is that God
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:10.920]  has in a heavenly agenda that supersedes the New World Order agenda and
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:16.000]  relegates it to just a sub sub part of God's heavenly agenda and God's agenda
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.240]  is being worked out but we don't see it because we have divorced them from our
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:24.720]  reality and now I agree with you I agree with you this is a test the evil is
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:28.040]  there to separate the wheat from the chaff great points jamming another
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:30.760]  Chris in Wisconsin trying to get to everybody here of course we won't
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:37.320]  Chris go hi Alex I talked to you the first time about a year ago I read my
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:42.760]  script for the New World Order fails video regarding the Hutari tribe they've
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:47.040]  been back in the news lately and in the same spirit of preemptive defense a few
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:51.120]  months ago I heard some really awful slanderous lies about someone I've
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:55.560]  respected for a long long time on the radio so I started up a blog instead at
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:56:01.280]  wordpress.com it's called I punched out Jesse Ventura so it's I punched out
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:05.760]  Jesse Ventura that wordpress yeah that's just a total sigh up it turns out
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:09.640]  news corps published that book saying that and then never told people they
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.800]  were selling the book or it was their imprint when they had that guy on and
[1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:17.480]  Ventura says he's gonna take legal action on him great point let's jam in
