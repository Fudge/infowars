[00:00.000 --> 00:15.740]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.740 --> 00:22.220]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[00:22.220 --> 00:42.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42.880 --> 00:45.000]  Be honest with yourselves.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.960]  In all the history of modern media, have you ever seen them demonize someone more than
[00:49.960 --> 00:52.740]  they have yours truly?
[00:52.740 --> 00:58.920]  Ask yourself why is the corporate media, why is Hollywood so desperately afraid of me?
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.320]  Why do they lie and twist my every word and then desperately tell you not to listen to
[01:04.320 --> 01:05.320]  me?
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.920]  It's because, ladies and gentlemen, I've got their number.
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.960]  I've done the research and it's unbelievable the crimes they're openly committing.
[01:13.960 --> 01:16.200]  They think you're idiots.
[01:16.200 --> 01:17.680]  They think you're morons.
[01:17.680 --> 01:21.720]  They brag on c-span that you have the attention of a goldfish.
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.160]  Zuckerberg says my users, trust me, they're dumb.
[01:26.160 --> 01:27.160]  You know what?
[01:27.160 --> 01:29.040]  I don't think you're a dumb.
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.640]  I think you have soul and art in mind and I believe they've been bombarding you with
[01:33.640 --> 01:38.640]  chemicals and biologicals and brainwashing from birth via television until you don't
[01:38.640 --> 01:41.040]  know even what universe you're living in.
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.120]  So I'm here to streak you awake because if we don't come together, the globalists are
[01:46.120 --> 01:51.560]  going to be able to totally dominate our species and destroy us forever.
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.320]  Actually tune into the show at infowords.com for yourself.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.440]  Write down some notes and then search out the terms and issues I'm covering and find
[02:00.440 --> 02:05.040]  out, ladies and gentlemen, the reason they fear info wars and myself so much is that
[02:05.040 --> 02:07.200]  we are simply the rabbit hole.
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.520]  It's up to you to take the red pill and find out how deep it goes.
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.000]  The matrix doesn't want you to take that pill.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.720]  I just want you to know all I am offering is the truth.
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.920]  I may look through a scanner darkly and distort some things in my own mind, but the final
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.760]  equation I'm trying to tell the truth and that's why I've changed the world.
[02:28.760 --> 02:32.000]  So find out what the enemy's so scared of right now.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.240]  Find out what I'm actually saying for yourself and not what they're telling you, I said.
[02:37.240 --> 02:39.720]  Globalists want you to sleep so they can live.
[02:39.720 --> 02:43.000]  I want you to awaken so we can all have a future together.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.880]  I'm Alex Jones, visit infowars.com today and find out why I am the public enemy number
[02:49.880 --> 02:50.880]  one.
[02:50.880 --> 02:57.360]  All right, and that was Alex Jones and I'm David Knight here live in studio.
[02:57.360 --> 03:01.840]  We have an amazing amount of news that you may think that you've heard everything there
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.760]  is to hear about fake news, but just within the last couple of days we've had major retractions
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.840]  from the New York Times, a paper of record from the AP Jake Tapper is putting out fake
[03:11.840 --> 03:16.880]  news about Donald Trump trying to blackmail Joe and Mika and holding up a fake national
[03:16.880 --> 03:17.960]  inquire cover.
[03:17.960 --> 03:21.760]  We have a stage video of a refugee drowning.
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.040]  We're going to take a look at that and then Carl Bernstein coming out and saying we have
[03:26.040 --> 03:31.520]  a malignant presidency saying that we have to have the mainstream media attack this in
[03:31.520 --> 03:34.440]  a way that we've never had this happen before.
[03:34.440 --> 03:39.440]  And then as we see at the top of Drudge, we see a tweet that somebody started on Reddit
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.520]  where they basically showed it was a clip of Donald Trump during the wrestling days,
[03:45.520 --> 03:46.520]  body slamming somebody.
[03:46.520 --> 03:49.560]  And of course, we all know that wrestling is not real folks, right?
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.200]  Maybe they could figure that out and they are telling us that don't worry.
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.160]  We have this Shakespeare play where we make somebody look as much like Donald Trump as
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.880]  we can so we can stab him to death and applaud for that in New York City.
[04:01.880 --> 04:08.520]  And now the media is having fits saying Trump is promoting violence against CNN.
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.560]  I mean, this is a cartoon that you see here.
[04:10.560 --> 04:12.560]  There's nobody specifically targeted.
[04:12.560 --> 04:14.040]  That's a key difference there.
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.880]  They got just a CNN block over somebody's face that he's throwing around there in the
[04:18.880 --> 04:19.880]  arena.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.680]  And what they're looting to is the fact that they are losing so badly.
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.280]  We have a White House aide saying fake news is collapsing in on itself and it absolutely
[04:29.280 --> 04:30.280]  is.
[04:30.280 --> 04:31.760]  That's what that meme is about.
[04:31.760 --> 04:32.760]  We're going to talk about that.
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.760]  We're going to talk about war building up in North Korea as well as the Democrats trying
[04:37.760 --> 04:41.160]  to hide election information from the Trump administration.
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.160]  That's right.
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.680]  They've been telling everybody that it wasn't rigged.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.680]  We know that it was.
[04:44.680 --> 04:45.680]  Stay with us.
[04:45.680 --> 04:57.680]  We'll be right back.
[04:57.680 --> 05:02.760]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[05:02.760 --> 05:08.240]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.

[05:18.640 --> 05:22.760]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.960]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.200]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[06:02.680 --> 06:11.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[06:11.680 --> 06:21.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight on this Sunday, July 2nd, 2017.
[06:21.960 --> 06:25.600]  We've got July 4th is right around the corner and we've got Obama warning us, don't get
[06:25.600 --> 06:28.800]  too patriotic, don't get into that nationalism.
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.800]  At the same time he's doing this in Indonesia, his real home country, the place that he grew
[06:33.800 --> 06:41.960]  up for his CIA mother and his father that raised him, Sataro, was involved in that brutal
[06:41.960 --> 06:45.160]  regime that you don't hear anything about in the United States because they were our
[06:45.160 --> 06:51.320]  killers, they were the CIA killers and they had a massive purge there that was politically
[06:51.320 --> 06:57.160]  based and he grew up there, went to a madrasa there and he's down there telling everybody
[06:57.160 --> 07:03.240]  that we should not be too nationalistic and that we only have a temporary loss of American
[07:03.240 --> 07:04.240]  leadership.
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.700]  But don't worry, we're gonna get back into the climate change, the globalism that he's
[07:07.700 --> 07:12.440]  pushing in Jakarta as he's telling us, don't get very patriotic on the 4th of July weekend.
[07:12.440 --> 07:15.400]  Well, we're not gonna pay any attention to it and there's gonna be some people who are
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.200]  lighting up for freedom in Vegas, we're gonna talk about that as well.
[07:19.200 --> 07:23.840]  Vegas has sweetened the pot, they've upped the ante on putting down the war on drugs
[07:23.840 --> 07:28.480]  and it is now legal, they had four states you may remember in the election in November
[07:28.480 --> 07:34.400]  that legalized marijuana and Nevada is the first one to implement it starting this weekend.
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.000]  But they have left a lot of tripwires for people and we're gonna tell you about that
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.400]  and you need to be very careful if you're going there for tourism because they have
[07:43.400 --> 07:48.520]  left some very dangerous tripwires in there in terms of restrictions on how you can use
[07:48.520 --> 07:54.520]  this supposedly now legal substance, we'll see what they've left in there.
[07:54.520 --> 07:58.000]  Also we have White House, it's talking about how the White House aide went on radio and
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.080]  said fake news is collapsing in on itself and we're gonna start with that before we
[08:03.080 --> 08:07.800]  get the preparations for war, Trump is gonna be calling the Chinese and Japanese leaders
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.320]  later today.
[08:09.320 --> 08:14.160]  That is getting very, very touchy, we've had some encounters on the artificial islands
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.600]  that the Chinese have built in the Philippine Bay there and so we're going to be talking
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.600]  about that as well.
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.760]  But let's talk about what's going on with fake news first because today, just the last
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.320]  couple of days, ever since Donald Trump went with Joe and Mika, things have really been
[08:31.320 --> 08:37.000]  changing very quickly and Donald Trump is saying, let's play this clip with what he
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.160]  says about the fake media, he says, they're trying to silence us but we will not let them,
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.800]  let's play that clip.
[08:44.800 --> 08:55.280]  The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them because the people know
[08:55.280 --> 08:58.200]  the truth.
[08:58.200 --> 09:05.160]  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House but I'm president and they're
[09:05.160 --> 09:12.160]  not.
[09:12.160 --> 09:23.640]  I guess he stole that line from Al Franken, right?
[09:23.640 --> 09:24.640]  Al Franken and you're not?
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.160]  Well, actually, I'm president and you're not and that goes for you too, Al Franken.
[09:30.160 --> 09:39.160]  Let's get back to what actually happened because it's been a big couple of days and
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.920]  of course, this all began about 10 days ago, remember when we had CNN, get caught in a
[09:44.920 --> 09:46.280]  fake story.
[09:46.280 --> 09:49.920]  They pulled it back, they started saying, we're going to have to have review at the
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.720]  vice president level within CNN of any of these Russian stories.
[09:54.720 --> 09:59.360]  We had the Democrats saying, we need to pull back on this, we're overplaying it, we're
[09:59.360 --> 10:01.800]  doing this to the exclusion of other issues.
[10:01.800 --> 10:06.400]  They realized that they had jumped the shark, then he had CNN fire three people, then we
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.600]  had the James O'Keeffe revelations that came out throughout the week.
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.160]  But now in the last couple of days, what we've had is the New York Times and the AP telling
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.520]  us that no, actually, there weren't 17 intelligence agencies.
[10:20.520 --> 10:23.720]  They've been lying to us since December.
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.720]  Remember that?
[10:24.720 --> 10:28.680]  That story and we're going to talk about how many thousands of stories, how many times
[10:28.680 --> 10:32.800]  that has been repeated, that quite frankly came from Hillary Clinton.
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.880]  And the fact that they continue to repeat that Hillary Clinton lie and did so even before
[10:37.880 --> 10:43.740]  the campaign was over, tells you that the intelligence agencies, that law enforcement
[10:43.740 --> 10:47.600]  agencies were in with Hillary Clinton as were the news meeting.
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.360]  We're going to talk about the Hatch Act and their legal culpability in this as well.
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.080]  But then in addition to this, we've had Jake Tapper then come out and say, Joe and Mika
[10:57.080 --> 11:00.560]  were threatened to be blackmailed by Donald Trump.
[11:00.560 --> 11:06.040]  And then he shows a national inquire cover that was totally fake.
[11:06.040 --> 11:11.240]  And of course, there wasn't any evidence issued for that, except just that they said that
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.320]  he was, if they didn't do such and such, which they didn't do, that Donald Trump is going
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.360]  to have some fake stories put out about them or something or tell the truth about them,
[11:19.360 --> 11:21.040]  which didn't happen.
[11:21.040 --> 11:22.880]  So where's the blackmail?
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.880]  I don't know.
[11:23.880 --> 11:25.640]  I guess it's all in Jake Tapper's mind.
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.720]  Maybe if we could see inside that fake issue of the national inquire, maybe the details
[11:30.720 --> 11:33.560]  are in there, inside that fake issue of the national inquire.
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.440]  Then we have Carl Bernstein come out, one of the venerable reporters who was involved
[11:38.440 --> 11:41.040]  in the Nixon coup, the Watergate coup.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.680]  That was truly a coup.
[11:42.680 --> 11:48.240]  You need to understand that in context, that truly was a coup against Richard Nixon that
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.440]  was done with involvement of the FBI at the highest levels, just as we're seeing now.
[11:53.440 --> 11:56.600]  The collusion between the press, between the FBI, between other agencies, although now
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.120]  we have a lot more intelligence agencies and they have a lot more capability of doing that
[12:01.120 --> 12:02.120]  type of thing.
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.520]  But Carl Bernstein is coming out and saying that this is calling for a different kind
[12:06.520 --> 12:07.520]  of reporting.
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.120]  We're going to play that for you as well.
[12:09.120 --> 12:13.640]  And then you have, as the final bit of information here, I'm giving you an overview.
[12:13.640 --> 12:15.200]  We're going to go into a little bit more detail with these.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.200]  We're going to play the videos.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.480]  We're going to show you what they had to say.
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.240]  But the amazing thing about this is that if you look at the drudge report, at the top
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.440]  of the drudge report, there was a little gif that was created on Reddit.
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.000]  And it showed, it was a clip where Donald Trump was playing around in his world wrestling
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.440]  days.
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.480]  And they had a staged attack, as you can see there.
[12:35.480 --> 12:38.800]  But the individual that he's taking down, they put a CNN over it.
[12:38.800 --> 12:41.240]  And that's exactly what Donald Trump was just saying.
[12:41.240 --> 12:43.400]  He said, the fake media is trying to silence us.
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.400]  We will not let them.
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.600]  You understand that he's in a wrestling match for the fake media.
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.360]  And they look at this and they say, this is a call for violence against CNN reporters.
[12:53.360 --> 12:54.520]  It's not.
[12:54.520 --> 13:00.280]  These are the same people who push back against the idea that a Shakespeare play where they
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.480]  make it very clear that it's Donald Trump and his wife, who has an accident just like
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.680]  Melania.
[13:06.680 --> 13:09.720]  And they stab him to death and the audience is cheering that.
[13:09.720 --> 13:12.440]  And of course, they come back and say, well, we've done that sort of thing before with
[13:12.440 --> 13:13.440]  Obama.
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.640]  Let's cheer when Obama was slaughtered on stage or were they sad?
[13:17.640 --> 13:19.520]  I think it probably was the latter.
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.640]  I think they probably were not cheering.
[13:21.640 --> 13:23.240]  But they did that.
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.440]  And as we were saying, that's going to incite violence.
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.880]  And we had the shooting of the congressional individuals at the baseball game, Scalise
[13:31.880 --> 13:33.680]  and others.
[13:33.680 --> 13:36.200]  And they kept saying, no, there's nothing about that at all.
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.760]  Very specific threats about a president that they have demonized.
[13:40.760 --> 13:47.400]  And yet here we have a tongue-in-cheek wrestling video where Trump is wrestling CNN just in
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.080]  general, just a metaphor for CNN.
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.200]  And they come out with these types of headlines.
[13:52.200 --> 13:56.040]  Trump appears to promote violence against CNN with his tweet.
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.240]  Trump punches CNN in a juvenile tweet.
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.120]  Trump tweets a fake video of him attacking CNN.
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.120]  Really?
[14:03.120 --> 14:05.120]  You think that was fake?
[14:05.120 --> 14:09.080]  The guy really didn't have a CNN look over his head.
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.080]  Come on.
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.120]  To say that that was fake, it was a parody video.
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.360]  And that's Politico, of course, trying to stretch this out.
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.160]  Let's play a clip, guys, that we have of the White House press corps falsely accusing the
[14:22.160 --> 14:24.280]  White House staff of assault.
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.280]  This is on MSNBC.
[14:26.280 --> 14:51.880]  I'm not exactly sure what we're hearing behind the scenes looked like a little bit of getting
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.800]  roughed up in some form.
[14:53.800 --> 14:57.080]  As the reporters were leaving the Oval Office there, Spice to say, you saw the two presidents
[14:57.080 --> 14:58.080]  of South Korea.
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.680]  So you think there's a little bit of a double standard going on there?
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.800]  I think when they act out very violently and assassination of Donald Trump, make it very
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.760]  clear in every way that they can.
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.320]  And they took a lot of liberties with Shakespeare's play.
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.600]  They worked Twitter into it and so forth, just so you that you know.
[15:13.600 --> 15:16.680]  The guy was a dead ringer for Donald Trump, and then they say, no, there's nothing wrong
[15:16.680 --> 15:17.680]  with that.
[15:17.680 --> 15:18.680]  That's artistic license.
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.640]  They don't want even a silly gift like that with Donald Trump wrestling people.
[15:24.640 --> 15:25.640]  They don't want that to go out.
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.160]  Let's take a look at what the White House aide said when we come back.
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.160]  He said the fake news complex is collapsing.
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.800]  He said to those supporters of the Trump administration who were worried about all the fake news reporting
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.560]  in the last 23 weeks, I can assure you, just ignore it.
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.760]  Yeah, he's winning.
[15:41.760 --> 15:44.080]  He body slammed him and they're not very happy about it.
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.080]  Stay with us.
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.080]  We'll be right back.
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.280]  Let's get down what really happened with these phony 17 intelligence agencies.
[15:51.280 --> 15:52.280]  Not at all.
[15:52.280 --> 15:58.800]  They're finally having to fess up.
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.560]  Myco ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[16:02.560 --> 16:04.160]  Talk about next level probiotic.

[21:29.960 --> 21:31.680]  This is the time to talk up folks.
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.440]  We've got a very uncertain situation that we're in right now and of course we don't
[21:37.440 --> 21:39.560]  know what's going to happen with North Korea.
[21:39.560 --> 21:43.480]  That's one of the news stories we're going to be getting to later in the broadcast.
[21:43.480 --> 21:49.440]  We have Donald Trump is going to be talking to the leaders of Japan and China trying to
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.440]  unwind that situation.
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.520]  It's a very complicated situation.
[21:52.520 --> 21:53.520]  It is a hair trigger.
[21:53.520 --> 22:00.680]  This guy is absolutely North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is absolutely insane and provocative.
[22:00.680 --> 22:03.960]  And it's not really clear that even though the Chinese have a great deal of leverage
[22:03.960 --> 22:06.440]  with him, if they can reason with this guy.
[22:06.440 --> 22:09.160]  So we do not want to see an attack.
[22:09.160 --> 22:13.160]  We don't want to see him attack first, but we also don't want to see some kind of a war
[22:13.160 --> 22:14.960]  that exactly what do we do with that?
[22:14.960 --> 22:16.520]  We're waiting to see what happens with it.
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.600]  So it's always good to be prepared.

[22:33.000 --> 22:38.200]  Take a look at all the specials that we have as part of this 4th of July summer mega special.
[22:38.200 --> 22:44.640]  And remember that we have free shipping store-wide on everything at InfowarsStore.com.
[22:44.640 --> 22:47.240]  Now let's go back to what's happening with the news.
[22:47.240 --> 22:52.440]  As we see the mainstream media literally melting down and Carl Bernstein that we're going to
[22:52.440 --> 22:57.920]  talk about in just a moment here, understand that when he comes out and he says that we
[22:57.920 --> 23:03.680]  have a malignant presidency and we need to do something that we've never done before
[23:03.680 --> 23:04.680]  and come after them.
[23:04.680 --> 23:09.840]  This is a guy that led the coup against Richard Nixon along with the FBI and others.
[23:09.840 --> 23:14.640]  So when we look at this and we look at him taking down the mask of objectivity that never
[23:14.640 --> 23:20.760]  came out during Watergate with this kind of candor about how politically involved the
[23:20.760 --> 23:21.760]  media was.
[23:21.760 --> 23:27.760]  And of course, the thing that has always kept them in the position of authority is to talk
[23:27.760 --> 23:31.920]  about how disinterested and objective and rational that they are.
[23:31.920 --> 23:34.000]  They don't take sides, they say.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.080]  No they do.
[23:35.080 --> 23:36.960]  And we're seeing that very, very clearly.
[23:36.960 --> 23:40.920]  Not only are they taking sides, but they're putting out false information and they're
[23:40.920 --> 23:43.200]  pushing for a coup openly.
[23:43.200 --> 23:49.560]  And so basically they truly are collapsing in on themselves as a White House aide Gorka
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.560]  said.
[23:50.560 --> 23:51.560]  He's deputy assistant to President Trump.
[23:51.560 --> 23:56.360]  He went on a radio show and he said the fake news complex is collapsing in on itself.
[23:56.360 --> 24:01.240]  We see that with the massive scandal at CNN having to fire people who are generating totally
[24:01.240 --> 24:03.440]  false stories about the administration.
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.080]  We see that with the severe personnel cuts at the New York Times.
[24:07.080 --> 24:10.720]  And of course, now we see that even more clearly.
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.400]  Let's take a look at what's going on with the Associated Press and with the New York
[24:14.400 --> 24:19.320]  Times about these 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.
[24:19.320 --> 24:22.320]  Remember we've been told that since December.
[24:22.320 --> 24:27.360]  The AP in their retraction says the Associated Press reported that all 17 U.S. intelligence
[24:27.360 --> 24:32.120]  agencies have agreed that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Donald
[24:32.120 --> 24:33.240]  Trump.
[24:33.240 --> 24:38.400]  That assessment was based on information collected by three agencies, not 17.
[24:38.400 --> 24:42.400]  Three agencies, FBI, CIA, NSA.
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.000]  And it was published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.840]  all U.S. intelligence agencies.
[24:48.840 --> 24:53.280]  Not all 17 intelligence agencies were involved in reaching the assessment.
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.800]  Now that's AP walking it back, correcting the record.
[24:57.800 --> 25:02.120]  New York Times doesn't even get their correction correct.
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.280]  The New York Times correction, which was buried in a story a couple of days ago.
[25:06.280 --> 25:09.880]  The New York Times correction, quote, unquote, is still wrong.
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.080]  W.D. pointed out that they tucked it into the bottom of a story titled Trump's Deflections
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.480]  and Denials on Russia Frustrate Even His Allies.
[25:18.480 --> 25:20.800]  They published it on June 25th.
[25:20.800 --> 25:23.280]  And this is how we missed it.
[25:23.280 --> 25:24.920]  The correction came out on the 29th.
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.680]  A White House memo article on Monday about Trump's deflections and denials about Russia
[25:30.680 --> 25:35.640]  referred incorrectly to the source of an intelligence age assessment that said Russia orchestrated
[25:35.640 --> 25:38.680]  hacking attacks during last year's presidential election.
[25:38.680 --> 25:41.800]  The assessment was made by four intelligence agencies.
[25:41.800 --> 25:42.800]  Now they're wrong.
[25:42.800 --> 25:43.800]  Remember, it's three.
[25:43.800 --> 25:46.120]  AP just pointed that out and we'll tell you why.
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.080]  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, that's not an agency, okay?
[25:50.080 --> 25:52.680]  That's the one that all the others report to.
[25:52.680 --> 25:55.280]  The CIA, the FBI, and the NSA.
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.280]  The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence
[25:59.280 --> 26:00.280]  community.
[26:00.280 --> 26:03.120]  And they said, but even that correction is inaccurate.
[26:03.120 --> 26:07.640]  It goes beyond the fact that they said it was four agencies when it was only three.
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.280]  And they point out that the assessment was not made by those agencies.
[26:11.280 --> 26:14.880]  Not even the three agencies, New York Times.
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.000]  The agencies simply approved the assessment, but the assessment was not done by the agencies.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.680]  It was done by a highly irregular committee.
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.640]  That fact was disclosed by Director of National Intelligence, former Director of National Intelligence,
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.240]  James Clapper during the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on May 8th, when he acknowledged
[26:36.240 --> 26:42.440]  that the assessment was not conducted by his office, by the FBI, by the CIA, not by the
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.440]  NSA.
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.800]  It was done by a panel, okay?
[26:45.800 --> 26:46.800]  You understand this?
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.880]  So the New York Times is saying, well, it was four agencies when it was really three agencies.
[26:51.880 --> 26:54.440]  But it wasn't even done by those three agencies.
[26:54.440 --> 27:01.680]  And James Clapper, who was head of the Director of the National Intelligence Office, said that
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.120]  in the subcommittee hearing during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing.
[27:07.120 --> 27:11.680]  Clapper told senators that the assessment was actually made by two dozen or so quote-unquote
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.440]  seasoned experts who were hand-picked from the contributing agencies.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.480]  So you understand this?
[27:18.480 --> 27:24.400]  These are a few people who are brought in and they're told to say essentially, you understand
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.880]  how this works, right?
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.240]  Let's listen to what he had to say.
[27:27.240 --> 27:31.360]  And how did those four agencies verify the accuracy of the panel's assessment and ultimately
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.160]  give it its stamp of approval?
[27:33.160 --> 27:38.000]  Clapper said, well, I'm not aware that anyone dissented or that they disagreed when it came
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  out.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.040]  So they hand-pick these guys, do you think maybe they're people who are going to do what
[27:43.040 --> 27:44.040]  they're told?
[27:44.040 --> 27:47.200]  Do you think maybe they're people who have a political agenda?
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.760]  And they come in as his hand-picked panel and they present them with an assessment.
[27:52.760 --> 27:55.120]  And then nobody speaks out against it.
[27:55.120 --> 27:56.120]  Why would they?
[27:56.120 --> 27:58.560]  They haven't done any investigation, most likely.
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.760]  And so because of that, now we have unanimous approval by that hand-picked panel of this.
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.940]  And then it escalates to the point where it is now unanimously approved by all 17 agencies.
[28:10.940 --> 28:15.960]  Former CIA officer Fred Flights, who's 25 years of service in the national security
[28:15.960 --> 28:22.920]  positions, said that convening such a panel was a drastic departure from normal protocol.
[28:22.920 --> 28:25.000]  It went against all standing rules.
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.120]  It carried a strong political stench, and it rendered the findings suspicious.
[28:33.120 --> 28:36.720]  That's a report from WND, and they got that exactly right.
[28:36.720 --> 28:42.280]  So they have this political panel that they put in that has a political stench to it,
[28:42.280 --> 28:43.280]  and they put that out there.
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.640]  It escalated to all 17 agencies, but when we come back, we're going to talk about where
[28:47.640 --> 28:52.040]  that came from and how it was pushed and how we pushed back against it from the very beginning.
[28:52.040 --> 28:56.520]  We're also going to tell you about the real news about how the election was rigged.
[28:56.520 --> 28:57.920]  We'll be right back.
[28:57.920 --> 29:01.680]  The tide is turning and the witch hunt aimed at President Donald Trump.
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.680]  After being right about rigged elections, fake news, and the travel ban, the unrelenting
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.160]  persecution of our president is actually starting to yield some fruit for the drain the swamp
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.160]  movement.
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.840]  As Trump trolled James Comey into admitting he leaked and Loretta Lynch intervened in
[29:14.840 --> 29:18.840]  the Clinton email probe, the investigations are now aimed at the Democrats.
[29:18.840 --> 29:21.320]  John Podessa had a secret hearing on Tuesday.
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.520]  Loretta Lynch will soon be called to a hearing, Susan Rice will have to answer for unmasking,
[29:25.520 --> 29:29.160]  and Bernie Sanders and his wife are being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[29:29.160 --> 29:34.840]  And now Republican senators want answers on the FBI Russia probe in regards to surveillance.
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.560]  Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham are leading the way in searching for answers
[29:38.560 --> 29:43.360]  on the procedures taken and by whom to issue surveillance requests because of the Russian
[29:43.360 --> 29:44.360]  probe.
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.160]  What could this possibly turn up as the world awaits answers from Barack Obama as to why
[29:48.160 --> 29:52.720]  it was he that interfered with the Russian investigation, not President Trump?
[29:52.720 --> 29:56.280]  Stay tuned for more of the implosion of the left at infowars.com.
[29:56.280 --> 29:57.280]  This is Owen Schreuer.
[29:57.280 --> 30:03.280]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[30:03.280 --> 30:05.280]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[30:05.280 --> 30:09.360]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[30:09.360 --> 30:14.600]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[30:14.600 --> 30:18.320]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.000]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.560]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.000]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[30:29.000 --> 30:34.440]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[30:34.440 --> 30:40.240]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[30:40.240 --> 30:41.840]  ever concerning iodine.
[30:41.840 --> 30:43.760]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[30:43.760 --> 30:47.920]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[30:47.920 --> 30:50.240]  to any optimum health regimen.

[33:02.160 --> 33:20.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:20.600 --> 33:25.120]  You're listening to an infowars.com front line report.
[33:25.120 --> 33:26.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:26.120 --> 33:30.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.240 --> 33:34.320]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, July 2nd, 2017.
[33:34.320 --> 33:36.320]  It is coming fast and furious.
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.720]  I know you've heard fake news, fake news over and over again on every side.
[33:39.720 --> 33:41.400]  It's calling the other side fake.
[33:41.400 --> 33:49.360]  But now we have the New York Times, the Associated Press, we have CNN melting down, firing people,
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.920]  having major retractions after they've been pushing the lie of 17 intelligence agencies
[33:54.920 --> 33:56.840]  saying that the Russians hacked.
[33:56.840 --> 34:01.320]  And of course, this was all something that was started by Hillary Clinton back in an
[34:01.320 --> 34:03.380]  October debate.
[34:03.380 --> 34:07.720]  So these people have been pushing this narrative all along, and we need to look a little bit
[34:07.720 --> 34:08.720]  deeper.
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.440]  We need to actually look at the violations of law committed by James Clapper and others
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.600]  who politicized their agencies and violated the Hatch Act.
[34:19.600 --> 34:22.960]  Because of the time that we had James Comey come back, remember just before the election,
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.160]  he came back and he said, well, we got some new information about the Hillary Clinton
[34:26.160 --> 34:31.280]  emails and immediately you had Senator Harry Reid and others saying we need to get after
[34:31.280 --> 34:32.560]  him on the Hatch Act.
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.360]  And quite frankly, they could have done that in terms of the way that it was presented.
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.760]  But also, the narrative that has been done by many in the intelligence agency in the
[34:43.760 --> 34:48.800]  aftermath of all this pushing the lies about Hillary Clinton both before the election and
[34:48.800 --> 34:49.800]  after the election.
[34:49.800 --> 34:51.120]  They need to take a look at the Hatch Act.
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.560]  And we're going to take a look at that when we get into what the Democrats are doing
[34:55.560 --> 35:01.760]  in terms of pushing back on the efforts to look at voter registration rolls.
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.240]  This is something that they don't want you to see.
[35:04.240 --> 35:06.360]  They're trying to hide what is there.
[35:06.360 --> 35:10.840]  And they're trying to hide the fact that we know that there are a lot of problems on
[35:10.840 --> 35:11.840]  the voter rolls.
[35:11.840 --> 35:13.960]  They're saying, no, no, not a problem, it's fake news.
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.440]  And look, Donald Trump is listening to infowars and immediately he says there were millions
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.120]  of votes that were illegal aliens who registered to vote and so forth.
[35:22.120 --> 35:26.760]  But they're doing everything they can to stop the release of those public records.
[35:26.760 --> 35:28.880]  These are not privacy issues.
[35:28.880 --> 35:31.800]  This is something that has to do with the corruption of the Democrat Party.
[35:31.800 --> 35:35.120]  But let's get back and finish up on these 17 intelligence agencies.
[35:35.120 --> 35:41.000]  There's a story from Zero Hedge pointing out the New York Times has been pushing this for
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  a very long time.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.800]  And this began, as I just said, with Hillary Clinton in the debate in October.
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.120]  She said there were 17 intelligence agencies that all agreed with this.
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.760]  And in this article, Zero Hedge put out some tweets from WikiLeaks and WikiLeaks back
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.880]  on the 20th of October, 2016, before the election, said Clinton's, quote unquote, 17 US intelligence
[36:02.880 --> 36:09.200]  agencies may be the biggest, most immediately disprovable whopper ever intentionally made
[36:09.200 --> 36:11.200]  during a debate.
[36:11.200 --> 36:12.640]  Let me repeat that.
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.040]  They said there's a biggest lie easily disproven ever made during a debate.
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.760]  And then they follow that up and they say, well, what do her 17 intelligence agencies
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.760]  include?
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.480]  They include things like the Coast Guard, the DEA, Naval Intelligence, Department of
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.760]  Energy, Air Force Reconnaissance.
[36:28.760 --> 36:30.640]  Really, seriously?
[36:30.640 --> 36:36.120]  I mean, those people were looking at the Russians supposedly hacking into our election.
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.400]  And again, remember, they kept saying they never got into the voting machines.
[36:40.400 --> 36:43.040]  No, that was Homeland Security that did that.
[36:43.040 --> 36:47.840]  That was Homeland Security that violated the law immediately after the election.
[36:47.840 --> 36:54.040]  And subsequent to that, getting into the voter rolls in Indiana, as well as in Georgia,
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.840]  Georgia's place where they were first discovered.
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.400]  And then later they found them going in about 15,000 times into Indiana in violation of
[37:01.400 --> 37:07.720]  the law, trying to create a situation where they could take over the state election agencies
[37:07.720 --> 37:09.680]  and declare critical infrastructure.
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.120]  So that's an executive order from Barack Obama.
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.920]  And that allows Donald Trump now to basically hoist them by their own petard and to go in
[37:18.920 --> 37:19.920]  and take a look at this.
[37:19.920 --> 37:22.680]  We don't want the federal government running the elections.
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.200]  But it might be a good thing right now before he gets rid of that executive order.
[37:26.200 --> 37:27.200]  And I hope they do.
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.280]  Because all the secretaries of state meet and say, remove this designation of critical
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.280]  infrastructure.
[37:33.280 --> 37:34.280]  It needs to be removed.
[37:34.280 --> 37:38.600]  But before you do, let's take a look at what Jay Johnson and Homeland Security were doing
[37:38.600 --> 37:41.720]  illegally breaking into these different places.
[37:41.720 --> 37:48.600]  Because we had congressmen, Chaffetz and others, say, please explain to us what you were doing.
[37:48.600 --> 37:49.600]  What was the purpose of this?
[37:49.600 --> 37:50.880]  How many times did you do this?
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.240]  Come forth with this.
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.440]  And they call for a special investigator because they believe that Homeland Security was not
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.200]  going to be honest, forthright, that they were not going to investigate themselves.
[38:00.200 --> 38:01.200]  And they're right.
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.200]  They stonewalled them until Jay Johnson did his dog and pony show and said, oh, it's the
[38:07.200 --> 38:08.200]  Russians.
[38:08.200 --> 38:10.640]  And I know that was ordered by Vladimir Putin.
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.600]  That's another patently absurd lie, just like the fact that the Coast Guard was looking
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.800]  at Russian interference somehow in our elections.
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.600]  But then they go on to say this.
[38:23.600 --> 38:31.680]  Day 8, 2017, WikiLeaks points out, there have been 3,490 fake news stories that reported
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.520]  that 17 intelligence agencies made US election hacking report when only three of them did.
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.440]  And we talked about that, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA.
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.600]  And it wasn't even those three agencies.
[38:43.600 --> 38:48.720]  It was a political panel that was put together, presented with a report, nobody complained
[38:48.720 --> 38:49.720]  about it.
[38:49.720 --> 38:52.680]  So Clapper says, that's done.
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.680]  We all agree, it's unanimous, puts it out there, says, I speak for 17 intelligence agencies,
[38:57.680 --> 38:58.680]  and we unanimously agree.
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.240]  Do you see how the lie snowballed under Clapper?
[39:02.240 --> 39:08.120]  The same guy who, remember, we had Ron White and say, are you listening to all of our emails
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.120]  without search warrants?
[39:09.120 --> 39:10.960]  And James Clapper couldn't look him in the eye.
[39:10.960 --> 39:15.280]  He looks down, he rubs his eye brown, he goes, well, I can't really say.
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.320]  And then we found out a couple of weeks later, we had the Snowden leaks that showed, yes,
[39:21.320 --> 39:24.400]  we honored out, we have the documents that they really are truly doing it.
[39:24.400 --> 39:30.560]  So here you have James Clapper putting this together, and now we've had nearly 3,500 fake
[39:30.560 --> 39:39.120]  stories about 17 intelligence agencies unanimously saying that somehow the Russians hacked it.
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.960]  Let's take a look at what else we found from the New York Times, just as a reminder.
[39:43.960 --> 39:47.640]  Just as a reminder, because these things are coming so fast and furious, it was an entire
[39:47.640 --> 39:54.080]  month ago that we had Comey testifying, and that Comey shot down the New York Times and
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.680]  said that their February the 14th story was basically a lie.
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.160]  Remember if we go back, this is a daily caller story, the New York Times is looking into
[40:04.160 --> 40:08.600]  whether one of its big Russia scoops is actually true after former FBI Director James Comey
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.480]  disputed the report in his testimony before Congress.
[40:11.480 --> 40:14.040]  So this is about a month ago.
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.440]  The paper of record reported on February the 14th that US intelligence officials had
[40:18.440 --> 40:23.600]  intercepted repeated communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian intelligence
[40:23.600 --> 40:26.440]  officials in the year leading up to the election.
[40:26.440 --> 40:28.200]  Total lie from the New York Times.
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.680]  Total lie from the New York Times, and FBI agent, former director James Comey called
[40:33.680 --> 40:36.000]  him on it in testimony.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.760]  The news firmly planted the as yet totally unsubstantiated narrative that the Trump campaign
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.000]  had colluded with Russia to sway the election in its favor.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.920]  But Comey characterized the report as almost entirely false, entirely false, and then they
[40:48.920 --> 40:51.160]  came out and said, well, we're looking into it.
[40:51.160 --> 40:56.440]  See this has been going on and on, these are major, major fabrications by the New York
[40:56.440 --> 41:03.040]  Times, by CNN, by the Washington Post, by the AP and others that continue to go on CNN.
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.680]  And now we have another one from the Associated Press break on this weekend.
[41:06.680 --> 41:10.440]  They're coming so rapidly you can't keep up with them.
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.040]  And now this one, this is a new fake meeting, sorry.
[41:14.040 --> 41:20.960]  And it sounds exactly like what CNN did when they said that Anthony Scaramucci had met
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.960]  with Russian investment fund, a bank, and they had completely made that up.
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.840]  That was what caused the three individuals to be fired.
[41:28.840 --> 41:30.960]  This has caused a big shake up at CNN.
[41:30.960 --> 41:37.080]  And now AP has come out with a similar thing, saying that the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt,
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.880]  Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveress had met privately.
[41:42.880 --> 41:45.760]  This is an imaginary meeting, never happened, folks.
[41:45.760 --> 41:49.000]  And then they alleged that some kind of impropriety happened as a result.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.040]  So they make up a meeting, and then based on their imaginary meeting that never happened,
[41:54.040 --> 41:59.920]  the AP talks about improprieties, ethics issues.
[41:59.920 --> 42:04.800]  And now they're having to retract that, just like CNN.
[42:04.800 --> 42:06.880]  You get the idea of where this is going?
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.320]  And now, let's play Bernstein's video.
[42:11.320 --> 42:18.560]  Let's play what Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame said about the non-functioning Trump
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.800]  presidency that is, as he puts it, malignant.
[42:22.800 --> 42:25.160]  Let's play that clip from Bernstein.
[42:25.160 --> 42:30.000]  I think something much greater is happening, and that is that we are in the midst of a
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.360]  malignant presidency.
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.160]  And that malignancy is known to the military leaders of the country.
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.000]  It's known to the Republican leadership in Congress who recognize it, and it's known
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.120]  to the intelligence community.
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.600]  And the presidency of Donald Trump is not functioning.
[42:46.600 --> 42:49.400]  It's not functioning partly because of his character.
[42:49.400 --> 42:50.400]  It's not functioning partly because of his character.
[42:50.400 --> 42:52.400]  All right, we're going to play the rest of that when we come back, and we're going to
[42:52.400 --> 42:55.840]  talk about what's behind this coup, if you don't realize it just yet.
[42:55.840 --> 42:56.840]  We'll be right back.
[42:56.840 --> 43:10.680]  All right, we're going to talk about what's behind this coup, if you don't realize it
