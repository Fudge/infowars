[00:00.000 --> 00:18.500]  Info Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.000]  It's Sunday, August 14th for Year 2022, and the Great Awakening has exploded.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  It's already tremendous expansion with this raid on Trump and the insane hypocrisy.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  And the support for Info Wars has exploded as well.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Humanity is finally understanding how great a threat we are really under.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  And next segment, we're going to go over some big examples of that as well.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  But there's also been another event that has really captured the public's attention
[01:23.000 --> 01:33.000]  and helped them start to question the entire Truman Show, Alice in Wonderland,
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  man behind the curtain narrative that we've been fed.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  So coming up at the start of the second hour, I'm going to lay out a huge issue
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  that I'm not going to get to right now because of time constraints, but next hour we will.
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  But we're going to hear from a top military historian in the next segment
[01:57.000 --> 02:06.000]  discussing the fact that America is 100% going into an authoritarian paradigm
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  and that if we don't reverse it quickly, it could lead to beyond a civil war.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Which when you understand that the globalists want America to collapse on its own,
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  empires rarely get conquered from without, they collapse from within,
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  and that the globalists are positioning America to destroy itself from within.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  The Democrats have been put in power by the Klaus Schwab's Bill Gates of the World.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  They believe they're really about to get full one-party dictatorship here.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  They said they're destroying themselves, but they're destroying us at the very same time.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  Democrats are enemies of themselves, common sense in America,
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  but we really need to somehow reach out to them so they can expand their paradigm
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  and understand that they're being lied to.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  And obviously the Republican leadership are almost as bad as they are.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  Lots of blue blood neocons, they're a big problem as well.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  But we have a populist insurrection taking place through the Republican Party,
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  a peaceful insurrection, through the Republican Party, a political realignment.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  And that's why you have the Republican and Democrat establishment all targeting the populist Tea Party.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  So we're going to lay it all out here today.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  I'm going to really lay out some stunning information next segment.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  And then Owen Troyer is going to be hosting for the balance of the broadcast.
[03:27.000 --> 03:37.000]  I'll be back hosting tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central right after Harrison Smith and the American Journal.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  But America is awake where I'm at, visiting family.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  When I was here just five years ago, three years ago, these American flags weren't up here like this.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  And now these American flags are up here.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  And this area was formerly Democrats.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Most of the people I'm hanging out with were Democrats just five years ago.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  They're not now.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  And they weren't flying American flags like that because they thought America was secure.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  They now know it's not.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  So big broadcasts for you lined up today.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  We're always going to question the big events.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  We're always going to ask who stands to gain.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  And we're always going to defend the basic rights that have made America so great and we will never surrender.
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  We'll be right back with my big breakdown of mainline historians and experts admitting that we're in a dictatorship.
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  And that we've got to a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and end of special interest.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  And that we've got to abolish the FBI and we've got to abolish the private Federal Reserve if this country has any chance.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  But I believe in America.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  I'm betting on America.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  I'm betting on you in FullWars.com.
[04:41.000 --> 05:01.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  Super male vitality is incredible.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  Why does it work so well?
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  And the answer is very simple.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions,
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  known herbal compounds that boost libido,
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  stamina and energy.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  And it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  It's cold pressed.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off Super male vitality.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  And it goes great with X2, which is also 25% off.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  But if you get both these products together, they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com.
[05:51.000 --> 05:59.000]  So X2 and Super male vitality, 40% off together or 25% off individually at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:08.000]  It's amazing try today.
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  More and more, we're seeing even establishment Republicans and former establishment Democrats
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  like Tulsi Gabbards come out and say,
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  We must abolish the deep state or they're going to abolish our republic.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  We're not going into a tyranny.
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  We're in a tyranny and it's time to wake up before it's too late.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  I never thought I would say this.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  The FBI is beyond redemption.
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  It's all of its bureaus and its institutions have to be farmed out and broken up.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  If you have a warrant, an FBI warrant, there's no guarantee that that has not been altered.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  If you subpoena and you want FBI records on phones with a Mueller, they will be wiped clean.
[06:46.000 --> 06:58.000]  If you want disinterested legal counsel, look at Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  Victor Davis Hansen is one of the top fellows at the respected Hoover Institute.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  He's also one of the most respected military historians currently alive.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  And he laid out on Fox News yesterday in five minutes exactly where we are.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  We are living in a tyranny. We aren't living in the beginning of a tyrannical takeover.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  We're living deep, deep inside of it.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  The only thing I would add to his five-minute analysis of how much trouble this collapsing republic is in
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  is the push to forcibly inject not just the U.S. population but the population of the world
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  with these experimental shots that now even mainline insurance companies have confirmed
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  have massively increased the number of deaths in healthy and sick people.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  It is just incredible.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  And the open admission by the IMF and the World Bank and the Davos Group and the U.N.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  that they are establishing a planetary world government through the vaccine ID
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  that will be the new global cashless society through which to enforce the social credit score,
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  the carbon taxes that track and trace everything we do,
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  and then, of course, finally, the universal basic income,
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  which is how they'll control it fast for our lives because everybody will be on welfare,
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  even if you have a job, it'll still be pursuant to how they program the digital tokens
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  and where you're even allowed to spend them.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  I mean, this is beyond a dystopian science fiction nightmare that's actually happening right now.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  You added that, all the lawfare, you added that, all the weaponization of the judiciary
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  being used against the American people where Steve Bannon was convicted.
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  A month ago in D.C. by D.C. Jury of contempt of Congress,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  and he couldn't cross-examine the witnesses against him.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  That's unprecedented.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  And people watching the show Troll that happened here in Austin on Sandy Hook
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  noticed that we could never call witnesses, we couldn't bring new information in,
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  we couldn't put out our financial numbers.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  It was all one-sided, completely and totally one-sided.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And they're testing and beta testing this on people like myself and Roger Stone
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  and Donald Trump and Steve Bannon and others.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  And that's why it's so important for all of you to realize that we have to speak out against us,
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  we have to say no.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  We have to rally behind good legislatures, good governors and good judiciary
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  that are out there operating and doing a fair job and expose the totally weaponized judiciary.
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  So here's this five-minute clip where he lays out just with stunning detail
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  and all this is historically on record what these people are really doing.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  And remember, Obama has tens of millions of documents
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  that he still hasn't given the National Archives.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  But Trump had a few boxes and he's a bad guy.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  The point is, there's always been a conflict between the executive and the archived bureaucracy
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  and the truth is, the president is his own branch of government
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  and can decide what to classify and what not.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  That's why this is all fraud.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  Obama's allowed to keep his records and so is Trump.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  All right, here is this critical report.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  Please say whether this will be right back with more of this live special Sunday Transmission.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  At moments like this, why?
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  Why has what we've watched over the last 24 hours taken place?
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Why had they targeted Donald Trump?
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  Well, they're afraid in the short term, but in the long term,
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  they believe they're morally superior to America
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  and therefore any means necessary or justifiable for their morally superior ends.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  Right now, we don't have the rule of law in Washington.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  Whether you're targeted or exempt depends on your ideology.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  So in the past, when there was a dispute over the archives, the presidential papers,
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  Barack Obama just said, I'm not going to turn them over, the freedom of information.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  He spent $30 million resisting efforts to do that.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  George Bush had an executive order and said, you know what?
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  I'm not going to do this.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  And that was adjudicated.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  And now we go after a president and go to his house with 30 agents.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  In the past, when a high official was called for a congressional subpoena,
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  Eric Holder just said, I'm not going and I'm not turning over any of this fast and furious.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  The idea that you would put him in shackles or you'd confront him with his family
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  and grab his phone is just ridiculous.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  But this is what we're doing on ideological basis.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  And when you start to do that, you don't have a democracy anymore.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  And I don't think we do.
[11:11.000 --> 11:18.000]  The second thing is this January 6th committee will is sort of like a French Robespierre committee on public safety.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  To be on that committee, you have to have one criteria and you have to vote to impeach Donald Trump.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  If you're a Republican, there was one other qualification.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  You had to be politically inert with no future.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  And it was deductive.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  It started with the premise that we're going to destroy Donald Trump
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  and then we're going to bring in witnesses and we're going to allow narratives for that end.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  There's going to be no cross-examination.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  There's going to be no disinterested counsel.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  We know that when Dick Cheney himself made a commercial
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  and he bragged about his daughter that she was the one power that could stop Donald Trump.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  But that's not what her job is in that committee.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  It's to be disinterested.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  It's to be inductive.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  It's to find out what happened on January 6th,
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  not start with a boast that you're going to destroy Donald Trump
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  and make the witnesses and the testimony fit that.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  And finally, I never thought I would say this,
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  the FBI is beyond redemption.
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  It's all of its bureaus and its institutions have to be farmed out and broken up.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  If you have a warrant, an FBI warrant,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  there's no guarantee that that has not been altered.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  If you subpoena and you want FBI records on phones with a Mueller,
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  they will be wiped clean.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  If you want disinterested legal counsel,
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  look at Lisa Page and Peter Struck.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  If you're the FBI and you want to find out why Hillary Clinton
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  has hired a foreign national to find dirt on a political opponent,
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  then you will hire that same foreign national.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  And you look at the last four directors.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  We just saw Christopher Wray and he just stonewalled every question
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  and then he flew on an FBI plane, our plane, a luxury jet
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  because he had to go to his own vacation spot.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  He took over, remember, from Andrew McCabe.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  What did he do?
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  He lied four times to federal investigators
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  and his wife was running for an office with Clinton-related packed money
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  while he was investigating Hillary Clinton's email scandal.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  He took over from James Comey who leaked confidential memos
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  written on FBI devices to the media.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  And then when he was called before Congress on 245 occasions,
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  he said he didn't know or didn't remember.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  Anybody listening to this tries out with the IRS and they're going to go to jail.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  And he took over from Robert Mueller,
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  whose entire special counsel case was based on two premises.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  The information that was false in the Steele dossier
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  and the shingmanigans of the Clinton hired GPS disinformation firm.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  And when he was asked specifically, he said under oath
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  he knew nothing about either entity.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  And so this is very ironic because all of this is destroying this country.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  And it comes from the people who warned us democracy dies in darkness
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  and they have descended upon us the greatest cloud of autocracy
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  and ill-liberality in the history of this republic.
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  And we're going to have to do something and hope and pray
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  that the House is under new leadership.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then it will be up to Kevin McCarthy and Republicans, as you say,
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  to reply in kind.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  I don't want to live in a country where Kevin McCarthy tears up
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  the State of the Union address as soon as Joe Biden gives it.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  I don't want to live necessarily in a country when Kevin McCarthy says
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  no squad member is going to be on any House committee
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  or Mitch McConnell is going to go to the Supreme Court
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  and yell about Supreme Court justices.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  But that's what we're at and let's pray to God the republicans can save us.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  You're of course referring to the actions by Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  over the past several years.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  It's hard to see forward, isn't it, Victor?
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  A path for national unity, but you have to start with diagnosing the present
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  and you did so well.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now live inside the Info Wars World headquarters
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  in Austin, Texas.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'm sure we're going to be with you the rest of the way
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  on this Sunday version of the Alex Jones show.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Here's what I've got coming up.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  I do have some news on my desk, but I think I'll probably forego most of the coverage
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  to open up the phone lines.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  And so I'm going to give out the phone number probably in 20 minutes after the next segment
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  and we'll start getting your calls lined up.
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  But I want to tell you, last night I actually went to the future.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:40.000 --> 15:48.000]  I was in the future last night and so I come bearing news today from the future.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  And it's not good.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  No, it's not good, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  So I'll tell you what the future looks like on the other side of this break.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  Super male vitality is incredible.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  Why does it work so well?
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  And the answer is very simple.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  that boost libido, stamina and energy, and it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's cold pressed.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[16:32.000 --> 16:39.000]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off Super male vitality.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  And it goes great with X2, which is also 25% off.
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  But if you get both these products together, they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com.
[16:49.000 --> 16:57.000]  So X2 and Super male vitality, 40% off together or 25% off individually at infowarstore.com.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  It's an amazing try today.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  that supplies the highest quality signature reducing faraday cages,
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America,
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  high end line at a very affordable price.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone,
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads,
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers.
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.000]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  Redux is info wars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity,
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family,
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  And the studies are all clear.
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes a big joke about this
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  They want to break up society.
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.000]  We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  available as a major sponsor now.

[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  It's discreet shipping. I've used it. It's amazing.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  And it's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  This also enhances it.
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  So again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today

[19:54.000 --> 20:18.000]  at Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, last night I was in the future.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  And I did not really like what I experienced.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Of course, I'm being a bit facetious, but not really.
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  I want to tell you a story of my night last night
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  because I think it's very indicative as to where humanity is going
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  on the current path we're on.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  And if we don't recognize the flaws in this future
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  and recognize what human life is going to be like
[20:56.000 --> 21:05.000]  if we choose this path, then we're bound for a very, very frustrating future
[21:05.000 --> 21:13.000]  where you'll just be so turned out with the frustration of your daily activities
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  because it's so obnoxious, the hoops you have to jump through,
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  that you'll beg to go live in Klaus Schwab's pod,
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  eating the bugs with the virtual headset on
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  so that you don't have to live in the crappy world that's been built for you out there.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  Now, let me explain.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Let me give a bit of a background here.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  So there's a soccer team in Austin, Texas, now a professional soccer team,
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  major league soccer team.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  They came here, I think last year was their first season.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Now, before they even had a game,
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  they had their marketing campaigns all around the city,
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  wear your mask, take your vacs, we're gay.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Before they even kicked the ball, played a game,
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  turned the lights on at the field, just all this propaganda.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now, if you know me, you know I come from sports media,
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  you know I'm a sports fan, but I was so turned off by it,
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  I just never wanted to go to a game.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  Well, I decided to go to a game last night.
[22:15.000 --> 22:23.000]  So Austin FC is probably about as woke as it gets when it comes to professional sports.
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.000]  And the experience of going to a game,
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  all of the hoops you have to jump through and the frustrations and the inconveniences,
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  it takes away from the game experience.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  Now, I'm somebody that's been going to sporting events since when I could walk.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  I mean, by the time I was 15, my dad would drop me off at Bush Stadium
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  and I'd go run around, get $5 bleacher seats, be down there by myself.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  So the fan experience is seriously going downhill.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  And it's too bad too, because it was a great time.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  I had a great time last night.
[23:01.000 --> 23:07.000]  I really did, but let me tell you what I say that this is a warning from the future.
[23:07.000 --> 23:15.000]  So let's tell you what it's like now, because if you understand why this is so frustrating,
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  you understand where the future is going.
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  So now you can't even have, and this is probably how it is at most professional events,
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  but I don't know, this is the only professional team really in Austin.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  There's no more tickets.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  You can't have a physical ticket.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  You have your digital ticket.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  And so because you have your digital ticket, you have to go through all kinds of hoops just to get your ticket.
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  You've got to download apps.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  You've got to sign in passwords.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  Get new pass accounts and get new passwords and then get new apps and then do transfers.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  It's a whole process.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  Instead of just this, here's your ticket.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Enjoy the game.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  Not anymore.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  Download an app.
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.000]  Make a new login.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  Make a new app download.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  Transfer the tickets.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  So just getting a ticket, I'm not even kidding you, took me over an hour to try to figure all this out.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  And I had to be on the phone with these internet ticket companies to try to get a ticket to my phone.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  So that's a total pain in the ass.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  So that's what the future is like.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  Oh, you don't have the paper ticket.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  You don't have the solid ticket anymore.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  No, now you're going to be downloading apps, making screen names, making new accounts, going on the internet and all this stuff.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  And then you just hope you can get that ticket on your phone at the end of the day.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  So that's obnoxious.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  You also have no parking near the stadium.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Well, why wouldn't you have parking near the stadium?
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  Because they want you to get a rideshare.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  You see, it's all about carpooling and having a rideshare and going green.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  So no parking at the stadium.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  So everyone's got to walk more than a mile to get there.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  Because you don't want to have a parking lot next to the stadium so people can drive because you don't want people driving.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  See, you want them carpooling or on one of those electric scooters.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Yeah, they had a whole zone for the electric scooters.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  They had the whole thing lined up for people to get their drop off.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  So you're not allowed to have a physical ticket and you're not allowed to drive to the stadium.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  You also aren't allowed to have cash.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  Totally cashless.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Nope, no cash allowed here.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  Sorry.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  Digital only.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  Okay, so again, that's part of this future process.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  No nothing physical, everything digital.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  No where for you to park, no individual activity.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  You got to do the rideshare.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  No cash.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Everything's got to be digital.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  Everything's got to be on the card.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Everything's got to be with the microchip.
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  Then I get in there and there's a free COVID-19 vaccine tent.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  I'm not even kidding you.
[26:01.000 --> 26:08.000]  The only thing missing from this experience was a 300 pound bearded man in a dress saying it's tranny time.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  But that might have been hidden somewhere in the stadium.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  I just didn't see it.
[26:11.000 --> 26:20.000]  So a free vaccine stand at a soccer game.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  Like you're going to go to a sporting event and you're going to get a jab in you.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  Oh, oh honey.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  Look, there's a COVID-19 vaccine tent.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  I think I'll go get faxed.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  I think I'll go get boosted.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  What?
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  Okay, so I guess that's normal now too.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  Just going to have a little vaccine center there.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  Maybe it's a monkeypox vaccine, whatever else they got there, COVID.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Come get your vaccine guys.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  After all, you're at a football game or a basketball game.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  You came here to get a vaccine.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Get your vaccine card.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  And I go to take that picture sarcastically, obviously.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  And nobody's going to get their vaccine.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  And it's these four heavy women sitting there with masks on.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  Only people in the stadium with a mask on like, oh look, we're still doing the COVID theater.
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  We've got our mask on.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  We're giving out vaccines.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  And I sit there to take the sarcastic photo.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  They got so excited.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  They thought someone was going to get a vaccine.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  They hop up out of their seats.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  Oh, you want the vaccine?
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  You want the vaccine?
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  I'm like, no, no.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Actually making fun of you.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  Sit back down and enjoy your mask.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  Now I halfway expected there to not even be a national anthem.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  And I'm wondering as I'm sitting down before the game, like, are they going to sing the national anthem?
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  Now they did sing the national anthem.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  People cheered for it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  I like that.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  But get this.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  And I'm not kidding you.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  I couldn't believe it.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  I had to double, triple, quadruple take it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  Not one American flag in the entire stadium.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  Not one.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  Zero American flags.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Now you might say, well, OK, fine.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  There's not an American flag.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  What's the big deal?
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  If you go do a Google search right now, and you guys can plug this in, there are hundreds
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  of flags at soccer games, specifically at Austin FC soccer games.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  I saw Venezuelan flags.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  I saw other national flags.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  I saw Texas flag that said protect trans kids.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  A couple of Austin FC flags.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  And then about 20 different versions of the gay flag or the trans flag.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  The biggest flag in the stadium was a trans flag.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  And there were more trans flags than any other.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  It was the highest flag and the biggest flag in the stadium was a trans flag.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  I'm at a soccer game, folks.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  Single American flag, 30 trans flags flying in the stadium.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  And a Texas flag that says protect trans kids, but not an American flag.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  So I'll finish this up on the other side of the break.
[28:53.000 --> 29:02.000]  But I mean, folks, it's like twilight zone science fiction now going to a ball game.
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.

[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  Super Blue being sold out for more than a year and a half.
[29:55.000 --> 30:00.000]  Finally back available at infowarstore.com.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  around the world to the civilian market two years ago.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  The Biopros for septic tanks, for porta potties, for RVs, for your drains, your boats.
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  It goes on and on.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  But it's been so successful now.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  We're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  Because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  And it's exclusively available at thebiopros.com and now infowarstore.com.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we've made a major purchase
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.000]  and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  or thebiopros.com.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  It is amazing and it funds the infowar.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  I've got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[31:11.000 --> 31:15.000]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with
[31:15.000 --> 31:22.000]  and we said, what are the best-selling, natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[31:28.000 --> 31:38.000]  But with our new product from X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  that's just two amazing things for your body.
[31:41.000 --> 31:45.000]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  Well now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com, 40% off.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  infowarstore.com, diet force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these rants and all that.
[32:06.000 --> 32:14.000]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[32:14.000 --> 32:22.000]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  versus what your collective body has put out there.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it and you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this,
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.000]  not only that, he kind of explained it, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  That is very rare, you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[32:40.000 --> 32:47.000]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this is it, this is no Beatrix.
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.000]  You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[32:51.000 --> 33:11.000]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones. Order your copy now at Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[33:11.000 --> 33:25.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  What's the moral of the story or what's the lesson learned here?
[33:42.000 --> 33:49.000]  We're going into a future where everything is politicized, everything is a stage for propaganda.
[33:49.000 --> 34:01.000]  The human process is being removed from these activities and everything is digital, making the process even more painful.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  Plus, you can't even drive your car to the event because there's no parking and you'll be lucky if you can even afford it.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  And I was talking to the crew in the break, just kind of reminiscing, I mean, I'm not that old.
[34:12.000 --> 34:23.000]  So we're just talking 15 years ago where my dad could drop me off at a ball game with 10 bucks and I could get in for 5 bucks and get a hot dog and a soda in the stadium.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  That's not that long ago.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  That's just, just more than 15 years ago, that was the case.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  That ain't happening today.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  Hell no.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  Yeah, right.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  So this is what the future looks like.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  Everything is now a political theater propaganda stage, even a ball game.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  You go to the ball game, you're not going to a ball game.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  You're going to a politicized propaganda campaign event with a side or derv of the ball game as entertainment.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  You're going to get propaganda out the wazoo before you even get into the stadium, before the game even kicks off.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  You're going to get the health propaganda with take your vaccine.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  You're going to get the gay propaganda with the trans flags everywhere.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  You're going to get the new world order propaganda with everything being digital, no parking, not allowed to drive.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  And so this is the future we're going into and it's not pleasant.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  Oh, not to mention no American flags either.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  No, no, no.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  Not going to have that.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  No American flag for you.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  And it's removing the human from the process, becoming a human less process.
[35:36.000 --> 35:45.000]  Then it becomes this kind of side effect of now people just expect everything is done for them.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And so they're really not even connected to the event or to the activity.
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  It's just all done by machines, all done by AI, all done digitally.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  And you're just kind of like a placeholder, like a mannequin just kind of sitting there.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Like you're not really involved in anything.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  And so that's the human less future.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  And so, I mean, to me it was the biggest taste of the future that I've ever gotten.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  And it was just such a frustration of a process.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  And I just know that that's the future.
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  That's what you're going to get.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  You want to go to a ball game?
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.000]  No.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  You're going to have a pain in the ass getting your digital ticket.
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  You're not going to be able to park.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  You're not going to be able to afford it.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  Won't be an American flag propaganda left and right everywhere you go.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  And you're just like, wow, what happened here?
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  What happened?
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  What happened to this country?
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  What happened to go into a ball game with your family and friends and just having a good time?
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  No.
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  Now you're going to get all that propaganda just layered on top of it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  And if you can even survive the process of it all, you're just hoping you can get some enjoyment out of it.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  Yeah, that's the Austin FC fan section, which is a great fan section.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  Again, I'm not trying to be a hater here.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  I had a good time.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  I like going to ball games.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  I like being around people.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  I like the human experience.
[37:05.000 --> 37:19.000]  But it's just wild to be living in this Twilight Zone future where you just know it's like, wow, this whole process is extremely frustrating and excruciating.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  This is the future.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  This is what they want for the future.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  And so it was just wild.
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  And the free COVID-19 vaccine tent was just like icing on the cake, man.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  I mean, just ridiculous.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  And I think it's a shame.
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  So I'd like us to look at this right now and say, is this the future we really want?
[37:48.000 --> 37:58.000]  Is this the process we really want moving forward with all our public events, whether it's ball games or concerts or the theater?
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Is this really how we want to go into it?
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  Because this is where we're going.
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.000]  Everything digital, remove the human from the process, propaganda layered on top of everything.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  And that's the thing.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  It's like, oh, how do we make this event woke?
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Not even thinking about the actual game.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  It's like, oh, I know, let's not have parking so no one can drive.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  I know, let's have gay flags everywhere.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  I know, let's have a COVID-19 vaccine tent.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  I know, let's not have an American flag.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  I know, let's not have any cash.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  I know, let's not have any physical tickets.
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.000]  Imagine you're just sitting in the boardroom and you're saying, hey, I thought we were talking about a soccer game here.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  So that's the future.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  I got a nice taste of the future last night.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  And I got to tell you, it sucks, folks, because this is where we're going.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  And the more frustrating part is that everyone agrees it's frustrating.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  Everyone agrees the processor is ridiculous.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  Everyone agrees that the propaganda is out of control.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  Yet we still do it.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  We're still diving into this.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  Even though nobody likes it, nobody wants it, everyone's frustrated by it.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  We're still going in.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  It's a very odd thing, I have to say.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  It's a very, very odd thing.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  But that's the whole removing the human from the process.
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  So you're just basically getting inserted into these things and you don't actually have any involvement in the process.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  You're just there to be propagandized and spend your money.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  And it's sad because it's only going to get worse.
[39:40.000 --> 39:47.000]  And so I have a feeling that experience, Austin FC is probably one of the most woke professional sports teams out there.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  So I'm sure that that's why the experience is so gruesome in the process.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  But my guess is that's going to be the experience with all public events in the very near future.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  What I experienced last night.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And you're going to get a taste of it.
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.000]  At your local ballgame, your local concert venue, your local theater.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  It's all going this way, folks.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  It's all going this way.
[40:13.000 --> 40:22.000]  And so you're going to get a little taste of how frustrating this humanless, digital, propagandized future is.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  And by the way, the only propaganda allowed, though, is the anti-American propaganda, anti-freedom propaganda, communist left-wing propaganda.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  That's all that's allowed at these things.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  You're not going to see an American flag.
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  You're not going to see them celebrate our great country in any way or...
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  Hell, I don't know.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  Maybe even have like maybe a second amendment thing.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  30 gay flags.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  Not an American flag.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  30 gay flags.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  So it was pretty surreal.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  I've got to tell you.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  Pretty surreal to see 30 gay flags waving and not one American flag.
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  And then a Texas flag that says protect trans kids.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  Who brings that to a soccer game?
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  A liberal.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  That's who.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  A liberal.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  Got to get that trans flag.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  Got to let people know they want to chop little kids' gentiles up.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.000]  Got to let the people at the soccer game know that they want to mutilate children's gentiles.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  Got to let the people at the soccer stadium know that they're gay or they're trans.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Got to let them know.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  And you got to give them an opportunity to get that vaccine too.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  I mean, so, but imagine.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  You're talking about death cult rituals now going on at ball games.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  Because that's what it is.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  They even write stories now.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  It's mainstream news last week.
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.000]  LGBT youth, they actually say LGBT minority youth have the highest rates of suicide in the youth.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  Yeah, you're the ones doing that to them.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  You're brainwashing them.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  You're destroying their innocence.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  You're destroying their bodies.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  And then they're going suicidal.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  That's a death cult.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  And then I go look at that propaganda at a soccer game.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  You've got an experimental vaccine.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  That's killing people, 40,000 at least in the United States of America that we know of.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  And I've got a damn vaccine tent sitting right there.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  It's like, that's what I'm saying.
[42:35.000 --> 42:42.000]  I'm at a soccer game with death cult programming all around me.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  Everywhere.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  And then when you add that into the whole experience with the human being removed from the experience
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  and the human process being removed from the experience,
[42:53.000 --> 43:02.000]  it's like I'm just sitting in the death cult future just waiting for it to all come down.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  Our best selling product, Super Blue, is finally back in stock.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  The original available at infowarstore.com.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  It only came in three weeks ago and already half of our stock has sold out.

[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  Super Blue being sold out for more than a year and a half.
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  Finally back available at infowarstore.com.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be over
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  and it's starting to happen.
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  That's why I said, yeah go to infowarstore.com, get the book and start shipping in a couple weeks.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  But I said go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  And if it goes to number one, not of political, not of history, not of US history,
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  it's already number one over 40 categories like political science, you name it.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  40 plus categories is number one.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books in the world.
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  We are now number nine in the world.
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  Woo!
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  This is major.
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  This is political.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  This could fund our war chest.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  Just go to Amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Because you read this, you know their whole plan how to stop them.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  Hit the great reset in the war for the world now.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  It's gonna go to number one.
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.000]  What do you make of that?
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.000]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read,
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.000]  that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  they don't want you to read this book.
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  And so by buying this book, you're gonna prove that censorship doesn't work.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  That freedom is alive in this country.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  This is essential reading.
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  And, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  It's not gonna be available in bookstores.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  It's not gonna be available in libraries.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  They're gonna try to take it down from every platform that they can,
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  but they're not gonna be able to do it.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  Buy the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  I really appreciate you having me on.
[45:56.000 --> 46:21.000]  And I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project,
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  we're launching in the near future.
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.000]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[46:39.000 --> 46:46.000]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776coin.com.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  This is history happening now.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  Info War States, your support is changing the world.
[46:51.000 --> 47:01.000]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  Okay, I am now going to give out the phone number.
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  And we're going to take calls the entire second hour of the Alex Jones show today.
[47:25.000 --> 47:31.000]  And I know Christy Lee has a big Sunday night live show that she's going to be hosting afterwards as well.
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  The phone number to call in 877-789-2539.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  We're going to do open lines, so anything is fair game to talk about.
[47:38.000 --> 47:46.000]  If you want to respond to my warning of the death cult programming that's going to be overwhelming everything in the future with my experience last night, that's fine.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  You want to talk about the raid as it's kind of simmered the dust has settled on that story.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Now we've got some more answers.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  We've got some more questions or anything else.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  It's all fair game 877-789-2539.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  Or I love it when when when liberals are leftist call in to tell me how bad I am.
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.000]  We really will we'll invite that as well if any of you have the courage or the spine to give it a go tonight.
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.000]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[48:18.000 --> 48:26.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we do intend to stay on air as long as possible.
[48:26.000 --> 48:35.000]  And you are noticing obviously the attacks against Info Wars are increasing in the last month.
[48:35.000 --> 48:45.000]  And of course, that is by design, the corrupt establishment, the Democrat Party look at Info Wars like we're weak right now and it's like chum in the water.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  And so they're coming after us hard.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  But Info Wars is not weak right now.
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  We're as strong as ever.
[48:50.000 --> 49:01.000]  And with your support, shopping at infowarstore.com and spreading the links and praying for us, we will continue to be on air every day.
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  That is our plan.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  And so they're going to have to basically drag us out of here.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  I mean, they'll have to raid it and shut this place down.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  And who knows, they might have that in their bag of tricks.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  Because as I was saying last week that then they start covering mainstream news articles.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  And it's amazing how the left doesn't even realize how they're the bad guys now.
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.000]  And it's like Owen Schreuer and Info Wars say anybody could be rated next like Tucker Carlson.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's like, yeah, don't you see how these are the bad guys?
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  But they like promote it like that's good.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Like, yeah, we should be raiding all conservatives.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  We should raid Tucker Carlson.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  We should raid Fox News.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  We're the good guys though.
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  And we're anti-establishment.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  No, I don't think so.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  You're the bad guys and you know it.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  And so now you just look at it like chum in the water.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  After all our political enemies, we control the FBI.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  We control the government.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  We control big tech.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  We run the deep state.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  We're the left.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  We're the new American Gestapo.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  We're the new American Nazi.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  We're liberals though.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  We're progressives.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  We're all about gay kids.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  Yeah.
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  Now, supermail vitality is one of the top selling supplements that we have at infowarstore.com.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  It's actually a liquid tincture, really great product.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  And it's been out of stock for a while, but we've got it back in stock, supermail vitality.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  And it's 25% off.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  So I know the regular users of supermail vitality are stocking up on it right now.
[50:36.000 --> 50:44.000]  But now is your chance, if you've never tried it, to give it a go at 25% off at infowarstore.com.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  And while you're there, browse the store, there's going to be all kinds of supplements
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  that you're going to be interested in, not to mention the apparel, the goods.
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's all at infowarstore.com and it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  All right.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  As the crew is getting your phone calls lined up, let me just pick it up and put it down here.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  Some of these headlines that are featured at infowars.com.
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  CBS panel fears FBI raid in no way to turning Trump from announcing 2024 run.
[51:20.000 --> 51:29.000]  Yeah, if anything, it boosted his desire if there was ever a lack thereof.
[51:29.000 --> 51:38.000]  And it's only made Trump supporters that much more ardent in their support of Donald Trump, myself included.
[51:38.000 --> 51:45.000]  But you know, looking back on it now that some of the dust has settled on this story, I mean,
[51:45.000 --> 51:51.000]  really the only thing we know is that this is obviously politicized political persecution
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  and Democrats run the show.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  But was it Hillary Clinton that wanted this done to Trump?
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  Was it the Democrat Party?
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  Was it the deep state?
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  Was it Obama?
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  Who was really making this call?
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  Who was really making the call to do the panty raid on Melania Trump's wardrobe?
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  Who really made the call?
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  Whose idea was it to break into Mar-a-Lago?
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  And what were they looking for?
[52:18.000 --> 52:23.000]  Because we've been lied to by the FBI, obviously, about the agenda there.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  What were they really looking for?
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  And if they continue to make the claim of, oh, classified documents or archives or whatever,
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  well, any knowledgeable person knows that that's a lie.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  All you got to do is go back to the president before Trump, Obama, and look at all the documents
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  that he seized.
[52:42.000 --> 52:49.000]  I mean, the guy basically stole national archives and then built a compound in Chicago with
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  federal money that he can go stash it in.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  And that was a huge story.
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  That was a big debate and a big controversy when Obama did it.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  But hey, it's Obama.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  He just does whatever the hell he wants.
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  So they said, oh, Obama took these archives and is hiding them now.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  And it was just kind of like, oh, yeah, but it's Obama.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  So I guess we have to let him do it.
[53:11.000 --> 53:18.000]  By the way, you know, that was the big story last week, the raid, obviously.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  But there was other big stories.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  I mean, how about the CDC announcing that COVID is basically the flu?
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  They just came out and just said, yeah, COVID's just the flu, basically.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  Go back to normal.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  No big deal.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  Didn't even make news.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  People still run around wearing their masks, like a bunch of jackasses.
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  The FBI was supposed to turn over the Hunter Biden laptop to a congressional oversight
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  committee.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  They didn't do it.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  Just didn't do it.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Didn't even make the news.
[53:45.000 --> 53:57.000]  So they're hoarding all the criminal activity that is in the Biden laptop from hell.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  So there were other big news stories.
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  You had the FBI plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.000]  You have that trial going on, all the exposure of what the feds were doing to set people up,
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  lying to people, trapping people.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  That all came out as well.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  And it was all overwhelmed by the raid at Mar-a-Lago.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  How convenient.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  Not to mention it was the one year anniversary, or I guess it's about to be.
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.000]  I don't know what the exact date was, when Biden had the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.000]  where the 15 servicemen got killed, and then they came back to America and Biden was too
[54:37.000 --> 54:45.000]  busy checking his watch to show his respect to the fallen soldiers.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  So all of that was going on, but it all was overwhelmed because of that raid at Mar-a-Lago,
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  which obviously is the biggest story of them all.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  But yet those other ones, still pretty big.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  CDC, eh.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  COVID's just the flu.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  FBI, Hunter Biden's laptop, yeah, we're just not going to turn that over.
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  Yeah, we're just not going to do that, yeah.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  We're just not going to investigate the Biden crime family while Biden's on what is 50th
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  vacation of his presidency, more vacation time.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  The only person that took more days off was Obama.
[55:21.000 --> 55:27.000]  So Biden outdoing Obama, just like he got more votes than Obama too, you know.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  Just like he got more votes than Obama.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  Oh, this is nice.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  Again, these are the headlines from Infowars.com.
[55:36.000 --> 55:44.000]  Caught on video, CPS employee tells 14-year-old girl to become prostitute.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  Wow, nice CPS, very nice.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  FBI seized privileged Trump records during raid.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  DOJ opposes independent review.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  Of course, of course they don't want an independent review.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  They're crooks, they're criminals.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  They need to be shut down.
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.000]  That's what I'm saying, like, it's not just Infowars saying this now.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  The media focuses on Infowars because they want to use us
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.000]  like we're like the guy hanging in the gallows.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  So when people come into the city, they see this guy, they see a dead guy hanging.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  They say, oh, I don't want to steal here.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  I don't want to be a pirate here.
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.000]  That's what they try to do to Infowars is just put Alex Jones bloody rotting carcass
[56:33.000 --> 56:39.000]  up hanging in the gallows so everybody can see, oh, I don't want to do what Alex Jones does.
[56:39.000 --> 56:49.000]  So they see Fox News and other independent journalists and news hosts becoming more like Infowars
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  which is just telling it like it is, telling the truth, giving the American people the real story
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  with the foresight.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  And then they just say, oh, my gosh, it's so bad what Infowars has done.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  They want that, they want Infowars up there bloody and hanging in the gallows
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  so that all the other media organizations will say, oh, we don't want to be like that.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  We don't want to end up like that.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  We better not tell the truth.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  We better not question the FBI.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  And so I just say the FBI needs to be shut down.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  The FBI are terrorist organizations.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  Oh, well, let's see.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  They're the ones that were plotting to kidnap the governor.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  What does that mean?
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  And then they say, whoa, don't say anything bad about the FBI.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  And you better not sound like Infowars either or we'll do to you what we did to them.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  But it's too late.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  The cat's out of the bag.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  Any rational American right now knows that the government's out of control
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  and that the FBI has been politicized and needs to be shut down.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  Sold out for more than six months.

[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  And right now we still have time to prepare.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.

[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Yeah, Trump had more people outside of his moro lago residents after the raid than Biden has at any of his presidential campaign events combined.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  But hey, 81 million votes, bigot.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  I've got a feeling we've got some great callers on the line.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  And so we're going to be spending the rest of tonight's transmission taking calls.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  And let's start it out with Bart in Georgia on the ruining of pro sports.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  It really has gone south in the last decade or so.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Bart, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Go ahead.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Yeah, they started ruining America decades ago by destroying major league baseball.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  And I'll refer to your story when 1976, I was 10 years old, went to my first baseball game.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  My father said, come on, son, I'm taking you to school.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  We got in the car.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  He said, you're not going to school.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  We'd like you to say you're sick.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  We went to the game and he skipped work.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Ah, yes, the old businessman special.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Yeah, when they put lights in the ring, we feel they ruined that tradition.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  That was a huge controversy there.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  I think it was the late 80s.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  They had like all these petitioners saying, don't put lights at Wrigley.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  It took them forever to get them up.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Yeah, and then here's another story.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  My father bought season tickets to Atlanta Braves in 1978.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  And they went right behind home plate.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  And then they went on strike for most of the season.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And I never forgave them for it.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  It really is sad, too.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And, you know, the whole thing is so controlled now.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Really, that's part of the problem, too, is it's also micromanaged with your Nazi ushers
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  and your parking lot Nazi ushers and everything.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  It's like, I remember even just the tail end of the 90s.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  It was like, you're going to an event.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Find a place to park, park your car and go to the event.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Now it's like, oh, they got these ushers everywhere and parking a lot of tenants everywhere.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  You can't go here. You can't go there.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  There's parking everywhere, but you can't park there.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And you're just like, what? This doesn't even make sense.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  Yeah, and you can't get any more Americana than baseball and hot dogs.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Remember the old, who is the old cubby player that the guy was about to set the flag on fire in the field
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  and he went and ripped it out of his hands and the crowd went wild.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Remember that?
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  I don't remember that. I think I was boycotting him.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  You're not going to see anything like that anymore.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Now they've just burned the American flag as part of the experience.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Like, yeah, down with America. Woo-hoo!
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  It's crazy, Bart.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Thank you. I'm just no longer interested in professional sports.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  They don't help me pay my rent.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Well, it's a damn shame, too, that, I mean, you have that, like, a small handful of athletes
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  that are even willing to say anything against the establishment, anything against the grain.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  All the professional sporting events have sold out to the left, sold out to China.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  And all you really have is Dana White at the UFC. That's it.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  That's the only pro-America professional sporting leader or organization is the UFC.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  And it's pathetic.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  All right, Bart, thanks for the call.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Let's go to Kevin in New York. Kevin, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  You know, I was going to talk about the whole Trump scenario.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  But you talked about, like, sports and how they're changing, rewriting history and changing sports.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  I was watching an Elvis movie, the new one. Have you seen that one already?
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  You know, I've noticed this trend. There's, like, a bunch of Elvis movies out now.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  I don't know what's up with that, but I don't know which one you're talking about.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  It's the big bad, you know, it's the guy who did the great gas fake, you know.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  So he's got it hyped up with music, glit.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And I'm a huge Elvis guy. I've read, like, seven or eight books in Elvis.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  You know, I've been a big fan. But all of a sudden they've re-writted.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  And when you watch the movie, Elvis is, the whole premise is that he's, like, almost like a civil rights leader, you know.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And there's such an emphasis on focus.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Oh, so it's like rewriting the story of Elvis.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Elvis was, like, macho man, masculine.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  He was an American champion. I mean, he was a fighter. He was a soldier.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  He was a musician. He was an actor. Like, he was the all-American dude.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  So they got to rewrite that history and probably turn him into a left-wing twink or something.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Oh, exactly. Yeah, definitely.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I mean, the movie's beautiful to look at.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  But even, like, scenes where he's going to Beale Street, which was, like, in Tennessee or Memphis,
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  a predominantly black African-American, what do we call it these days, neighborhood,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  and they're playing hip-hop music.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And then they spent about, like, 15 minutes of some soul singer singing instead of Elvis.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And even in the credit, they barely played any Elvis music.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  So, you know, I was thinking about talking about Trump.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Well, sadly, they blew a great time, a chance to make a great movie about Elvis, so it'll probably suck.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  that supplies the highest-quality signature-reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon,
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  and other U.S. government agencies.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America,
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  onion line at a very affordable price.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it, like desktop computers,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  it is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  Redux is InfoWars, taking the highest-quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity,
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  Yeah, I'm getting a lot of reviews about the movie.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  The movie is starting to get delivered to people's houses.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  If you got the pre-order at infowarstore.com, I'm getting a lot of good reviews.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  And now people are finally getting their DVD copies.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  You can get your DVD copy of Alex's War documentary on Alex Jones at infowarstore.com.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  I'm a truck driver. I'm on the road. I haven't got it yet.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And TurboForce, that's all I'm going to say.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Let's get it going.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  I think we're out of TurboForce right now, which is a damn shame,
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  because I drank some today before I went on air.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  We'll get it back in stock hopefully, hopefully soon.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  So the wife and I, I took a week off and we went over to a, I live in Alabama,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  and we went to a water park there, Alabama adventure, pretty nice, you know, real nice.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Had a good time. But everything was digital.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  So I go in there and it was very pricey.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  You know, fortunately I make an okay living and the tickets for two adults was like a hundred bucks.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  And then you got to get a digital thing on your wrist in order to open up this locker.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And that was like $21.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  And then, so I left in there, you know, I didn't bring a whole lot into there
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  because I knew I'm going swimming.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  So I took a little money and I went over, my wife, she wanted some pizza.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  So I go over and I wait in this line and it was long.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And I get up to the front of the line, the two pieces of pizza.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  And then some onion rings or whatever it was, you know, and okay, that'll be X amount of dollars.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  And then she says, so I go to give her the money.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Oh, we don't take money with this at all digital amusement area.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Crazy.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  You know, and I was like, yeah.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Who doesn't take cash?
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Yeah, it was crazy.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And then we went to, I saw that movie, the new Top Gun Maverick there.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  I highly recommend it real good.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  I still haven't seen that one.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Oh, it's really good.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  You'll like it.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  You got everything.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  You'll cry.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  You'll laugh.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  You'll be in suspense.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  It was a great movie.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And then after that, we went out to Chili's and Chili's, you know, everything at Chili's was really good.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  I thought and it was really good.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And then so then they bring over this like tablet and you got to use your credit card on the tablet to pay for it.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  And it asks you like 17 different questions before you can enter.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Enter.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Does it ask you what gender you identify as?
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  I mean, you know.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Just about.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  I mean, just about.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  When was the last time you took a vaccine?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  When was the last time you wore a mask?
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Like, hi, I just want to pay for dinner.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  That's one other thing.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  When we went to the swimming pool there, right?
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  There was people in there with masks on, you know, and I'm like, one guy, I looked at him, I said, are you a ninja?
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  And he looked at me like with his eyes, but that's all you could see.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Because he had the, he had this like turtle thing neck up to his, up to his like eyeballs.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  And he was wearing a hat and he looked like a ninja.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And I'm like, what are you a ninja?
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  How are you going to go in the water and not get wet?
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  You know, I mean, you know, we got to protect from COVID.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I mean, you know, yeah, these people are crazy.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  But anyway, you know, it said the trouble force and the silver lining.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Hey, thanks for the call, Jay.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  And maybe the silver lining in this is that.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  I mean, how do you really properly?
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Because it's all going this way.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  It's all centralized.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  It's all a centralized influence of making everything digital, putting everything on smart grids, internet grids and all this stuff.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  It's like, I mean, honestly, it's, it's the analogy or maybe the reality is it's an interdimensional spider that is building its web or net.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  Internet, worldwide web.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And it's an interdimensional spider building its net to capture all of us.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  And it's like the spider doesn't even respect us as prey.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  It just, it builds its net and it just knows we're going to go into it to be, to be eaten.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  But the spider doesn't want blood and guts.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  It wants souls.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  So the silver lining is whatever this influence is taking everything digital that this interdimensional spider catching everything in its net.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  We're going to have to build our own systems.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  We're going to have to build our own communities.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  We're going to have to get back to human behavior in our own way.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And that's going to be the only way to do this because you see where it's all going.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  The corporate world government has influence and control over all of it.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And that's why everywhere you go, like major sporting events, you see all their propaganda.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  They don't take cash.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  So, and we've held it off a little bit.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  We've definitely held it off a little bit, but we know where it's going.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  We know where it's all going.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  And of course they don't want you to have cash because if you have cash, then you can't be controlled.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  But if everything's digital, they can shut your, they can shut your access to money off.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  They can take all your money away.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  It's all just numbers.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  There's no real assets there.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  And so that's why they want to get rid of cash.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Let's go to Carol in Texas now.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Carol, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Go ahead.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Oh, and how's it going?
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Happy Sunday to you.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Hi.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  I'm good.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Thank you.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  So, getting back to what you were talking about, going to the sports event you went to.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  You know what it is personally?
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  I think they just don't want us coming together sharing the basic human experience of friendship and camaraderie.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  They just want us to be like that.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  What was it?
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Running names?
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  What was it?
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Yes.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Yep.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  You know.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  I mean, my God.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Kids can go to Kentucky too for God's sake without some kind of big stat rat training out.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  They're trying to, you know, trying to give them that pizza, you know what I mean, you know?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  Well, there's definitely an element of they don't want the human experience of people coming together, but they can't avoid it.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  So, if it's going to be there, they have to layer on all their propaganda so that you have to deal with it every time.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  And what does a trans flag have to do with sports? I mean, besides, you know, Heather from South Park.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Can you imagine? I mean, I'm serious.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  I'm walking into a ball game.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  I'm walking into the soccer game and here's a COVID-19 vaccine tent and then here's 30 gay flags waving.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  And I'm like, what the hell?
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  I know.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  It's not like it was back in the day. I don't know if you've ever been to a WWF or a WWE.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Oh, of course.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  We're gonna say the best. It's like you can sneak up in the front.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  If you have general, like general mission, you can kind of sneak up and wade to the rock and everything.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And you know what? And you know what it was? You know what it was too?
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  There was no political correctness.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Now everything's got to be politically correct.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And so in other words, everything has to suck.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And it's like they can go back and they're doing it now to like the rock.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  The rock used to make all kinds of racist jokes in the 90s.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  They all used to do racist jokes. It was hilarious.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  It was fun. Everybody had fun.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  The WWF was the most politically incorrect thing on television and they had the top three rated shows in every market.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  And that's what made it great. And now when you bow to absurdity, that's what you get, you know?
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  I mean, in my 51 years, well, this is my special day, by the way, once I was spending my birthday with my info warriors.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Wait, did you say today's your birthday?
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  Oh, happy birthday.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I can spend it with a better crowd. My info wars people, you know?
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Happy birthday, Carol.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Oh, thank you.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And also one more thing, I was in sleep on Friday when you were talking with that gentleman.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  His name gave me.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  But when you were talking of me wearing that Obama thing, it's like that popped in my head before you even put it on.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I was like, I knew he was I knew he was going to go with him.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  You're talking about in 2008 when Obama said we need to have the civilian law for a law force bigger than the military, basically.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  And now that's what they're doing with the IRS.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I know it just boggles my mind.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  It's like, you never want to believe this is going to happen. I mean, it's like, Alex, he's been he has been bought on since I've been listening for the past 15 years.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  But like, no, this nobody ever wants to believe that the worst is going to happen.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Well, here's the problem. Here's why it's so hard for people to really believe it, I guess, is because it's hard to look at because Obama isn't presented as a radical ideological revolutionary.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  But that's what he is. Barack Obama is a radical left wing communist revolutionary who is intentionally for eight years as president and still afterwards trying to sabotage America and sabotage our way of life.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  But see, Obama's presented as kind of, oh, you know, he's slick, he's cool, he's well spoken, he's popular.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  No, he is a radical communist revolutionary.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  These people are radical communist revolutionaries. That's why they're expanding the IRS.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.

[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  And the answer is very simple. It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions known herbal compounds that boosts libido, stamina and energy and it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed. It's been sold out for eight months or more.

[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  This needs to be addressed for what it is because I don't really know how to properly because I want to be caring.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  I don't want to sound off-putting or cold about this because these people need help. They're seriously mentally deranged.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  And really what it is, it's an addiction, folks.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  And so what you saw from Gay Pride Month is really a bunch of perverts and sex addicts who can't even stop having gay orgies when they're breaking out with monkeypox.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  And now, folks, if you didn't realize what this really was, just total sexual depravity, it's about to come out that they're also engaged in it looks like beastiality.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And now dogs are getting monkeypox on their anus.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  So I'm not trying to be gross here.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  We have a serious sexual depravity problem in this country and it's being celebrated as liberal.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  It is degenerate, it is filthy, and it is deadly.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  And so now you're starting to hear, and it's not just dogs getting monkeypox from their owners, little kids are getting it too.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  This is sexual depravity, folks. It is beyond degeneracy and it's not being properly addressed for what it is.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  It is a problem and it's being celebrated.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  So just get ready for that deal.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  So yeah, they're teaching kids how to have sex and they're sexualizing kids and dogs are getting monkeypox.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  I mean, do you see what's going on here?
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  That's what they want. They want their degeneracy, they want their depravity, they want their perversion,
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  and they want it to be celebrated because they know it's wrong.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  They know it's devious.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  So how bad does it have to get?
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  How many kids have to get monkeypox?
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  How many dogs have to get monkeypox before we call this what it is?
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  This isn't your sexual revolution of the 60s, folks.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  This is your sexual revolution of the 2020s that are going to result in a lot of people getting really sick.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  And they're not going to stop because they're being celebrated.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  So get ready for that. You're going to hear about dogs and kids with monkeypox and you know exactly how they got it.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  They're going to act like we don't know what's going on.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Because they can't have their liberal leftist gay sex revolution get stymied by the fact that they're spreading diseases rampantly
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  even after we just had everything shut down for the flu.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Incredible stuff.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Let's go back out to the phone lines now. Let's go to Sarah in Austin here.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  She wants to talk about my shared experience from the soccer game last night.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  Sarah, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  Hey, how's it going?
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Hey, I'm good. Thank you.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  So I just moved to Austin a couple months ago as my fiance.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And we've been seeing the Austin FD merch everywhere.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And it seems like it's always people wearing masks, wearing it, but...
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  Very well. It's almost like they're only going for liberals to be fans of this team.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Exactly. There's something weird about it.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  But some friends offered us tickets in the fan section for free because they were going to be out of town.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  So we were like, sure, we'll go to a soccer game. That sounds fun.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Had to park by the domain because we missed the train.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Nowhere to park.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Yep. Had to walk a mile.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And then of course, the second we get there, we see the COVID-19 free vaccine tent.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Like it was just so ridiculous.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  But when we get to the fan section, I was shocked by the amount of trends and intersectional flags.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  I couldn't believe it. I was like, felt like we were in the Twilight Zone.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  It's weird. You're like, you think you're going to a soccer game and you're just going to some globalist propaganda death cult ceremony.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Exactly. Like there was just something so weird about it.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  I'm like, okay, this is fun drinking beer at a game. The energy is great.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Like the game was exciting. But why is this going on?
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Like, why does this have to be happening while I'm here?
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  I just don't get it.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Well, this is what liberalism does. This is what communists do.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  They have to take everything that is popular or ceremonious for the community.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And they have to take it and they have to conquer it and then they have to layer their propaganda over it.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  That's what communists do. And that's what they're doing to us now.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  So now you go to a soccer game. The soccer game is the sideshow.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  The liberal propaganda is the real event.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Oh, absolutely. Me and my fiance were saying, if we ever go to another game, we're going to take a page out of Alex Stein's notebook and go culture jam and just carry a big American flag in the same section and just act like, what's wrong?
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  We're just holding an American flag.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  You know, it's funny because that was my instinct, too, is to say, why don't I just bring a big American flag and wave it and see what happens?
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  And I do wonder what would happen because they get to wave all their flags.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  They got 30 different trans flags that are waving. The biggest, highest flags there are all the gay trans flags and not single American flag.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I wonder what would happen if somebody waved an American flag. I really do.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Yeah, same. I think it would be. I think we would get a lot of dirty looks, but they can't say anything. They can't make me put it away. They've got all their flags out.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  But it's almost like you want to do the culture jamming in that regard just to see the response or to force them.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Because I really wonder if they would just tell you not to wave the flag. I mean, that wouldn't surprise me one bit.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  I mean, they got Black Lives Matter flags waving, too, folks. I mean, it's crazy.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  Yeah, it was crazy. Hey, by the way, I've heard Elijah Schaefer mention and Austin Info Wars gets together. What is that?
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  I'm not so sure. Why don't we get to put her on hold and see what she's talking about, guys, and we'll talk about that.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Let's now go to Last Prepper Standing in Texas. You're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  How's it going, man? Hey, good, man. Thanks for calling.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  You know, I want to start out by thanking you and Alex, first of all, because I'm sure that you guys have been in the fray more than anyone else in the truth or community.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  And you guys aren't commended enough for it, especially you.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Well, look, I don't do this for fortune or fame. I kind of hate it, to be honest. But what's wild is...
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  It's like, I really don't even want to talk about it. What's wild is that I'm the one that's been defamed, okay?
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  I have been so slandered, libeled, and defamed. It's insane. I have more death threats coming in than ever before.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  I have more lies about me in the media than ever before. And it's like, I'm just sitting here like, wow, I'm the one that's getting targeted.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  I'm the one that's getting the life destroyed. I'm the one being defamed. But then I'm the one that gets sued for it.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  It's total Twilight Zone stuff.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  It is Twilight Zone stuff, just like showing up to a soccer event where there's 30 gay flags against you.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  And any time in human history, you showed up to somewhere, and there was 30 flags against you, you would understand that you were being conquered.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  And that's what it is. See, that's what it is right there. They have to wave it in your face that they've conquered you.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  They have to show it off that they've conquered you. That's why they wave all the gay flags.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  So how do we stop that, Owen?
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Well, sadly, you can either cult your gym to push back against it, or you just don't take part in it.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  I don't know if you can stop it.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  You just don't take part in it. That's what it is. You need to support businesses and people who only support you.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I used to go to every event there was, sports-wise, I only go to USP. They support what I'm talking about.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  I only try to do business with businesses that support where I'm at.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  And it's harder and harder to find those businesses, but you're absolutely right.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  That's why people need to shop at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase, and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at InfowarsStore.com or TheBioProse.com.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing, and it funds the Infowar.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom, and the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  They want to break up society.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world, available as a major sponsor now.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  Go to TheIronPatriot.com today, TheIronPatriot.com, and watch the instructional video, look at the science yourself, and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.

[1:30:51.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  This also enhances it, so again, get yours today at TheIronPatriot.com.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  In this new book, I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this is it, this is no beach read.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  You're not going to be flipping pages here, you're going to be having a pen out, you're going to be underlining stuff.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  A great reset by Alex Jones.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Order your copy now at Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system,
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  which has allowed Infowars to remain a free public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  Do you understand what I have said?
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  Yes, I believe what I said was true.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Your beliefs do not make something true.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  That is what we're doing here.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  The Infowars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  And with your continued support, we will keep going.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  Join us now and support the Infowars.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  If you found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  You know, another story that isn't really getting covered much, and that's the car crash and death of Ann Hesch.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  I didn't really cover it because it just seemed to be just a basic story, you know, drunk driving or whatever gets in a crash, people die.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  I think she's off Lysport. I don't know if she's been declared dead yet, but there might be another story there.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  And I've just been kind of monitoring this with little interest until recently hearing some details about the crash and then what Ann Hesch was up to as far as her work in Hollywood.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  People are thinking that there might be some foul play there, and there is a video going around that appears to be, after the accident, she's trying to rip herself off the gurney before they shove her into the ambulance.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  In other words, doesn't look like a woman that needed life support before she got to the hospital.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  So that's kind of another weird underlying story that's not getting much attention, but I may dig deeper into that tomorrow on the war room.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I want to go back out to the phone lines now, and I want to go to, let's go to Organic Warrior in Oregon. Organic Warrior, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  Hey, how's it going, Owen?
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  Howdy, good.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  All right, good. Yeah, I just wanted to touch base on Hawaii a little bit, because I'm originally from Kauai, and I always used to hear Alex talk about Kauai, all the elites going over there and stuff.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  We know who's all there, but we want to know who's running for governor is BJ Penn from Hawaii.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  He's leading the people of Hawaii to bring a better place back to Hawaii because it's leading for the rest of the world.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  They do the Monsanto seeds there, and there's a lot of corruption there right now.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Is he a Republican or a Democrat?
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  No, no, no. He's Republican. He's basically like a Trump guy.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  Hawaii is kind of an enigma, isn't it? I mean, it's a lot of people that understand stuff like you said, like GMOs, Monsanto, they like health and organic foods, but then it's like liberal as hell with their leadership.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  So back to BJ. BJ is a great guy to be a governor in Hawaii because he grew up in Hawaii.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  He knows he's got all the Hawaiian people at heart, and what has happened now is corporations have gone in over there and there's corruption inside and this and that.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  But also, he's a UFC world champion. I mean, you guys want to talk about UFC.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  You know, look him up, DJ Penn, but he's running for governor of Hawaii, and we have Makua Kai Rothman. Makua Rothman's running. Also two over there for Oahu Senate.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  He's a pro surfer, professional big wave champion as well. So now it's time for Hawaii to let all the champions and, you know, we could take Kings of Hawaii take over and bring it back to how it should be, which is keeping the Aina clean, picking up garbage,
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  teaching the farming, Hawaiian farming and cultural stuff that needs to be brought back in Hawaii, you know.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Well, the reinforcements are arriving politically, and, you know, really the answer is we need good people to run for office, and it is happening.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  The challenge is obviously beating the rigged elections. I mean, that's really what it comes down to, but the Democrat Party needs to be put in the history books.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  It should not exist any longer. The Democrat Party is so filled with corruption and crime and anti-American activities and terrorism, and then even going back to the KKK and slavery.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  I mean, the Democrat Party needs to be put away, and I'm not for a Uniparty.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  People listening to this in Hawaii, man. People listening to this in Hawaii. Aloha. Vote for DJ because it's going to get better. I know how, you know, everyone's been to Hawaii so expensive and this and that.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Well, and that's why people just need to get informed politically and know who they're voting for, and I'm not for a Uniparty.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  Believe me, I don't want a Uniparty of the Republicans either. I mean, Mitch McConnell is just corrupt as the rest of them, too.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  But the Democrat Party just needs to go. It just absolutely has to go, and finally we have good people running for office.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Thanks for the call. Let's go to Junior in New York. Junior, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Hey, oh, and thanks for taking my call.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  So I was just going to say I had a couple of points I wanted to make, but one was about Trump and how we should always look at things and be cautious of what we believe.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Because I think if you look at Donald Trump's history, he is not trustworthy. And so what is being shown to us in the media could also be some kind of a stunt to kind of throw people off.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  And yeah, I voted for Trump. I met you in DC.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Like, I'm shocked, but the guy can't be trusted. I challenge you guys to have David Ike on and have a special on why Trump can't be trusted because of the type of people he hired, like Wilbur Ross,
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Manukin, he leaves people in jail. He basically doesn't bail out Assange, leaves him to rot. We need some kind of a, my other point is we're going to need some kind of a to get out of this like a white hat situation kind of like with Psyop Steve Bochenek said it was going on with a black row brotherhood.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  If we don't have something like that going on, we're doomed and there's no coming out of this and kind of stuff needs to collapse.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Well, see, that's why that's why the whole QAnon thing was so pivotal for the Democrats.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  It's to give Americans this sense of relief that there are white hats in control. They're not. It was all a lie.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  I mean, who knows the true origin story of QAnon or what happened, but it was obviously used as a Psyop at the end of the day against Trump supporters.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  And as far as your criticism of Trump, it's all fair. I completely agree. Trump has all kinds of faults. He hired horrible people, but the attacks against him are completely legitimate.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  I don't think that's, I don't think that's smoking mirror stuff because Trump has controlled opposition.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I think they're genuinely concerned about Trump and I think more than anything, it's just because they don't control him and he is his self and he's basically a self made man who can do stuff on his own accord without being destroyed.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  And so that's why he has to be destroyed right now. Does he have faults? Can he be trusted? I mean, these are fair questions, but the attempts to destroy the man because he wanted to run the country are, I believe, legitimate.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Thanks for the call. Let's go to Owl Killer in Virginia. Owl Killer, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Hey, so I think it was John Adams that said that the Constitution is only fit for a more own religious people. So here's the deal.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  The system is too broken to fix and the corruption and the blackmail is too much. And what they did to Trump initially when he won, they tried to frame him.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  And now, as long as it was a Bush or a Clinton, they were going to be fine because everybody was in on the same scheme. Right now, what we're dealing with is to cover up is worse than the crimes.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  And the only solution moving forward is, and the only way to get out of this peacefully without some type of physical confrontation because for the first time in my life,
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  I probably felt the way black people have been feeling in this country since its existence. Now, whether the fear of police is justified or not,
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  I probably have the same chance of FBI kicking in my door as they do of getting shot by a police officer, but it's just actually seeing what they were able to do to the president of the United States.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  I think what needs to be done is we need a healing in this nation where all the department and every type of government organization comes out and says,
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  we're not going to, we're not doing the great reset. We're doing the great reboot and we're coming back and everybody is on the same playing field.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  And the only way to do that is agencies like the FBI. They're never going to go peacefully unless you give them their pensions.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And it's the same thing for Congress. Give them their pensions, we'll pay their pensions right now, and we'll give them absolution for all their crimes.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  But I think, but everybody has to go and we have to start over.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Well, there's an area, this message is spreading wide across right wing media that the FBI needs to be shut down.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  It's a unifying, harmonizing message that I haven't seen in right wing media in a long time.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  We're going to talk about the torment that Democrats are putting on conservatives right now. Absolutely.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  And it's just what Democrats did to black people. You're absolutely right.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  The fear that Democrats put in black people in the South during the Jim Crow era, they're now using similar tactics to put fear in conservatives.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  So that's what they're doing. That's why they go after Trump so much. That's why they go after Trump supporters so much.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  They want us to live in fear of them because they're tyrants. They're authoritarians. They're the oppressors.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  So yeah, this is why the Democrat Party has to go, folks. The Democrat Party never changed. Never did it change.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  It's cold pressed. It's been sold out for eight months or more.

[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  These studies are all clear. The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  They want to break up society.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.

[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Thank you so much for joining us and we'll spread the word my friends. We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Let's go to Kay in Oklahoma. This is a big story Kay. The cover-up of the Oklahoma City bombing, the cover-up of the Unabomber, is it all connected to the people involved with the Trump raid?
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Kay in Oklahoma, go ahead.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  Actually, I believe so because here in the state of Oklahoma, we had the Oklahoma City bombing.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  And things are starting to come out now and Alex was actually, I'm watching something called the Noble Isle of Oklahoma City bombing.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  I had a guest on, I'm going to probably get him on back this week, Chris Emory, who worked with that documentary. I think I'm going to have him back to talk about that.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Yes, and it is amazing to me because how the feds and the CIA were both involved in bringing down the building that killed and killed children, killed innocent people, and also injured 800 people.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  But what's so funny is the ATF was, well, their offices were inside that building, but the ATF were told not to go in that day.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  And how I see all this stuff, you know, Timothy McVeigh, he's so hated the government, but he has been shown to be an operative of the government.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  And people are like...
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  And I'm probably under mind control, MKUltra.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  Probably, I wouldn't put it past it. But how I see is the FBI, how they have attacked Ellen and Whitewater paperwork.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  The investigation for Whitewater was also stored in War Building.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And by the way, I'm pretty sure, because I was looking at this, I'm pretty sure that Merrick Garland actually refused to sign a search warrant of Ted Kazinski's house.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  Merrick Garland, the guy who signed off on the warrant to raid Trump, refused to sign off on a warrant for Ted Kazinski.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  Yes.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  So that's why I want to get Chris Emery back on to kind of get all these facts laid out in front of me.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  I mean, it's just crazy how it's all connected. I mean, you want to talk about a deep state, it's always the same names, the same characters with the same connections.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  And on both parties, so they wouldn't say, our state has now been taken over by a white rhino group, anti-Trump, anti-American, first agenda group.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And we're a 100% Trump state. All 77 counties voted for Trump.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Actually, I'm not even kidding you. I'm so sick and tired of Democrats that I looked for the most red counties in America.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And it actually was Southern Oklahoma and Southwest Texas.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I think it was Love County, Oklahoma, that was 99% for Trump.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Yes.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Like that's where you want to go.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Well, we got a Trump rally coming this weekend. We're ready to go.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  There's a Trump rally happening right now on, I think it was Long Beach or, I don't remember where it was.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Like thousands of cars, just an organic Trump train just happening again by 81 million votes as he's on his 39th vacation of his presidency.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Kay, thank you for the call. Let's go to Anna in Texas.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Anna, you're on Alex Jones' show. Go ahead.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Hi, Owens. I've been a consistent listener since 2020 when the COVID mess started and so I've been hearing info wars, exposing everything, even through the election fraud.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  And it was so eye-opening. But what I realized is that, and many listeners have realized, is that we no longer have a free nation.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  We pretty much have a, we're in a hijacked ship.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  And, you know, it's been very, very inspirational hearing everyone, you know, share what they're doing, you know, the gentleman from my pillows and all of that stuff is going on.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  And, you know, it's like a lot of defensive little battles that somehow, you know, we still lose.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  And that was thinking, you know, the offensive strategy I was here, Alex mentioned, like, what do we do now? What do we do now?
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  And the offensive strategy that I've been seeing is that there's three areas that these people that hijacked the ship are focusing on.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  That's AI, you know, total control, the money and the food system.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  And I just feel like, you know, if we were to focus offensively versus defensively on, you know, just gathering all of the listeners and the Americans that still believe in this nation and to focus, like, on AI, you know,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  they're trying to take over control as by everything we do on social media. Why are we still on social media? Why are we still on this hijacked ship heading to the slaughter?
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Well, and so now you bring up a very, this is one of the greatest dilemmas of the individual is to say, do I just completely break from civilization because it's become so corrupt?
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  Or do I continue to engage in the corrupt civilization at the hope or the chance that we can save it or turn it around?
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  It's a true mental dilemma that everybody kind of will have to go through.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  But the problem that we're having is that, you know, I think it's fair to say that this country has never experienced a threat like we're experiencing right now,
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  a domestic enemy that would be the Democrat Party actively working to sabotage this nation from within with its hands on all the control systems.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  I don't think this country has ever had a threat like this with sheeps and wolves clothing like or rather wolves and sheeps clothing like Barack Obama and so many of their ideological leaders.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  So that's the problem is first we have to recognize, first we must accept and recognize what the true threat continuum is.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  And then we can properly come together to deal with it.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  But most people still don't understand.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  They're starting to understand the Mar-a-Lago raid certainly up to the understanding like 100 times.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  But there needs to be a complete understanding, a total in totality that the Democrat Party is a direct threat to this country.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  That's not just rhetoric. That's not through osmosis. They have chosen this path.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  They are actively and openly trying to sabotage this country. That is not up for debate.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  So we have to recognize that's the problem.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  And do we want to have a party that just destroys the country?
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Is that what we want? I don't think so.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  But first we have to recognize the threat continuum that it is.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  And it is the Democrat Party.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  The Democrat Party that's been around.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  They were the racist ones that wanted to keep their slaves. They were the ones that wrote the Jim Crow laws.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  They were the ones that bombed buildings and killed police officers.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  And now they're the ones undermining the U.S., bringing in globalism, and actively trying to sabotage the free people of this country.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  So people need to understand that.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And I think the political persecution against Donald Trump by the Democrat Party is waking people up to the true issue.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  And so then you have the problem of, well, okay, if we're going to do this peacefully and politically, we've got to have fair elections.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  There's where we run into the massive hurdle that we're not sure we can leap right now.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  Because I mean, we really don't even know how to properly measure it up.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  And most people still don't even understand it's there.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  But the awakening is happening.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  So it's really just a race against time.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Can the globalists, can the Democrats destroy America before enough people wake up to realize the threat and stop it politically?
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  So that's the challenge we face.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And thank you for the call.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  All right, that's going to do it for the calls today.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  I'm sorry to the callers I didn't get to.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Christy Lee may or may not be taking phone calls.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  She usually has great guests on when she hosts.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  So I'm not sure what Christy Lee has planned coming up for Sunday Night Live.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  But I do want to thank everybody that called in.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Glad we could get ahold of you and get you on the air.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  And of course, I'll be back hosting the War Room 3 p.m. tomorrow.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  And we are expecting Alex Jones to be back hosting his show at 11 a.m. central tomorrow as well.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Now, every day is a challenge to stay on air here.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  And so just remember, folks, InfowarsStore.com is the place to support us financially.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  And it really angers me when I see people out there celebrating what they think is going to be the demise of Infowars.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And they just want to see Alex Jones basically bloody corpse hanging in the gallows, what their lawyers say.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  It's like, we're going to take the corpse of Infowars and we're going to get all their money.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Okay, but you're the good guys, I'm sure.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  No, it's the fact that, folks, there's 100 employees or so here and a lot of them have families.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  And they don't care. They just want to destroy people's lives.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  They just want to destroy innocent people's lives.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  This is the Democrat Party.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  But with your continued support at InfowarsStore.com, with you telling friends and family that we're on the air every day,
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  with you spreading the links and with you praying for us, we're going to continue to be on air.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  And nothing angers the left like Infowars being on air.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  I mean, they are fuming every day Alex Jones' voice is on the air.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  They are fuming every day when my voice is on the air.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  They are just fuming, just fits of rage inside of them that Infowars is still on the air.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  They are just torn apart inside, which is sad they hate free speech so much, but that's who they are.
