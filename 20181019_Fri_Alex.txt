[00:00.000 --> 00:18.640]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:30.000 --> 00:52.960]  it is the 18th day that's right you're now 18 days out from the unbelievably historic and
[00:52.960 --> 00:59.120]  critical midterm elections that are referendum on nationalism versus globalism but really what
[00:59.120 --> 01:04.160]  they're attached of is can the democrats get enough illegal aliens to vote in the past that
[01:04.160 --> 01:10.320]  not been the issue they were just having democrats and people they hired like homeless go out and
[01:10.320 --> 01:18.160]  vote off of the voter registration rolls of people who'd recently died in obituaries they would take
[01:18.160 --> 01:22.080]  the obituaries and line those up and that's the famous thing democrats are well known for and have
[01:22.080 --> 01:27.200]  been caught literally tens of thousands of times doing and then all the project Veritas underground
[01:27.200 --> 01:34.720]  video showing all of it but now in texas in other areas it's in the washington times it's in the
[01:34.720 --> 01:41.840]  houston chronicle texas democrats openly ask non-citizens the register to vote and they run
[01:41.840 --> 01:48.400]  the voter registration operations now that's out of houston and austin and other cities they've
[01:48.400 --> 01:56.160]  been caught and this is official and they've also caught democrats using early voting ballots that
[01:56.160 --> 02:06.160]  you can mail in to engage in the massive coordinated fraud and that's just what's going on in texas
[02:06.160 --> 02:12.320]  that we've caught them doing as the investigators say they estimate that they might bust one group
[02:13.600 --> 02:19.280]  for maybe one percent of the fraud they're engaging in so
[02:19.280 --> 02:25.200]  it's probably for every group you bust a hundred other groups out there operating
[02:25.200 --> 02:30.960]  conservatively and then you only bust the group that you do bust for a tiny percentage of what
[02:30.960 --> 02:37.600]  they're doing as well but remember the democrats are trying to kill logic they're all over the news
[02:37.600 --> 02:44.320]  saying it's insane trumps insane alex jones is insane no one is trying to vote illegally
[02:44.320 --> 02:50.320]  it doesn't exist and no one wants illegal aliens to vote and illegal aliens aren't voting
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.280]  and no one's voting in the names of dead people even though it's a joke that more dead people
[02:59.280 --> 03:07.280]  vote in chicago than living lbj got into congress famously stuffing ballot boxes in texas it's a
[03:07.280 --> 03:15.040]  fact but the death of logic is that they will then tell you on the news mainstream media
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.800]  and and lepers media that they're registering illegals to vote that a whole bunch of democrat
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.120]  controlled states have legalized illegal aliens voting in many cities and counties so they're
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.160]  mainlining it with one arm and then telling you out the other side of their mouth it's not happening
[03:32.160 --> 03:41.040]  it's incredible now the big news today the big news today is this
[03:43.440 --> 03:49.280]  we've known this it's been clear that they've been hyping that trump and my shelf and others are
[03:49.280 --> 03:53.760]  wanting to carry out violence or provocateur violence against the media well they actually
[03:53.760 --> 03:58.800]  provocateur violence against us and building up towards the election it's clear the pre-programming
[03:58.800 --> 04:06.560]  has been massive like a pr rollout for the super bowl or you know a new hains underwear commercial
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.120]  i mean you know when a new flavor of coca-cola is coming out because the ads are everywhere
[04:11.120 --> 04:14.640]  well they're hyping that there's going to be terror attacks against the media and that it's
[04:14.640 --> 04:19.040]  conservatives and christians libertarians and nationals fault and mainly donald trump and
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.120]  alex jumps and so we've all got to be shut down and we've all got to be arrested and then they lie
[04:23.120 --> 04:30.560]  about what we said well now they've gone into total overdrive saying that the attacks on the
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.400]  media are imminent that trump wants to get journalists murdered and killed and 18 days out
[04:36.400 --> 04:43.280]  i'm more sure than ever they are getting ready to false flag university schools government buildings
[04:44.320 --> 04:51.120]  media complex systems and that's why they want us off the air and censored before they pull it so
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.320]  that there's no countervailing narrative of questioning who benefits and who has a history
[04:56.320 --> 05:02.880]  of doing it and who's been hyping it's imminent words cannot describe how big the stakes are for
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.920]  the future of humanity right now info wards is being openly targeted at the democratic party
[05:08.480 --> 05:14.080]  left to cia operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire soros crime syndicate
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.000]  people say why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating and running
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.880]  america into the ground and i knew we had no future if we didn't do this so we've already had
[05:22.880 --> 05:29.280]  incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight
[05:29.280 --> 05:34.000]  is and why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.760]  spread the word about our articles and videos info wars dot com we won't just continue to stand up
[05:39.760 --> 05:46.080]  against these brutal scumbags we'll win we have huge sales info or store dot com right now and we're
[05:46.080 --> 05:50.080]  still able to operate the shopping cart gets stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to
[05:50.080 --> 05:55.120]  block our commerce and you're right to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially
[05:55.120 --> 05:59.760]  soros the global spring win this is info wars darkest hour we're your support i'm counting on you
[05:59.760 --> 06:15.680]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:15.680 --> 06:30.720]  this is a red alert this is a red alert this is an emergency alert
[06:31.360 --> 06:37.760]  coming to you from deep in the heart of texas austin 18 days out from the most historic
[06:37.760 --> 06:43.920]  election in world history i've been saying that for two years since trump became president elect
[06:43.920 --> 06:50.800]  almost two years ago and now even the council on farm relations in the financial times of
[06:50.800 --> 06:56.720]  london and atlantic monthly admit that it is a referendum on nationalism versus globalism it's
[06:56.720 --> 07:05.040]  a referendum on can we stop massive coordinated election fraud from battleground states across
[07:05.040 --> 07:11.680]  the country now international and national polls show that texas is about 20 more republican
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.320]  than it is in democrat and folks know that republicans and conservatives tend to vote
[07:16.320 --> 07:23.280]  more than liberals so why do they see texas as a potential blue state because of election fraud
[07:24.560 --> 07:29.520]  and because they're cheating we're going to have to work harder i've got the washington times you
[07:29.520 --> 07:41.200]  name it all reporting on democrats publicly registering illegal aliens to vote now illegal
[07:41.200 --> 07:46.640]  aliens voting is not but a big deal usually folks voting the names of dead folks usually
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.360]  homeless people they bust around to do it that's well known but they're telling illegals that it's
[07:51.360 --> 07:57.040]  okay and that it's they're right now and they have to make it official because the average illegal
[07:57.040 --> 08:00.960]  doesn't want to submit a crime actually on average they're to share illegally they're a little bit
[08:00.960 --> 08:07.760]  scared to be picked up and so the extent of their criminal activity is is is is generally
[08:07.760 --> 08:13.520]  just wanting a better life but the democrats are going to induct them into this brainwashing
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.320]  and into this corruption and more and more the illegals are voting and many cities like san
[08:18.320 --> 08:24.080]  francisco let illegal aliens vote in local elections this is treason but you let sanctuary
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.200]  cities break the law they're going to go all the way so coming up texas democrats ask non-citizens
[08:29.200 --> 08:36.000]  to register to vote it's mainstream news and we've got news out of fort worth out of dallas and out
[08:36.000 --> 08:45.840]  of houston where they're busting democrats on the payroll of the democratic party in battleground
[08:45.840 --> 08:55.040]  texas going in and filling out absentee ballots of old people who they know they're in a nursing home
[08:55.040 --> 08:58.800]  or they know they're they're they're they've got Alzheimer's and they've got a list of them
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.760]  and they go through and they fill them out they get a mail to them they fill them out and they mail
[09:03.760 --> 09:12.720]  them back in so this is just an incredible time to be alive obviously the really big news is
[09:15.600 --> 09:21.600]  that the democrats are now and the deep state and the corporate media and the hollywood scum
[09:23.040 --> 09:26.640]  that's perched on top of us feeding off of us has now gone from
[09:26.640 --> 09:39.680]  a parroting drumbeat of alex jones and president trump are organizing people to kill mainstream
[09:39.680 --> 09:45.520]  media oh we're victims oh my gosh if you criticize us or call us liars you're trying to get us killed
[09:45.520 --> 09:52.400]  it's gone from a steady drumbeat to a banging crescendo to now a cacophony that sounds like
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.840]  a thousand railway trains you know rumbling back past your house in the dead of night blowing their
[09:57.840 --> 10:12.480]  whistles and what does that tell me i'm not a rocket scientist like neil armstrong but i know
[10:12.480 --> 10:20.240]  when i see a big giant corporate alignment chirping the same thing over and over and over and over
[10:20.240 --> 10:26.960]  and over and over again that they know something's coming it's called basic deduction my dear watson
[10:26.960 --> 10:33.040]  and that they have a history of staging events against themselves they have a history of hyping
[10:33.040 --> 10:37.600]  it they have a history of then blaming innocent groups they want to enslave or take rights away
[10:37.600 --> 10:44.560]  with it and they are desperate cornered rats right now and that they are preparing to allow
[10:44.560 --> 10:51.120]  terror attacks to to provocateur terror attacks or to carry them out whole cloth and then drop alex
[10:51.120 --> 10:58.080]  jones info wars or donald trump paraphernalia at the scene that's a two plus two equals four
[10:58.640 --> 11:07.920]  deduction there's no doubt 18 days out that they've got a bunch of different projects from i'd say
[11:07.920 --> 11:18.320]  truck bombs to mass shooters uh to poisoning that they've got a long line of different scenarios ready
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.080]  with the bombs loaded on the trucks with the chemical and biological weapons loaded up in
[11:26.080 --> 11:42.400]  the basements with the shooters with their cartridges prepared with their magazines fixed
[11:46.240 --> 11:54.160]  think about that is there any doubt meanwhile what do they do every day until i can't even
[11:54.160 --> 12:00.320]  track it anymore they say 25th amendment remove the president on every major news channel it was
[12:00.320 --> 12:08.000]  mika brzezinski and others yesterday today it's rosy o donald saying use the military to kill the
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.400]  president and to attack the white house well right after trump got elected atlantic monthly reported
[12:14.400 --> 12:20.880]  that they were preparing a pentagon plan to stay behind networks not the whole pentagon but democrat
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.920]  cells operatives just like the justice department to overthrow the president not just with the 25th
[12:25.920 --> 12:34.240]  amendment but with a military coup d'etat so you think about that ladies and gentlemen
[12:35.520 --> 12:41.840]  media false flag imminent establishment trying to kick in fours off internet before big event
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.120]  that's from back in august and you know i knew they were going to take us off the internet in
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.760]  banus when there were thousands of articles a day some days hundreds every day and every local
[12:51.760 --> 12:57.760]  news station even where i live and family all over the country saying you're on the news every
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.000]  night saying you're a white supremacist and that you bully children and that you did all these
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.080]  terrible things and that you want violence and that you want to kill the media and blah blah
[13:06.080 --> 13:13.040]  blah and i said it's preparing to ban me a few months before the election and then if congress
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.080]  doesn't act and the president doesn't act immediately they will then remove every other libertarian
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.400]  every conservative every christian every nationalist every common sense person
[13:24.480 --> 13:31.280]  and you notice exactly as i said it's now happened because i know giant pr rollouts when i see it
[13:31.280 --> 13:38.720]  good lord it's like poland in 1940 hitler masked a couple million troops on their border and kept
[13:38.720 --> 13:43.760]  saying we're not gonna attack as they lined up all the heavy artillery and troops
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.760]  i mean you know when you're about to get your ass invaded
[13:52.400 --> 13:55.840]  and i told everybody it isn't about alex jones they're coming for you
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.280]  everybody kind of oh we better not say too much to defend alex we'll get censored and then they
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.360]  just every day a couple thousand more conservatives shunned with millions of followers some with
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.080]  hundreds of thousands every day thousands and thousands of twitter and facebook sites everyone
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.240]  i know has had theirs banned even just basic stuff that's christian or pro military or pro gun
[14:16.240 --> 14:23.440]  it's all gone they're gonna take it all because they're getting ready to blow up federal buildings
[14:23.440 --> 14:29.280]  and shoot up schools and blame it on us and they're gonna wind the mob up to come and grab us out of
[14:29.280 --> 14:34.800]  our houses and drag us off and have the police capitulate to their strong cities initiative
[14:34.800 --> 14:38.640]  and literally have you in control which they've openly announced their planning
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.240]  and you go my god that's an insane scenario i know they're insane they're out of control it's
[14:44.240 --> 14:52.480]  unbelievable and now gentlemanly david night and his real news twitter account with hundreds of
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.240]  thousands of followers he has that libertarian it's huge as well but they'll probably try to get
[14:56.240 --> 15:03.520]  that he said that's a twitter began the genteel david night did a satire reading an article out of
[15:03.520 --> 15:12.240]  babelon b dot com about hillary clinton being only 50 percent reptoid we don't push the reptoid
[15:12.240 --> 15:20.400]  conspiracy he certainly doesn't and buzz feed reported it even though we said it was satire
[15:20.400 --> 15:30.480]  and someone else's satire and it was removed that's how they operate but don't worry they're
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.920]  removing anybody that warns of the dangers of std's and unprotected sex now show everything
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.840]  is bug chasing san francisco the insane san francisco culture of the most nihilistic people

[21:17.520 --> 21:24.720]  knight now because of that we need to get into the reason it happened mr knight read from a
[21:24.720 --> 21:33.280]  satyr article babelon b dot com hillary clinton's releases dna test results proving she's only half
[21:33.280 --> 21:40.320]  lizard and mr knight made a joke comparing it to elizabeth warren and well he's now
[21:40.320 --> 21:45.280]  gotten banned we're going to pull that clip up a little bit later for you but this affront
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.440]  happened in the last 24 hours joining us is david knight still broadcasting on
[21:49.440 --> 21:55.440]  hundreds of radio and tv stations and of course at info wars dot com for our show though soros
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.880]  and i are working hard to stop that and we can make jokes about this all day but there's a large
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.000]  stack of news articles here where they say alex jones at info wars are still on twitter despite
[22:06.000 --> 22:13.920]  the ban we've got msn reporting breathlessly on that get him off get everything off but now you
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.760]  can't even make a joke david perhaps we'll all be arrested for what we're doing now or is it
[22:20.400 --> 22:27.280]  that you know who is in command by who you can't criticize is it actually that david i could be
[22:27.280 --> 22:34.240]  correct and that i am actually a real reptoid 14 trillion years old from the planet pendarius
[22:34.800 --> 22:39.440]  and that hillary is one of my hatchlings of true royal lineage and that's why you're not allowed
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.960]  to criticize her uh what do you think mr night well i think if we could show that she was at
[22:44.960 --> 22:50.800]  least 0.09 percent reptilian dna then she would qualify just like elizabeth warren qualifies for
[22:50.800 --> 22:56.160]  being a Cherokee but no alex you know we look at the elizabeth warren thing it was it should have
[22:56.160 --> 23:01.360]  been considered to be satire and i thought it was perfect that the babel and b did that story
[23:01.360 --> 23:05.920]  saying that after looking at elizabeth warren's thing uh hillary had her own dna test and she
[23:05.920 --> 23:10.880]  said those conservatives are lying i'm not a hundred percent reptilian dna i'm only 50 percent now
[23:10.880 --> 23:17.280]  what what the daily beast did was really reprehensible on a number of levels uh they came out yesterday
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.560]  at 526 p.m eastern standard time they came out said alex jones and his info wars outlaw were
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.600]  permanently banned from twitter in september the moves seemed to be a death blow for info wars
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.800]  just weeks before they've been kicked off of platforms like youtube and facebook now of course
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.040]  they don't mention the fact that youtube and facebook and apple were colluding they did it
[23:35.040 --> 23:38.880]  within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also
[23:38.880 --> 23:44.400]  colluded with the press and we saw this pattern happen again last week uh we had another 800
[23:44.400 --> 23:48.880]  alternative media sites that were shut down facebook and twitter within hours of each other the
[23:48.880 --> 23:52.880]  press had already been notified the press already had their stories ready to run just like they did
[23:52.880 --> 23:57.280]  with us so they're they're ringing their hands of the daily beast saying well they should be down
[23:57.280 --> 24:01.760]  but they're still up how are they still up how are they still uh communicating with people
[24:01.760 --> 24:07.040]  and how do we get them off of the remaining social media sites and so they then cite me
[24:07.040 --> 24:10.960]  they said in fact too much after jones and info wars are supposedly shunned a number of accounts
[24:10.960 --> 24:16.160]  remain live and tweeting on tuesday the twitter account for info wars real news show with host
[24:16.160 --> 24:22.720]  david night promoted night's claim that hillary clinton is quote 50 rep tillion dna so they put
[24:22.720 --> 24:28.960]  that out there as if i'm taking that seriously no it is a satire uh elizabeth warren's claims are
[24:28.960 --> 24:35.520]  satire but alex the real amazing thing about this to me is that it was the daily beast that was
[24:35.520 --> 24:41.920]  attacking danie williams when he was asking a real question of bill clinton and that was please
[24:41.920 --> 24:48.640]  take a dna test so i can know who my father is you've paid a highway patrol in arkansas every
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.960]  christmas they would deliver cash my mother my mother who's black says that you are my father
[24:52.960 --> 24:58.320]  i look like you i'm lighter skin than my sister can i please have some closure on this will you
[24:58.320 --> 25:05.120]  please take a dna test either put this to rest and show that it's not true or then to let me know
[25:05.120 --> 25:12.160]  that i've got a father and do and you know welcome me into the family and he was vilified vilified
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.240]  by the press there in that press conference especially by this reporter from the daily beast
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.280]  and she was so bad alex you remember that it was live streamed here on info wars i at one point
[25:21.280 --> 25:27.120]  attacked her instead of talking to danie williams i said how dare you treat him like this and said
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.920]  who are you i said i'm david night from info wars and she goes oh info wars and this is the daily
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.520]  beast that's shutting us down one let's expand on this let's expand they're like how dare they
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.000]  be able to communicate because they want to be able to lie about us and say that we want violence
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.160]  and that we want to attack the press while they call for blowing up the white house while roseo
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.000]  donald calls for the military to take trump out at the white house while they say hashtag
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.240]  hunt republicans while they say kidnap baron trump and raping while they say all of this insane crap
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.880]  they want to silence us everywhere and then when you read and say it's a satire article because
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.520]  i've seen the video we're gonna play it later and you can you joke about a satire article
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.240]  and make jokes they then misrepresent that we're saying that we believe reptoids are running things
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.160]  when that's not what we've said that's not what we do just like they say that i say that there's
[26:14.160 --> 26:19.360]  martian moon bases with slave children i've offered a million dollars this is a gore mask
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.880]  from star trek this is not real it's a joke and everybody knows that they'll probably say in fact
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.200]  the last time i did this like five years ago they said jones thinks lizards are real and
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.920]  dressed up like one on the show because they think their own readers don't get satire this is the
[26:33.920 --> 26:40.800]  incredible mental illness of what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.160]  insane david and again do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.320]  really really big that they're everywhere saying trump's gonna cause violence uh here's one right
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.040]  here uh i mean just today there's just tons of these uh saying that trump's gonna get a
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.760]  bunch of people killed trump wants the media dead a vox editor trump hopes his supporters
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.840]  will murder journalists i mean this is incredible they're the ones calling for violence david
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.880]  well alex you know they could be laying the foundation for that but let me tell you something
[27:08.880 --> 27:12.800]  they have overthrown our government and our foundation and our constitution and our individual
[27:12.800 --> 27:17.920]  rights if we allow them to get away we're shutting down the free press and free speech free speech
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.960]  is separate from freedom of the press it's bad enough to take away the freedom of the press
[27:20.960 --> 27:24.400]  but what they're doing on social media is taking away the ability of people
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.240]  to read the press and then comment on what they agree with and what they disagree with
[27:30.240 --> 27:34.960]  and that's what they're taking down and they understand that satire i i honestly don't think
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.560]  they're that stupid i honestly don't think that twitter is that stupid they did it within a couple
[27:38.560 --> 27:44.000]  of hours of this no they know it's a fraud david and again yeah twitter's used more than telephones
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.440]  now in many areas uh as you know the head of pen and teller came out and said that it's more powerful
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.480]  than the courts now show they silence us and then they demonize us and they defame us and we don't
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.800]  have a way to respond back or post legal notices or challenge their lives and they are abusing their
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.920]  authority big techs out of control even the head of google now admits they're censoring people and
[28:05.920 --> 28:10.720]  says yeah we're helping china he told congress in a letter last week censorship can help the
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.000]  government it's a good service we're offering mm-hmm yeah and we can use this outside of china
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.480]  as well and then we saw the good censor document that was in a bright part saying that we're not
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.440]  going to follow the model that has been the historically in america where we have a free
[28:25.440 --> 28:30.400]  marketplace and free speech we're going to follow uh the european idea that we're going to have
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.800]  dignity instead of liberty well that's not a european idea really that's a bf skinner
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.080]  uh behavioral modification idea he wrote the book uh beyond freedom and dignity that's really
[28:40.080 --> 28:43.440]  where they're going they're trying to modify our behavior that's right and they take your popular
[28:43.440 --> 28:48.240]  twitter account down very genteel professional show you have and then lie about you and say you
[28:48.240 --> 28:54.240]  believe space aliens run things and that uh hillary's really a reptoid and engage in fake news fraud
[28:54.240 --> 28:59.600]  against you when they silence you that is the criminal activity we're dealing with hunters

[31:55.920 --> 32:04.000]  supermail vitality at infowarstore.com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.520]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[32:09.520 --> 32:15.840]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[32:15.840 --> 32:22.320]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employ
[32:22.320 --> 32:29.200]  a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[32:29.200 --> 32:34.960]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our
[32:34.960 --> 32:41.440]  elixir pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph
[32:41.440 --> 32:48.400]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of
[32:48.400 --> 32:54.080]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water
[32:54.080 --> 32:59.120]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[32:59.120 --> 33:08.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:08.800 --> 33:30.480]  18 days 18 judgment day the alex jones show because there is a war on
[33:30.960 --> 33:36.240]  for your mind so david night has the david night show that's what we're calling it now
[33:36.240 --> 33:46.000]  now stations like that better from 8 to 11 8am central and i love how when they say
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.680]  ban alex jones he's done all these horrible things and then lie about what i've done
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.600]  then they try to extend it to well david nighter oh and shroyer pollot center anybody that's
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.360]  affiliated with info wars they're banned too oh but we're not censoring oh we're private companies
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.840]  and then their own documents come out admitting twitter facebook google apple are all coordinating
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.600]  together and so now sundar who had his head of global privacy lied to congress three weeks ago
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.960]  and say there's no dragonfly there's no plan to censor we're not censoring here sundar's like
[34:17.600 --> 34:23.600]  yes we are censoring everyone and we're helping china and it is good value we will help you hear
[34:23.600 --> 34:31.600]  an american censor it is very good i mean these are quotes type it in google ceo
[34:31.600 --> 34:38.640]  as admits to china censorship and says it has great attributes for here oh we know sundar
[34:39.440 --> 34:47.040]  sundar slayer of the first amendment sundar came to america and conquered them sundar
[34:48.400 --> 34:56.320]  so now david night who has a very family show cerebral uh nine million people were downloading
[34:56.320 --> 35:02.960]  it every month uh on on itunes that was all just you're not allowed to do that it's delisted no
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.800]  no and of course apple just put up an index for people so that they would go and get our
[35:08.800 --> 35:15.840]  streams from there they were using us not the other way around so paul watchin's uh coming up
[35:16.560 --> 35:21.120]  care to help to comment on this and more but but let's be very clear we build the content
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.880]  and like drudge has worn over and over again you send everything to facebook and twitter
[35:27.440 --> 35:34.640]  and it becomes the platform and then it can curate the reality at once and then it can lie about you
[35:34.640 --> 35:39.440]  and tie your hands behind your back like an unboxing match you're tied up on a post your
[35:39.440 --> 35:44.720]  legs are bound you got a gag in your mouth and then the trendies and the skinny jeans can walk up
[35:44.720 --> 35:51.360]  and boom boom boom punchy and everybody goes whoa how awesome you are it's unbelievable
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.760]  and we've let them just run on and run on and run on because historically people never recognize
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.160]  the new tyranny they always remember the last tyranny hitler and his little clown outfit or
[36:02.160 --> 36:08.000]  Stalin or Mao or Hugo Chavez or fiddle Castro they always remember the last caricature you
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.240]  know a third world dictator in an army uniform that's not what they look like they look like
[36:12.240 --> 36:20.160]  Tim Cook they look like Barack Obama they look like sundar pachari little smiling non-threatening
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.400]  dudes kind of like in the first uh despicable me i love the little bill gates type guy he's kind of
[36:26.400 --> 36:33.360]  a little nerd but he's totally horrible and evil i'm libra i'm trying to go kill you that's exactly
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.280]  who they are and they're deadly dangerous and they've already raped this country and they're
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.240]  trying to stop our nation coming back these people are sick now finish up David Knight and Paul
[36:46.240 --> 36:52.880]  Watts has taken over here is the clip from what a day ago that got David Knight banned on you know
[36:52.880 --> 36:57.360]  we started about 14 months ago the real news with David Knight got a couple hundred thousand followers
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.720]  whatever just a place say here's David Knight here's where he can tweet send out links communicate
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.840]  you know you could have some twisted argument to get me off there and then you'll misrepresent
[37:07.840 --> 37:13.040]  but David there's nothing there so again they silenced him they ban him they ban you being able
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.400]  to communicate with him and then they lie about him and say he believes reptoids are running things
[37:18.400 --> 37:23.440]  one of their favorite things they use on me that's that's David Ike and I mean these people are pretty
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.120]  soulless it might as well be reptoids the point is is that is that it doesn't matter even if you
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.760]  wanted to just say on twitter I believe Hillary's half alien that'd be his right and of course all
[37:33.760 --> 37:37.760]  the other groups can do that they leave it alone no it's that's funny and then we're making
[37:37.760 --> 37:41.920]  fun of Elizabeth Warren and her fake Native American claims and it was satirical he was
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.240]  reading off another satirical article Babylon B.com which says in the first line this is satire
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.760]  and we have it on screen but again they don't show when they ban you and then the and then the
[37:55.760 --> 38:02.080]  Daily Beast Soros funded lies because these are lie machines who work in concert to murder the truth
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.120]  so here is what got David Knight banned uh let's let's talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton
[38:07.120 --> 38:11.600]  because there's all of this news about Elizabeth Warren's ancestries coming out there was some
[38:11.600 --> 38:17.520]  breaking news from Babylon B the satire site and they said shortly after Elizabeth Warren released
[38:17.520 --> 38:25.200]  a DNA test that she may or that may not show that she is one 1024th Native American the failed
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.720]  presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed her DNA test that
[38:30.720 --> 38:38.080]  conclusively proved that she is only 50 reptilian the test conducted by a renowned DNA expert
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.480]  showed that only 50% of her blood comes from reptilian humanoids from spacebent on destroying
[38:42.480 --> 38:48.240]  humanity many Washington insiders have claimed that she was 100 reptilian but these claims have
[38:48.240 --> 38:54.960]  now been shown to be a hoax uh Babylon B quotes Hillary Clinton saying on an interview Sunday
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.200]  I am happy to announce that I am only half reptile I hope my critics will think twice
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.560]  before calling me a space reptile now since that's only half true I'm only part lizard person
[39:04.560 --> 39:08.480]  thank you very much well that's not the worst thing that's been said about Hillary Clinton
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.840]  that would be a step up for her actually to be a reptilian space lizard so he says it's satire
[39:15.840 --> 39:21.040]  he says it'd be a step up for they've had to update it and apologize hey we're a satire site
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.280]  but everybody's getting really upset about this yeah people are now being banned for covering
[39:25.280 --> 39:31.040]  your satire and saying it's satire and then lying and saying you didn't say it's satire but I never
[39:31.040 --> 39:36.080]  even satirically said that there were martian colonies with slave children on them they just
[39:36.080 --> 39:43.840]  made it up and why not because if they can silence you then they can say whatever they want about
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.080]  you that's the other equation of censorship David you'll be back tomorrow where people
[39:48.080 --> 39:54.080]  can't censor you for now 8 a.m to 11 a.m info wars.com forward slash show and that's why it's
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.640]  so critical every listener has to email their friends and family daily and say first of them
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.440]  it's under attack here's what they don't want you to hear text message friends and family are articles
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.720]  the live feeds info wars.com forward slash show or the pages we posted say what the topic the top
[40:08.720 --> 40:14.000]  topic is so people understand this is urgent they're trying to shut us down ahead of the election
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.400]  and only by listeners spreading the word signing up for a free newsletter and then sending that
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.120]  email on uh at info wars.com forward slash newsletter only by doing that will we get around
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.320]  the censors David. Absolutely Alex and you know we're talking about DNA as I said before the serious
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.360]  question about DNA was shut down at that press conference by the Daily Beast when Danny Williams
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.680]  wanted to know if Bill Clinton would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his paternity but of
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.000]  course let's talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast it was just a few days ago that we
[40:46.000 --> 40:52.720]  pointed out that Chelsea Clinton sits on the board of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.160]  been rewarded with 6.6 million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes uh uh Hillary Clinton
[40:58.160 --> 41:02.960]  and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast it's their ancestors you know the parent
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.320]  and the grandmother of the Daily Beast but Alex I want to say something about Twitter because you
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.840]  know we've had this situation with uh Farrakhan coming out and saying uh Jews are he's not anti
[41:13.840 --> 41:17.520]  Semitic he's anti termite and they said well that doesn't violate our rules because he didn't say
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.480]  that about any specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.280]  harassment of a specific person in other words Hillary Clinton and you know being a reptile
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.120]  a public figure they're not saying it's bullying that's right if you she calls me a dark heart and
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.800]  the worst person in the world but then I I I can't say anything bad about her and she's serious
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.040]  about that but let me you know when we had this uh statement this interview with Wired Magazine
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.920]  that Jack Dorsey had talking about Twitter CEO of Twitter and he said oh all that stuff about us
[41:47.920 --> 41:51.840]  being the free speech wing of the free speech party that was just a joke I know they've become a
[41:51.840 --> 41:54.960]  joke themselves but they went on to say a lot of people come to Twitter they don't actually
[41:54.960 --> 41:59.360]  see an app or service what that kind of looks like is a public square and they have the same
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.880]  sort of expectations of a public square and that is what we have to make sure they get right also
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.120]  make sure that everyone feels safe in that public square so he uses the term public square three
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.920]  times when he testified before Congress he used the term public square five times Alex we have a
[42:13.920 --> 42:21.120]  Supreme Court decision that says 1946 March versus Alabama that if you are in the public square even
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.760]  if it is privately owned they can't stop your speech in the public square we've let a Supreme
[42:25.760 --> 42:31.120]  Court decision Robi Wade kill tens of millions of babies but we ignore this Supreme Court decision
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.520]  that would protect us from having the public square killed by Joe there's no doubt that they
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.040]  operate and they have liability protection because they are a public square then they jump back and
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.360]  say they're publishers and censorists if Congress just acts the president acts it's over for them
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.960]  but whatever you do folks they can't stop you word of mouth a local stations tv radio
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.120]  internet telling people tune into the Alex Jones show tune to David Knight he won't be back tomorrow

[49:44.560 --> 49:49.840]  ago when we said this demonization campaign of info wars is to set the precedent with us
[49:49.840 --> 49:56.480]  because they know once it's been a big story once one man dies it's a it's a national tragedy
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.480]  a million die it's it's a statistic the stalin said they made it all about me in a referendum on
[50:02.480 --> 50:07.760]  free speech lied about it took us off and now it's thousands of sites a day off twitter facebook
[50:07.760 --> 50:13.440]  google total delisting uh new york times said yeah we're banning anybody good job twitter that shows
[50:13.440 --> 50:20.400]  an mpc meme it's dehumanizing i mean they have gone into turboville and sundar says you bet we're
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.120]  censoring the head of google and it'll help america he went to the senate and he sent him a letter and
[50:25.120 --> 50:30.400]  he said we're standing by to help you censor it's got a lot of attributes to it i mean they have
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.200]  really taken their pants off here they've really showed us their big old purple booty
[50:35.200 --> 50:42.720]  well of course and the irony here is that these same websites that got cold recently in this purge
[50:42.720 --> 50:46.800]  of you know pages with millions of followers there was some on the right but a lot on the left
[50:47.760 --> 50:52.880]  one of those pages and you've probably seen a story up on info wars dot com literally wrote
[50:52.880 --> 51:00.000]  article after article a couple of months ago when we got purged celebrating reverb press i'm talking
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.720]  about the headlines were literally youtube finally flushed alex jones for hate speech in the tinfoil
[51:04.720 --> 51:10.240]  brigade is melting down conspiracy creep finally got what he deserved alex jones is finished on
[51:10.240 --> 51:16.560]  facebook and the internet is rejoicing so it was all this kind of yes go girl you slay kind of
[51:16.560 --> 51:23.280]  ridiculous soft morrick um headlines celebrating the purging of info wars well guess what reverb
[51:23.280 --> 51:29.360]  press has now been banned by facebook and twitter oh but they get the platform to whine about it on
[51:29.360 --> 51:36.800]  buzzfeed and buzzfeed says how bad it is the same buzzfeed with charlie wasell who lobbied to have
[51:36.800 --> 51:42.960]  info wars banned as well along with obviously oliver darsi of cnn so yeah we defended these
[51:42.960 --> 51:48.480]  people now they're banned now they're given mainstream platforms to whine about it the irony
[51:48.480 --> 51:54.960]  is strong here but here's the good news alex because we've got such proud such forthright such
[51:54.960 --> 52:01.840]  an activist audience if you go on alexa.com and look at info wars traffic now the concern was
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.080]  always yes we're going to get a big spike out of this because of the media attention but for how
[52:06.080 --> 52:12.080]  long are we going to maintain it well if you go on alexa search rankings which is not always accurate
[52:12.080 --> 52:17.520]  but it is generally speaking we've not we've maintained that level so we were down at about
[52:17.520 --> 52:24.880]  4500 originally back in july shot up to 2500 around that level and it's maintained at that
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.760]  level over the past two months or so since we got mega banned on everything now that's probably not
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.480]  going to stay right there but we do have an activist audience which is engaged as you said
[52:36.480 --> 52:42.000]  sending out the emails sending the text messages to keep us at that level to the point where they
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.360]  lose it's the strides and defectives backfire on them but the point is that social media censorship
[52:47.360 --> 52:53.040]  alex they whine all day about cyberbullying okay this is a form of corporate cyberbullying
[52:53.040 --> 52:58.480]  social media is the global public square you take someone away from that you remove their
[52:58.480 --> 53:02.880]  right to that you're basically removing them from the global brain you're choking their
[53:03.440 --> 53:09.280]  ability to participate in the public square thousands of people were fired after all these
[53:09.280 --> 53:14.320]  mostly left-wing libertarian you know pro-drug legalization anti-war websites got banned off
[53:14.320 --> 53:20.880]  facebook and twitter in coordination once again so this wasn't one website enforcing its terms
[53:20.880 --> 53:27.600]  of service this was big tech corporate giants monopolists colluding with each other in election
[53:27.600 --> 53:33.200]  meddling that is the key they whine all day about the npc meme being election meddling
[53:33.200 --> 53:37.920]  because it's bots even though it's clearly not bots it's individuals creating these accounts
[53:37.920 --> 53:42.000]  the election meddling is solely on the part of facebook and twitter because they're so
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.520]  desperately afraid of this meme but it should be considered corporate cyberbullying thousands of
[53:47.520 --> 53:53.840]  people lost their livelihoods because of these bans this actually ruins people's lives now it's
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.800]  not just oh you can go and start your own media platform or oh it's just a private company now
[53:58.800 --> 54:03.360]  these massive corporations are ruining ruining people's lives laying off thousands of people
[54:04.080 --> 54:09.840]  and now they get to go on bus feed and whine about it having celebrated in repeated articles
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.640]  in four wars getting banned so it's kind of ironic well you're absolutely right poll and if you go
[54:14.640 --> 54:19.360]  back to right wing watch and the southern probably law center and media matters all funded by soros
[54:19.920 --> 54:24.160]  they're going well we got PayPal and other payment processors we scanned their servers
[54:24.160 --> 54:29.840]  and we know it's this company harass them have them shut down he's a nazi so they lie about me
[54:29.840 --> 54:34.960]  and defame me then they harass us so that our listeners can't buy product from us and they go
[54:34.960 --> 54:39.360]  oh but it's a private company no they're trying to shut us down just like they've been trying to
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.160]  shut america down and they're so pissed paul that the country is coming back from the dead
[54:44.160 --> 54:48.320]  and they get more desperate by the minute as trump is able to restore the republic and his
[54:48.320 --> 54:56.800]  nationalist candidates win in germany in sweden in denmark in greece in idly in brazil all over
[54:56.800 --> 55:02.960]  the world they are really scared oh completely the brazil things could completely out of control
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.840]  bolson areas gonna win the ironic thing about all this though is that right wing watch which
[55:07.840 --> 55:13.040]  continuously lobbies for everything to shut us down whether it be mail servers or you know payment
[55:13.040 --> 55:18.880]  processors you go on their youtube channel they literally steal entire videos from people without
[55:18.880 --> 55:24.080]  commentary it's clearly not fair use re-upload them to their own channel do they get copyright
[55:24.080 --> 55:29.120]  strikes from youtube no it would it may be worth pointing that out to youtube that they're blatantly
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.480]  violating copyright but then again alex their channel has about 30 000 subscribers and nobody
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.520]  watches i was about to say i don't want us from plus we don't need to they want to remove us because
[55:39.520 --> 55:46.480]  they can't compete with the truth these are literal handlebar mustache you know villains like dick
[55:46.480 --> 55:52.320]  dastardly from cartoons we were kids i mean they are literally like villains with bombs to blow up
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.720]  the first amendment well someone tweeted about this um earlier where you know david night was
[55:58.720 --> 56:03.280]  talking about the daily beast article goes up and literally what an hour later the account disappears
[56:03.840 --> 56:09.360]  they make the comparison it's it's like the kid that the sniveling kid that that tattles on everybody
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.840]  that nobody liked at school it's like the kid at the end of the class who reminds the teacher
[56:13.840 --> 56:18.720]  that the homework is due when the teacher's forgotten about it it's like how could you even
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.160]  think that devoting an entire article to this is even worth it but that's the attitude but again
[56:24.160 --> 56:29.840]  the supreme court is going to hear a case you probably saw this story yesterday alex this is
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.680]  a big case this is cnbc we posted it on info wars yesterday the supreme court has agreed to hear a
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.120]  case that could determine whether users can challenge social media companies on free speech
[56:39.120 --> 56:44.560]  grounds this is manhattan community access cooperation versus halak centers on whether a
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.400]  private operator or a public access television network is considered a state actor which can be
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.280]  sued for first amendment violations so that's going to have broader implications for whether
[56:53.280 --> 56:58.640]  facebook twitter and google are considered publishers so if that goes our way in the supreme
[56:58.640 --> 57:05.040]  court which is obviously now balanced in favor of logic and sanity that could be a massive massive case
[57:05.040 --> 57:10.320]  and let's let's be clear we already have all the cases where they they say they're a public
[57:10.320 --> 57:15.440]  commons so they don't have publisher liability under the digital millennium copyright act and a
[57:15.440 --> 57:20.480]  bunch of other laws and in subsections of laws that obama passed and telecommunications act in
[57:20.480 --> 57:29.600]  2008 show 2009 so and 2017 and so they're not supposed to take stuff off unless it's illegal
[57:29.600 --> 57:35.680]  by them curating as they do they now open themselves up as publishers and lose the
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.920]  third party liability waiver they had i know i'm a i run info wars that's how we can have
[57:41.920 --> 57:45.520]  comments somebody goes there and threatens to murder somebody it's not my fault i'm a third
[57:45.520 --> 57:50.800]  party i have to remove it i have to respond to subpoenas but i'm not liable you deserve a deep

[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.320]  so there is something in history let historians call the slippery slow
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.120]  you see think about a slippery slow fish at the top of a water slide
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.680]  and you start to go and it's it's slow at first but then all of a sudden
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.280]  and see in historical times last few years is the blink of an eye that's a twinkle on the eye
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:51.840]  actually and now we're about a third the way down the slide and boy things are picking up
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.880]  we're seeing more censorship the last three months than we've seen since the civil war
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.640]  in america i mean kipper gore and you know wanted to put labels on things that it that had adult
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:12.400]  language which the left called terrible that that isn't one one trillionth what we're saying
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.920]  so now we're going hyperspace down the slide poll how bad is it gonna get i mean how crazy is
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:25.360]  it i guess is bad as western civilization and people let it get well it's at the point where
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.320]  they've banned 1500 is that the point now alex with the banning of the memes which by the way to
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.400]  explain it which i did in my video briefly but this is when it accelerated this study came out
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.000]  oxford college london they found that the most effectively spread beams originated out of the
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.400]  donald's subreddit and fortune the entire purpose of this study was how do we create filters that
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.080]  can detect hateful memes so everyone freaks out about the eu planning to ban memes twitter's already
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.920]  doing it based off of this study which again goes to the point that the left can't mean so simply
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.800]  they simply want to ban memes altogether there's an article today out of um rt uk researchers
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:14.160]  linked consumption of junk memes to teen obesity they've literally taken a meme of a a fat uh asian
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:21.840]  kid saying free food count me in and blaming that for childhood obesity nothing to do with let's
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:29.120]  be clear what they really want to ban is people communicating and making jokes i mean this is
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.120]  the most incredible authoritarianism ever where they call kermit the frog jokes racist and because
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.360]  they say it is it's banned i mean it's i don't ever see them winning this yeah they want to stop
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.920]  people communicating through the medium of satire because that's the most difficult thing to ban if
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.360]  you outright use certain ban words and hateful hateful phrases against people they can point to that
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.200]  and in their own but like you do on twitter you'll show some horrible thing they didn't say oh look
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.120]  how wonderful it is this leftist is calling for killing people well their computer doesn't know
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.200]  how to stop that because it agrees it's set to let the left do that plus the the double standards
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.320]  are just flagrant they said they they banned um real news because it targeted individuals well
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:16.480]  when it doesn't target individuals look at sarah jung she called white people you know uh dumb ass
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.240]  efforts she said um she liked to be mean to old white men said there was they said subhuman goblins
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.400]  that live in holes the ground she was rewarded with a verified tick kandis owens tweets out the
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:35.040]  exact same things changes white people to jewish instantly uh suspended lockdown there was a pro
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:41.440]  life account on twitter alex that put out an article four years ago by a molecular biologist
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.440]  and microbiologist that said the rise of std's the rise of syphilis was because gay people were
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.240]  having more and more unprotected sex this was by a doctor it was an article four years old
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.720]  bam your account has been locked meanwhile we've got virulent hatred every day they lock your account
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.840]  now for four year old tweets sarah jung didn't get locked down or anything she didn't even have to
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.360]  delete the tweets they still up there she gets rewarded with a verified tick she gets a cushy
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.960]  job at the new york times here's the other thing though you go on google trends uh compare soy
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.360]  boy which we kind of popularized at the end of last year to the to npc meme the npc meme is already
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.960]  twice as popular as the soy boy meme which is pretty big has ever been and aren't you noticing
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.320]  that as they try to suppress the memes it only makes them get bigger so i'm gonna do a few more
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.080]  mistakes you gotta go paul man another special guest joining us we're back in 60 seconds i want to

[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.280]  mean will be the meme that finally breaks them i think it could be mpc because it's the classic
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:52.000]  archetype like thx 1138 brave new world uh the you know the apple ad from the 80s of the gray faced
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:00.480]  automatons i mean i mean it goes back to metropolis we all know that the outside toxins in the water

[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:26.480]  something called an mpc meme that is now arguably the biggest meme in internet history and you talk
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.320]  to older folks they don't know what a meme is a meme is like uh two thousand years ago they would
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:37.360]  draw a little pictures on the walls graffiti in rome it was like the newspaper of the people
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.760]  people write in chalk they write in paint and then there there would be jokes that the public
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.400]  would pick up a lot of them didn't even make sense it's like in china one of the poo is associated
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:52.160]  with the dictator because in chinese they think he kind of sounds like this oh dear my honey
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.560]  can they think he kind of sounds you know to them listening to chinese he sounds like oh christopher
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:05.680]  wobin so that's what's described so they ban you get put in prison you know if you try to email
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:12.880]  somebody when you put it okay or uh taiwan flags i mean that's in the news so that's a meme it just
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.760]  means a symbol it could be an inside joke it could be anything and the left for whatever reason has
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.720]  not been successful memeing it just doesn't work uh because they're so authoritarian they're they're
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:31.520]  so monolithic uh so so it it just doesn't translate and and it's a fact okay and so i say i salute
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:39.520]  you know hail uh forechan uh and you know hail the great memers and and the donald subreddit
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.200]  because that's what this is all about free speech and we salute you so they want to try to attack
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.760]  reality they want to try to attack communication they want to try to say the okay sign everything's
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.840]  going to be a okay these on jello commercials and seven up commercials
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:03.680]  they can't deal with it but now the mpc meme from thx 1138 the 1984 apple commercial everywhere
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:10.800]  is people with shaved heads in gray uniforms that is the art typo future governmental tyranny plan
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.600]  that the globalists just so happen to plan so the idea of letting sjw know you're programmed
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.120]  you're in a shell letting them see that they're really conformist override some of their programming
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:27.440]  and that's why the new york times gleefully said thank god two days ago twitter is banning anybody
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.240]  that shit does this so now just showing groups of colorless bots which what we're being turned
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.840]  into under globalism that's actually the plan of the corporate globalist system is he rid of all
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.880]  culture all individualism all all real diversity they are so scared of it
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:55.200]  so here is the 1984 ad from 1984 the most viewed ad in history hands down this is the most popular
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.840]  most powerful ad that launched apple to its trillion dollar supremacy yearly
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.760]  but now what they planned they were fighting they'd become so they launched the mpc meme
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:14.800]  as a in 1984 saying no to the pc oppression and no to the way it was controlled but they
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.160]  actually launched their own system that was even more internal and cloistered but will it be banned
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:27.120]  here it is today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the information
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.720]  look at those mpcs gray uniforms gray skin shaved heads
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.560]  sexless here comes the goddess hot orange pants stomping forward with a club
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:54.000]  with a hammer like a female for the sledgehammer
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.960]  right in the face of jim car
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:16.240]  oh
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.400]  except now it is and tim cooks leading it paul
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.000]  Watson how profound is that and where do you at a gut level see all this ending
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.800]  well there's also a funny comparison do you remember the um zuckerberg photo where he's
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.120]  walking down the aisle towards a platform to give a speech and they're all wearing the virtual
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.240]  reality headsets they changed that to be all mpcs as well that was a good one but it's it's even
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:51.520]  more archetypal than 1984 alex or thx 1136 it goes back even further than that in fact i was
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:57.120]  going to put this in my video and forgot to do it entirely because it was like 2am youtube crashed
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.400]  and i had to get up there quickly but um plateaus allegory of the cave you look at the beginning
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:08.800]  of that you look at the myopic drooling you know individuals who can only see what's in front of
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.400]  them can't see what's going on in the real world outside those are npcs they can probably find the
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.200]  video right now plateaus allegory the cave on youtube go and look at the start of that video
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:26.400]  this was the archetype for the npc so it literally goes back right to the dawn of um philosophy greek
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.560]  philosophy that this npc meme originated alex so that's why it strikes such an authentic chord
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.440]  when people see it and it also intersects with the walk away movement which is obviously based around
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.120]  leftists awakening from the fact that they're just being exploited as human shields for democrats
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.440]  who just expect them to vote for them again and again and again they banned the founder of that
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.520]  off facebook as well for a while as as you remember he was on the show so it's due to the
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.920]  intersection with the walk away movement you know it's canonis owens that said the other day
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.280]  they they they see plateaus allegory the cave if you wind that on a bit where it's just four of
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  them sat in a row looking at the shadows projected on the wall you'll see how similar it is to the
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.840]  npc meme it's near the start but canonis owens said the other day you know democrats need 85
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.760]  percent of the black vote to win they have to get at least 85 percent so if you take away just 20
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:26.400]  percent of that they're they're in a complete bind they're finished so that's how this npc
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.360]  meme intersects with the walk away movement which is why they're so terrified about it you know you
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.120]  had salon.com new york a guardian before the election saying that i mean this is what salon.com
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.720]  said in an article arguing that memes should be censored quote the political meme has become the
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.920]  centerpiece of disinformation campaigns and the ability of memes to communicate ideology
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:54.160]  is boundless these are the same websites alex that banned their own comment sections because
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.680]  studies came out showing that people trust the veracity of the article based more on the comments
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  than the text of the article itself they're trying to end individual human contacts that can create
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.360]  false consensus just like panasonic had human blinkers help people concentrate and open
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.880]  offices people said no they're not blinkers they're blinders so they're literally trying to
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:23.200]  train us to be like horses that draw corporate carriages. Yeah there's Plato's allegory the
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.960]  cave again find that click find that image at the start of that video where a lot they're all
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.680]  sat together watching the shadows that is the quintessential npc then of course you had the
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:37.520]  new york times yesterday come out and admit that um memes can escape the internet see the underbellion
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:43.200]  morph into the actual tools of influence is partly understanding the mechanics of modern politics
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.360]  so they openly state that memes swing elections basically maybe we can even compete with google
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.400]  algorithms which can swing millions of votes on election day but that's not election meddling so
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.520]  they admit that it's it can swing elections and the left can't mean because they're so
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.200]  petrified of offending anyone they're constantly walking on eggshells so they're not good at comedy
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.120]  that's why they're afraid of it because it's an ancient human language from the time of drawing
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.640]  on cave walls to now and we're communicating outside of their controlled paradigm and they're
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:20.000]  threatened by it and that's why just communicating and making art and being engaged and being involved
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.640]  is victory paul joseph watson incredible job we really appreciate you thanks a lot alex take care

[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.840]  slipping away even if you looked at the responses to elizabeth warren's tweets when she went on that
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.800]  twitter rampage and had to change subjects halfway through because she was getting crushed in her own

[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.760]  Courageous journalist from Egypt. She now lives there in the United States. A lot of you probably heard of her
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.080]  We can roll in the background for TV viewers to her Fox News appearances, but
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520]  when Obama and
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.560]  Hillary
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:20.680]  Funded the Arab Spring on that larger plan six seven years ago and the takedown of Libby and all of it. She was there her brother got tortured
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.320]  She had to flee the country just incredible. So Cynthia
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:32.680]  Farahot is the website of Cynthia farahot.com. That's Cynthia F a r a h a t dot com
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.480]  And I won't go over her whole bio
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.080]  But I wanted to get her back on the show because she's been a caller
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.560]  I'm like well, I mean, I know who you are to just to give her expert view on
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.440]  What's happening in Saudi Arabia and what's happening in Syria and what's happening with Sharia law?
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  That Maxine waters just came out and promoted and all the rest of it
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:01.440]  And and what's happening with these radical elements of Islam and and where does she see it going?
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.040]  And what is the alliance with the left because she's really the expert just want to try to give her the floor here
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.040]  It's great to see you there on skype and thank you for joining us
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040]  Thank you for having me Alex
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.120]  You're the expert so much is happening in the Middle East the crossroads of the planet
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.880]  Europe Asia Africa and the whole crossroads of energy
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.560]  What would you want to tackle first as a real expert to give people an understanding of what's going on?
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:34.840]  Let's start with a Saudi journalist situation because
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:43.320]  This has a lot of different dimensions and thoughts to it that most mainstream media is not interested in it
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  So for example
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:51.520]  Uh, there's a lot been said he's been portrayed as a journalist and he is a journalist
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:57.160]  But there but he's also a lot of other things. Let me give you an example
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.640]  And they that's that's these are the facts. These are not my opinions
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.520]  The fact is he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.360]  the fact is he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.960]  This was also mentioned in the book the looming tower and others
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:23.440]  the fact is that he was a close associate to Al Qaeda the fact is that he was working for a
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.080]  Saudi intelligence and he was an advisor to
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:38.160]  the head of the Saudi intelligence Turkey al-Faisal even after he left the intelligence agency, which he interestedly did a few
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.160]  months
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.200]  Before 9-11 so we this is what we know about this man
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.480]  So here's another question
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:53.160]  How is someone who's affiliated with okay to know some of the laden and an active member in the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.360]  Allowed to work in Washington post. Why would the Washington post?
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.840]  Higher and affiliate over some of the laden
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:07.000]  That's a question that I would like to see answered and I know it would never be answered any time soon
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:14.960]  So that's what we know another thing also that we know is that Prince Salman's two of his aides
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.680]  were pictured
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.000]  and one a security guard and another is an advisor were pictured entering the a
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.360]  Saudi embassy the day that Hashi went missing so
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.120]  maybe
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.520]  He was because of what he might know about 9-11
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.960]  a his ties to Al Qaeda can have
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.640]  Damning information
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.960]  That can hurt the Saudi government
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.360]  Another question with this with the Prince Salman do something like that
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.920]  Unfortunately, yes, unfortunately, Arab regimes have
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.680]  Shown us
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.760]  Consistently that they lack the ability to think long term the ability to control themselves
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:06.160]  They do not understand the concept of consequences and 9-11 is a perfect example of that and
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.560]  So unfortunately as I do believe that Prince Salman would do something like that
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.680]  Well, certainly my issue is why do it in plain view and then see the leftist globalist media is trying to undermine Trump
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:25.400]  Jump on it and blame Trump. We know there's a 9-11 connection Saudi Arabia. We know there's a cover-up, but this new prince this new leader
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.560]  Has been trying to reform at some levels. We know Trump's about to put the clamps on Iran
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:36.800]  So I see this as a larger strategy and some of my sources say deep state green-lighted dish
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.400]  But as a way to basically then
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:45.520]  Caused a huge furor and drive a wedge between the US and Saudi Arabia. I don't trust Saudi Arabia
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.480]  I think Trump's been playing with fire with it
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:52.360]  But I do want to get them to stop supporting Al Qaeda and ISIS and it looks like they've at least done that at some levels
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:59.320]  But you are the expert I know on this and pioneered that Obama was funding the Arab Spring the Muslim Brotherhood that basically
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.920]  Is like Sinn Féin and the IRA? They're the good cop bad cop for the good cop of the bad cop
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.800]  So I understand, you know, what's going on here, but larger geopolitical when I see CNN the Washington Post
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.920]  That's kind of the leftist arm of the CIA
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.680]  Try to embarrass Trump with this. I think there's something bigger going on here
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:24.800]  You know, they are using anything against President Trump even everything good that he has done is being
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.320]  Pinned that it was it was bad that it's bad. So there's no winning with these people
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.600]  they blamed him for for hurricanes and for
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.320]  Weather disasters. So these people are constantly going to behave like this
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  This actually did hurt
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  not only
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:53.880]  The attempt to modernize Saudi Arabia, but it also hurt the enemies of Prince Salman himself, which is the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.720]  this happened under
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.360]  Erdogan's nose Erdogan is
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.280]  What the most prominent key during the Muslim Brotherhood right now and his country has been a hub
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:14.520]  For Brotherhood terrorists from across the globe including the United States chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood where they go there
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:20.480]  And they have the meetings and all this a burst of plans and tactics and terrorists
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.280]  I'm banned off Twitter Facebook all these things they lie about what why I'm banned
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:32.080]  But then I see ISIS groups al-Qaeda groups Muslim Brotherhood all of them recruiting getting money saying kill people
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.920]  They're allowed to have preachers in Islamic preachers say kill people in England at public squares
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:43.200]  If I said that I'd be arrested and I should why is the left allied so much with radical Islam?
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.800]  They're both hotel terrians
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040]  It's the enemy the friend
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:57.600]  The enemy of the my enemy is my friend kind of thing leftists are arrogant. They think they can play with fire and not get burned
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.920]  History proves them wrong
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.320]  Leftists in Iran trying to do the same thing with the mollus over there
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.760]  They got double cross. Oh, yeah, and then they literally hung their heads on sticks and marched with their heads

[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:24.680]  The left had the real power because they were mad that Mosaddek had been kicked out the Shah was in so they get rid of one problem
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.440]  Bring something 50 times worse and then as soon as they because the left didn't want to kill people
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.120]  So they use radical jihadists to carry out the murder even though they were a minority and as soon as they got in
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.120]  They killed them instantly and which is the same thing over and over again

[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:32.840]  We've got some really big news here, it's up on Infowars.com
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.840]  Mexico deploys officers to its southern border to block migrants headed for the US
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:43.840]  Trump has said if you don't stop those people will cut off the billions in aid
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.840]  He told Honduras, he told Guatemala, they're trying to stop it, but once you've got tens of thousands of people
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:54.840]  UN funded coming in, it's hard, but Mexico already understands this
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.840]  Mexico gives you six months to a year hard labor if you come across their southern border
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03.840]  Because as bad as Mexico is, it's at the top of third world countries for GDP and things like that
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  There's a middle class in Mexico and they understand that
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:13.840]  So there you go, the translation, Mexico is building Trump's wall
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:19.840]  The Mexican government has reinforced security at southern border with Guatemala with 2,000 persons
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840]  Way more than that
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  Caravan of Honduras is expected to try to enter the country
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.840]  And that's just the first group and head for the United States according to local reports
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  So the UN is opening up migration rounds just like they've done out of the Middle East and Africa into Europe
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840]  As part of this globalist plan
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:39.840]  And Cynthia Farahot can speak to that award winning journalist
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.840]  And again, inside the Arab Spring, inside the leftist CIA takedown of nations
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  Backing ISIS al-Qaeda type groups
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.840]  Kidnapping and slaving women, slavery being brought back to North Africa
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.840]  Many other areas, just unbelievable evil with the left backing it
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.840]  So you got cut off talking about the 1979 Islamic Shiite Revolution
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:06.840]  That the left opened the door for into Iran and then go from there
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:16.840]  So in 1970, the Mullahs of Iran perpetrated the Islamic Revolution
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:23.840]  It did not, and it could have not happened without leftist agitators and activists
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:31.840]  Communists and socialists that thought that they related to the utilitarianism of Islamists
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:38.840]  And thought that they could have an alliance and then it worked jointly
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  Or maybe they were thinking they could defeat the Islamists and take over
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:50.840]  But of course, months after the Islamic Revolution, they took all these leftists
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:56.840]  Including the military generals among them, decapitated them, put their heads on sticks
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.840]  And marched with them down the street
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:08.840]  So it's so arrogant and so ignorant to think that they can work with the hounds of hell
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.840]  Who were Islamists and they can defeat them
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.840]  In this equation, the most brutal and the most vicious is the one that always going to win
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:26.840]  And trust me, Islamists are so much more better at being evil than leftists are
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  What is that from your experience?
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:35.840]  Why they are, they're allying together?
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.840]  I think because they relate to the totalitarianism of Islamists
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  And Marxist, when you read Karl Marx and Engels' literature
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:37:00.840]  You will see that they believe in relying on what they call the rag classes to become agitators and engage in crime
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  Like the Antifa group, for example, in Marxist ideology
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  They view them as the dispensable rag class that can create agitation
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  They do not have much to lose, they can get violent
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  And then they are very easily to get rid of afterwards, they're very dispensable
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:32.840]  But the difference between people like what Marx called the rag classes
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.840]  And people like Islamists, Islamists are ideologues
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.840]  Islamists are the only enemy that wins whether they live or die
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.840]  Exactly, so it's a cult, that's why it fits into the left
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:52.840]  And now the left thinks it's so sexy, so cool, promotes it, allows it to continue, allows it to grow
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  And then now we see Christians, conservatives, nationalists being censored everywhere
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:04.840]  Where do you see this big clash of civilizations going and then getting back into Saudi Arabia
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  And what's happening there, where do you see this going?
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.840]  Look Alex, we are going to win
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:21.840]  People who believe in reason, who believe in human rights, who believe in the values of the American Constitution
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:28.840]  We are going to win, we can lose little battles, but we will win the war
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:34.840]  And let me give you a little example, when I was completely banned in Egypt
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  In 2008, someone from Egyptian intelligence was pretty angry, called me over the phone
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  And said, are you aware of the amount of money that you've caused us?
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.840]  And the guy was just screaming, and I didn't understand what he was talking about
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  And he said that every two weeks they had to change the people who were listening in and recordings
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.840]  Because they bugged my house and they bugged my office and they bugged everything
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  So the people who were listening to report on what I say were getting turned to my side
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.840]  Could you believe that? They were getting turned
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840]  I believe it, I know exactly
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.840]  So of course that shows you how powerful our ideas are
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840]  And they are never...
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  Exactly, freedom really works, it's really cool
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:38.840]  We don't want to live under a leftist Soviet Union or a communist China or a collapsed Venezuela
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.840]  Or some Islamic hellhole
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.840]  I mean again, Venezuela on average had more money in the 1950s than the US citizen did
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  In Argentina, now they're hellholes, because of socialism
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.840]  And it's the ideology, it doesn't work
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.840]  So the way socialism and globalism and communism and Islamic fascism works is
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.840]  It wants us silenced and shut down because it can't compete
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  Just like Twitter and Facebook and Google
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.840]  Please continue and then we'll get your take on the massive censorship you see by big tech giants
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  That's the same thing that third world hellholes do to dissidents
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:25.840]  And people who believe in freedom of speech and values that are expressed very beautifully in the US Constitution
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.840]  This is an attack against the American Constitution
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.840]  This is an attack against American values
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:38.840]  And against everything America stands for and that it defines its greatness
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.840]  This is not just an attack against you
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.840]  So this is the war we are at, it's a war of ideas
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.840]  And they can engage in this behavior, but it backlashed
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.840]  Because now you are going to become mainstream
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.840]  And I want you to remember me Alex when this happens
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:06.840]  That's what they're doing to you right now is going to end up being one of the best things that ever happened to you in your career
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:15.840]  Because that is a morality test for every individual who stands for any decent value
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  To stand with you or they are on the side of this savagery
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  So that is a defining moment in American history
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:32.840]  And a defining moment for anyone with an ounce and a yota of integrity or moral courage
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.840]  So when I called your show you said this is fight club now
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:41.840]  Your show is becoming intellectual fight club
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.840]  So this is what's happening, we are going to win
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.840]  We can lose little battles but that's not going, that's not sustainable
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.840]  I have seen it, when they banned my book, guess what happened
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.840]  People were buying it like drugs, it was everybody wanted it
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:03.840]  Until completely sold out
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.840]  So we are going to win and the values that they banned
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:12.840]  And the book that they banned, now I write it
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  Everything in mainstream media in Egypt
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:21.840]  And it's celebrated and it's becoming mainstream
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:22.840]  And this is
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.840]  You're helping cause, I know this in front of major reformation with your book and other books
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.840]  When we come back we'll talk about those but the particular book that they tried to ban
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.840]  Tell folks the name of that
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:46.840]  And the desecration of the heavenly religion because that is the name of the bill in Egypt that they used to punish dissidents and people who are against blasphemy laws
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:52.840]  Desecration of a heavenly religion available at CynthiaFarHot.com
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones then FullWars.com
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  Let's spread that link
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.840]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.840]  But I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.840]  So I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840]  Well, I broke the contract last week
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  And so this is potentially the last run, in fact right now it is the last run
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  There's a viable shield X2

[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.840]  This is it
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:56.840]  Recall 888-2533-139
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:24.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:35.840]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.840]  Cynthia Farahot is our guest, one of the top journalists in the world
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.840]  Incredible courage as you can speak to the whole Khashoggi situation
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.840]  Who they admit was involved in intelligence operations
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  Washington Post meets leftist intelligence operations
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.840]  So I heard it was to cover up 9-11 information
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.840]  I'm not sure, we'll get her expert take in a moment
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  And then ladies and gentlemen, when we go into the fourth hour
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.840]  I've got a bunch of video and a bunch of articles that I haven't gotten to
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.840]  That I'm going to get to then since Mother Breaking News
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.840]  It's on newswars.com and infowars.com
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.840]  And what she said is true
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.840]  They had the stage there of spring to try to radicalize
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.840]  And have a leftist breakdown of the European border and a larger globalist plan
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  When that failed, then trying to kill her, torturing her brother
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.840]  Or having to escape the nation, she became even bigger hero
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.840]  But if we can survive this process of censorship, restore the republic
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:38.840]  Yes, then it'll be a total defeat, at least for a while, of the leftist ideology
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.840]  Which is not liberal
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:47.840]  The problem is that if we fail, it's going to be really bad in a new dark age
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.840]  And a real authoritarianism, that's why I need your financial support
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  I'm trying to launch new shows, I'm trying to syndicate to more radio and TV stations
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.840]  We have bigger audiences than ever at infowars.com and newswars.com
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.840]  And on radio and TV stations, but it's kind of evening out here
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.840]  I want to expand the face of the global, so that's why I want to thank you all
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.840]  For your financial support, and we make it easy
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  With great books, with great videos, with great t-shirts, with great supplements
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.840]  Whatever the best is, it's there
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.840]  We have free shipping storewide, 35% off of storeable foods right now
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.840]  And 50% off on X2, even though it's selling out the last run
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.840]  And Brainforce Plus, and fluoride free, colloidal silver iodine, fortified toothpaste, super blue
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:37.840]  And the immune gargle, and the super silver gel that's the best out there
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:40.840]  FDA cleared for over the counter, the only one that is
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.840]  And so much more, that's how you fund us
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  You hear the network, and that's the satellite provider, they've got their sponsors
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.840]  And you hear local radio sponsors, you support them
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  But 80% of our funding is you buying products directly from us
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.840]  So when you buy a t-shirt, you buy a water filter, you buy an air filter
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.840]  You buy some great supplements, that makes it all possible
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  The best fish oil, the best turmeric, it's all there
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  I mean, we go out, just like our informations game changing, our products are
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  So biggest sale ever, Christmas and Black Friday and everything rolled into one
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:14.840]  Because the Democrats and Soros are harassing
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  And I've taken five of six payment processors, we have one
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.840]  One
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  Now, I always got aces in the hole, but I'll tell you, it's whack-a-mole
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.840]  You need to get the orders in now to provision us into the new year
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.840]  So thank you all for your support, you've really been coming through
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  So much, so we're gonna have to end these specials very soon
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  Because a lot of these are about to sell out
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  I'll have some new specials on what's left
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.840]  So thank you, but get your Christmas shopping done now
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  Now Cynthia Farahot, CynthiaFarahot.com is her website
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.840]  It's here with us this segment, I got her a little bit late
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:50.840]  Maybe she'll do five minutes in the next hour, but I really respect her and appreciate her
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.840]  I'm gonna stop asking questions, you wanted to get more into Saudi Arabia
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.840]  And this current firestorm over this one reporter
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.840]  And I'm saying, you're a reporter, I'm a reporter
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.840]  I mean, we're valuable and I support free speech
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:08.840]  But what's really behind this, and what are the other players and angles?
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:15.840]  So while I do that, unfortunately Prince Salman could have been involved
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.840]  I believe that the way to go further is to
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.840]  We have to make sure that this never happens again
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:35.840]  And the way we do that is there has to be punishment against turning your embassy into a slaughterhouse
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:42.840]  Because if this passes, every third world hellhole will be turning their embassies into slaughterhouses
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:46.840]  For dissidents who enter there for whatever reason
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:51.840]  So that's a very, very dangerous precedent that it happened
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:58.840]  The second thing, if I was advising President Trump, the thing I would be focusing on the most
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:05.840]  Is to make sure that one of the very dangerous princesses right now
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:12.840]  Who is supported by the Muslim Brotherhood in Iran does not become the next king of Saudi Arabia
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  Because they already started talking about putting him there
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.840]  And that is Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz and he's residing in London right now
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:31.840]  And he's among the most dangerous princesses who are eligible to become the next king of Saudi Arabia
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:35.840]  So it has to be a priority that this man does not get to this level
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  The other safe option is we have the brother of Prince Salman
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:49.840]  Khaled bin Salman who was the Saudi Arabia's ambassador
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.840]  In the US, that is a good, he's a moderate
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:53:02.840]  He's been in the United States, he's more familiar with Western ideas than his brother
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.840]  I think that's a good alternative to Prince Salman
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:11.840]  And the United States should not be fighting Turkey's battles
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:19.840]  Erdogan right now, he's a little coward and he keeps releasing some information to the press
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:27.840]  Hoping that America fights his battles and punishes Saudi Arabia on his behalf
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:33.840]  So while I breathe that this was a terrible crime and there needs to be a punishment
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:40.840]  It should not be done in a way that would serve Erdogan
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.840]  And I think Trump when he said let us learn what happened, only a few days into it
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.840]  And the media demonized him like he was backing what Saudi Arabia did implying
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:51.840]  He wants members of the press to be killed is just asinine
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.840]  They're the ones constantly calling for him to be killed or be removed from office
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.840]  Or for the military to come after him or for the White House to be blown up
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.840]  I'm going to play some of those new clips in the next hour once you're gone
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.840]  But I mean, I'm just calling like I see it
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:11.840]  Is it about 98% of calls for violence in Europe and also in the United States by the left?
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.840]  Of course, of course
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.840]  And they're wasting our time with the Kavanaugh Inquisition
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:24.840]  And they're wasting our time with some foreign actress and her creepy lawyer
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.840]  And instead of focusing on real issues
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:34.840]  They've released an incredibly disturbing report, a peer-reviewed report
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.840]  About Islamists with ties to terrorists that lobby Congress
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.840]  Not a single mainstream media outlet was interested in covering that atrocity
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.840]  We're heading to the midterms
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  How is that not a priority?
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.840]  How about calling your congressional nominee and telling them a pledge
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.840]  You are not going to meet with Islamists and operatives of Al-Qaeda
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:06.840]  The webmaster for Osama bin Laden, for God's sake, was lobbying on the Hill
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:12.840]  And he lobbies on the Hill every year in an event called Muslim Advocacy Day
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.840]  So we're having some national security disasters
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:23.840]  And they're wasting our time on Pocahontas and the porn actress
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.840]  And all this vulgar garbage
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.840]  It's circuses
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.840]  Yes
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.840]  Let me ask you this question then
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.840]  What happens if there's another big terror attack
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:41.840]  And Trump's actually been trying to secure the borders and trying to vet people from these seven failed countries
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.840]  Where they don't even have real passports
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.840]  What is the left going to do if there's another big terror attack?
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.840]  I mean, take Iran, we know they've got real Hezbollah sleeper cells here
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.840]  They've bragged about that
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  What happens if that happens and then they've been trying to block stopping it?
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.840]  That is a possibility, of course
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:07.840]  Especially that the Muslim Brotherhood operatives who founded Al-Qaeda and ISIS and Al-Jamal Islami
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.840]  And the vast majority of terrorist groups has a very strong presence in America
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840]  And they're very powerful here
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.840]  So that's definitely a possibility
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:21.840]  And of course they're going to leftists will blame it on President Trump
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.840]  And it is a real threat
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.840]  And there was a terrorist among the Islamists who were lobbying Congress
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.840]  A man involved in the murder of 500
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.840]  A murder and injury of 506 people
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.840]  So is that a threat?
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.840]  Are we under threats of terrorism?
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  Of course we are
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  Well, you brought up a lot of really stunning points
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.840]  We've only got five minutes left when you have this little short break
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.840]  And I appreciate you staying over a little bit, but I got you on late
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:55.840]  When we come back in like two minutes, I'll give you the full five minutes
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.840]  What else is on your radar screen?
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:58.840]  What else do you want to warn people about?
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:09.840]  Is one of the main leading experts on the radical Islamic leftist metastasization?
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:17.840]  My priority is to stop them from having this access to lawmakers
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:21.840]  That is the most urgent situation right now
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  Because they have been bragging about influencing United States policy
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840]  Exactly
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.840]  And if you look at Germany and Sweden and everywhere where it's parliamentary
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:33.840]  Where you can get 5-10% Muslim, but they all vote the same
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.840]  That's a swing vote
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.840]  And so they're very powerful and smart politically
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:39.840]  Because they vote monolithically and that's why they're such a danger
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:42.840]  We'll talk about that and how to stop it straight ahead
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:43.840]  Because let me tell you
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:58:07.840]  We'll play the clip of Serena Law
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.840]  Back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.840]  To still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:27.840]  To get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.840]  So go to infowarstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.840]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:40.840]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:47.840]  The Supermail in you, Supermail Vitality from infowarstore.com
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:14.840]  Tumeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:19.840]  To help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.840]  And so much more
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:25.840]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:30.840]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:37.840]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.840]  To work synergistically for full body support

[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.840]  What's really going on are these anti-sharia laws
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:19.840]  They are motivated by anti-muslim bigotry, plain and simple
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.840]  Syria equals Islam and Muslims
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:27.840]  And a vote against one is a vote against another
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:28.840]  Thank you
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.840]  Sending out an SOS
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.840]  And she's sending out an SOS
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.840]  Cynthia Farahat, investigative journalist, one of the most famous in the world
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.840]  Who helped expose the fact that Obama and Hillary funded the Arab Spring
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.840]  She's saying the big SOS is this
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:53.840]  ISIS, Al Qaeda, bin Laden's webmaster
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  They're openly on Capitol Hill, they're lobbying, they're bragging what idiots we are
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.840]  And if you look at Europe, the way they've lobbied, the way they've become that key vote
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.840]  That key swing vote that votes as a block
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:08.840]  This is really the real threat, not the physical terrorism
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.840]  That's the good cop, bad cop scenario
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  This is the real heart of it
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.840]  So break down your emergency report
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.840]  Tell folks where they can find it, because this is critical
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.840]  They can find it on my website
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.840]  And they can also find it on my official Facebook page
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.840]  This report has damning evidence
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.840]  To the support of many congressional members
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:40.840]  To some of the world's most brutal and vicious Islamists
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.840]  And that is actually much more dangerous than physical terror
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:50.840]  Because they influence policies that can result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  As we have seen with the so-called Arab Spring
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.840]  In this report, you are going to see Senator Cory Booker
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.840]  Taking a selfie with Osama bin Laden's webmaster
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.840]  And I'm not the one who's making this allegation against him
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.840]  That's the United States government
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:16.840]  The guy United States government accused him of operating a mirror website for Al Qaeda
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.840]  And Mr. Cory Booker is taking a selfie with this man
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:30.840]  So what do you think this message, what kind of message did this send to terrorists worldwide
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.840]  To moderate Muslims worldwide
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:36.840]  To victims of Islamic terrorism worldwide
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.840]  That a potential next president of the United States
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:45.840]  Is taking selfies with Al Qaeda operatives
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.840]  What does that...
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  Can it get more dangerous than this, Alex?
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.840]  It's incredibly important
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.840]  And again, people can go to Cynthia Farahot
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840]  CynthiaFarahot.com
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.840]  And find Islamists with direct ties to terrorists
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.840]  Lobby Congress
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.840]  And so basically, you've got lobbyists for ISIS and Al Qaeda
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:10.840]  Running wild, running free on Capitol Hill
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:12.840]  Simply insane
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:14.840]  People need to go get the report
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:16.840]  They need to share it
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:17.840]  They need to get it out
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:18.840]  And that's why they fear Info Wars
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.840]  Is they fear our audience
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  Audience, you're not the caboose
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:22.840]  You're the engine
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  You're the whole train
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:24.840]  You're the track
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  You're the planet
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:27.840]  When you move, nothing can stop you
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  If you don't take action, we're screwed
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:30.840]  Amazing
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:31.840]  We've got a minute left
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:32.840]  You're awesome giving us this time
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.840]  People can find your books at CynthiaFarahot.com
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:36.840]  Again, we salute your courage
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.840]  Please come back on a regular basis
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.840]  In the last 60 seconds, other points
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:44.840]  I would like to thank your audience
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:47.840]  When I called for an Info Wars
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.840]  I was overwhelmed with messages of love, prayers
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.840]  And kindness and support
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  You have great audience, Alex
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.840]  They are incredible, aren't they?
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.840]  They are the victory
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:03.840]  Oh my God, they're amazing
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  I've been on shows across the world
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:07.840]  And you by far have the best audience
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:10.840]  I've never had that experience before
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  And another thing, I love your products too
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:14.840]  I'm on Brainforce right now

[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:20.840]  Your audience is amazing
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  You're doing great work
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.840]  And that's why they're targeting you
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  Well, you're amazing
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.840]  And we just thank God you're there as well
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.840]  And we look forward to speaking to you soon
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.840]  Thank you so much
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.840]  Thank you for having me, Alex
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:34.840]  You bet
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.840]  We got huge
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:36.840]  I want to say huge breaking news
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:37.840]  It's such insane news
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:38.840]  I don't even know what to say at this point
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:39.840]  We'll cover it when we come back
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:41.840]  But when she talks about the audience
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:42.840]  It really is true
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.840]  I don't just keep saying how great you are
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.840]  If you understand you are the best
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.840]  It's true
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:49.840]  I mean, Info Wars

[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.840]  Only at the beginning of the colon
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:41.840]  But our premium organic acacia fiber

[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.840]  A tree here to the ground
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.840]  And shutter from the sound
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.840]  The death machine makes low and down
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:36.840]  It's gaining power for power
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.840]  A gas mask is a couture
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.840]  Senator Warren's family has long told stories
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:44.840]  That they have some Native American heritage
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.840]  Some people don't believe that
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:48.840]  And his name is Donald Trump
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:49.840]  Breaking news this morning
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.840]  Senator Elizabeth Warren has released results
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:52.840]  Of a DNA test
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:55.840]  Showing she does have Native American ancestry
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.840]  Messages its senator and possible presidential
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:00.840]  Hopeful Elizabeth Warren released results
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.840]  Of a DNA test
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:05.840]  She says proves she has some Native American heritage
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:08.840]  Strong evidence that she has Native American heritage
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:12.840]  DNA analysis proves she has Native American heritage
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.840]  Elizabeth Warren can now officially say
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:16.840]  That she is part Native American
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:19.840]  It's past time to separate politics from fact
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:23.840]  And the fact is the people calling Warren a liar
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:25.840]  Just don't have a leg to stand on
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:28.840]  President Trump, who calls her Pocahontas
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:30.840]  Has suggested he would pay a million dollars to a charity
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.840]  If she took a DNA test to prove her heritage
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.840]  When told of the test results today
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:36.840]  Here's what President Trump said
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:37.840]  Who cares?
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.840]  Who cares?
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:39.840]  Who cares?
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:40.840]  Who cares?
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.840]  You care!
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.840]  You care!
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.840]  You're literally the only person who cares
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:48.840]  I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:50.840]  Paid for by Trump
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:53.840]  If you take the test and it shows you're an Indian
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.840]  You know
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.840]  Donald Trump
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:59.840]  Promised he'd donate one million dollars to charity
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.840]  If Senator Elizabeth Warren could prove
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.840]  She had Native American ancestry
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:07.840]  Well, the DNA results are in
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:09.840]  Yay!
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:10.840]  She is
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:12.840]  She's one tenth of one percent
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:14.840]  Elizabeth Warren took the test
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:16.840]  Now he says he's not going to pay the million dollars
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:20.840]  One confronted about his million dollar pledge
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:21.840]  This afternoon
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.840]  He chickened out
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.840]  The president is scoffing at the results
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.840]  How much? One one thousand?
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:28.840]  Do you over an apology?
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.840]  What about the money then?
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:31.840]  She owes the country an apology
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.840]  We don't have to wait for the president's DNA
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:36.840]  He is one hundred percent douche
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:41.840]  Elizabeth Warren taking the bait
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.840]  Now the president likes to call my mom a liar
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:46.840]  What do the facts say?
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.840]  The facts suggest that you could absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.840]  This is absolute pure bull
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.840]  Don't believe the crap you see from these people
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.840]  The fake news
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.840]  I'm an Indian outlaw
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.840]  Half Cherokee and chocolate
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  My baby, she's a Chippewa
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.840]  Oh, she's a one of a kind
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.840]  Elizabeth Warren is whiter than your average white person
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:13.840]  My papal had high cheekbones
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.840]  Like all of the Indians do
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:22.840]  Fokuhonus is on the warpath
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.840]  They call her Fokuhonus
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.840]  Does Warren translate into Cherokee as spreading bull?
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.840]  If Senator Warren sets the standard
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.840]  You too could claim a minority preference
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.840]  But I knew my father's family didn't like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.840]  So my parents had to upload
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.840]  Most white Americans have more Native American blood than Senator Warren
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:05.840]  She's potentially one one thousandth and twenty fourth Indian
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:08.840]  Which is zero point zero nine percent
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:10.840]  I never asked my mom for documentation
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:12.840]  When she talked about our Native American heritage
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.840]  The university actually celebrated her as the first minority woman to receive tenure
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:20.840]  Warren posed as a victim because on the left
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:22.840]  Victimhood is power
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:23.840]  Warren is trying to play the victim
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.840]  I'm 13 percent victim
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.840]  I'm 21 percent victim
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.840]  Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you, DNA and me
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.840]  Are you in?
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:38.840]  Hellfucking yes, I'm in
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.840]  Waging war on corruption
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  Waging war on victimhood
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.840]  Projecting and achieving planetary victory
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.840]  Alright, now that's some good news and hilarious
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:52.840]  And everything they do blows up in their face
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  But they're still in control of the banks and the media
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.840]  And the chai comms and the EU
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.840]  And they are trying to destroy those of us
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:05.840]  And stick our little heads up above the parapet
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.840]  I don't normally do this
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:09.840]  But more and more
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:11.840]  Let me just tell the crew now and they do a great job putting up with me
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.840]  Can we get a portable mic ready
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.840]  And get a camera aimed over here at these maps
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  Because I'm going to give a presentation when we come back from break
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.840]  About the real crisis
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.840]  And it's been weighing on me to cover this
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.840]  But then I just don't cope with words to describe how insane it is
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:36.840]  But this is the key to really everything
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.840]  You guys print me some of the articles that I know I've had you print four times the last five, six days and I've never covered
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.840]  I've mentioned it but never covered it
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:47.840]  It's even the New York Times
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:54.840]  Emergency, Austria and Hungary and Italy pulling out of the UN refugee compact
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:12:00.840]  Yes, the UN runs worldwide who comes into your borders
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.840]  But now they have announced the invasion of the US officially
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:08.840]  This came in just minutes ago
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:11.840]  Like ten minutes ago, it's stunning, it's on infowars.com
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.840]  I'm going to cover it when we come back
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:18.840]  Look, I already knew this, you already knew this
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.840]  But to see it all over the news
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.840]  And I was back in the coffee room getting some iced tea during the break
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.840]  And I saw it on Fox News too
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.840]  So I'm like reading it and then it's on Fox News like it's no big deal
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.840]  And I'm not even attacking Fox News but they're like
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.840]  The United Nations is directing the refugee columns coming towards the United States
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.840]  Mexico under US pressure has agreed to stop them
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:48.840]  But the UN is pledging to build refugee centers in Mexico and help those migrate into the United States
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.840]  We're under UN attack!
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.840]  This is how you take people down
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:57.840]  They're the ones advertising with collapsing Latin America
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.840]  And globalist policies and communist policies that did it to do this
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:07.840]  So they can then set up globalism here
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.840]  Instead of having free market capitalism down there, they'd be just as rich as we were
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:17.840]  But they never got a chance, did they?
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:19.840]  Look, I don't want to see Latin America sink into hell
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:25.840]  I'm just not going with them!
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.840]  But at least they're not Islamic, that's the golden lining
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.840]  The silver lining I guess, isn't it?
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:39.840]  Oh God, help me, I just don't know what to do anymore
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:42.840]  I mean, it really does take your breath away
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.840]  If it doesn't take your breath away that we're under UN invasion
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.840]  And then the president's fighting it and the media's attacking him
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.840]  And we're under Chai-Com the chips
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.840]  Most of the chips in your refrigerator, your washing machine, your car
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:57.840]  Have Chai-Com spy chips, tracking and stealing data
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.840]  And I mean, it's like, I'm not a fascist!
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:06.840]  Facebook and Google and YouTube and Apple are, they're the ones that dare all this
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.840]  If Trump sends the army in to take their ass out, he's not the fascist
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.840]  It's called self-defense, and oh, meanwhile they're saying, oh, use the military against Trump
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:19.840]  You're saying, because they're planning all this, folks
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:21.840]  You see those big migrant waves?
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.840]  In fact, pull up next segment, the famous snake stuff
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.840]  You know, the video that got us banned on Twitter or whatever
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.840]  I want to show the European Union leading in the millions as well
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.840]  We've seen this before, they build an army and they march it in
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.840]  And the media says, do it, do it, and then once those corridors are open, it's over!
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:42.840]  The wages go down!
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.840]  Your pension funds go down!
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:46.840]  Giant suckings down!
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.840]  Ross Perot talked about
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:53.840]  Now listen, they were paying $50 an hour on average in Canada
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:55.840]  We were paid on average about $25
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.840]  Now, as soon as we got rid of those tariffs and controls, they dropped down about $30
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:01.840]  We dropped down about $15
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.840]  So it didn't build them up, it didn't build us up
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:06.840]  It was a giant sucking sound, it's been done other places
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:08.840]  Let me show you 20 minutes of graphs and science here
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:10.840]  I'm a self-made guy, $10 billion
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:15.840]  Now, Mexico paid about $2 an hour, this is $19.93
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.840]  $92
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.840]  Now, if they went from $50 to $30, we went from $25 to $15
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:25.840]  It's not going to raise Mexico to lower us, it's not going to raise Canada
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:27.840]  It's a sucking sound
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:30.840]  You get rid of civilization, you get rid of that, then none
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:32.840]  See, what was the left side?
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:33.840]  Oh, minimum wage, minimum wage
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:37.840]  How about free market drives up all the wages, which you see happening
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.840]  And the Federal Reserve is like, oh god, let's raise interest rates, let's stop wages going up
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:44.840]  See, because they can't have a free market
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:49.840]  The big bankers want to control when they rig to vertically integrate and consolidate
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:16:08.840]  But hey, if people are too stupid to take liberty and prosper in their hands, you get what you deserve
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:29.840]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.840]  I sued the IRS in one
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.840]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:41.840]  I can help you too
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.840]  I'm going to pay $800, 34 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:54.840]  That's danpilla.com danpilla.com
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:59.840]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.840]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:08.840]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:12.840]  That only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:16.840]  It's easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.840]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.840]  Go to minutemanstove.com
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:43.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:57.840]  I want to plow into all of this
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:00.840]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:03.840]  Just encouraging listeners to understand that

[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.840]  I cannot say it any clearer

[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:48.840]  Stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:50.840]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:53.840]  And they're coming back against us so we need your support
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:59.840]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement

[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:28.840]  What was it like for you?
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:31.840]  Because we haven't talked about this ever on TV or off
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:33.840]  What was it like for you when you won?
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.840]  It was horrible, I was away by myself in Boston
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:38.840]  About to shoot a TV show and I said to my therapist
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:40.840]  Do you think it's wrong for me to go alone?
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:42.840]  It's election night and what if he wins
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.840]  And she said, you know Rosie, you've got to stop it
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.840]  Always the negative tapes in your head
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.840]  No one's saying it's wrong for me
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.840]  You go there, you do your job
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:53.840]  I went there and I started, I actually got physically sick
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.840]  I got physically sick that night
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:57.840]  And I thought to myself, this cannot be happening
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:59.840]  Because when he got the nomination
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:01.840]  I thought, well we just got away to election day
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:04.840]  That's all I have to do is hold on till then
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:07.840]  And then that he won, it took me a good year
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:09.840]  To compose myself to be in public again
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:12.840]  I took a year out of the spotlight
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:15.840]  I'm sure you would have wanted to be proven wrong
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:18.840]  The first thing he did was pass the Muslim ban
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:20.840]  He came into office and did all the things
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.840]  That you probably knew about him
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.840]  When he was elected, what I wrote on Twitter was
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:26.840]  We should impose martial law till we make sure
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.840]  That the Russians weren't involved in the final tallies
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:29.840]  Of the votes
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:31.840]  And Bob Mueller has indicted 13 Russians
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:32.840]  For election middling
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.840]  And people were like, martial law, what's wrong with you
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:35.840]  You're a lunatic
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:37.840]  He wants to send the military to the border
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:39.840]  I would have sent the military to the White House
[02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:40.840]  To get him
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:45.840]  I just saw live footage
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:47.840]  You just saw live footage of your TV viewer
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:49.840]  Of your radio listener from RT
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:51.840]  Because our traitorous media won't show this
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:57.840]  That was bigger masses of people pouring across
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:59.840]  The Mexico border
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.840]  Than what we even saw in the famous footage
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:03.840]  In the last few years
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.840]  Of the giant columns of people pouring into Europe
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.840]  I mean, it is unbelievable
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:11.840]  Now, the live feed is cut out
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:13.840]  But we streamed it live 10 minutes ago
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:15.840]  We're going to go back into that and get that
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.840]  And I'm rarely speechless
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:23.840]  But to see Rosie O'Donnell
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:25.840]  How dare we have troops on the border
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.840]  We should just let the UN come in
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:29.840]  And announce everybody we're going into America
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:32.840]  And then pay to have these images
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:34.840]  Just like they did with Islamist out of
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:36.840]  The Middle East and North Africa
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:40.840]  Pouring into Europe to open up those migration lanes
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:42.840]  For the globalist invasion
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.840]  I mean, this is world government
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:47.840]  So about 20 minutes ago I said
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.840]  Coming up incredible article
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:53.840]  About how it's even the Associated Press and Reuters
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.840]  That the UN is running this
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.840]  And I mean, I know you know that
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:07.840]  I know I know that, but it's outrageous
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:09.840]  Can we show the snake footage
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:11.840]  The famous footage of the giant columns coming in
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:12.840]  Yeah, there it is
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.840]  This is even bigger and worse than that
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:17.840]  This is totally collapsing everything
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:19.840]  So I'm so flabbergasted right now
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.840]  And I want to nail this
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.840]  So that we can then take the live feed video
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:34.840]  And post it so
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:36.840]  So we can get out to people and warn people
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:38.840]  This is insane
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:40.840]  The globalist are literally collapsing
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:42.840]  The collapsing world
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:45.840]  Third world system into the west
[02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:47.840]  This is World War 4
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:49.840]  This is the attack, this is the plan
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:51.840]  Thousands of US bound migrants
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:53.840]  Storm Guatemala, Mexico border
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:55.840]  Under UN command
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:57.840]  Look at these headlines
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:23:59.840]  I added under UN command
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:00.840]  That's RT
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:02.840]  Look at Fox News
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:04.840]  US, Mexico agree on
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:06.840]  Plan to handle migrant caravan from Central America
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:08.840]  But it just broke through into Mexico
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.840]  Out of Guatemala
[02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:13.840]  And it goes on to say the United Nations
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:16.840]  Is going to establish UN camps
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:18.840]  On the Guatemalan border
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:19.840]  To bring everybody in
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:21.840]  And then force them over the border
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:23.840]  Just today the Mexican government
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.840]  And it's a very important step
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.840]  Requested the intervention of the UN
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.840]  The Office of the High Commissioner of Refugees
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.840]  To help Mexico recover any asylum claims
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:33.840]  For the members of the caravan
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:36.840]  Because the UN is setting up refugee centers
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:38.840]  On the border
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:41.840]  With the United States
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:43.840]  Southern country
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:44.840]  Mexico
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:47.840]  Hungary pulls out of UN global migration agreement
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:48.840]  So does Austria
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:50.840]  This is what they do
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:52.840]  They advertise, they pay
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:53.840]  They bring the people in
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.840]  They bust the gates open
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:56.840]  And then the liberals
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:57.840]  The socialists
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:58.840]  The globalists
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:24:59.840]  The leftists
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:01.840]  They feed and fund off all these people
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:02.840]  Who never get jobs
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:04.840]  And are totally personless
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:05.840]  Who then if they want
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:06.840]  They give them one order
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:08.840]  They burn everything down
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:13.840]  One hell of a way to sabotage civilization
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.840]  So we're going to get that footage again
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  Because it was live
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:20.840]  It was just like 10 minutes ago
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:21.840]  15 minutes ago
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:23.840]  And I said I'd give a presentation
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.840]  Describing the invasion routes
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:28.840]  And we'll do that
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.840]  Coming up the start of the next segment
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.840]  But at certain points
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:34.840]  It's like I almost came to sit here
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:35.840]  And talk about this on air
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:36.840]  I mean my god
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:37.840]  The democrats, the globalists
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.840]  They're part of this UN
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:40.840]  UNESCO
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:41.840]  Soros
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:43.840]  World government plan
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:44.840]  To implode the third world
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:45.840]  Flood everything
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:47.840]  Weaponize the populations that are brought here
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.840]  This is how the globalists are taking over
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:51.840]  They don't want middle classes
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:53.840]  They don't want anything
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:55.840]  They want to collapse everything
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:57.840]  And now they're desperate
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.840]  Trying to accelerate their plan
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:03.840]  The footage has now been archived
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:04.840]  So let's fade up the audio
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:05.840]  And roll some of this
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:06.840]  This is unbelievable
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.840]  And then they break through
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.840]  The Mexican border
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:11.840]  This is the same footage we've got
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:12.840]  Out of Europe
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.840]  Where they knock the fences down
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:14.840]  And climb over
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:15.840]  And then the fences are broken
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:17.840]  And then if hungry
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:19.840]  Or Austria try to stop this
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:23.840]  If they try to stop them
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:25.840]  Then the UN says
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:26.840]  Under the EU
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.840]  They're going to send in the military
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.840]  This is a 30 minute video
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:33.840]  Of these thousands and thousands and thousands of people
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:34.840]  Brought in by Soros
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.840]  Staged in Honduras
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:38.840]  In Nicaragua
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:40.840]  In San Salvador
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:42.840]  You can fade it back up
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:43.840]  And then they boom
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.840]  March them up to show everybody else
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:47.840]  Hey, it's open
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:49.840]  Blow off the gates, come in
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:51.840]  And again, it's not that these people are bad
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:54.840]  It's that they're being run by the globalists
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:56.840]  And notice they've all got their national flags
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:57.840]  They've got flags
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.840]  They're coming El Norte
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:01.840]  And they've got their flags of their country
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.840]  Because they've been taught to hate America
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:03.840]  And be nationalistic
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:04.840]  And they've got their flags
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.840]  We're coming with our flags
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:07.840]  We're coming to your gates
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.840]  We're going to blow your gates off
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:10.840]  We're coming
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:12.840]  Now fast forward
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:13.840]  This is 30-something minutes
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.840]  Let's skip halfway ahead
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:16.840]  You will see them break the gates
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.840]  This is unbelievable
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.840]  Oh, my God
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:21.840]  It's starting
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.840]  Oh, I'll fade the audio up
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  Climbing over the fence, it's beginning
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.840]  And then pretty soon
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:30.840]  They tear it all down
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:31.840]  Oh, my God
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:32.840]  Back it up a minute
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:33.840]  Oh, my Lord
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.840]  We're going to come back and cover this
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:36.840]  Good God
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:37.840]  Back it up more
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:39.840]  Because when we come back from break
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:40.840]  We're going to have this for everybody
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:42.840]  If you're a TV viewer, you've got to see this
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.840]  This is why they want us off Twitter and Facebook
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:46.840]  They are getting ready for this
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:48.840]  And they do not want anybody covering this
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.840]  This is classic primitive Rome falling
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:55.840]  This is, this is absolutely
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.840]  Totally directed by Soros and the UN
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:00.840]  Clear and present military attack
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.840]  Our 2,000-plus-mile southern border
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:04.840]  Undefended
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.840]  You've got Mexico with its border, its wall
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:10.840]  And this is making Mexico an already-filled state
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:12.840]  Completely collapsed
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:14.840]  With people tearing down the fences
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:17.840]  If you're a radio listener, this is dramatic footage
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:20.840]  You will not see this anywhere in U.S. news
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:22.840]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:24.840]  This is incredible
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.840]  Good God, the gates just fell
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:31.840]  And they're not waving American flags, as you can see
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:33.840]  And there's all sorts of Islamists
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:35.840]  That have infiltrated from all over the world
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.840]  Pouring into Mexico
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.840]  And Mexico will arrest you if you get off the train lines
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.840]  The train lines
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:44.840]  That's right up the train lines
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:46.840]  And then if Trump tries to check who the kids are
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:48.840]  Who anybody is, he's a Nazi
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:50.840]  This is the invasion, this is the traitorous activity
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:52.840]  This is America under attack
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:54.840]  18 days out
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:56.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:58.840]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:00.840]  When they tried to seize my mother's house
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:02.840]  I sued the IRS and won
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:04.840]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:06.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement

[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:04.840]  I spend hours in front of a screen
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.840]  And then hours in front of bright lights

[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:35.840]  Impacting thing I've ever seen
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:37.840]  It was incredible in the last five years
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:39.840]  Seeing millions of Islamists pour in
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:41.840]  Broadened by UN troops
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:43.840]  Marching by the millions into Europe
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:45.840]  People thrown out of their houses
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:46.840]  Total welfare given to them
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:49.840]  To incentivize Africa and
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.840]  The Islamic nations of the Middle East
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:53.840]  Completely invade
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.840]  And moderate regimes were taken down
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:57.840]  To open up the borders of Europe
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.840]  To carry this out
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:01.840]  Only Russia stood against it
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.840]  And now, this just happened
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:05.840]  The last 20 minutes
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:07.840]  I was watching the live RT feed in there
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:08.840]  And we took it
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:10.840]  And we've got the footage for you
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:12.840]  That I want to back up to the moment
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:13.840]  For TV viewers
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  And I'll narrate for radio listeners
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.840]  When this happened
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.840]  Just 20, 30 minutes ago
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:20.840]  It's the Mexican border
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:22.840]  Thousands of thousands of invaders
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:23.840]  From all over the world
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:25.840]  Hundreds of Islamists have already been caught
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:26.840]  I've got headlines here
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:28.840]  ISIS Al Qaeda members
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:30.840]  And they shake down the gates
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:32.840]  They shake down the wall
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:33.840]  And they break in
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:36.840]  And they pour in en masse
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:38.840]  With our own media saying
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:40.840]  How dare Trump try to stop this
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:42.840]  No borders, no walls
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.840]  You come here, everything's free
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:45.840]  Everything's wonderful
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:47.840]  But once they bring them in in Europe
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:49.840]  90% don't get jobs
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:50.840]  They get on welfare
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:51.840]  And now they're alone
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:54.840]  And they're controlled by the leftist
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:55.840]  By the globalist
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:56.840]  By the Democrats
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:57.840]  By the UN
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:00.840]  So here's the big announcement
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:02.840]  I just watched
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:07.840]  On October 19th, 2018
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.840]  The beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution Part 2
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.840]  You just watched
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:13.840]  And if you can't cue it right up to the point
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.840]  They break down the
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.840]  Let's roll it from here for TV viewers
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:21.840]  You just watched
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:26.840]  A UN-sponsored, created, media-advertised zone
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:28.840]  Where for a year
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:31.840]  They've been mashing migrant caravans together
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.840]  To blow open a migration route
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:37.840]  And to embolden people
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:40.840]  To flood up the rail lines
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.840]  To Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.840]  And flood in, waving their flags
[02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:51.840]  Of the Middle East and of Latin America
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:53.840]  And saying, we demand everything
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:55.840]  I've got articles stacked up today
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:58.840]  Wearing gold watches and $1,000 phones
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.840]  And $200 skinny jeans
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:02.840]  Bitching for more in Europe
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:04.840]  Pissing all over everything
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:06.840]  And there it is
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:08.840]  Promised free welfare
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.840]  Promised women
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  Promised jobs
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.840]  Promised everything by Soros
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.840]  And the corporate media and Stephen Colbert and traders
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:19.840]  You are witnessing on your TV screen
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:25.840]  The UN attack, the globalist attack on America
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:28.840]  And you're looking at the Democratic Party mainstream news
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:30.840]  Registering illegal aliens to vote
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:32.840]  That's in the Washington Times today from Rider in Texas
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:35.840]  And look at the directors and their NGO outfits
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:38.840]  Waving everybody in
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:40.840]  And waving those foreign flags
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  Look at that amount of people
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:47.840]  That's over 10,000 people in one wave
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:51.840]  That's Soros, bending America over
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:56.840]  And putting our head in the guillotine
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.840]  Look at that, that lone armored vehicle
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:03.840]  That was supposedly going to stop the power of a mass of people
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.840]  And the Mexican government collapsing into corruption
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:10.840]  And then Trump valiantly trying to stop it
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.840]  As now 800 miles away
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.840]  Now marches tens of thousands of people behind them
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.840]  Pouring in in the most dramatic footage ever
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.840]  That's what a 21st century UN invasion
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:26.840]  Sixth generational warfare looks like
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:30.840]  That's what it looks like, ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:31.840]  And then the footage cuts
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:36.840]  And reportedly it's just still flowing and flowing and flowing and flowing
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:39.840]  Looks like way more than 10,000
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:42.840]  But that's the tip of the spear
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:46.840]  That's the tip, look at it, flowing and flowing and flowing and flowing
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:48.840]  El Norte
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:50.840]  And then nothing's going to be good enough
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.840]  So think about it, you're not an army in uniforms
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.840]  Though the message is white people are bad
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:00.840]  But let's get to the country that they set up
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:03.840]  Because it's so good
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:06.840]  And so the message is get up there
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:09.840]  And anybody that opposes you is opposing children
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:12.840]  Maybe one out of 50 people's a child there
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:15.840]  But it won't matter, the news will show the few children and say
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:17.840]  Don't stop any of them, they're children
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  Let them all through, because they're holding children up like human shields
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:23.840]  It was earlier in the video, and I was watching it live
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:25.840]  Holding children up at the fences
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.840]  Open the fences, we have children
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:30.840]  We're fleeing where we came from
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  We're fleeing the failures and the hell
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.840]  That our ancestors have created
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.840]  And we're bringing it to visit it on you because of your hospitality
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:42.840]  And your open arms, and how dare your president
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:44.840]  And how dare your border patrols sail to anything
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  And so the left is, abolish ice, abolish ice, dox their houses
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:51.840]  Kill them, kill Scalise, kill Rand Paul, kill Trump
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:56.840]  Kill Alex Jones, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:59.840]  Dox them, abolish ice, no defenses
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:03.840]  Everyone come, come, come
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:07.840]  As the left always invites in their Islamic killers
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:10.840]  As they always invite in their destroyers
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:13.840]  They're just begging to be annihilated
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:16.840]  The most dramatic footage I've ever seen
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:20.840]  Of the collapsing Latin America and the zombie apocalypse
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.840]  As you see that within 10 days of people not having food
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:27.840]  Most of them become mass murderers or cannibals
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:30.840]  And you see people out of obese
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:33.840]  They're not even starving in their third world countries
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:37.840]  Pouring in, demanding their piece of that pie
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:40.840]  Even though they're not waving American flags
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:43.840]  They're waving their flags
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:45.840]  Because they're conquerors
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:49.840]  And they've been told you're here and you're gonna conquer America
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:51.840]  You're gonna take it over
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:53.840]  You're gonna stand up to Donald Trump
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  Because George Soros wants to mount America's head on the wall
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:03.840]  Because they have a plan to do it in Europe
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.840]  And a plan to do it here
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.840]  And a plan to do it everywhere else
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:10.840]  And it's all happening right now
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:13.840]  All those voters ready to be registered
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:16.840]  To take your guns and take your pension fund
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.840]  And take your bank account and raise taxes on you
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:21.840]  And George Soros is exempt from taxes
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  Because Texas Democrats ask non-citizens to register to vote
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:28.840]  We don't say illegal aliens
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:30.840]  Because that's politically incorrect
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  The Washington Times didn't want to get banned on Twitter
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.840]  So they use the language they're told
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:38.840]  The Texas Democrat Party asks non-citizens to register to vote
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:41.840]  Sending out applications to immigrants with a box
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:43.840]  Citizenship already checked, yes
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.840]  Like Obama said in 2016
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:48.840]  Oh, if you live here, you can come here, you can vote
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:50.840]  According to a new complaint filed Tuesday
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.840]  Thursday, asking prosecutors to see what laws may have been broken
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:58.840]  Gee, I wonder what laws just got broken in that footage
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:40:59.840]  Keep rolling it
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:02.840]  The Public Entrance Legal Foundation learned to district attorneys
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.840]  And the Federal Justice Department through the pre-checked applications
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  And also included a signed affidavit from a man who said
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.840]  Some of the relatives who aren't citizens received the mailing
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:19.840]  This is how the Texas Democratic Party is inviting foreign influence in an election
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.840]  In a federal election cycle and it goes on from there
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.840]  You know, we have a guest host joining us
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.840]  Who always does a great job, Joe Gilbert
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:31.840]  But I'm really tempted to commandeer this next hour
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:35.840]  Because how could I just shit here like this is just more news
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:41.840]  When we just watched the southern border of Mexico collapse
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:46.840]  Under the UN Invasion Test run by the UN
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.840]  Here's Fox News, the UN is establishing refugee camps
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:56.840]  On the southern border of Mexico in Guatemala
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:59.840]  To open up migration routes
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:02.840]  Saying there's no right to sovereignty or nation states
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:04.840]  Only the UN
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  How about the UN has its gates knocked down
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.840]  And a couple million people go live in that building in New York
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.840]  Oh, no, that would never happen
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.840]  How about the Vatican that has 200-foot walls and the Pope says open Italy up
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:19.840]  Oh, no, he won't do that
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:27.840]  No, you are going to let the third world in to be organized to destroy you
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:30.840]  The most incredible footage ever at infowars.com
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:33.840]  And we're taking these live feeds and updating them to the site
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:35.840]  And that's why they want to censor us 18 days out
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.840]  Because if you think this is bad, let me tell you, the next 18 days
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  They've launched the UN attack. The US is now under UN Invasion
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.840]  UN-directed collapse of the border, red alert
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:50.840]  The United States is now under UN Invasion
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:54.840]  We need 200,000 troops mobilized now
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:57.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:00.840]  With our own four years of seeking and testing
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:03.840]  To find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:06.840]  To detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield
[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:09.840]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:13.840]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.840]  That are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:19.840]  And it supports the info war. It is a classical 360-win
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:23.840]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.840]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:29.840]  When it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:31.840]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:36.840]  And you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:39.840]  And as clean and as focused as you can be
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:42.840]  Because we need you, the remnant of America
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.840]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:46.840]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:48.840]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:51.840]  We're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:44:20.840]  With Z-Shield and infowarslife.com
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:23.840]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.840]  Including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health
[02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:29.840]  Aiding and regulating fat metabolism
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:32.840]  Helping to maintain cognitive function and more
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:36.840]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:38.840]  We're giving you the benefits of a simple formula
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:41.840]  That contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.840]  Paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.840]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:54.840]  Now available at infowarsstore.com
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:58.840]  X2, we were selling it for about three years
[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:01.840]  And then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:03.840]  And they said, oh we want more money, more money
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.840]  And oh, this and that. And so I've broken my contract
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:11.840]  And right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.840]  That literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.840]  It gasses, like I dream of genie and it's purple gas
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:22.840]  I mean that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:24.840]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:29.840]  But I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.840]  So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:35.840]  Well, I broke the contract last week
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:38.840]  And so this is potentially the last run
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:41.840]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:44.840]  And we've got a good supply of it, it'll be gone a couple months
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:47.840]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, M4store.com
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:49.840]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:52.840]  I suggest you stock up on it, it's available right now for a limited time

[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.840]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:03.840]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:09.840]  You may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:14.840]  That's why InforWar's Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula

[02:46:53.840 --> 02:47:03.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:29.840]  October 19th, 2018
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:38.840]  The year that the UN, the day that the UN officially declared war on America and invaded us
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:44.840]  With an illegal alien army that they staged down in Honduras
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:50.840]  That now marched through Guatemala and tens of thousands just blew a giant hole
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:55.840]  Through the Mexican southern defense of their nation
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:48:00.840]  Imagine you walked into Mexico or flew into Mexico and you tried to walk through their customs
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  And said, I'm going to Cancun without showing you my passport
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:07.840]  They'd take you to jail and knock your teeth out
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:12.840]  But if they don't even know who you are and you're just walking in
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:18.840]  Well, they just climbed over the fences, they just invaded the raw energy UN run
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:23.840]  And even Fox News says, oh, the UN is directing this group
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:32.840]  The UN is in control of it, the UN will establish refugee centers on the Guatemala border
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:36.840]  For the further invasion of North America
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.840]  We just witnessed the invasion of North America officially began
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:43.840]  They'd already tested open to the border to Mexico
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:50.840]  They tested letting the biggest group coming in now as Chinese women here to have babies and make them citizens and be anchor babies
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:53.840]  Because we're schmucks, they take our openness and use it against us
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:57.840]  But now the image of it's got to be over 10,000
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.840]  Pouring across and just hours of the footage
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:06.840]  Building up to the last 30 minutes of footage
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:08.840]  It happened at the start of this hour
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:14.840]  Just pouring through as far as the eye can see behind and in front
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:26.840]  Just vitriolically like images are typally of city gates being blown off and barbarian hordes pouring into Rome
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:28.840]  And this is 18 days out from the election
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:31.840]  You call the Democratic voter drive
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:37.840]  It's in the Washington Times, you name it, they've confirmed Democrats are doing mailers to illegal aliens
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:39.840]  They register them as voters
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:45.840]  And then when they do that, they give them absentee ballots and fill them out for them
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:49.840]  I mean, it is just a criminal takeover
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:52.840]  And Trump was just a shield against this
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:58.840]  And Americans have been trained to hate themselves in sovereignty so much
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:01.840]  That will they even notice this
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:07.840]  When you go back to Time Magazine six months ago and the giant hoax that looked at the little Hispanic girl
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.840]  Didn't matter, her mother had come across the border illegally over and over again
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:13.840]  The Lord knows what she was doing, her own husband said it was dangerous
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  Came across a hundred miles of desert
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:18.840]  She shows up, no one knows who her mom is, her mom says it's her mom
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.840]  They never separate them, they lie and they show Trump looking down the little girl
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:27.840]  Not the barbarism of the coyotes, the smugglers, not all the rape and murder of women and children
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:32.840]  Now, it's projected on Trump as a lying enemy, Time Magazine
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:35.840]  And then that's the opening salvo the war
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:41.840]  Let us do this, don't stop anybody
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  Don't stop anybody
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.840]  Or
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  You are me and little kids
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.840]  Think about that
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:50:58.840]  Think about that
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:02.840]  Capital Switchboard, everyone needs to call the Capital Switchboard
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:05.840]  This is an invasion and they've trained us to accept it
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:08.840]  And now they're going to collapse the third world in the West
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:11.840]  That's the UN World Government Plan
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:14.840]  You know the enemy's plan, you know how they're doing it
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:19.840]  21st century warfare using huge third world populations that have been deindustrialized
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:24.840]  Enslaved, dumbed down, controlled, and then their media all tells them
[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:26.840]  They're all rum of the IMF and World Bank and globalist
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:31.840]  Now's your time to come into Europe, over 10 million the last five years
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:35.840]  Shame footage, Europe, just like yours, go ahead and show Europe
[02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:39.840]  For radio listeners, huge columns flooding in, direct
[02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  And once they get there, the rape, the murder, because that's what they were doing when they came from
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:48.840]  Because there wasn't civilization there and they get there
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:51.840]  And they're signed up to vote by the liberals and they're the swing vote
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:55.840]  There's the Democratic Party voter registration drive
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:51:59.840]  Happening live right now on the border of Mexico and Guatemala
[02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:05.840]  On the border of Central America and North America happening now
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:08.840]  And then they go to the little hotel on by the old Italian man
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:13.840]  Your hotel's over, we're moving African migrants in here, no payment
[02:52:13.840 --> 02:52:17.840]  And then the police sit back and smile and look down at him
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:21.840]  Because this is our plan and we've been paid to be the traders
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:24.840]  And we're gonna do it!
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.840]  Capital Switchboard 202-224-3121
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:32.840]  Call your local offices, they're out there campaigning
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:37.840]  Go to their campaign events, get in their faces, say how dare you do this you monster
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:42.840]  How dare you have a wall around your house, we have a video of Nancy Pelosi and everybody else with their walls
[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:47.840]  White House Switchboard 202-456-1414
[02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:50.840]  I don't give numbers out very often, do I?
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:55.840]  202-456-1414, call the White House
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.840]  Go to the Trump rally in Houston for Ted Cruz coming up
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:03.840]  Make this the issue because Trump's on target
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:08.840]  But my god, it's gonna take major border surveillance
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:13.840]  This is UN directed and it's expensive to grab these people and to find out who they are
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:18.840]  They don't have paperwork and ship them back and they're trying to just overflow us so we capitulate and we give up
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:22.840]  This is a military attack
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:25.840]  Now we've actually got a video here, don't we?
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:31.840]  Showing Democrats, this is from dummy crats, the Diamond and Silk are putting out dummy crats
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:35.840]  Showing how Democrats have all these walls around their houses and how they live in the widest areas
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:38.840]  But they want your borders open
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:43.840]  I mean, my god, folks, the media kept saying 2000, I knew it would be way bigger because I saw what happened in Europe
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:49.840]  They'd bring them in 50,000 at a time and then they'd take them to villages of 100, 200 people and say a thousand now live here
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:52.840]  And it's literal hell
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:58.840]  Because they're not given jobs, they're not given the future, they're just there to be a political time bomb
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:00.840]  Offered a bunch of free stuff
[02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:02.840]  You're witnessing reality
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:07.840]  This isn't a science fiction movie, this isn't Soylent Green, it's not THX 1138
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:11.840]  This is UN invasion, but it's not blue helmets
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:15.840]  The good old boys always said, if I see blue helmets, oh, no
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:20.840]  It's a bunch of people already sucked dry by the globalists, already sucked dry by the UN
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:28.840]  They've always lived in armored fortresses and had third world people trimming the grass with scissors like slaves and sex slavery and everything else they do
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:34.840]  And then once they've sucked the country dry, they then exploit it as the next domino to take down your country
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:40.840]  And the only country standing against it before was Russia, now it's the United States
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:48.840]  And this is the reality, God help everyone because this is it, this is the main attack on America
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:50.840]  Let's go to that diamond and silk piece
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:58.840]  When it comes to the tolerant left, they will tolerate just about anything, even their own hypocrisy
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:03.840]  Publicly, they are all against building a wall for our borders
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:10.840]  But take a look at their estates, while their houses are tucked away behind their picket fences and gates
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:16.840]  We will not build a wall
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:20.840]  You can put that wall up as physically as possible
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:24.840]  Then why don't we put up a wall with a Canadian border, there's a lot of foreigners over there too
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:33.840]  To put a wall there is to, in my view, ineffective, too expensive, almost immoral
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  You can't just put walls up all around America
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:42.840]  So there's dummy crats, why don't you show the Vatican
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:46.840]  Folks, conservatives keep joking around being too nice about this
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:50.840]  This isn't a joke, they're not environmental wackos, they're not lettuce wackos
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:54.840]  They are globalists and they mean business
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:57.840]  They're not playing games, they know how to conquer
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:03.840]  They've got six plus billion people falling apart, collapsing
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:08.840]  And they're going to use them as weapons against you and your family, period
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:12.840]  If you're a radio listener, now's the time to take this live feed and email to everybody
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:15.840]  And text message it to everybody and take action
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:20.840]  America has been invaded, and I'm going to tell you, we don't have the crew
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:25.840]  I want to cover Trump coming to Texas, I want to have people constantly covering the open border
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:30.840]  We don't have it, if I had the funds, I would put five reporters on the border
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:34.840]  I would have five reporters following Trump everywhere, we've got two reporters doing it
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:39.840]  We need you to buy product now at infowarstore.com and a lot of it

[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:36.840]  It is a living hell, and it's all being directed by George Soros and the UN
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:40.840]  And it's in the news it is, we are under UN invasion

[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:15.840]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:20.840]  That everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:27.840]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:32.840]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:35.840]  To tell people by the local stations you're listening to
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:42.840]  So bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:59:42.840 --> 03:00:09.840]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning
[03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:30.840]  I feel so good, I feel so numb, yeah
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:39.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 23 years, and I've never seen anything like it
[03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:44.840]  It's even worse than the implosion of Europe and the Middle East pouring in our UN direction
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:54.840]  We have just witnessed a giant UN army smash Mexican defenses and overrun their wall and gates
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:01:04.840]  Flying the Honduran, the Guatemalan, the Brazilian, the Venezuelan flags screaming
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:10.840]  We are coming to take the north with the leftist and the UN directing it
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:18.840]  It's in Fox News AP that the UN is in full command directing them and marching them at the United States
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:27.840]  Holy Toledo Batman, this is unbelievable
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:33.840]  I'm going to post these live videos to infowars.com and when I say you better email them and you better text them
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:38.840]  and you better get them out, you better tell folks about the stations we're watching or listening to
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:44.840]  They just show a little girl who was never taken from her mom who her mom brought her over 100 miles of deadly desert
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:48.840]  coming in illegally, never even separated to show Trump over the little girl
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:55.840]  That's the calling card, you don't stop open borders, the left says we want ice abolished, we don't want any border
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:03.840]  My God, we need a moat with alligators, we need a 100 foot wall, we need helicopters
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:10.840]  I mean, this is the United Nations, it'd be one thing if a bio weapon got released or there was a plague
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:15.840]  Everyone's starving down there and then they came north, it'd be a big enough problem, but we'd treat it humanitarian
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:23.840]  This is United Nations directed everywhere they go, they live behind big walls, they have slaves trimming their yards
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:33.840]  literally with scissors, sex slavery, all of it and it's the admitted UN plan to smash national sovereignty
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:38.840]  With the 10 million Islamics they brought it already into Europe and red carpeted them everything free
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:43.840]  Now they've got, I mean they kept saying 2,000, I look at the numbers, it's tens of thousands
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:53.840]  And this is just the phalanx, the attack formation breaking down the walls, breaking down the border, breaking down the gate
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:03:00.840]  Flooding in, thousands of U.S. bound illegals stormed Guatemala, Mexico border under UN command video
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:07.840]  So let you know you heard it here first, this is UN directed publicly, it's an invasion
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:12.840]  The United States has already been invaded by the United Nations in probing attacks
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:20.840]  This is the next big push, Europe, Hungary, Austria have declared emergencies, manned their troops four to five fences
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:25.840]  because a wave even bigger started hitting this month as well
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:33.840]  Good God, and the same demoralizers are teaching your five-year-old son they're a girl and your five-year-old daughter they're a boy
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:40.840]  This is psychological warfare, big tech, the big banks, the UN, this is the robber baron war
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:48.840]  They don't want a first country status, they don't want middle classes, they don't want a first world, they want slaves and elites
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:57.840]  And there is the giant beginning army marching in with pride to seize the wealth of the north
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:05.840]  To seize the wealth of the UN, the real colonizers have now reversed the colonization and said you will colonize the north
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:13.840]  But you're not going to colonize anything, once you get here you'll be put in squalor and controlled as a weapon system of the Democrats
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:18.840]  indoctrinated and prepared for political control and conquest
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:22.840]  This is the new war, this is the 21st century attack
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:33.840]  This is the United Nations invasion of North America with Mexican defenses completely smashed
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.840]  Saying that they would send troops down to stop it
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:48.840]  Unless the United States invades Mexico this will intensify or we must mobilize the Army, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the local police departments, everything
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:53.840]  and start cracking down on this invasion
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:58.840]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:07.840]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate
[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:12.840]  People say why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground
[03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:15.840]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:20.840]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:24.840]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[03:05:24.840 --> 03:05:30.840]  and if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWords.com
[03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:35.840]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:38.840]  We have huge sales at InfoWords.com right now
[03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:45.840]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market
[03:05:45.840 --> 03:05:49.840]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Global may win
[03:05:49.840 --> 03:06:15.840]  This is InfoWords Darkest Hour. With your support, I'm counting on you
[03:06:15.840 --> 03:06:27.840]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:35.840]  The United Nations has officially invaded Mexico and has an army marching north of tens of thousands
[03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:39.840]  The other attacks were probes, even Fox News, CNN admit
[03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:46.840]  Oh, it's UN Run, the UN Refugee High Court says that there are no borders except at the UN
[03:06:46.840 --> 03:06:49.840]  There are no walls except at the UN, the Nancy Pelosi House
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:52.840]  And it's coming out of the Washington Times, you name it
[03:06:52.840 --> 03:06:58.840]  Even in Texas, they are sending voter registration and absentee ballots to illegal aliens
[03:06:58.840 --> 03:07:06.840]  Citizen is already checked for them and they are voting Democrat in mass
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:09.840]  So Mexico deployed officers to the southern border to block migrants
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:16.840]  Head of the US, they overran, pulled the gates down and flooded in in incredibly dramatic footage
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:19.840]  This is not, see, everything's been a buildup
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:21.840]  Like first they ban me and then they ban everybody
[03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:27.840]  Or first they, you know, have smaller migrant caravans and getting on the trains and coming up
[03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:33.840]  And Mexico turns a blind eye and now it's tens of thousands UN controlled, organized officially
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:37.840]  This is the takeover operation
[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:41.840]  And again, they just think now we'll go to sleep, it's no big deal
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:51.840]  No, this is the UN, this is George Soros, this is the UN Refugee Councils and all these other groups
[03:07:51.840 --> 03:07:57.840]  Here it is, Fox News, US and Mexican officials have agreed on a plan to handle the approaching migrant caravan
[03:07:57.840 --> 03:07:59.840]  Making their way up from Central America
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:04.840]  A senior administration official told Fox News, under the deal which was developed over the course of several months
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:10.840]  Mexico requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees establish shelters along the southern border with Central America
[03:08:10.840 --> 03:08:15.840]  Which of course they double crossed, massed their force and invaded
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:21.840]  Mexican ambassador to the US, Geronimo Gutierrez, elaborate on the request
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:26.840]  And it goes on, UN to establish shelters at Mexico's southern border
[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:32.840]  And that was all the faint, now the invasion tearing down the gates begins
[03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:41.840]  I mean you are witnessing it and then the footage, when they stream up the road for a mile, well over 10,000 people
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:50.840]  And then the feed cuts, and I looked almost no coverage in the United States of this incredibly dramatic footage
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:54.840]  And then as soon as they get here, chip on the shoulder
[03:08:54.840 --> 03:08:59.840]  You call it when gates are knocked down on a border with people screaming, waving their nation's flags
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:07.840]  You call it an enemy army, but because the UN uses giant third world populations and little girls as their fronts
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:13.840]  You're supposed to stand down and slit your family's own throat
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:18.840]  Just like the censorship, just like all the tyranny, just like them saying Trump's getting ready to be violent to the media
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:27.840]  For violence, 18 days out, they're pulling out the stops and Joel Gilbert, investigative journalist, best-selling documentary filmmaker
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:35.840]  He got mailed in Spanish, an absentee ballot, so it's on like Donkey Kong
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:42.840]  And he's going to show you right now, Texas, they're busting Democrats, voting on the names of dead people everywhere
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:46.840]  Or people in nursing homes, they've got databases, they mean business
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:51.840]  They're getting indicted, but they don't care, because they're a bunch of losers
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:57.840]  And this is their victory, their consciousness is if they could mount America's head on the wall
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:04.840]  They could finally be somebody
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:09.840]  And of course all these idiots being used by Soros and the globalist in the UN, look at that footage
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:12.840]  Put that on the front screen please
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:20.840]  It's unspeakable and now this will be shown all over the world and it will be invade, invade, invade, invade
[03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:28.840]  Just like communism or globalism takes over a country, sucks it dry, then exploits it as the next domino to take over the next country
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:36.840]  That is the doctrine of the globalist, the ultra-rich using communism in third world populations as their army
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:43.840]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:49.840]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to infoworks.com, but more importantly, you've got to grab these live feeds and email them and text them
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:54.840]  Did you hear America got invaded? You are now the modern Paul Revere
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:11:06.840]  But instead of saying to arms, to arms the Red Codes are coming, to arms, to arms the British are coming, wanted by land, to it by sea, to information warfare now
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:10.840]  They censored and made these bold moves because they're going for a broke
[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:16.840]  They're going to stage the false flags, they're going to have any if I go to members of Congress or the Supreme Court and kill their families
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:20.840]  They'll just be the cover, there you're about to see the real revolution
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:23.840]  100 years after the Bolshevik Resolution
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:32.840]  100 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, you're about to see the very same globalist bankers and their great-grandchildren making their move on America
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:39.840]  And the world, this is it, it's happening, it's real, you're seeing it happen
[03:11:39.840 --> 03:11:44.840]  Oh, Mexico works for the U.N. We're just going to mask this group here and we'll work with them
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:50.840]  And as soon as Trump says, I'm sending troops, they go, we can't mask the group anymore
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:53.840]  We've got tens of thousands, launch the attack!
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:12:00.840]  And of course it wasn't 2000, it's tens of thousands and tens of thousands more with those gates blown wide open
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:06.840]  All of it military precision, all of it carried out exactly as we knew they'd do it
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:10.840]  All of it on Infowars.com right now
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:14.840]  So you heard it here first, but God forbid anybody tweeted it out, you might get banned on Twitter
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:17.840]  You'll get banned later, or Facebook
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:27.840]  You saw the real invasion, October 19, 2018, 18 days out from the election, you saw the beginning
[03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:31.840]  You saw way beyond what's happened to Europe
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:36.840]  Because most of the migrants have to get through Turkey and other areas and it's not totally open
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:42.840]  But Latin America is open, one continuous land bridge straight into El Norte
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:48.840]  And the left waiting to take them in and take hammers and chip both their shoulders
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:52.840]  And radicalize them into an anti-white ideology
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:12:57.840]  And lower the wages and sack the country just like Venezuela
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:00.840]  Joining us is Joel Gilbert
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:03.840]  Joel, I cannot hype enough that this is our darkest hour
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:07.840]  This is the real deal, this is Soros Revenge
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:11.840]  This is the UN's revenge, it's Junker's revenge
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:14.840]  It is the globalist operation writ large
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:18.840]  And I don't know how we get people to understand how serious this is
[03:13:18.840 --> 03:13:22.840]  But I will tell you, it doesn't mean I'm going to save the world myself
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:25.840]  But we're going to the border now, and we're going to face this
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:29.840]  Because this is our country under total assault
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:34.840]  Well, I got a big shock in the mail just two days ago
[03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:41.840]  I get a mail-in ballot, vote by mail, vota por correo, bolota oficial
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:44.840]  Official ballot, I didn't ask for a mail-in ballot
[03:13:44.840 --> 03:13:49.840]  And when you open it up, you've got a ballot that's half in Spanish
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:52.840]  It says right here, bolota oficial
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:55.840]  Bolota oficial and half the thing is in Spanish
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:14:00.840]  The thing is designed for Spanish speakers as well as English speakers
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:03.840]  And I didn't even ask, I didn't ask for this
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:06.840]  So you can imagine that they're mailing out
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:11.840]  Millions and millions of these ballots all over the state
[03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:13.840]  And that probably happens everywhere in the country
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:16.840]  And this is a program that the Democrats have been pushing
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:18.840]  Is vote by mail, voting advance
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:21.840]  And they've been registering illegals for some time
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.840]  There's a clip called, I call it early vote
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:27.840]  Maybe we can show that from my, there's no place like Utopia Film
[03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:29.840]  Go ahead and roll that
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:31.840]  The illegal immigrants vote
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:34.840]  Yes, they do vote, they do, yes
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:35.840]  How's that possible?
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:38.840]  Well, it's very easy, you go to these supermarkets
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:40.840]  And you see these people that are registering people to vote
[03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:42.840]  And they can't even speak English
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:45.840]  And they sign them up to register to vote
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:47.840]  They get mail-in ballots
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:48.840]  And then they just mail them back off
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:50.840]  And there's no way of tracking them
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:52.840]  Here in Illinois, we've got early vote
[03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:57.840]  And in a lot of the states, in Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and Colorado
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:14:59.840]  You do it on your own time, and it's really convenient
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:02.840]  We're recruiting and training Latino organizers
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:06.840]  We're holding Latino voter registration drives across America
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:10.840]  We will transform this nation
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:12.840]  This is, it's all over the news
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:14.840]  Illegals are getting early ballots in their voting
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:16.840]  I mean, they finally did it
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:17.840]  That's it, right there
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:20.840]  All you gotta do is mail it in, there's no way to track them
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:25.840]  Imagine all these illegals, let's say 10, 15, 20 people live in a house
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:28.840]  And they get 10 or 20 of these in the mail
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:30.840]  And people just fill them out
[03:15:30.840 --> 03:15:31.840]  There's no way to track it
[03:15:31.840 --> 03:15:35.840]  So this is the way that their Democrats are manipulating the system
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.840]  Imagine if you have a child in a school
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:41.840]  And they bring in 20 people that don't speak English
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:42.840]  How's that gonna work out?
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:44.840]  Well, and we can show the footage
[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:46.840]  There's a giant Democrat voter registration drive
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:48.840]  A giant U.N. run invasion
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:50.840]  And we either grow up and say, no to it or we're done
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:55.840]  Healthcare reform is confusing
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:57.840]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:00.840]  Keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:03.840]  Navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:07.840]  Control your own healthcare costs and choices with Liberty Health Share
[03:16:07.840 --> 03:16:09.840]  Liberty Health Share is not insurance

[03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:21.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[03:17:21.840 --> 03:17:23.840]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:25.840]  When they tried to seize my mother's house
[03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:26.840]  I sued the IRS in one
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:29.840]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:31.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:33.840]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:35.840]  They thought might never be solved
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:36.840]  I can help you too
[03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:39.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day
[03:17:39.840 --> 03:17:41.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case
[03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:43.840]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX

[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:20.840]  For heavy metals, alkalinity and pH
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:22.840]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:25.840]  Unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:29.840]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:33.840]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:40.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:42.840]  Raises the pH of the water
[03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:44.840]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:48.840]  And acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:51.840]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system
[03:18:51.840 --> 03:19:14.840]  Will purify it
[03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:25.840]  In the next video, we'll be talking about
[03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:29.840]  How to get rid of the natural caffeine boost

[03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:21.840]  For more than the insane videos we've seen out in Europe
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:23.840]  That was also U.N. run
[03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:25.840]  Where they advertise everything's free
[03:20:25.840 --> 03:20:27.840]  Free welfare, women housing
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:29.840]  They have math people on the border
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:31.840]  They blow the border open
[03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:33.840]  And the U.N. brings you in
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:35.840]  Tens of thousands, it's got to be tens of thousands
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:38.840]  Just crushed the border defenses in Mexico
[03:20:38.840 --> 03:20:41.840]  Raging forward, waving their foreign flags
[03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:44.840]  That they would conquer the United States
[03:20:44.840 --> 03:20:48.840]  Publicly run its in the news by the U.N.
[03:20:48.840 --> 03:20:50.840]  And then you have the Democratic Party saying
[03:20:50.840 --> 03:20:52.840]  How dare we even have eyes
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:54.840]  No borders, no nothing
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:56.840]  You must open your country up
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:20:58.840]  You must let us have your children
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:00.840]  You must let us run your life
[03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:02.840]  This is a 21st century takeover
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:04.840]  And it's all over even mainstream news
[03:21:04.840 --> 03:21:06.840]  That everyone's being mailed in Spanish ballots
[03:21:06.840 --> 03:21:08.840]  That are already Czech citizen
[03:21:08.840 --> 03:21:10.840]  They never even asked for
[03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:12.840]  That they registered in some dead person's name
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:14.840]  That you fill out and send back
[03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:17.840]  So this is the country's darkest hour
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:18.840]  Trump was just an emergency beach
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:19.840]  He had to try to stop this
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.840]  And we need that wall
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:23.840]  We need that because the third world's collapsing
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:25.840]  And the very U.N. and others
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:27.840]  That have helped exacerbate that
[03:21:27.840 --> 03:21:29.840]  Are now organizing
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:31.840]  These poor, ignorant folks
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:34.840]  With an average, you know, like third grade degree
[03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:36.840]  To come into the country
[03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:38.840]  So the president
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:40.840]  Must declare a national emergency
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:42.840]  If you don't think your border collapsing
[03:21:42.840 --> 03:21:43.840]  Is a national emergency, it is
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:45.840]  Our southern border's already collapsed
[03:21:45.840 --> 03:21:47.840]  The president tried to stabilize it
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:49.840]  And enemies within have tried to block it
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:51.840]  If you don't think this is a national emergency
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:53.840]  You're insane
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:55.840]  And so it's under the constitution
[03:21:55.840 --> 03:21:57.840]  That the president and the military control the borders
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:21:59.840]  We need a good hundred thousand troops
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:01.840]  On the border now
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:03.840]  And we need to
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:05.840]  Organize the county and city police
[03:22:05.840 --> 03:22:07.840]  With emergency funding and
[03:22:07.840 --> 03:22:09.840]  Everybody involved in infrastructure
[03:22:09.840 --> 03:22:11.840]  And we have to ship every single person back
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:13.840]  Because this is a PR stunt
[03:22:13.840 --> 03:22:15.840]  A propaganda stunt
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:17.840]  Just like Europe to show it
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:19.840]  And they have the U.N. and the
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:21.840]  Democrat shoot videos, look at my house
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.840]  Look at my bitches, you know, I'm raping
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:25.840]  I'm doing this, that's what the Islamists do
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:27.840]  And everybody else sees that in the third world
[03:22:27.840 --> 03:22:29.840]  And comes in
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:31.840]  They're almost all military aged men
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:33.840]  So just as Europe
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:35.840]  This was organized there
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:37.840]  And the mass raping
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:39.840]  And all of it is just
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:41.840]  Going to intensify
[03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:43.840]  So you have to understand ladies and gentlemen
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:45.840]  The lawless hellhole scariness
[03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:47.840]  Of the worst third world countries
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:49.840]  And the most poor people
[03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:51.840]  Now pouring in
[03:22:51.840 --> 03:22:53.840]  Promised by U.N. propaganda
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:55.840]  And Hollywood propaganda
[03:22:55.840 --> 03:22:57.840]  That this was all going to happen
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:59.840]  And now it's here
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:01.840]  And now it's going to happen
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:03.840]  The carjackings, the rapes, the murders
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:05.840]  The bombings, the collapsed countries
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:07.840]  This is 21st century warfare
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:09.840]  This is the attempt to take America down
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:11.840]  This is it
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  Hours and hours and hours
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:15.840]  The footage of
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:17.840]  Giant columns of people
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:19.840]  Bigger than what's slammed into Europe
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:21.840]  Organized by Soros
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:23.840]  Because he doesn't think we have the will
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:25.840]  Or the strength to say no
[03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:27.840]  And he thinks that all of you
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:29.840]  Just think this is entertainment
[03:23:29.840 --> 03:23:31.840]  So you're not going to call talk radio
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:33.840]  They'll just be like, oh do you see the migrants
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:35.840]  Oh yeah, is Trump right to build a wall
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:37.840]  I don't know, I don't want anybody to talk
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:39.840]  Bad about me, I don't really like Trump
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:41.840]  I mean I, even though you secretly do
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:43.840]  You're crazy if you don't realize
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:45.840]  What this is, this is
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:47.840]  The Silicon Valley censorship plan
[03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:49.840]  This is the globalist program
[03:23:49.840 --> 03:23:51.840]  This is the assault
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:53.840]  This is the war, this is it, it's here
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:23:57.840]  35 million illegal aliens in this country
[03:23:57.840 --> 03:23:59.840]  A million plus legal a year
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:01.840]  Ellis Island, you came in 3 months to 6 months
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:03.840]  Quarantine to make sure you didn't have any diseases
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:05.840]  Meanwhile
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.840]  We're told, you just got
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  Open your border, typhus exploding
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.840]  Bubonic plague exploding
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:15.840]  All sorts of other diseases
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.840]  We've now got leprosy spreading again
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.840]  And scabies
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  And fleas, and ticks
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  And bedbugs
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840]  And it doesn't matter though
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:27.840]  Oh, I've got my Honduran flag
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  I've got my Guatemalan flag
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:31.840]  I've got my Venezuelan flag
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:33.840]  I'm going to come up there
[03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:35.840]  And I'm going to go to Trump rallies and wave them
[03:24:35.840 --> 03:24:37.840]  And say, we hate Trump and we hate America
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:39.840]  But damn it, we love your welfare
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:41.840]  And give us everything right now
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:47.840]  Till Gebra's going to take over
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:49.840]  But I'm going to be honest with you
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:51.840]  I'm supposed to go pick my girls up from school
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.840]  The day I told them I'd take them to
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:55.840]  Early dinner
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:57.840]  Oh daddy, please, please say you will
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:24:59.840]  But I almost, they have no future
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:01.840]  If I don't stay here, do they?
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:03.840]  I mean, I need to be on the phone
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:05.840]  I need to be calling Congress
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:07.840]  I need to be text messaging Tucker Carlson
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:09.840]  I need to be, this is the UN invasion
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:11.840]  Of America
[03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:13.840]  Everything else was a probe
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:15.840]  You know it, you've seen it, it's outrageous
[03:25:15.840 --> 03:25:17.840]  They think we're in a coma, awaken
[03:25:19.840 --> 03:25:21.840]  Realize what's happening
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:25.840]  Realize the UN plan
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:27.840]  Realize the UN program
[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:29.840]  Realize how they operate
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:31.840]  With giant masses
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:33.840]  Of starving people they control
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:35.840]  And they're not trying to bring them here to help them
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:37.840]  It's cold blooded and it's shit
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:41.840]  So I want you to call Congress
[03:25:41.840 --> 03:25:43.840]  I put the number out earlier
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:45.840]  And I want you to call Capitol Hill
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:47.840]  I want you to call talk radio
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:49.840]  And I want you to say, go to infowars.com
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:51.840]  Go to RT.com
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  Go see the footage, this is almost nowhere
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:55.840]  This is a UN invasion
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:57.840]  It's run by the UN
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:59.840]  The UN says they're doing it
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:01.840]  The Democratic Party's involved
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:03.840]  And at a certain point
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:05.840]  It's a lot easier than just blocking
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:07.840]  That southern border
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  To arrest Nancy Pelosi
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:11.840]  And Michael Moore and all the people saying
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:13.840]  Kill Trump, arrest him, send the military in
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:15.840]  They're the ones directing at the Ford Foundation
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:17.840]  The Carnegie Foundation
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:19.840]  The UN, the Rockefellers
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:21.840]  Trump ought to march the US military
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:23.840]  To the UN and shut it down
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:25.840]  And kick all those traitors out of there
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:27.840]  And say, we know we're under foreign globalist attack
[03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:29.840]  Because the UN was shut up by robber barons
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:31.840]  To take over the world and take over America
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:33.840]  The UN is done!
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:35.840]  Soros is done!
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:37.840]  Or we're done!
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:39.840]  Now you choose to side
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:43.840]  Or get down on your damn knees
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:45.840]  To political correctness that doesn't mean crap
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:47.840]  You think being censored or attacked
[03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:49.840]  By globalist traitors and all these yes men
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:51.840]  That don't even get power out of selling people out
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:53.840]  They're the biggest shmuck
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:55.840]  Shump, sucker, douche bags
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:26:57.840]  The plan it ever saw
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:26:59.840]  And ever will see
[03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:03.840]  On freedom fells, the best men
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:05.840]  Rot in filthy jails
[03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:07.840]  And those that try to appease appease
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:09.840]  Are hung by those they tried to please
[03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:15.840]  Good God
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:17.840]  We're in a crisis
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:19.840]  Government wants more people on food stamps and welfare
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:21.840]  Venezuela is collapsing
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:23.840]  Causing a chain reaction
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:25.840]  Of seven nations to El Norte
[03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:27.840]  And it's here
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:29.840]  And even if you were a migrant
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:31.840]  That just got here and has prosperity
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:33.840]  This will bring down your prosperity
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:35.840]  Like a black hole
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.840]  So everyone already here better understand
[03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:39.840]  You're about to watch the prosperity
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:41.840]  Go bye bye
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:43.840]  Right as Trump was trying to reboot it for everybody
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:45.840]  And I'll say it again
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:47.840]  I'm gonna up our game
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:49.840]  In the fight

[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:53.840]  We need you to thank the stations that are carrying us

[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:19.840]  Begun and it's officially
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:21.840]  Run by them and this is it
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:25.840]  We have to make this the number one story
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:27.840]  And Trump has to move, he seems to do something
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:29.840]  Big on the border before, I know he's gonna
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:31.840]  Put 50,000 troops after the election
[03:28:31.840 --> 03:28:33.840]  The you in's got spies in your

[03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:37.840]  The attack, America is

[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:19.760]  every day. Daniel, welcome back.
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:21.080]  Thank you so much.
[03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:27.880]  Okay. First, I want to talk about your piece called The Plot Against the Supreme Court.
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:33.680]  You wrote that the Kavanaugh hearing, Kavanaugh was not even the real target. The target
[03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:40.760]  was the entire Supreme Court as part of a plot against the United States. Can you explain?
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:45.920]  Well, right now, Trump is in office. Presidential incumbents tend to win reelection, which means
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:50.200]  even if the Democrats fulfill their fantasies of taking the House and the Senate, they're
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:53.880]  not going to be able to get their hands on the Supreme Court for quite a while, which
[03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:58.560]  means they are attacking it as an institution. And it's not just about the current election
[03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:03.720]  prospects because they're thinking about the long term. The long term is the Supreme Court
[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:09.120]  is there to protect the Constitution. At least that's what it should be doing. And increasingly,
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:12.720]  they don't believe in the Constitution. The radical F wants to destroy the Constitution
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:16.680]  and wants to destroy the rule of law. And so it used Kavanaugh to go after the Supreme
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:20.320]  Court. It's still legitimizing the court. They didn't actually want to keep Kavanaugh
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:24.040]  off the court and said it wanted the Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court because that serves as
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:29.040]  a pretext for pushing impeachment, for pushing investigations of a justice. And once you can
[03:35:29.040 --> 03:35:33.000]  set the precedent with one justice, you can do with other justices.
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:41.200]  Okay. So what is the difference in the worldview of a conservative versus a liberal, how they
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:44.280]  view a Supreme Court justice and what their role is?
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:49.160]  Well, the very basic idea is that the Supreme Court, from the conservative standpoint, is
[03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:53.160]  supposed to protect constitutional limits. It's supposed to limit the power of government.
[03:35:53.160 --> 03:35:56.840]  Not everybody thinks that way. Not everybody does that way. But that's the essence of originalism.
[03:35:56.840 --> 03:36:01.880]  It limits the power of government. And Kavanaugh is an originalist. Now, on the left, the Supreme
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:07.120]  Court is not an institution for limiting government power. It's an institution for expanding government
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:10.760]  power. These are the people who believe that there is a living constitution and the living
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:15.920]  constitution is whatever any judge at any given time wants to say that it is. And this
[03:36:15.920 --> 03:36:22.040]  is how they can bring entire bodies of law into being by just insisting that this is
[03:36:22.040 --> 03:36:25.680]  now the current standard. For example, with abortion, they will discover that this is
[03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:29.880]  now the law of the land. Now, there's no actual legislative basis for this. There's no constitutional
[03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:35.960]  basis for this. It's tyranny. It's nine men, just nine men and nine women deciding this
[03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:40.320]  is what we want to do. This is what we're going to do. And we are the ones who determine
[03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:45.160]  the law of the land. Now, this is a very scary situation because nobody elected these people.
[03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:48.840]  Now, it's one thing when judges, when justices actually limit the power of government, when
[03:36:48.840 --> 03:36:53.120]  they serve as a check on the power of government. But this is the exact opposite situation.
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:57.920]  It's a situation where they expand the power of government without any known limits.
[03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:05.400]  Okay, so we just saw a graphic of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She can barely keep her head up.
[03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:11.480]  She's 85, Stephen Bader, 80. How do you think the left is going to behave if one of them
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:17.560]  retires or passes away during these next two years of Trump's first term?
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:21.280]  Everything we've seen with the Kavanaugh, the hysteria, the mob violence will be nothing
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:26.640]  compared to that. They will be prepared to escalate the civil war because remember, Kavanaugh
[03:37:26.640 --> 03:37:30.560]  is replacing Justice Kennedy. Justice Kennedy was a Republican appointee. He wasn't very
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:36.320]  conservative, but he was a Republican. If we actually talk about replacing radical
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:40.960]  leftists on the court with conservatives, they will go absolutely crazy because this
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:45.240]  is a fundamental threat to their power. So they will plot all the stops. If you thought
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:49.440]  that the Kavanaugh hearings were crazy, this will be a whole other level.
[03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:56.200]  Okay. And why do you think the attack on Kavanaugh was based on gender? Their usual
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:01.640]  favorite attack is race. If you don't believe in socialism, you're a racist. Why did they
[03:38:01.640 --> 03:38:07.520]  go after him on gender to radicalize gender at this moment in time?
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:11.720]  That's completely a political strategy. So black people don't tend to vote in the term
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:16.520]  elections. Women, suburban women, that's their major target, do actually vote. So from the
[03:38:16.520 --> 03:38:20.960]  very beginning, even before this Ford nonsense came out, they were targeting women. They
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:26.360]  were pushing the idea that Kavanaugh would overturn Rover's weight. They were pushing
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:29.760]  abortion. So from the very beginning, they were targeting suburban women because that's
[03:38:29.760 --> 03:38:35.200]  who they were hoping to turn out in the interim elections. If this had actually been happening
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:40.120]  around the national election, they would have absolutely accused Kavanaugh of being a racist.
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:44.080]  But this is a cynical political strategy. And that actually tells us that the whole rape
[03:38:44.080 --> 03:38:50.480]  accusations, it was a cynical political strategy from the very beginning.
[03:38:50.480 --> 03:38:56.400]  Is this really an attempt by the Democrats? And is their strategy maybe a long-term one
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:01.960]  to delegitimize the institution of the Supreme Court itself? And if so, why?
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:07.920]  Absolutely. So as I've said, the Supreme Court is the body that's the hardest to change
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:13.480]  by the kinds of voter pro tactics that the Democrats prefer. To get a Supreme Court justice
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:17.280]  in, it has to go through the White House. It has to go through the Senate. The Democrats
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:21.040]  might be able to take the House, but they're very unlikely to take the Senate. So they're
[03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:25.680]  going after the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court is hard to change and it's absolutely
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:30.400]  a threat to them because their project is big government. And the Supreme Court, a conservative
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:35.400]  Supreme Court is a block on the government. The Supreme Court is now as conservative as
[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:39.720]  it has been in a very long time. So it's a major threat. And they've decided to go after
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:41.760]  it in the crudest way possible.
[03:39:41.760 --> 03:39:49.280]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a couple of calls with, start with Zach in Kentucky. Zach,
[03:39:49.280 --> 03:39:57.680]  go ahead, you're on InfoWars. Is Zach still with us?
[03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:01.320]  Hey, I'm here. I'm here. Can you hear me?
[03:40:01.320 --> 03:40:06.080]  Okay. All right. So last caller, various students there. Thank you, Joel, for taking
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:11.680]  my call. I'd just like to talk about the mail-in ballot, like the one that you got.
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:17.360]  I'm here in Kentucky. I live in an apartment complex. And it was, you know, I've got like
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:22.880]  some postcard coming to me with a different gentleman's name on there, but with my address,
[03:40:22.880 --> 03:40:23.880]  of course.
[03:40:23.880 --> 03:40:30.680]  So I fill out return to sender on this postcard to put it back, you know, into my mailbox.
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:36.000]  And before my mailman could come get it the next day, somebody had taken it from my mailbox.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:42.600]  And that would basically mean that the information for that voter has gone through to where this
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:48.800]  gentleman can vote somehow, you know, while claiming that he lives at my address. I just
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:53.520]  thought that was very weird. So I called the board of elections here in Kentucky. They
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:59.760]  didn't seem very, you know, in Frankfurt, they didn't seem to be very, very concerned
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:00.760]  about it.
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:05.200]  All right. Thanks. Thanks for the call. Daniel Greenfield, the voter fraud. You know, I got
[03:41:05.200 --> 03:41:09.680]  one of these in the mail, mail-in ballot. It didn't ask for it. It's half in Spanish.
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:13.760]  How many millions of these are floating around the country to old addresses? And what is
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:17.760]  the vulnerability of the election system to this kind of fraud?
[03:41:17.760 --> 03:41:21.800]  Well, as Zach described, it's actually very common. It's the most common form of voter
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:27.880]  fraud. It was just a major voter fraud ring that used tactics like that to actually cast
[03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:33.160]  possibly thousands of votes. And it very often targets the elderly. It targets people who
[03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:38.440]  are vulnerable or disabled or people who just are easy to manipulate. The elderly are very
[03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:43.080]  common target because they often don't properly pick up their mail or because they ask other
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:47.280]  people to pick up their mail for them. So this is a very common place. We've had a number
[03:41:47.280 --> 03:41:50.800]  of incidents like this. The latest one is in Dallas. And there's no telling just how
[03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:55.560]  big this is on a national scale because every effort to investigate voter fraud, to shut
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:41:58.880]  down voter fraud, has been stymied by the Democrats.
[03:41:58.880 --> 03:42:03.600]  Okay. All right. We're going to have a break in about 30 seconds. We're going to be talking
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:11.560]  about the Khashoggi alleged killing and talk about who he really was. You know, this is
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:17.760]  a, Daniel, this is a form of government controlling other people, controlling its power. We've
[03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:21.920]  experienced that in this country with Obama interfering in the 2012 elections with the
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:29.640]  IRS, interfering 2016 with the FBI, DOJ. The Saudis just do it in a little bit more of
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:36.440]  a brutal form with murder. But we've experienced the government trying to suppress thought
[03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:41.160]  as well as big tech. And we're going to talk about Jamal Khashoggi and Daniel Greenfield's
[03:42:41.160 --> 03:42:48.080]  latest articles because he has written about how Khashoggi was a Muslim brotherhood town
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:53.360]  of Osama bin Laden. We'll be right back.
[03:42:53.360 --> 03:42:58.480]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Info
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:02.960]  Awards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:07.720]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start
[03:43:07.720 --> 03:43:12.480]  a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:17.440]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.440 --> 03:43:22.360]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:27.160]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:32.880]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:38.840]  these brutal scumbags. We'll win. We have huge sales, infowars.com right now. And we're
[03:43:38.840 --> 03:43:42.640]  still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact
[03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:46.640]  we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand

[03:46:08.240 --> 03:46:13.440]  they hammer you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you,
[03:46:13.440 --> 03:46:18.040]  fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it. Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:24.480]  of carriage. Silinium is an electrochemical. It's needed as well in all activity in the

[03:46:56.720 --> 03:47:16.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to
[03:47:16.840 --> 03:47:29.840]  the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Joel Gilbert guest hosting from
[03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:35.520]  the People's Republic of California, where I just got my Spanish and English mail-in
[03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:41.360]  ballot that I didn't ask for, that probably millions of these are floating around. I'm
[03:47:41.360 --> 03:47:46.560]  continuing with Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman journalism fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom
[03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:53.600]  Center. We're going to talk about Jamal Khashoggi. Daniel wrote several series of articles talking
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:59.720]  about the fact that Jamal Khashoggi was a Muslim brotherhood pal of Osama bin Laden.
[03:47:59.720 --> 03:48:05.760]  In fact, in high school, Khashoggi's best friend was Osama bin Laden, and he wrote,
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:13.240]  we are hoping to establish an Islamic state everywhere. Daniel, what has the media missed
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:17.920]  about Khashoggi and why are they avoiding telling the truth about what he is that he's
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:21.320]  not some kind of humanitarian?
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:25.160]  What is this about? Bottom line, this is about regime change. It's the same thing as the
[03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:29.680]  Arab Spring, except this is going to be the Saudi Spring. The media is openly advocating
[03:48:29.680 --> 03:48:35.000]  regime change in Saudi Arabia. They're using Khashoggi's supposed death at, we don't know
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:39.680]  whose hands, to advance this project. So this is not about human rights. It's not about
[03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:43.440]  journalism, despite what the media is saying. Khashoggi was not a journalist. He was a terrorist
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:48.160]  propagandist. For all he worked for the Saudis, he seemed to have been an intel asset. On
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:53.640]  the Saudi side, he was working for Prince Turkey, Mifaisal, who headed Turkey's, I mean,
[03:48:53.640 --> 03:49:00.160]  Saudi Arabia's intel operation. Then he went his own way. He was, as you mentioned, an
[03:49:00.160 --> 03:49:04.320]  old friend of Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden was first setting up al-Qaeda. He actually
[03:49:04.320 --> 03:49:08.800]  called Khashoggi to give him the details. Since then, what Khashoggi's been advancing
[03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:12.640]  is a Muslim Brotherhood takeover of the region. Again, the media is advancing this. It's pushing
[03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:17.240]  this under the guise of human rights, just as it did in Egypt, just as it did in Libya,
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.520]  just as it did in Syria. I thought repeatedly about this. It claimed that those were going
[03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:27.960]  to be secular, liberal governments. They were going to be democratic. Then Egypt, the Muslim
[03:49:27.960 --> 03:49:32.640]  Brotherhood took over. Syria was Muslim Brotherhood in the Islamist and al-Qaeda fighters. In
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:36.560]  Libya, again, it was the Islamist and Muslim Brotherhood fighters, and now it's the murder
[03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:40.760]  of three Americans, actually four Americans in total. So this is the same scam being pulled
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:43.920]  again. The question is, are people going to fall for it?
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:50.160]  Okay. So why was Khashoggi in Turkey? What was he doing there? What were his contacts
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:51.560]  with the Turkish government?
[03:49:51.560 --> 03:49:56.480]  Well, his family is Turkish in origin. Khashoggi is a Turkish name. Originally, they were not
[03:49:56.480 --> 03:50:00.760]  Saudis. They were Turks. And this is very important in the region because your ethnic
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:05.520]  qualities, your ethnic backgrounds, they're very much determined who you are. Now, Turkey's
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:11.120]  being currently being run by a guy named Erdogan. He's an Islamic dictator. He set up a false
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:15.400]  Iraq stock flyer, Fakuh, before it to shut down the last of the political opposition
[03:50:15.400 --> 03:50:19.040]  within this country. So everything that the media is reprinting in the United States comes
[03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:22.600]  from the Turkish media, and the Turkish media is controlled by the Turkish government. Now,
[03:50:22.600 --> 03:50:27.160]  the Turkish government arrested some 300 journalists during this Fakuh. It tortured people. It
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:31.360]  sexually assaulted them. It abused them. The media in the United States hardly said a word
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:33.560]  about that. They did not have a problem with that.
[03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:37.080]  Right now, all these stories that you're hearing, they're supposedly an audio tape that's coming
[03:50:37.080 --> 03:50:40.520]  from the Turkish media, which is coming from the Turkish government. And the Turkish government
[03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:45.160]  has already said that they will not turn over this alleged audio tape to the United States,
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:50.080]  despite claimed by the media here. So everything that we're hearing in the media is being repeated
[03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:54.800]  by the Turkish government. The Turkish government, along with Qatar, along with Iran, is in the
[03:50:54.800 --> 03:50:59.400]  feud with Saudi Arabia. They want to overthrow Saudi Arabia's government for their own reasons,
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:02.560]  and they're trying to enlist us. They're trying to trick us into doing the dirty work for
[03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:08.600]  them, just like they did in Egypt, just like they did in Syria, just like they did in Libya.
[03:51:08.600 --> 03:51:13.440]  Why did the Washington Post hire Khashoggi in the first place? What is their interest
[03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:16.720]  in having him as an alleged journalist?
[03:51:16.720 --> 03:51:20.880]  He was advancing Muslim Brotherhood political agendas, and it's not the first time the Washington
[03:51:20.880 --> 03:51:25.320]  Post was pushing the Arab Spring. It was pushing regime change in Syria and Egypt and Libya.
[03:51:25.320 --> 03:51:30.280]  I could go down the list. It's misreporting events in Yemen and around the region, because
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:34.440]  it has an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood. This is what a lot of the left in the United
[03:51:34.440 --> 03:51:37.880]  States has this alliance, and it's not just the left. It's some people in the Republican
[03:51:37.880 --> 03:51:43.440]  Party, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio have been advancing the Arab Spring in Egypt. They're
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:47.320]  pushing the same thing again in Saudi Arabia. So there are entities, there are political
[03:51:47.320 --> 03:51:51.960]  factions, particularly on the left, that are in bed with the Islamists. They want the Islamists
[03:51:51.960 --> 03:51:57.440]  to take over, and they will use any lie, any scam to make that happen.
[03:51:57.440 --> 03:52:03.640]  What's wrong with our politicians, like Lindsey Graham, immediately fell into the idea and
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:10.240]  demanded all these sanctions against Saudi Arabia? Are they aware of the vulnerability
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:17.320]  of our politicians that just love to try to create policy on behalf of our enemies without
[03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:19.440]  even realizing it?
[03:52:19.440 --> 03:52:23.600]  They know very well, and I know they might be realizing it, but the bottom line is they've
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:28.320]  been at this for a while. These special political interests have burled very deep into Washington,
[03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:33.120]  D.C. They control many of our politicians, and that's why these politicians repeatedly
[03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:38.320]  advance the same political agenda, which is so-called democracy, so-called human rights,
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:42.320]  and it inevitably ends with the Muslim Brotherhood taking over. So they've done this before,
[03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:46.200]  their organizations like the Republican Institute on the Republican side that have been pushing
[03:52:46.200 --> 03:52:50.600]  this and advancing this, and they claim that this is about democracy, but the reality is
[03:52:50.600 --> 03:52:56.760]  democracy is in Turkey, it ends when the Islamists take over, and Khashoggi was not about democracy,
[03:52:56.760 --> 03:53:01.000]  was not about human rights, he was not about a free press, he was about a Muslim Brotherhood
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:05.600]  takeover. That's what he was about, and when the Washington Post with other papers continuing
[03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:09.480]  hysterically advanced the same political agenda, that shows what they want to do. They want
[03:53:09.480 --> 03:53:14.080]  to break up a coalition against Iran, they want regime change in Saudi Arabia, and then
[03:53:14.080 --> 03:53:17.560]  they want regime change throughout the region, because if the Muslim Brotherhood were able
[03:53:17.560 --> 03:53:21.960]  to take over Saudi Arabia and they have that vast wealth in their pockets, they would be
[03:53:21.960 --> 03:53:25.400]  able to implement regime change across the region. One of the reasons that the Muslim
[03:53:25.400 --> 03:53:29.280]  Brotherhood takeover in Egypt failed was that they ran out of money. Egypt does not have
[03:53:29.280 --> 03:53:35.600]  a lot of money on its own. The Saudis actually ended up bailing out Egypt after Morsi, who
[03:53:35.600 --> 03:53:40.080]  was the Muslim Brotherhood leader, was removed. Now, if they actually get their hands on all
[03:53:40.080 --> 03:53:44.320]  that Saudi money and all that oil money, they would be able to take over governments across
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:50.480]  the Middle East. Okay, let's go to a phone call. Let's have Ron in Florida. Ron, go ahead,
[03:53:50.480 --> 03:53:55.320]  you're on Info Wars. Alex Jones show with Daniel Greenfield. Go ahead, Ron.
[03:53:55.320 --> 03:54:03.560]  Yeah, hey, how you doing, guys? I was listening to Alex earlier about the invasion that's
[03:54:03.560 --> 03:54:09.960]  pretty much underway, and being led by the UN, and that has me a little bit concerned,
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:18.880]  especially seeing, I've seen a lot of recent posts regarding a lot of UN hardware already
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:24.040]  here in the United States. And I'm kind of concerned with how many of them fellows coming
[03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:29.600]  up here may not even be. UN soldiers, train operators.
[03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:34.720]  Okay. All right, thanks for the call. Look, Daniel, we've got two things going on three
[03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:39.920]  weeks before the election. We've got a caravan making its way up the coast of Mexico.
[03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:45.920]  To press the immigration issue and to put Trump on the spot, is he going to reject
[03:54:45.920 --> 03:54:51.240]  all these children? And then we've got the press and the media screaming for justice,
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:58.480]  for Khashoggi. What is Trump's dilemma and how can he satisfy these mobs and still persevere?
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:03.720]  As far as Khashoggi goes, you know, the American people elected President Trump, they did not
[03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:07.560]  elect Hillary Clinton, they did not elect Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, they elected Trump
[03:55:07.560 --> 03:55:11.320]  because they liked his foreign policy, which means they don't want another Libyan war,
[03:55:11.320 --> 03:55:15.880]  they don't want another Arab Spring. President Trump needs to stick to his guns and to actually
[03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:19.160]  follow through on his foreign policy, which is no more nation building, no more regime
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:24.480]  change. As far as the caravan goes, now that's actually a very important point and there's
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:28.240]  an easy fix that we could actually do to address that. The reason we have to take all these
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:31.960]  people in when they show up at the border and claim political asylum is because we signed
[03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:36.400]  on to a UN refugee treaty back in the day. This was under LBJ and we were told there
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:40.760]  would be no big deal, it would be mainly symbolic, it's not just symbolic. The treaty is very
[03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:44.520]  dangerous and it means that whenever anybody shows up at the airport at the border and
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:47.960]  they apply for political asylum, we can't just put them on the plane back or we can't
[03:55:47.960 --> 03:55:51.120]  just send them across the border, we have to let them into this country and then process
[03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:56.760]  their claims. If we withdraw from the UN treaty, the UN refugee compact, we can absolutely
[03:55:56.760 --> 03:56:00.160]  change that, we can just actually put up a wall and say, sorry, no, you can't apply
[03:56:00.160 --> 03:56:03.080]  for political asylum, we are not taking applications today.
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:08.400]  Can Trump unilaterally do that or does he need Congress to agree to that?
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:13.000]  He can actually do that. The question is, is he actually going to do that? It has to
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:15.960]  be on the list of priorities, but you know, there are a lot of people around him, there's
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:21.520]  a lot of noise and the Democrats on the left constantly keep making new scandals, new controversies,
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:24.680]  not just in order to attack him but also to distract him, to tie him down because if you
[03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:28.360]  want to tie somebody down, if you want to prevent somebody from getting things done,
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:31.680]  then you harass them, you bewilder them, you throw a thousand different things at them
[03:56:31.680 --> 03:56:33.360]  and that's what's been going on here.
[03:56:33.360 --> 03:56:37.840]  All right, what's your prediction for the midterms, Senate and House?
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:43.760]  Well, the Democrats lost their chance at the Senate when they did the whole cabinet stunt.
[03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:47.560]  They turned off a whole lot of people in red states, turned off a whole lot of men. They
[03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:51.200]  sent a message that they're a party of an angry mob that's just going to destroy somebody's
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:55.960]  life based on absolutely nothing. Now, the House, they spent a whole lot of money, they've,
[03:56:55.960 --> 03:57:00.480]  I believe, raised about a billion dollars on this, so they've, this is going to be the
[03:57:00.480 --> 03:57:04.240]  mother of all midterm elections, they're throwing everything they have at it, but the bottom
[03:57:04.240 --> 03:57:08.960]  line is they're going to depend on turnout and if Republicans, if conservatives, if
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:12.560]  independents actually come out and vote and they say, we don't want this mob, we don't
[03:57:12.560 --> 03:57:16.360]  want our country run by a lynch mob, then the left is not going to win even if they
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:18.000]  have a billion dollars.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:23.080]  Okay, well, for one, I'm going to send in my mail-in ballot. I'm going to fill it out
[03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:27.480]  on the Spanish side just to make a point, but I am going to vote and make sure I get
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:32.400]  this in and everyone should do that if you want to see more jobs and less mob. Daniel
[03:57:32.400 --> 03:57:43.400]  Greenfield, thank you so much for being here. Check him out at FrontageMag.com. Thank you.
