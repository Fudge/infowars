[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  Cash Weighing 363 Tons
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  Loaded On Pallets And Flown On Military Aircraft Funds
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  Those Were Frozen Saddam Assets And The Military Said They Kept
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  Now Get Ready For This This Is Reuters
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  No Record Of It's Dispersal
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  You Want To Talk About An Orgy Of Corruption Evil
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  There Are Photos Of The Troops Just Grabbing Huge 50 Pound Subbails For Themselves
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  Generals Sitting On Piles Of It
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  They Just Shifted In
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  And This Is The Stuff On Budget
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  This Is The Stuff They Admitted
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Let Me Say That Again
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  No Record Of It's Dispersal
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  363 Tons
[04:38.000 --> 04:50.000]  363 Tons Or 4 Billion In Cash
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  That Wasn't Even For The Contractors
[04:57.000 --> 05:06.000]  Here's The Photos Of The Military And The Generals Standing By While They Went Into Museums That Had Stuff That Made The British Museum Of Antiquities Look Like A Joke
[05:06.000 --> 05:14.000]  We're Talking About Carvings And Gold Crowns And Statues Worth Hundreds Of Millions A Piece
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Gone
[05:16.000 --> 05:25.000]  And 3 Years Later Popping Up On International Market Being Sold In New York And Brussels And London And Paris
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  I Mean They Aren't Even Hiding It
[05:29.000 --> 05:44.000]  363 Tons Of $100 Bills
[05:44.000 --> 05:55.000]  And Then I Have A Friend Who Sells Military Legal Flak Vests That He Buys From The Manufacture At The Gun Show
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  He Has The Receipts Everything And A Guy Came In And Said I Want To Buy One From Him
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  And He Got Him Out In The Parking Lot
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  Somebody I Know Not Known For 12 Years
[06:06.000 --> 06:14.000]  And The APD Shows Up And They Arrest Him For It And Then The Military DoD Guy Just Disappears
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  And Isn't Going To Testify But The Charges Are There
[06:18.000 --> 06:26.000]  For Some $400 Vest That He There Had The Receipts And The DoD Saying He Bought Stolen Material
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  See It's A Joke That's What They Are Out Doing
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  They Are Out Indicting One Of The Colonels In Able Danger Who Blew The Whistle On Government Involvement And Paranology 9-11
[06:36.000 --> 06:45.000]  And So They Start Criminal Charges Against Him For $63 Of Unauthorized Phone Calls On His Government Cell Phone To His Wife
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  When In The Protocol It Is Listed As You Being Able To Call Your Wife On Your Cell Phone
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  Oh And They Say Some Pencils And Pens Came Up Missing And Paper Totaling What Was It $12

[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  The Major Police Forces Openly Now Are The Mafia Running Murder For Hire Hits

[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  Now Welcome Back To The Show
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  I Know Many Of You Out There Are Going To Be In Disbelief About This
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  And Saying He Is Full Of Shit Those Are Lies It's Not Happening
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  So For Those Of You Who Think That Or Are On The Border Of It
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  I Have A Female Who Is An Iraqi War Vet Called Into The Alex Jones Show On That Same Day
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  And Back Up Exactly What Alex Just Said
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  So Here It Is
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Now Let's Go Back To Michelle And The Other Calls
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  Michelle You Said You Were In The Military Tell Us What Branch And You Said You Witnessed All The Cash Being Handed Out But You Didn't Take Part
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  You Also Said No To The En throughout Shot Specifically Give Us The Specifics Without Giving Away Too Much About Yourself
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  Tell Us
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  Hello
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Yes
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  Yes I Was In The Army And Without Giving Away Too Many Specifics
[11:56.000 --> 12:03.000]  Well I Will Say When I Refused To Take The Anthrax Shot Again I Mean It Was Like I Was An Outcast
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  I Was One Of The Few People In The Line Who Said Something Doesn't Feel Right In My Spirit
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  I Just Don't See Why
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  It Was Almost Like In 2003 Because We Knew What Was Going On
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  We Had A Sense Of What Was Going On
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  By The Way They Gave That To Troops From The Mid 90's To 2000 They Then Banned It's Use Because BioPort Run By Admiral Crowe Got Shut Down
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  Because They Found It Filled With All These Microplasms, Live Viruses It Was Killing Troops And Maiming Them In Mass
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  All Mainstream News Go Pull It Up
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  They Suspended It And Then Bush Just Started It Back Up Again In 2002 But Go Ahead
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  Yeah I Was Just Going To Say That In 2002 We Kind Of Suspected That Something Was Going On Because We Were Always Having To Do More
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  We Did More Work Than Normal I Would Say When We Weren't At War Things Were A Little More Relaxed More Calm
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  In 2002 Right Before Everybody Started To Go To Our Rec Especially The Army Units
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  There Was Just So Much Going On And I Remember Right Before Everybody Had To Leave
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  And They Were Giving Everybody They Made Us Attend Meetings Saying This Is What You Are Supposed To Say If You Get Confronted With Media People
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  This Is What You Are Supposed To Do If Your Family Asks And We All Knew Where We Were Going
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  Yeah All Had A Lie
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  It Was All Very Suspicious
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Tell Us About The Cash
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  I Was The Main Voice Of Descent About The Cash I Just Felt It Wasn't Right In My Spirit
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  But Describe How They Were Where You Were How They Were Handing It Up
[13:28.000 --> 13:35.000]  Well Some Of The It Wasn't Really The Top Brass It Was Mainly Because I Think They Didn't Want The Responsibility Of It
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  You Were There That's The Stories I Heard From Other Troops That I Know Personally Is That Yeah No They Come Into The Unit And Hand It Out There
[13:43.000 --> 13:52.000]  It Was Mainly The NCOs E5 E6 And Above They Kind Of Stopped At EEA Because I Guess They Work More So With The Top Brass
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  And Again Go Over The Cash Tell Us About It
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  So When They Were Dispersing It Especially When You Were Out In Our Rec Either They Did It Discreetly Or They Did It Out In The Open
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  But It Was Kind Of Hush Hush Like Don't Tell Anybody This Is Among Us 5 Or This Is Among Us 8 And Nobody Wants To Say Anything About It
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.000]  Because It Was Us As U.S. Army Soldiers Who Were Also Working With The Quote Unquote Iraqi Soldiers
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And My Thing With It Was I Can't Really Tell If They Are For Us Or Against Us Because Just Because They Put On A Uniform
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  Now I've Been Told Between $1,000 And $10,000 Would Be Handed Out Within A Month How Much Cash Were You Seeing Being Handed Out
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  Oh More Than That It Was More Than That
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  I'm Talking About Per Soldier
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  Well It Depended Because There Weren't Buckets Per Se But There Were I Would Say More Like Bags
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Bags Of Just Money And Then They Would Say Ok We Would Go Up To Them
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  The Court I've Got Is Those Big Dollies That Are Flat Bottomed With Boxes And They Would Literally Go $10,000 For You
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Good Job $5,000 For You
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  Yeah And Don't Say Anything And Go Hide It And Don't Say Anything And Then We Have To Come Back Over To The States
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  We Kind Of Had To Be Very Discreet In How And Not Many Persons But How They Had To Do It
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  And They've Done The Same Thing Now Understand The Big Guys Have Stolen Almost $4,000,000 Then They Just Hand Out A Few Billion To You Guys To Then Get You Under Their Thumb
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's Kind Of Like You Know The Soldiers Complain About We Complain Amongst Ourselves Like How We Don't Get Enough
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  So It's Kind Of Like An Incentive Thing Well Here We Know That The Army Doesn't Pay You Enough So This Would Be To Offset Those
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Yeah But That's Not What It Is It's A Corrupt Deal
[15:32.000 --> 15:41.000]  It's A Complete Lie And It's Just To Me I Just Want To Say To All The People Who Facilitated That And The Person Who Called You A Few Days Ago Cuckoo
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  Just Shame On You For Thinking That This Is Not True And It's Not Happening I'm Living Proof That This Is Corruption To The Highest And
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  How Long Were You In Iraq And What Year?
[15:51.000 --> 16:04.000]  One Term And I Was Only There For A Year So It Was One Term The Unit I Used To Be In Is Now On The Third Term Over There
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  So It's Just Like It's Mind Boggling
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  How Often Did They Hand The Cash Out?
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  It Depended Usually It Depended On What Missions Cause We Would Have To Go Off On Missions
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  So It Depended On What Missions Where We Were Going To Who We Were Meeting With If We Were Meeting With Top People It Was Kind Of Like
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  All Undercover Nobody Pretended Like Anything Was Going On It Was Kind Of Like Mom Is The Word
[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  This Is Also A Way To Introduce Mainline Troops Into Black Ops Taking Masses Of Cash Man This Is
[16:38.000 --> 16:44.000]  And It's Kind Of A Guilt Thing And So That's Why I Said I Can't Do It Because It's A Snowball Effect
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  If You Do It And If You're A Soldier And You Had Any Consciousness And I Wasn't The Only One Who Refused To Take It
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  What Percentage Refused The Cash?
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  A Small Percentage
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  5, 10%, 20%?
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  I Would Say Maybe About 10
[16:58.000 --> 17:04.000]  I Mean Because What Can You Do If You're Being Told And You're Being Brainwashed To Say This Is What You're Supposed To Tell To The Media
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  This Is How You're Supposed To Add
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.000]  Sure Sure They Get You In Groups Of Eight And Then What They Just Reach In Bags And Like On Average Handout How Much?
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  Just Big Big Big Stacks Of Hundreds?
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  Yeah Pretty Much
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  Pretty Much I Mean You Take What You Can Get And You Fill It Up And You Don't Say Anything About It
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  I Mean It's Just The Simplest Thing
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Did They Tell You Don't Send This Home To Family Or Don't Talk About That?
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  Oh Yeah Don't Send It Don't You Don't Mom Is The Word I Couldn't Stress That Enough
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Mom Was The Word
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  And It Was Just Mind Boggling Because I Said This Is Not Right
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  This Is Not How I Was Raised To Be
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  This Is Not Part Of My Belief
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  Now What About The Foreign Soldiers?
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  What About The Illegal Aliens That Are Now 20% Of The Army Ground Force
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  Or Do They Keep Those In Separate Units Or Were They In Their Units?
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  Well When We First Went Over There We Were At
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  Well I Won't Say The Place Where We Were At Because There Are Still Other Soldiers And Marines Over There Now
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  But We Did Work And Live With Some Of The Iraqi Soldiers
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.000]  And To Me It Was Just Like The Scariest Thing In My Life Because I Just Kept Thinking Are These Holy Slaves?
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.000]  But I'm Talking About Mainly The Latin American Slash Mexican Slash Filipino
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Yeah When I Was Over There I Didn't Really Encounter Them
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  So They Were Probably In Another Part Of Iraq Or Somewhere On The Border
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  I Really Didn't Encounter Them At All
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Not Me Personally
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.000]  I Just Mainly Heard About The Iraqi Soldiers Working With Them
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  So Were They Handing The Cash Out Every Week? Every Month?
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  Now I Know It Was Random
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  It Wasn't A Routine Thing It Was A Random Thing
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  How Many Times In The Year You Were There Did You Watch Cash Being Served Out?
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  Me Personally I Would Say About 15
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  So Every Month Or So?
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  Probably You Can Average It Like That But Sometimes It Could Have Been Two Times A Month Or Three Times Or One Time
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  So It Was Really Random But It Went On
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  How Much Cash Each Time On Average?
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Ballpark A Thousand?
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  I Would Say Maybe One Soldier The First Time Probably About Between Two, Three Four Thousand Dollars
[19:05.000 --> 19:12.000]  I Didn't Take It I Didn't Take It I Just Saw It And I Was Tempted
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  I Can't Lie But It Just Wasn't Right
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  Unbelievable You Know I'd Like To Get Your Name Off Air I Promise We'll Never Use Your Name In The Story
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  But I'd Like To Be Able To Get You In Contact With One Of My Writers Can We Do That?
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Sure
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Alright Stay There Michelle
[19:50.000 --> 20:05.000]  Cool Toys For Grown Ups
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  Cool Toys For Grown Ups

[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  This Is From Wired.com
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  By Lisa Kdeyama
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  Who Says Toys Are For Kids?
[20:21.000 --> 20:27.000]  In Japan We Believe That Everyone Including Our Parents And Grandparents Should Have Playing Things Too
[20:27.000 --> 20:35.000]  Since September I've Been Surfing My Home Country's Best Department Stores And Online Retailers For Crazy Fun And Creative Toys For Grown Ups
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  Some Are Multifunctional Others Are Utterly Useless
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  Together They Give Us Some Insight Into Jokes And Quirks That Underline Japanese Consumer Culture
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Fake Marijuana Plants
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  Here's One Form Of Marijuana That Could Be Flaunted On A Window Sill Without The Danger Of Being Arrested
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  These Fake Potted Plants Are Made To Look Just Like The Real Thing And Are A Big Hit Among Potheads
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  Alright Comments Here
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  Man It'd Be Such A Blast Replacing All My Friend's Plants Nevermind
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Okay Blaze Do That
[21:15.000 --> 21:24.000]  You've Been Able To Avoid Conviction But Would You Definitely Be Inviting Arrest On A Search At The Very Least
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  Looks Nothing Like Real Wheat
[21:27.000 --> 21:34.000]  Big Hit Among Potheads Yeah So Someone Sees It In The Window And Calls The Cabs And They Catch You Smoking
[21:34.000 --> 21:42.000]  This Has Got To Be One Of The Lamest Ideas Ever If You Don't Smoke Pot Why Would You Want One Of These
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  If You Do Smoke Pot Why Would You Want One Of These
[21:45.000 --> 21:54.000]  If The Long Retardation Involved With This Product Is Stupefying I Used To Smoke Weed And Would Love A Couple Of These
[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  I Think Everyone In America That Bleeds Marijuana Should Be Illegal Should Have One Of Them In Their Front Yard In Protest Of The Marijuana Laws
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  I Bet It Would Not Take Long For The Fake Ones To Be Made Illegal
[22:08.000 --> 22:19.000]  It Goes On But Yeah Even If You Had That You Could Be Accused Of Impersonating Probably A Pothead I'm Assuming Because In Florida FreeTalkLive.com
[22:19.000 --> 22:27.000]  They Went Over A Year Ago A Man He Was A Crack Addict And He Needed Money To Buy Crack
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  And He Was Too Lazy To Rob People And Break Into Houses So What He Simply Did Was He Got Bread At A Gas Station
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.000]  You Get Bread Wet And Crunch It Up Or You Don't Get Wet Just Crunch It Up In Your Hand You Know You Can Make Bread Into Those Little Balls
[22:39.000 --> 22:49.000]  Well You Do That And You Microwave It And Apparently I Guess It Looks Similar To Crack He Was Selling A Fake Crack To Buy Real Crack On The Streets In Florida
[22:49.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I Think It Was In Florida It Was Somewhere In The Country And He Got Arrested For Selling To An Undercover Cop For Selling Fake Drugs To Buy Real Drugs
[23:00.000 --> 23:10.000]  You Know It's Crazy How Society Is But Stuff Like That Does Happen So With That Cue The Music
[23:10.000 --> 23:30.000]  Welcome Back To The Show This Next One Ties Back To The Money Missing That Was Shipped To Iraq
[23:30.000 --> 23:42.000]  It's Entitled From The RawStory.com Daily Show Slams Bremer For $12 Billion In Lost Cash Friday, February 9, 2007
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  RawStory Is Having Video Problems Today Blah Blah Blah
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  On Thursday's Daily Show Jon Stewart Lampoon Former US Iraq Counsel Paul Bremer Who Somehow Managed To Lose $12 Billion In Cash
[23:55.000 --> 24:06.000]  Said Democrat Henry Waxman From Cali On US Effort To Send So Much Money To Iraq
[24:06.000 --> 24:18.000]  To Do That The Federal Reserve Bank Had To Pack 281 Million Individual Bills This Money Mainly 100 Dollar Bills Was Packed Into Bricks And Each Brick Was Worth 400 Grand Each
[24:18.000 --> 24:28.000]  The Cash Weighed More Than 363 Tons Stewart Jokes That The US Must Have Flown Dipped In Gold Cargo Planes Into The Sun
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  I'm Going To Play This For You Enjoy
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  That's Oddly Moving
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  Let's Talk About Iraq Which I Don't Know If You've Heard Is Not Going As Well As Perhaps It Could Have
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  And 4 Years Into The War Congressional Democrats Just Got This Idea Start Asking Why
[24:52.000 --> 25:07.000]  On Tuesday Former Coalition Provisional Authority Chief L. Paul Bremer Appeared Before The House Oversight Committee The Subject His Failure To Account For $8.8 Billion Of The $12 Billion In Cash Meant To Kickstart Iraq's Post-War Economy
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  $12 Billion In Cash Where Do You Get $12 Billion In Cash From?
[25:13.000 --> 25:30.000]  To Do That The Federal Reserve Bank In New York Had To Pack 281 Million Individual Bills Including More Than 107 $100 Bills On To Wooden Pallets To Be Shipped To Iraq
[25:30.000 --> 25:39.000]  This Money Mainly $100 Bills Were Packed Into Bricks And Each Brick Was Worth $400,000 Each
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  The Cash Weighed More Than 363 Tons And Was Loaded On To C-130 Cargo Planes
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  And Then Those Planes Were Dipped In Gold
[25:51.000 --> 25:59.000]  And The Wings Will Spread With Caviar Those Planes Were Beautiful And Then They Flew Them Directly Into The Sun
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  Oh They Were The Finest Planes You Ever Did See
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  Not A Muscle In The Soul
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  So About This Money
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  Well The Question This Committee Is Trying To Answer Is What Happened To The Money
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  Yes The 363 Tons Of Cash
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  Seems Like A Fair Question Mr. Bremer
[26:26.000 --> 26:37.000]  I Don't Know Iraqi Ministries Lacked Good Payroll Records
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  F***ing Renine In Accounting
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  Damn It
[26:44.000 --> 26:57.000]  Your Unfamiliarity With Quicken Has Ruined Our Chances For A Stable Democracy In The World's Most Dangerous Region
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  And From The Region That Gave Us Algebra
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  So Vexing
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  Of Course The Republicans On The Committee Wanted To Let Everybody Know That They Would Have Looked Into This Matter Years Ago
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Only It's Really Not That They Could Do
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  Self Righteous Finger Wagging And Political Scapegoating Won't Make Iraq Anymore Secure
[27:16.000 --> 27:23.000]  60 Years Ago The Truman Commission Found Huge Quantities Of Money Going To Waste Or Worse In FDR's Administration Of World War II
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  I Might Also For The Committee Put Into Perspective What $12 Billion Is
[27:28.000 --> 27:41.000]  Certainly Seems Like A Lot Of Money When You Put It In $100 Bills And Put It On Forklift
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Touche
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  It Is True When Put On A Forklift
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  $12 Billion Does Seem Like A Lot Of Money
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  I'm Going To Go Out On A Limb Here And Say Almost Any Amount Of Money That Can Be Stacked On A Forklift
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.000]  Is In Fact A Large Amount Of Money In Fact Whenever You Might Have To Say To Someone Do You Have Change For A Ton
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  And I Would Like It In Unmarked Pallets On A Forklift
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  You're Dealing With Quite A Bit Of Money
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Anyway That's Darrylissa
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  Trillionaire
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  Well The Committee Never Got To The Bottom Of What Happened To The Missing Money But They're Just Getting Started
[28:19.000 --> 28:33.000]  It Would Be The Beginning Of A Two Year Effort To Make Sure That We Can Watch To Protect Taxpayers Money From Being Wasted Through Inefficiency
[28:33.000 --> 28:52.000]  What Could Be Slowing Us Down
[28:52.000 --> 29:04.000]  For The True Futility Of This Committee's Efforts To Fight Government Inefficiency And Waste The Punchline Really Came At The End Of The Hearing
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.000]  The Committee's Website Will Now Have A Fraud, Waste And Abuse Tip Line
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  The Website Is www.oversight.house.gov
[29:14.000 --> 29:25.000]  Our Republican Committee Website Invites Whistleblowers And Anyone Else With Information About Waste Abuse Fraud Or Needed Reform Oversight At www.mail.house.gov
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  We Seem To Have Rival Tip Line Websites
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Let's Make This Perfectly Clear
[29:34.000 --> 29:46.000]  The House Oversight Committee Established A Waste And Inefficiency Tip Line And Then Another One
[29:46.000 --> 29:53.000]  But Don't Worry Don't Worry Don't Worry At All People It's Not A Problem
[29:53.000 --> 30:00.000]  It'll All Be Cleared Up By Tomorrow's Congressional Tip Line Oversight Meeting On Redundancy Get Together
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  There Will Be Four Of Them
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  We'll Be Right Back
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  When I Got The Bank Back The City Was On Fire
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  Welcome Back To The Show Yes As You Just Heard The Government Loves It
[30:16.000 --> 30:22.000]  Loves Making Things Complicated And Does Just That As Much As Possible So You Feel Dumb And Stupid
[30:22.000 --> 30:29.000]  And Not Knowing What The Hell Is Going On That Makes Them The Almighty One I Suppose
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  But Jon Stewart Finds A Way To Find Humor In Just About Anything So I Need Those Just That
[30:36.000 --> 30:43.000]  But I Gotta Get Going With My Saturday Sorry About 30 Minutes Long Enough For The Show For Today
[30:43.000 --> 30:48.000]  We'll Be Back Very Very Soon Until Next Time Ta Ta
