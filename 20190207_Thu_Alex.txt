[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, February 7th, 2019. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.320]  going to be over the next four hours as we are every weekday 11 a.m. 3 p.m. Central Standard
[00:51.320 --> 00:58.920]  Time. There is obviously a ton of news and information to cover and we're still looking
[00:58.920 --> 01:05.240]  at the aftermath of the very powerful State of the Union by the president and some polls
[01:05.240 --> 01:13.920]  having him as high as 82% CBS poll 76% even CNN's fake polls where they normally skew
[01:13.920 --> 01:21.120]  20 30 points against Republicans had him up there in the low 50s very exciting showing
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.200]  when the president can punch through and reach the people the people resonate with the good
[01:27.200 --> 01:38.360]  wholesome common sense message. That said, Trump's support of the new NAFTA get negotiation
[01:38.360 --> 01:45.400]  that does make some better deals for America on trade is a total nightmare written by Silicon
[01:45.400 --> 01:52.680]  Valley within it that emboldens the massive monopoly tactics and censorship we've seen
[01:52.680 --> 02:02.320]  and I think this is such a fundamental area that I don't know what to do and I want to
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.920]  open the phones up and get your take on this and I normally am very decisive folks know
[02:06.920 --> 02:14.040]  that I'm not too decisive but everything else Trump's doing is good and he's way better
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.360]  than the Democrats but if he won't defend the First Amendment and he lets these monopolies
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.240]  operate that censor him and everybody else what are you supposed to do I mean you have
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.320]  to drop your support for the president and let him know that so you get him back on the
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.600]  straight and narrow and I don't like pulling stunts like that like in culture does but
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.880]  you know maybe in cultures right and I've been wrong and I've been too easy on the president
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.960]  on a lot of issues like amnesty and sure we're like well the Democrats are going to refuse
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.440]  anything Trump offers so he just makes them look like fools and he goes up the approval
[02:49.440 --> 02:59.440]  rating with Hispanics being reasonable yeah I know that but at the same time this country
[02:59.440 --> 03:05.680]  is being collapsed from within and without it's just crazy and then there's the whole
[03:05.680 --> 03:13.160]  censorship front the whole censorship front it's just unbelievable I scan through a ton
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.720]  of news like everybody does there's a list for the show at Roll News Junkies and I see
[03:17.720 --> 03:24.920]  in the background every day 50, 60, 70 articles that I don't have time to read but I scan
[03:24.920 --> 03:34.160]  where major GOP strategist banned on Twitter for criticizing Senator Warren lying on her
[03:34.160 --> 03:41.800]  entrance formed of the Texas bar and then you read oh they apologized and reinstated
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.520]  her account and that way you just you just hear this chatter of censorship and then another
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.400]  person another person another person and in the background there's the thousands of people
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.320]  getting banned off all these platforms that you don't even hear about anymore so it just
[03:56.320 --> 04:05.040]  becomes this background chatter like a symphony warming up ahead of the real finale that's
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.680]  total and complete Chinese style global social score system that is their plan and that's
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.200]  why people got so mad at Joe Rogan with Jack Dorsey on from Twitter it was his all complete
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.280]  lies oh we don't censor anybody and Joe at the end is like thank you for being such a
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.200]  moral CEO and standing up First Amendment it was like it's like saying to Hitler thank
[04:27.200 --> 04:34.400]  you for supporting Jews thank you it's just upside down world while all this is happening
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.560]  the internet's going from free and open in the West to being selected and force fed and
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.640]  controlled and you've got all these people on their hands and knees groveling to the
[04:42.640 --> 04:47.680]  big tech gods so they can be cool it's like the old Soviet Union where you know you had
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.160]  one commission to control all the plays and all the TV shows and it sucked and it's like
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.480]  oh but they're big stars yeah because you call the line and you're force fed you're
[04:56.480 --> 05:14.560]  just absolutely shameful by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family
[05:14.560 --> 05:21.680]  in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.160]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burnout is
[05:26.160 --> 05:31.360]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects we have developed hands down from our research
[05:31.360 --> 05:38.320]  the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing
[05:38.320 --> 05:44.320]  else like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packaged
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.960]  mixed with fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though it's very very strong it
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.760]  lasts 10 hours so take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named
[05:53.760 --> 06:09.680]  turbo force because it will take you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live com
[06:09.680 --> 06:25.600]  it for wars tomorrow's news today
[06:25.600 --> 06:40.240]  so if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:41.840 --> 06:46.560]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[06:46.560 --> 07:00.000]  america and the world and what's left of christendom is being gaslighted
[07:02.160 --> 07:09.840]  the news is meant to be upside down world news alert church of satan warns of
[07:09.840 --> 07:16.480]  mike pence and the dangers of christians to our children news alert extremists don't like humans
[07:16.480 --> 07:22.960]  and animals being spliced together and the first gene-edited babies being born news flash
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.160]  republicans are being banned from criticizing democrats or saying learn to code
[07:31.360 --> 07:36.320]  news flash democrats angry at trump for saying we shouldn't have post birth abortion
[07:36.320 --> 07:44.560]  you know later in the broadcast we're going to show video of post birth abortions
[07:45.520 --> 07:51.920]  there will be viewer discretion advised but pbs has shown this let's not show it yet give people
[07:51.920 --> 08:02.960]  time to tune out we're going to show footage of post birth abortions these babies deserve to
[08:02.960 --> 08:08.400]  be humanized sure i know you're not going to want to watch an animal butchered or a child butchered
[08:10.320 --> 08:15.200]  but we have to humanize them and see that's the next step they're harvesting the organs
[08:15.760 --> 08:20.560]  and that's why they want us off air we go to the next step of what this is really all about
[08:20.560 --> 08:27.360]  we bring them down before they've conditioned us to accept the next step these are monsters
[08:27.360 --> 08:33.120]  using psychological warfare i'm going to explain it again the governor of virginia is a pediatric
[08:34.080 --> 08:43.360]  surgeon specializing in organ removal that's why he wants to explain to you we're going to keep
[08:43.360 --> 08:49.040]  them alive after they're born keep them comfortable because he has to normalize that at the hospital
[08:49.040 --> 08:57.920]  and normalize it everyone else this is a normalization processed by a snake preacher you
[08:57.920 --> 09:06.560]  understand they need to keep the children alive for a few days to a week while they get the donors
[09:06.560 --> 09:13.760]  lined up to get maximum cash it's like keeping the aeration going on minnows at the at the
[09:13.760 --> 09:21.120]  bait shop that goes up a few hours the minnows are dead and you can't put them on a hook and
[09:21.120 --> 09:26.720]  catch bass with them now let's go up from minnows we all feel sorry for it the left says you you
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.000]  know shouldn't even have baitfish it's abusive seriously pete says that's eating fish is bad
[09:33.920 --> 09:40.160]  yes we've humanized the uh one inch minnow if you don't have aeration it dies they have to keep
[09:40.160 --> 09:47.440]  the babies alive to get the organs and when they're done they suck every drop of blood out
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.440]  they render down all the skin for collagen all the organs are sold and i'm sorry to be so macabre
[09:53.440 --> 10:00.720]  here but if we don't admit what's going on it's like germans at the end of world war two
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.960]  didn't believe there were any death death camps or that hitler was killing anybody and hitler was
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.280]  he wrote the final solution those documents came out he was killing millions of people all over
[10:11.280 --> 10:21.200]  europe in russia it's a fact and eisenhower couldn't believe the fact that of germans would get in
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.240]  his face town leaders during the occupation of germany and would say there we didn't do that so
[10:26.240 --> 10:29.600]  he said you're going to a death camp and you're going to help clean up dead bodies
[10:29.600 --> 10:41.520]  and see that's what i'm doing here is joe rogan said alex jones is obviously mentally ill he's
[10:41.520 --> 10:47.920]  gone to a bad place let's play the clip and then he played the literal soros funded media group
[10:47.920 --> 10:54.160]  clip from a soros funded group and for media matters so exact soros funding exact talking
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.720]  points going i don't get talking points hiding in plain view he's either got an iq about 70
[11:00.720 --> 11:06.800]  or he's a lying snake it's the latter and he goes yeah listen to this he claims that
[11:08.720 --> 11:15.200]  and of course the tapes edited by the soros group and and he cites the so-called news group
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.160]  and plays it where i say that they would go have sex with dead bodies at the morgue
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.640]  and that they found them with dead kids in dungeons and that they would drink their blood
[11:24.640 --> 11:32.400]  and eat the pituitary gland and in 30 seconds the crew typed in jimmy savel 500 raped children
[11:32.400 --> 11:38.560]  murdered children eaten children sex with dead bodies eating their brains just type in jimmy
[11:38.560 --> 11:46.480]  savel sex with dead kids just just type it in major bbc presenter who supplied the kids to
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.240]  everybody how bbc star jimmy savel allegedly and it's it's been confirmed the british news
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.120]  got away with abusing 500 children and sex with dead bodies now joe if you go read the london
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.560]  telegraph or you go read the police reports and i've had members of parliament on talking about it
[12:05.600 --> 12:10.560]  they would eat children and you're like i can't believe that exists
[12:10.560 --> 12:18.160]  well we all know about psychopaths they're evil people that like to mount people's heads on walls
[12:18.160 --> 12:25.840]  torture people you know that's not just in american psycho so yes joe we're in a bad place
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.920]  when they're splicing humans with animals for 30 40 years and now it's just breaking we're in a
[12:29.920 --> 12:36.240]  bad place when the iphone's can watch and listen to us in real time we're in a bad place when

[12:50.080 --> 12:55.680]  the system i saw the media focus off of the wiki leaks documents that was true satanism

[13:31.040 --> 13:36.240]  else was covering and said people are looking into it and i said okay i got that part wrong just like

[21:33.680 --> 21:42.880]  who isn't a pedophile who then still gets to direct movies with kids it's hundreds and hundreds
[21:42.880 --> 21:54.560]  of famous cases it's rampant absolutely totally completely out of control and rampant
[21:54.560 --> 22:02.560]  and then alex just mentally you know he he says that there's people having sex with
[22:02.560 --> 22:06.480]  dead kids in hospitals and he says they're drinking their blood
[22:09.520 --> 22:11.840]  yeah you're right joe i'm in a bad place man because i care
[22:14.240 --> 22:20.640]  i can't just sit here and rationalize all this stuff i mean take george soros the big
[22:20.640 --> 22:26.320]  listment test the guy you quote from you quote from his media matters is as your talking point
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.240]  and say it's not a talking point it's like jack dorsy said we don't censor anybody everybody has
[22:30.240 --> 22:36.240]  a right to be on twitter except alex jones well why'd you do it well i don't know you know why
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.720]  because the establishment came down and they said get him off the air because he's a nationalist
[22:40.720 --> 22:47.200]  who with his audience has relaunched nationalist capitalist movements worldwide europe the e you
[22:47.200 --> 22:52.800]  take over is falling apart they're in panic mode all the world it's happening i'm getting chills right
[22:52.800 --> 22:57.440]  now we have all accomplished a great deal audience and i salute you
[23:01.440 --> 23:08.880]  joe you know george soros because i called you and i told you about it we sort of defended him
[23:10.160 --> 23:14.880]  you know he went on 60 minutes instead that it was the happiest time happy making time
[23:14.880 --> 23:19.280]  happiest time of his life helping round up jewish but he felt no responsibility for it
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.840]  because if he wouldn't have done it somebody else would that it was an exhilarating feeling
[23:25.760 --> 23:34.480]  this is the sickest crap i've ever heard in my life and soros i used to be so megalomaniacal
[23:34.480 --> 23:41.760]  and on such a power trip that he would say to interviewers i'm god i am the messiah you pull
[23:41.760 --> 23:47.920]  the interviews up in magazines and then by the 90s he said i used to tell people that i was the
[23:47.920 --> 23:53.760]  messiah because i believe i am the messiah and it was maybe something i shouldn't have been saying
[23:53.760 --> 24:04.160]  but i i am the messiah so there it is and it was the happy making time my best time of my life
[24:04.160 --> 24:11.440]  it was exhilarating it was it was great danger but i was with my father and we were rounding up all
[24:11.440 --> 24:19.040]  the jews singing them off oh so fun and and so the 60 minutes interview was like so you were
[24:19.040 --> 24:24.640]  helping round up your fellow jews and sending them to death camps yes yeah i was actually
[24:25.200 --> 24:33.360]  yes i was and so now in this upside down world i'm the bad guy and joe's the good guy he's the guy
[24:33.360 --> 24:38.400]  that from his little perch in los angeles will tell us how that'll be good and how to be bad
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.000]  yes there it is word soros i carry potent messianic fantasies
[24:51.600 --> 24:57.040]  i i i i since i was a boy i believe that i was the messiah i
[24:57.040 --> 25:06.080]  think i think now it's maybe alexander my son he is the messiah
[25:07.760 --> 25:12.720]  the messiah the messiah so a nazi collaborator thinks he's the messiah
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.800]  who was a famous villain imploding countries and trying to overthrow their currencies
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.360]  and i'm the bad guy for saying what he said on 60 minutes okay joe cool
[25:23.360 --> 25:29.680]  and they tell me i'm marked for destruction because i won't back down because i can't back down
[25:29.680 --> 25:37.040]  these people are hurting children soros is are heavily involved in all the crowley and magic
[25:37.040 --> 25:46.880]  crap look it up look up alexander at spirit cooking events it's disgusting these are disgusting
[25:46.880 --> 25:55.440]  people and to get close to god you've got to politically and spiritually get away from these
[25:55.440 --> 26:01.840]  people and by getting away from them that means protecting children protecting culture
[26:01.840 --> 26:09.360]  from the trash of the universe the worst garbage that will do anything for power and control
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.000]  and who only wants to destroy civilization in the name of civilization
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.280]  so i'm proud of the work i've done and sometimes i get in war mode and i come off a little aggressive
[26:21.280 --> 26:28.320]  nobody's perfect but you hype yourself up into these positions of no fear that's the way it is
[26:29.120 --> 26:36.160]  when you're fighting a global culture that is designed to destroy our genetics
[26:36.160 --> 26:42.960]  vampirically psychically spiritually feed on our children overthrow creation
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.720]  poison and destroy the earth in the name of saving it and folks don't know this has got
[26:50.720 --> 26:57.680]  to be opposed and when people become willing chills for the very worst aspects of hollywood
[26:57.680 --> 27:04.320]  and soros and others and then sit there and go oh alex jones is my friend but he's crazy he's bad
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.960]  he's in a lot of trouble no joe you're in a lot of trouble out there in los angeles with your
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.760]  wife and kids bring them all that toxic smog and being around all that evil if you had a soul left
[27:13.760 --> 27:17.760]  you'd feel it or tried to get away once when you ran up to colorado but
[27:20.720 --> 27:26.720]  they got you and no joe i don't think you're in the cia i said the whole dmt iowasca push
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.160]  is cia and almost all those guests you had on are admittedly working with the cia at research
[27:32.160 --> 27:38.400]  facilities and at universities to do it territory 2.0 so don't misrepresent what i said and as a
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.680]  fat toy eddie bravo is not the middle of this at dinner a couple years ago eddie's like
[27:45.360 --> 27:48.640]  hi doesn't joe have you on the podcast and i'm like i'm not really worried about he goes well i
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.160]  i think he's been threatened i think they you know they've got to him and i heard some stuff
[27:52.160 --> 27:58.160]  blah blah and i'm like well is that true or no actually i just you know i well i i i i i think
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.360]  he was threatened and then later eddie's like no no no that was just a hunch so i went on there and
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.000]  said joe got threatened by the cia i heard and joe called up like an hour later all mad and i said
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.880]  listen i'll call eddie and it but the point is it's like nitpicking on all this stuff
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.520]  they're killing babies after they're born for years plan parenthood and others are losing
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.040]  lawsuits law enforcement's figuring it out and going how is that legal so the indictments and
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.160]  arrest are starting to happen so they need to have their front people who are surgeons that are in
[28:30.160 --> 28:34.720]  that business and have to be governors come out and say we keep them little fellers comfortable
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.120]  for a while and then this we kill them you're like why do you kill them and well um yeah let's not
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.520]  discuss that as you say it's completely normal move along these aren't the babies you're looking for
[28:44.640 --> 28:49.760]  move along so it's all a Jedi mind trick at the bottom of the spider hole that is that governor

[33:00.560 --> 33:14.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:14.400 --> 33:31.920]  the devil went down to georgia he was looking for a solar steel he was in a
[33:31.920 --> 33:36.480]  bind because he was way behind he was willing to make a deal when he came across this young man
[33:36.480 --> 33:40.560]  sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said boy
[33:40.560 --> 33:46.560]  let me tell you what i guess you didn't know it but i'm a fiddle player too and if you'd care to
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.600]  take a dare i'll make a bet with you now you played pretty good fiddle boy but give the devil
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.640]  his due i bet a fiddle of gold against your soul because i think i'm better than you the boy said
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.680]  my name's johnny and it might be a sin but i'll take your bet you're gonna regret that's what
[34:01.680 --> 34:09.600]  this is everything you talk about these are done with the consent of obviously the the mother with
[34:09.600 --> 34:15.680]  the consent of the physicians more than one physician by the way and it's done in cases
[34:15.680 --> 34:22.240]  where there may be severe deformities there may be a fetus that's non-bible so in this particular
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.480]  example if a mother is in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be
[34:28.480 --> 34:34.480]  delivered uh the infant would be kept comfortable uh the infant would be resuscitated if if that's
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.320]  what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians
[34:40.320 --> 34:46.080]  and the mother so so i think this was really blown out of proportion but again we want the
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.040]  government not to be involved in these types of decisions we want the decision to be made by
[34:51.040 --> 34:59.440]  uh the the mothers and their providers and all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live i
[34:59.440 --> 35:05.280]  am your host alex jones let's get into the big central issue that has to be dealt with here
[35:05.280 --> 35:13.360]  there is a massive coordinated criminal takeover of not just the internet here in the u.s but the
[35:13.360 --> 35:19.680]  internet worldwide from australia to europe to the united states of canada the same program is
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.720]  being implemented nine months ago ten months ago now there was a 30 page wall street journal
[35:26.720 --> 35:32.960]  article that polotsin wrote about that said we're going to take wiki leaks off and alex jones off
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.560]  and once the president's set to take them off we're going to start taking everybody off and
[35:38.560 --> 35:46.560]  by the middle of 2019 most the internet will be paid social networks will not promote any
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.640]  third party news or information period facebook announced they're going to stop letting farmers
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.920]  even have access uh to commenting on facebook because they're the ones rebelling in france
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.880]  that was in the news last week buzzfeed actually two weeks ago called for it i mean soros called for
[36:00.880 --> 36:09.040]  it uh and then the facebook responded saying yes we will not let farmers french farmers complain
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.720]  about anything so so see now it goes from alex jones to french farmers complaining about gas prices
[36:14.720 --> 36:22.400]  period oh and youtube says they're gonna get rid of the downvoting because we can't let you vote
[36:22.400 --> 36:28.240]  that's hateful and now info wars dot com paul joseph watson article key to get this out remember
[36:29.040 --> 36:34.240]  the EU just passed a law to begin criminalizing memes buzzfeed lobbies twitter to ban memes
[36:34.240 --> 36:39.520]  that make fun of black-faced democrats if you can't meme just get them censored
[36:39.520 --> 36:45.440]  and you laugh at buzzfeed but it is a fake news weapon system
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.000]  continuing instagram apologizes for removing gop spokeswoman's post about senator warren
[36:55.280 --> 36:58.800]  they removed it and said it was hateful and warned her they might cancel her account
[36:58.800 --> 37:03.600]  because she showed elizabeth warren's bar card of texas that she said she was native american
[37:03.600 --> 37:10.480]  which is a lie and what she's now apologized for because zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero
[37:10.480 --> 37:16.720]  zero zero four two mean she's about the widest person on earth okay i'm about six percent
[37:16.720 --> 37:21.280]  ahead of american i wouldn't call myself an american you got to be 13 percent for most tribes to say
[37:21.280 --> 37:30.560]  that you are so instagram apologizes for removing gop spokeswoman's post about senator warren
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.560]  but that's daily caller that's only when it's a high-level top spokesperson she gets pissed
[37:36.560 --> 37:44.000]  she can go in to those mummies up there that don't know what's going on and say look i've
[37:44.000 --> 37:50.160]  been censored because they go to and lie in congress to their faces i've been there you've
[37:50.160 --> 37:58.320]  seen the live feeds and they tell them oh no no no nothing's going on nothing's happening when
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.400]  in industry publications the new york times and the washington post and the wall street journal
[38:05.200 --> 38:12.240]  this was all in industry publications a year ago that hey our stock's going to go up hey
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.560]  don't think the new york times is going to fold you know carlo slim the king pin just pulled out
[38:17.920 --> 38:23.360]  we've got the cavalry on the way its big tech moguls are going to invest and they're going to
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.280]  force feed top search results to the new york times and washington post so we'll be profitable again
[38:29.280 --> 38:35.520]  and just like that when they they broke the algorithm and make you ccnn make you see the
[38:35.520 --> 38:42.640]  new york times suddenly they aren't on live support anymore here's another article twitter

[39:36.000 --> 39:40.320]  didn't back down went public because he had a platform and they backed down saying it was
[39:40.320 --> 39:47.520]  a mistake and it was a joke about trump saying this isn't symmetrical haha with a laugh track
[39:47.520 --> 39:55.040]  going because polosi was behind trump seated playing with her dentures while pencil standing up
[39:56.080 --> 40:02.240]  for not killing babies after they're born yes that's right she would not stand

[47:28.560 --> 47:35.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[47:37.520 --> 47:43.840]  so congress is not acting on the great censorship ever hit the western world and so
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.040]  the tyrants have tested the perch and they've done their beta test and so now all hell's breaking
[47:53.040 --> 48:00.480]  loose censorship never before seen total social engineering where if you play ball you get left
[48:00.480 --> 48:07.760]  online for a season but by the end of this year they plan to have almost phased everybody out
[48:08.320 --> 48:11.280]  to where if you want to even do anything on facebook or anywhere you're gonna have to pay
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.120]  and so they get you on a communication system that they control that has no transparency
[48:17.120 --> 48:23.280]  and then they start slowly putting the screws to you we're going to talk to mike adams
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.560]  who just got massively censored for what he said about bitcoin and jack dorsi and the fraud
[48:29.280 --> 48:32.240]  i know joe rogan's reached out a couple times wanting to talk on the phone
[48:33.040 --> 48:40.240]  and i just don't know if i can i just couldn't bring myself to call or pick the phone up last
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.400]  night and i'm not trying to act tough here i actually the guy's a charming fellow and i've
[48:44.400 --> 48:50.080]  liked him in certain ways but um i just have to i this is about my soul and it's not for sale
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.720]  and i just and yes i'm in i'm in war mode people need to understand that
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.880]  and so i do get a little aggressive and i may have even you know said some things that are over
[49:00.880 --> 49:07.040]  the line to joe but he said a whole hell of a lot of stuff about me that isn't true and it isn't
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.320]  about me jimmy savel did have sex with hundreds of dead bodies and did murder children and did
[49:12.320 --> 49:18.000]  supply them to british elite that's mainstream news joe so just because you can't handle it
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.200]  and you sit up there and say i'm making that up when in 10 seconds you can confirm what i said
[49:23.200 --> 49:27.840]  was true you say i'm in a bad place show we're in a bad place and i believe this would be the
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.480]  number one republican ad it's what trump should stand on if they have any sense and it's the right
[49:32.480 --> 49:42.080]  thing to do nancy polosi and alexandria cortege refused to stand in defense of already born
[49:42.080 --> 49:48.320]  babies not being in fantasized i mean that is like if jeffrey dommer was in court trying to get
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.240]  out of prison time he'd stand up mr. dommer i'm about to sentence you into life and prison of death
[49:54.240 --> 49:58.560]  now tell me what you did to those children torturing them and raping them and killing them
[49:58.560 --> 50:05.520]  was wrong and that you are sorry i am not sorry i am jeffrey dommer he would get to he would get
[50:05.520 --> 50:13.120]  executed but you can have polosi in plain view refusing to get up and all these witches on and
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.800]  then it wasn't just that it was the human trafficking it was the kidnapping it was it was they were
[50:18.800 --> 50:23.920]  pissed how we've gotten thousands of women and children out of sex slavery and they're just like
[50:26.080 --> 50:31.680]  and it just goes on and on and on if we're going to mic Adams i've got a plug we won't be here
[50:31.680 --> 50:36.880]  they're trying to shut us down i'm in the fight of my life these are great products anyways thank

[51:35.440 --> 51:40.240]  gone out and when mike adam said that he got banned too because it's it's the announcement that
[51:41.040 --> 51:46.480]  two plus two equals four no it's the announcement that we don't kill babies after they're born

[52:50.160 --> 52:55.680]  and then you've got mike adams of naturalnews.com he comes on he promotes info wars and oh they just
[52:55.680 --> 52:59.520]  let him know hey here's a little wrap on the on the head a little slap in the face little
[53:00.720 --> 53:04.480]  we're going to restrict you now we're going to ban you we're going to terminate you
[53:05.280 --> 53:11.040]  for daring to speak of our lord and savior jack dorsy so uh uh uh tell us what happened uh mike
[53:12.400 --> 53:18.400]  alex in the hours after my appearance on your show yesterday all three accounts that we use on
[53:18.400 --> 53:24.800]  twitter were suspended simultaneously that's the health ranger account the real natural news account
[53:24.800 --> 53:32.080]  and the news target account and uh obviously a manual suspension obviously from jack dorsy uh maybe
[53:32.080 --> 53:38.640]  joe rogan promoted it to dorsy who knows but the point is they have punished me for appearing on
[53:38.640 --> 53:45.120]  your show they've punished me for off platform behavior so if you look at the tweets from the
[53:45.120 --> 53:51.040]  health ranger account just it's at health ranger you can see that it's over 95 percent health
[53:51.040 --> 53:57.600]  nutrition food science you know food contamination science just that's what we we tweak there all
[53:57.600 --> 54:02.080]  the time we don't even get into politics on that channel but that channel was banned because i appeared
[54:02.080 --> 54:06.320]  on your show and secondly alex this is really crucial if you think about it you and i were
[54:06.320 --> 54:13.520]  discussing what i now believe to be massive securities fraud a conspiracy being carried out
[54:13.520 --> 54:19.680]  by joe rogan and jack dorsy where they are not disclosing their financial conflicts of interest
[54:19.680 --> 54:27.840]  as is required by the sec they are engaging in what i believe to be a a con a massive scam
[54:27.840 --> 54:33.360]  that could ensnare millions of innocent people and they are silencing the independent journalists
[54:33.360 --> 54:39.920]  such as myself you who are looking into that massive financial fraud so they are a techno mafia
[54:39.920 --> 54:45.280]  we're living under techno fascism independent journalists who are whistleblowers are being
[54:45.280 --> 54:51.920]  silenced in order to cover up what i believe to be serious sec crimes or or violations
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.360]  that are with cryptocurrency that's what's going on right now alex and they just proved it by banning
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.280]  all of my accounts all at the same time hours after i appeared on your show and if you recall
[55:03.280 --> 55:09.280]  yesterday on your show i said this is what they do to people they reward you if you denounce alex
[55:09.280 --> 55:14.960]  jones they punish you if you say that alex jones has a right to speak and they just proved it yet
[55:14.960 --> 55:22.560]  again it's crazy and of course even mainline sites like hacked and others uh said the dark side of
[55:22.560 --> 55:28.640]  joe rogan jack dorsy's uh you know bitcoin promotion and he's not telling you that the single currency
[55:28.640 --> 55:36.560]  for the uh square cash system uh is the main sponsor of joe and so when you have that trifecta
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.200]  of joe not disclosing it which he didn't he tried to back it up later no he didn't and and which which
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.760]  which which they didn't break down and the fact that he's saying we need a single currency
[55:45.760 --> 55:49.200]  and he thinks it's going to go back up and he thinks it's going to be the best in the world
[55:49.200 --> 55:55.280]  he's there literally talking up securities he's heavily invested in in a trifecta uh at every
[55:55.280 --> 56:02.560]  level what what jack dorsy did what rogan did is textbook according to uh hacked dot com reports
[56:02.560 --> 56:07.040]  that joe rogan is is being paid about three hundred thousand dollars a month to promote
[56:07.040 --> 56:14.080]  the the the cash app that's owned by twitter and being pushed by jack dorsy and yet they do not
[56:14.080 --> 56:20.880]  disclose this to their audience you know according to sec violations or rules these are criminal
[56:20.880 --> 56:26.080]  offenses that could be prosecuted but must be investigated at the very least by independent
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.720]  journalists and yet it's those same independent journalists who are being silenced so what we
[56:30.720 --> 56:38.560]  are dealing with here alex as you know very well it is a mafia a techno mafia that both pushes
[56:38.560 --> 56:44.560]  what i believe to be financial scams and Ponzi schemes and then silences the independent journalists
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.400]  who are attempting to investigate and honestly report on those financial schemes this is fascism
[56:50.400 --> 56:57.280]  techno fascism jack dorsy is running it joe rogan is a front man for it that's clear to me now
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.480]  especially after what happened yesterday there's no reason for me to be banned off twitter other
[57:02.480 --> 57:08.080]  than the fact that i spoke out on your show alex that's what it's all about and they this is a
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.360]  message to be sent to anyone else who dares to speak out that you will be censored you'll be
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.520]  defamed lied about smeared economically sabotage cut off from your revenue streams but you know
[57:19.520 --> 57:25.520]  guess what they can't turn me i'm not surrendering to these tyrants i'm going to continue to do the
[57:25.520 --> 57:29.920]  research i'm going to continue to engage in investigative journalism and continue to report
[57:29.920 --> 57:34.240]  the truth on your show and the elsewhere good job well let's come back and talk about this mic

[59:50.080 --> 59:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:16.320]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:22.000]  i want to explain something to the globalist i want to explain some of their menus
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:30.240]  i know you guys make these deals mainly out of fear and at first you know you give into some
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:33.360]  pressure and then it's more more more more and then you're a kept creature
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:41.840]  but you're going to be like the people hanging off the helicopters kids in Saigon when it fell in
[1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:49.120]  1974 i mean that's that's where this is going the the globalist program is meant to fail it's
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:54.000]  meant to bring us all down and you think you're parlaying yourself into some you know position
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.600]  but now the position doesn't look so good when what i told you 10 years ago is now mainstream news
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:05.440]  eight years after i said it two years ago they started reporting elite secret airstrips all over
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:14.800]  new zealand tasmania kawaii underground bunkers multiple multiple year food supplies and most
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:20.160]  of these globalists have already moved their families out so wow you've really set up something
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:27.200]  really really nice and really sustainable not so my sweater's two more segments my you know
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.600]  it's not just that i know joe rogan or he'd hand me back on his podcast it's that i wasn't paying
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.520]  attention to him for years because i'm so busy about and my listeners are like dude this guy's
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:41.680]  bad news so then we started really trashing me i started actually watching and like every time
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:46.720]  i watched it was some horrible globalist scam and and i was like this guy's literally turned into
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:51.840]  a snake maybe he was always one so this isn't personal with the joe rogan thing it's just that
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:56.720]  i've got to not have any sacred cows just because i've been friends with somebody and and i respect
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  the fact that you have that leadership characteristic that that's what this is all about is doing what's
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:09.520]  hard mike well what what you and i both come to learn is that the only people that we can trust
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:14.240]  are people who are being persecuted by the establishment and that's actually uh you're
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:20.560]  being censored by twitter being deplatformed really actually gives you authority or or credibility i
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:27.120]  should say with the the real people of the world those who are never censored those who are promoted
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:34.560]  are the the snakes and the liars and the deceivers uh but being being shut off being a shadow ban
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.760]  and being deplatformed economically sabotage remember this is all part of how they attack you
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:44.480]  first they smear you they lie about you on purpose and then they silence your ability to defend
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:49.200]  yourself and this is this is what they do to trump this is what they've done to you for many years
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:53.440]  you know the the lies about you are i mean the the only person they've lied about more is president
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:58.320]  trump but they they know exactly what they're doing i'm talking about the the media establishment
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:01.360]  they know what they're doing they know that you can't defend yourself they know that if you try to
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:07.120]  defend yourself you will be shadow banned and they know that most people actually um not your
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:12.640]  listeners but sort of the brainwash public can be easily influenced and swayed by dis info
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.680]  from the new york times or cnn or you know usa today whatever or even even people like joe
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:23.200]  rogan by the way who it's not too late for joe you know he could still be a champion
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:29.440]  for humanity if he would reject the these you know these dark destructive forces and actually come
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:35.760]  out for humanity and speak out for humanity uh people can can change people can grow uh you
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:41.200]  you and i have grown over the years we've we've become more prominent in our defense of human
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:46.880]  liberty human life uh opposing abortion all of that we're just more firm now than ever but you see
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:52.080]  that's what that's what happens you you have this this polarization people either go to extreme evil
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:58.080]  or they go to extreme good and at this point alex is very clear who is with god and who's with
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:03.760]  satan at this point that's that's what's becoming clear now the mask is off the demons are out
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:09.600]  and you can tell who's defending life versus who is uh destroying life it's it's all clear now
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:14.160]  and again we're gonna roll the footage when we come back with the audio
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:21.120]  of uh of trump saying we should not kill babies after they're born and polosi refusing to stand up
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:26.720]  that clip is it's coming up we start the next segment and think about these people if i know
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:29.840]  we you gotta go to break shortly but if these people would kill their own babies do you think
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:35.280]  they wouldn't kill you or conservatives or christians or gun owners or trump supporters
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:41.680]  mass murder is what's next on the agenda and the censorship is the prelude to the mass murder that's
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:49.200]  coming you're absolutely right and it's it's just beyond chilling it's it's absolutely confirmation
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:53.360]  that not once not twice not three times but over and over again when they said let's stop
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:57.120]  killing babies after born we just saved a bunch of women from sex slavery

[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:18.240]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:30.240]  yeah there's a moment in history where cultures nations peoples civilizations decide whether
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:38.080]  they're going to go on and continue whether they're going to collapse and now our entire world
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:46.800]  is in that position humanity is choosing its destiny the censorship is accelerating the
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:54.240]  chinese social score is expanding to america the establishment is flexing its will to vertically
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:02.000]  integrate the economy and then force its anti-human directives upon us but then there's that moment
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:08.640]  when the governor of virginia says we kill babies after they're born we keep them alive because
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:13.840]  they're taking their organs and everybody starts going away that's illegal to kill a baby what was
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:19.520]  the baby before but it was a baby after but now as we were always told now it's in fantasy and then
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:26.080]  he defends it and then i don't think big league politics was part of this but clearly that was
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:32.000]  in the dirt file on the governor to keep control of it they had that the whole time in fact fraternities
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.600]  and groups get you to do that so they've got the guts one week you're having sex with a sheep the
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:42.400]  next week you're having sex with a 16 year old girl a couple years later it's a five year old kid
[1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:50.800]  and well next you gotta kill a kid so that's how this works ladies and gentlemen and so they were
[1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:54.960]  so scared of the people seeing behind the veil of how they're harvesting these organs because he
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:59.200]  slipped up that they went ahead and he said get in his file and leak it to some right wing group
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:04.800]  which i'm glad it came out but it came to smoke screen for the rest of the story there's a playbook
[1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:10.800]  it doesn't matter trumps on the trail and so he's there saying we've saved these thousands of women
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:17.200]  and children the democrat women won't get up courtes won't get up
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:23.680]  Pelosi won't get up talks about dead babies we shouldn't kill babies after they're born
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:28.880]  Pelosi looks pissed won't get up daily show makes jokes about it people are like wait a minute you're
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:33.440]  talking about killing babies after they're born this is you see because these are sick evil people
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.000]  and they know you've got a conscience so that's why they always tell you you're being bad because
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.960]  they know that that you have that place to look i did something wrong when these people have no
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:48.320]  authority over you and they literally hate you and want to kill you that's their wavelength that's
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:53.600]  their broadcast they've sunk to pure evil like mike said earlier you either resonate becoming
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.440]  better and better or you sink and the enemy knows that and they know the planet wants to resonate
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:05.680]  with god wants to go to the next level wants to literally have clear focused understanding
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:12.720]  and and and real light not deception so i want to point out they've also legalized the torture
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:17.440]  of these infants think about this that there are no limitations on the method of killing them
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:22.000]  that is now legal in new york and i don't mean to get graphic but the method we have to do it get
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.760]  into the message anything get into they can stomp on it they can use a pair of scissors a scalpel
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:32.240]  they could suffocate it to death they could put a plastic bag over its head look there there are
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:37.280]  no limits to how they can kill this baby because they do not define it as a living baby they define
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:44.880]  it as an unviable tissue mass and there's no law in their minds against torturing a piece of tissue
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:49.520]  so think about this they've legalized the torture of babies alex not just not just killing them
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.320]  and you're absolutely right that's in the bill that's in the law the same law in virginia this is
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:58.960]  their pushback to us saying don't kill babies in the seventh eighth ninth month that are viable
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:04.640]  they can be up for adoption at least inform the women oh no no we're going to we're going to keep
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:09.280]  them alive and then harvest their organs and then you're right they don't spend the money like you
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.600]  would on a dog for a ten dollar shot of lethal injection i worked for a vet used to have to
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:16.880]  help them do it i hated it but you know they were always in great pain so understood why it was still
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:21.520]  sad this is a baby they don't give them a lethal injection as you just rightly said the standard
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:27.200]  way it's done is a bag around the head or some places are so evil and into it they kicked the
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:32.320]  baby around that's been in law enforcement reports or they throw them in a bucket of water and then
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:37.520]  sometimes there's famous cases where nurses are so hurt who aren't part of that part of the facility
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:42.960]  that they get the baby out of the water because some babies can still even fight in that position
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:48.160]  and in survival instinct and they run out and hide the baby there's been famous cases where famous
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:53.440]  people have been dug out of dumpsters and we have you know in addition to this twitter censorship
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:58.560]  we we were contacted by apple this has been going on now for about two weeks and they sent us a list
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:04.800]  of articles that they say we are not allowed to publish or they will ban our app with apple
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:09.840]  and one of one of the categories that they say we cannot talk about is abortion and the other
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:16.800]  category believe it or not alex is satanism so apple is telling natural news that we're not
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:22.720]  allowed to talk about abortion or satanism or they will ban our app let's stop right there that's
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:27.680]  what it has come to have you written about this yet at natural news this is huge i i haven't had time
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:32.160]  i'm i'm gonna do a feature article on that probably tomorrow this is huge breaking news
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:38.160]  that not only as you point out it's always worse than i can even say these laws these bills that
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.040]  have passed in some areas passing and others unfortunately we stop them obviously let them
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.000]  kill the baby any means they want including torture and but let's expand on that that's
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.080]  why the governor threw in we keep them comfortable aren't you nice you're so sweet um that that now
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.840]  tim cook after teaching everybody that alex jones is banned he's now moving on to sending you what
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:06.240]  an email a letter saying we want to prove your app uh or will wow yes this is from the app development
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:11.920]  team and what they do is they they send us collections of articles that are not allowed
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:16.560]  to uh that that they say they're going to ban our app if we continue to allow those articles and
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:20.880]  those articles include of course abortion and satanism but also by the way one of the articles
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:26.880]  was an article that talked about apple censoring alex jones so they they are going to censor us
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:32.160]  if we talk about censorship and if we talk about the murder of babies and one of the other topics
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:38.000]  they won't allow us to talk about is uh illegal immigrants carrying infectious diseases into the
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:46.800]  united states so apple it's the the insanity of the censorship has reached a whole new level with
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:52.160]  apple twitter google well it's all a plan it's all a plan and you need to contact congress i think
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.800]  louis gomer needs to see this because this just shows the incredible racketeering that's going on
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.200]  they need to be subpoenaed all of this needs to come out because this is the model since we
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:06.000]  mentioned it here's president trump saying we shouldn't kill already born babies and nancy
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:12.800]  polosi will not stand here it is there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:21.600]  of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:32.000]  lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:40.400]  to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth these are living feeling beautiful babies
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:47.920]  who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world and then
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:55.360]  we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:03.680]  to defend the dignity of every person i am asking congress to pass legislation
[1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:12.240]  to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:19.600]  and then you just zoom in on the tv ad on polosi's ugly face looking so pissed now let's look at
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:23.120]  another one of these harpies another one of these demons they've been transferred from
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:28.000]  magical goddesses that they'll take care of the babies and give us life that god gave us to now
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.280]  the executioners so here's trump talking about stopping smugglers and things like this let's
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:39.600]  let's play cortege and then camila harris hear this today he leads investigations into the
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:50.480]  scourge of international sex trafficking elvin says that if i can make sure these young girls
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:58.560]  get their justice i've really done my job good pause mic mono mic's gotta go he's already five
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:03.120]  more months on the side to finish up but i gotta finish with this and get his take imagine if
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:07.600]  trump was the speaker of the house and polosi was the president and while he's talking about kidnap
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:12.640]  women and children being saved she's looking pissed looking down at papers and acting like she
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:18.320]  doesn't care they would say trump acts just gracefully and then sends out you know signals
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:23.120]  that he doesn't care about women and stuff and he would be rightfully criticized but this pig
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:28.880]  this pig and and again it's over and over again they do this mic well well yeah this is all part
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:35.200]  of the propaganda deception and you know trump just i think he just won the 2020 election by the way
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:40.640]  with that statement and we must defend life because we don't defend life then what are we here for
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.160]  if the democrats are willing to kill their own children they're willing to kill anyone we've

[1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:22.240]  first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:27.600]  block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:32.400]  brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:37.360]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:42.400]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:48.880]  compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even more

[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:37.440]  on a planetary scale which we're witnessing
[1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:45.360]  is you ambiently turn up the heat slowly until people adapt to being poisoned being dumbed
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:49.840]  down being demoralized being enslaved until suddenly like the course we kill babies after
[1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:57.200]  they're born and of course we've got human animal hybrids and the church of satans on abc cbs nbc news
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:01.760]  warning of the dangers of the vice president but mike adams can't have articles about the
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:07.040]  dangers of satanism apple says you can't do that because their symbol is the apple with a bite out
[1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:15.040]  of it the knowledge of evil it's all in your face so he's leaving us in a moment but i wanted to
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:20.560]  finish these clips here is cortez when we hear about people being saved from smuggling she doesn't
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:27.840]  stand up she doesn't clap she sits there like a demon possessed creature and just stares at him
[1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:36.880]  with death eyes here it is today he leads investigations into the scourge of international
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:47.600]  sex trafficking elvin says that if i can make sure these young girls get their justice i've
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:57.680]  really done my job thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues more than 300 women
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:09.040]  and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation and more than 1,500
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:29.280]  sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars but cortez doesn't stand up
[1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:37.120]  all right i can't watch any more of this let's go to camilla harris now camilla harris
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:42.800]  uh actually shaking your head uh on a similar statement of the president here it is
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:49.840]  how is the time for congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:59.120]  immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:09.360]  out of business look at the democrats they just look like demonic freaks and i should add
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:13.840]  they didn't stand up when he said stop human smugglers and traffickers and all this
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:17.920]  and i mean mexico is the hell off northern border these people are crazy
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:24.640]  mr millahara shaking her head i mean these are just what a bunch of narcissistic demonic people
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:31.360]  so mike in closing natural news dot com you've been censored for defending human life standing
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:35.600]  up against the latest bitcoin scams that you know corrupt billionaires are foisting on people
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:41.040]  why do you think we've seen the acceleration of the democrats in the left all of the world
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:46.960]  really coming out in defense of everything evil are they uncloking or did they or were they always
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:52.000]  this evil or like you suggested it's like an order has gone down a a transmission has gone out
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.200]  that has really activated them in there they're getting more vicious by the minute
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:00.720]  well they've always been this evil but it's been covert and i think this is their reaction to the
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:07.280]  mass awakening that is happening and that's that credit goes to people like you and and info wars
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:14.240]  the independent media all around has been waking people up globally and that awakening is accelerating
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:22.960]  and this is why the reaction now is a panic decloaking by the the pro satan you know pro pro demon
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:31.040]  left to accelerate their schedule of exterminating human life and and by the way i you know we we
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:39.920]  say that but it's real it's not a metaphor they are working to exterminate human life on our planet
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.440]  you've written about it the new york times they're they're all coming out saying humans are bad
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.600]  let's get rid of all of them it absolutely will all be dead it's going to be so wonderful
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:53.040]  we need a world government to kill everybody that's the cult it's a death cult they they
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:57.520]  openly talk about it they openly talk about eliminating 90 of the human population they
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:02.720]  say people are bad they say carbon dioxide is bad and that's of course a product of human
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:08.640]  respiration and this so-called green new deal now being pushed by ocasio portes if you think about
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:14.720]  what she is demanding she's demanding not only an end to all commercial air travel in america
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:19.920]  she's also demanding the mass slaughter of all cows and eventually the mass slaughter of all
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:25.920]  humans because those are the primary sources of a new dark age that's what the global carbon
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:31.440]  tax system is a new dark age yes yes and and they're going to justify the extermination of human
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:37.040]  beings through this green new deal kind of logic to say that in order to save the planet they have
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:43.840]  to exterminate humans but really their goal is not to save the planet not to not to save anybody
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:49.200]  their goal is utter destruction because they are demonically possessed destroyers of worlds
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:54.400]  you know this this is much bigger than politics this is much bigger than current events this is
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:00.800]  as i said yesterday on your show this is a cosmic biblical scale war this is the full
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:05.520]  offensive exactly we've been facing and christ talked about it everybody knows at the gut level
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.360]  and and again the san francisco elite all believe they're in contact with this they believe this is
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.760]  is an enlightenment to do all this i mean how insane is that but literally we've been probed
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:21.920]  before there's been an emissary here but this is the main offensive invasion about to happen
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:27.120]  it is and and remember the greatest trick of the devil is to convince you that he does not exist
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:32.400]  and many of these people you know some people are wholly possessed by a demonic entity other people
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:37.680]  are simply influenced by demonic entities and they're still partially human but believe me alex
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.320]  some some of these people on the left are no longer human this is critical to realize you are not
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:48.400]  dealing with their eyes all so big all these silicon people even under heavy lights they
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:54.880]  expect they're on hardcore drugs huge pupils well yeah they're the whatever divinity they might have
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:58.880]  been born with is long gone they don't have a divine spirit anymore and that's why they're
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:03.840]  capable of murdering babies that's why they're capable of all the attacks and slander and lies
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:10.240]  and deception the democrats have been overtaken by pure evil and defeating the democrats is
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:16.640]  not a political victory it is a cosmic divine victory against pure evil and we have to keep
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:20.720]  that in mind no matter what we do alex and i appreciate you you having me on i appreciate
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.760]  what you do you know i'm fighting just as well we we uh this fight has only just begun it's
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:30.880]  going to get a lot worse for us alex i hope we're both ready for it because it the attacks are coming
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  but in the end god wins god wins and i'm on the side of god you know there's just no that's not
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:43.760]  negotiable that's that's that's it i i don't i don't care what threats they level against me

[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:56.480]  human liberty and the divine end of story that would be much easier if people stop believing
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.680]  silicon valley's lies and looked at everywhere they're openly telling people i mean quitter
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:07.600]  before they ban us would send us messages and would have their executives call here and tell us
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:12.000]  this is what you can say what you can't say it's literal yes social conditioning mike adams god

[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:14.000]  politician uh donald trump who do you think would be most prone to dressing like this
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:21.600]  not good dressing like that is one of those i mean i don't think like donald trump because
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.240]  he's like i don't agree who do you think would be prone to dressing like this
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.280]  trump which politician do i think it is trump
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:42.320]  donald trump uh trump i'm gonna go with donald trump yeah what makes you think it's donald
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:49.600]  trump because he's a fastest racist pig do you have any evidence for that plenty give me one
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:56.960]  one well i could uh i'm i'm on video i'm not gonna grab her by them
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:06.000]  you think that's racist that's extremely sexist yes it's a good one uh i don't know bush um
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:15.680]  george w bush that's katlyn bennett and it's a it's a very powerful video uh martin luther king
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:22.640]  do you think martin luther king is in a kkk hood oh the kkk um either so the full report
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:28.560]  is up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com liberals think it was trump in ralph northam's
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:34.400]  racist photo and then you know the first five minutes is her asking him questions and then the
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:40.800]  next five minutes is her saying by the way that's a democrat governor northam and then they go well
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:46.160]  i don't care now it was a long time ago but since they thought it was trump without her even saying that
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:52.800]  he was evil so that's the double thing that's the brainwashing that's how wrecked these brains
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:58.800]  are how soft and stupid and we're not cherry picking you go to universities you go to trendy
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:07.760]  areas it's like these people are dead already they are so stupid what was weird is a few people
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:12.320]  that had foreign accents they knew who it was and what was going on it's it's just insane
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:19.680]  it's so dangerous too folks you know the more prosecutors uh from the whole
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:25.600]  Mueller witch hunt have just uh left they've just resigned from it that's in the news people
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:30.560]  saying oh that signals the witch hunt is about to end no it doesn't signal that
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:36.480]  it signals that that phase and that now congress is going to start all these other fake investigations
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:44.400]  that aren't russia-based 84 of them and trump tweeted about it this morning he said so now
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:49.520]  congressman adam schiff announces after having found zero russian collusion and he's going to be
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:55.280]  looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there's no reason to be
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:03.520]  doing so never happened before unlimited presidential harassment yeah if trump calls for a criminal
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:07.520]  investigation of hillary they go he's meddling with the justice department involving politics when
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:12.640]  that's his power to do it but when congress does all these witch hunts when they're the ones in bed
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:17.280]  with the russians and stuff it's just a okay so you just saw part of that clip with the
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:22.560]  kaitlyn benefit just goes to all this ignorant she's joining us along with millie weaver uh
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:26.800]  another great info wars dot com uh reporter they also have their own news organizations
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:30.800]  they're just contributors here we're very proud to have them working with us but i want to be
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:36.320]  too unduly punished by the corporate board for the other great work but both of these ladies
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:44.320]  in just the last um month just a cursor review i have reached more than 30 million people online
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:49.120]  so very very exciting that's not hits that's that's views and then they're just going out and showing
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.920]  what's really going on and there's another video coming up we'll play a little bit of at the start
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:57.760]  of the next hour for our next guest joins that millie did which is so so painful i i had to watch it
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:04.320]  but she calls up and schedules the uh third trimester at birth killing of her new baby that
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:07.920]  she has coming in about a month of course she wasn't really planning to do it but it's just
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:13.040]  it's so criminal that even though i know her and her husband they're great folks for many years
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.040]  i know she's a great person illustrating it i couldn't help but getting mad at her even watching
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:21.440]  her make the call even though i knew that she was doing it to illustrate it that's how this is a
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:29.840]  mother scheduling the dismemberment of her baby and i mean so i'm ranting here let's just start
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:35.440]  with that first lady's good to have you here what do you make of this governor of virginia
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:40.080]  the democrats defending it not standing up when trump says it's wrong to do this i mean it really
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:47.040]  seems like they're showing us how evil they are oh definitely i think that you know if in fact
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:54.480]  we are going to allow the democrats to go forward and continue making late term abortions legalized
[1:38:54.480 --> 1:39:02.240]  in all 50 states then our society has reached a level of debauchery that matches or surpasses
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.680]  sodomy and gamora i mean it's pretty disgusting and it was hard for me alex to be able to make
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:13.920]  that phone call but i know that i needed to illustrate that to people that it is that accessible
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:20.000]  and available for women to kill babies in their ninth month of pregnancy now of course i didn't
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.520]  fall through or even think about going to the clinic uh and doing like a james o'keith project
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:29.840]  veritas style undercover report because i was too creeped out it i mean it almost seemed like an
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:34.720]  abortion mill that you could wake up on a table and next thing you know your baby's out of you
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:39.440]  because you signed some uh power of attorney form from a doctor or something so that's why i
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:44.480]  oh oh millie great idea to do this i'm not even criticizing you i mean i i mean i admire you
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:50.560]  i'm saying at just a cellular level watching a mother even you know call that she can call a
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:57.200]  place to kill a baby after it's born it was just so viscerally hard to watch imagine actually seeing
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:02.320]  it really happened uh it's just incredible uh i gotta tell you though everybody should go watch
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:07.120]  the video it's on info wars dot com and news wars dot com and share it how to schedule abortion at
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:12.080]  nine months uh this is very very powerful uh information katelyn Bennett what was it like
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:18.240]  for you to watch that video well when they told me that they were doing it i was super i was kind
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:24.960]  of excited because i was like finally someone's going to you know basically bring delight how
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:31.440]  easy it is to do this because the the law tries to say that it's only in extreme cases and millie
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:35.840]  proved that it wasn't she was able to say well how do i go through those blue pools to say what if i
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:42.640]  have depression or you know what if i'm sick or what if i just you know i'm mentally unable to
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.120]  have this baby and these we're saying yeah go through with it we'll determine those things when
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:52.560]  you have the ultrasound i think it's so important that she did this video it did make me sad because
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:56.320]  i was still you know just like you said you know she wasn't going through with it but it
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:02.800]  still made you sad to watch it but at the end of the day she uncovered how it's not just
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:09.120]  these small rare cases it's anything you know just as long as the doctor says okay yeah you
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.880]  aren't fit to be a parent we can take this baby out and kill it uh you know right before birth so
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:20.080]  i think what she did was great and it's so important and the next exactly the next big
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:28.160]  shoot a drop is this is this degenerate uh demon governor of virginia he is a orthopedic uh no
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:33.200]  he's a surgeon that does not orthopedics like muscles and bones he is the look at the type
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:39.200]  but because read his bio he's the specific type of surgeon that does surgeries on organs on babies
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:43.760]  and then i knew that because they keep catching these big hospitals selling the organs and keeping
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:49.520]  babies alive and then sure enough that's where this whole rabbit trail uh is leading us well one
[1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:55.920]  of the false talking points that these pro-abortion advocates are making is that abortion is required
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:02.000]  to save women's lives and if you actually listen to ob gyns and former abortionists what they'll
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.880]  tell you is that they've never actually had to perform an abortion to save a woman's life
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:12.320]  because abortion procedures take up to three days it can take up to three days to dilate the cervix
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:17.520]  enough to evacuate the baby in a saline abortion which is the only type of abortion that's illegal
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:23.760]  for late trimester so if actually a woman was an immediate need for help what they do and they
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:29.440]  have always done is they deliver the baby via c-section and if the baby's born early it's taken
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:34.640]  off to nique you at least the babies are given a fighting chance to survive what hillary clinton and
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:40.160]  these feminists are pushing is intentionally killing a baby in advance and then days later
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:45.760]  delivering it that's not saving women's lives that's killing babies and they're getting caught
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:50.080]  everywhere selling the body parts so now they're trying to pass laws to keep the babies alive after
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:56.080]  so that they can get around that i mean this is beyond charlie manson and and share and take
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:14.480]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.560]  and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.360]  chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:31.920]  side effects we have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy drink
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:38.160]  pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else like it you must experience it it is
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:43.920]  a total game changer it comes in easy to use packets to mix them with fruit juice or water whatever
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:49.040]  you'd like warning though it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half packet the first
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.560]  time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:44:02.080]  turbo force and enforce live com i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:09.440]  and i've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:17.040]  most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:22.400]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when trump won
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:28.320]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what political action did
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:34.960]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in force down this is a fight
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:41.040]  about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country

[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:51.120]  right now live on this thursday february 7th 2019 transmission we're gonna go right back to them
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:58.000]  but i want to tell tv viewers viewer discretion is advised i told you this back at the start of the
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:08.720]  first hour well my goodness traces that i was going to air footage of post birth abortions
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:18.240]  now we've obtained footage of four post birth abortions these are human beings
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:29.040]  being brutally murdered in front of broad daylight in front of medical personnel and in
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:34.240]  front of everybody and we're going to air this footage right now ladies and gentlemen a partial
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:39.920]  birth abortion like the president said how are you doing this radio listeners all describe it
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:47.600]  how are you doing this when the baby's already born because remember post birth abortion is
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:52.480]  the same thing as killing granny remember newsweek the case for killing granny and what bill gates
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:56.720]  is pushing the idea that killing off and not taking care of each other makes us a better
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:01.680]  society you know it makes us a worse society so for tv viewers let's go ahead and roll
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:08.160]  a footage from 1963 a post birth abortion in dealie plaza dallas texas go ahead and roll it
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:14.720]  please this is a subredor film president john f kennedy in dallas before he was going to come to
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:21.840]  austin and boom shot in the neck and then shot in the front of the head and the whole back and
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:26.800]  side of the head blows out now pbs can show that will have complaints just where alex jones
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.640]  and by the way i'm not being sarcastic this is a post birth abortion how old was kennedy when he
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:39.120]  got killed and the deep state wanted him dead so they aborted him right there abort means kill
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:45.840]  let me show you from saudi arabia this is somebody else being a post post post birth abortion
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:53.920]  okay and so they again take dare a sword and cut your head off right there folks this is a woman
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:50:00.080]  that uh didn't do what her husband said and so here you go here goes the post birth abortion
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.640]  because that's what it is you're killing someone outside the womb and if you're offended by this
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:11.760]  you know i'm sorry the stuff they show kids shows is is is 10 times worse this is real though
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:17.200]  and this is what's happening and then of course you can we can show you senna a famous race car
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:24.000]  driver dying in a world champion race and uh that's post birth abortion except it wasn't conscious
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:30.240]  he chose to get in the arena so going back to you ladies there uh if we actually tried to show an
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:34.320]  abortion and you can get footage of partial birth abortions i've watched it only a few times and
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.000]  i can't look at it we're not going to show that here because we really care about babies and we
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.080]  can see kennedy killed or see a poor woman get her head chopped off it's terrible and i borderline
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:46.560]  don't do it just like it upsets me to see millie calling to schedule the execution of her new baby
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:50.640]  that's coming when even though she wasn't planning and she's doing it to stop it it's visceral i get
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.600]  why people are upset but you should be upset folks so that we can protect children and not let this
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:04.640]  happen uh millie uh kaitlyn you want to comment on that i mean yeah millie you know my point from
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:12.400]  this angle of of of this this is post birth abortion yeah so i really thought that you're
[1:51:12.400 --> 1:51:18.000]  going to show like a post birth abortion and then i saw the video and i was like one that's clever
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.480]  because it's true those are literally the same things um i think you know the only thing i've
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:29.360]  been thinking about is the state of the union how none of the women in white none of the democrats
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:35.120]  stood and clapped when president trump said he wants them to push for legislation that would ban
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:42.240]  abortions when the baby can feel pain these people don't think that this is murder and i don't know
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:47.280]  how to convince them that it is because they chant and scream in the streets that it's just a bundle
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:53.520]  of cells when it's not this is the party that values science to push up our taxes because they
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.800]  think climate change is happening but they they completely just throw science out the window
[1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:03.120]  when we talk about abortion and how it's murder and i don't know how to convince them otherwise
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:08.400]  well look they're not the party of science they claim they're the party of tyranny and the party
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:12.880]  of evil and they want to dehumanize life they want us to think humans are bad and humans are the
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:18.080]  problems we don't value ourselves and don't stand up for ourselves millie weaver why do you think
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:24.560]  the democrats are coming out in the open like this well i wanted to answer the first part the first
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:31.040]  question you asked katelyn there about you know what i thought about the afterbirth abortions
[1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:36.240]  katelyn recently posted a video on twitter that went mega viral where you know a father was out
[1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:41.840]  with his daughter at a woman's march promoting abortion and trying to deny that it was murder
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:48.160]  then he turns around and says to katelyn that he's going to afterbirth abortion her you know he's
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:54.320]  gonna late term abortion her and so he acknowledges then that essentially it's killing you're talking
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:53:00.240]  about killing a person and you know that's one of the things that hillary clinton was trying to get
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:04.960]  out from underneath during her debate with trump during the 2016 presidential campaign
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:10.720]  she was trying to say oh well this is necessary for women's health and trump was saying well
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:15.520]  she's actually saying that babies are going to be drug from the womb moments before birth
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:21.120]  and that's exactly what the democrats are now pushing for and they're using the talking point
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:26.240]  that this is to save women's health that it's medically necessary when it's not medically
[1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:31.760]  necessary to kill babies you'll ride up into the until their due date you can just deliver them
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:38.320]  and allow them to live but then again this isn't about women's bodies women's choices we're talking
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:42.800]  about whether or not they're going to allow for the killing of babies because i don't think most
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:49.760]  conservatives are actually objecting to babies being delivered prematurely if the mother is in
[1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:54.240]  a serious that's all a giant red herring everything's right herring look they want to keep the babies
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:58.640]  alive so they can get the organs that's why they're trying to pass these laws as a cover
[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.960]  but since you mentioned it that video i think you have like 18 million views just on twitter alone
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:06.640]  facebook i mean so when i say you guys have got like 30 million views last few weeks it's way more
[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:10.960]  than that which again shows people's hunger and that's one reason kaitlyn vennett and others i've
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:15.760]  noticed people are attacking you and the ben Shapiro's and people because they think they own
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:20.640]  conservatism they they're gods you have to understand and when they see you without you being pushed by
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.200]  the google algorithm getting more views than them that's very upsetting to ben Shapiro and other
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:29.120]  people and then other people join in on making fun of you because you're right out of college
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:33.680]  and and and and also working with millie doing a great job and they're just jealous of you so
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:39.040]  uh it's it's pathetic and it's why i hate these people you know ben Shapiro ought to feel good
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:44.400]  that there are a lot of smart young uh attractive women and others out there taking action but again
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:48.560]  these people are monopoly men and it's why i hate their guts uh you want to comment on that
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:54.480]  yeah so i've always said that the mainstream conservative people that i actually used to
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:59.440]  look up to i used to look up to ben Shapiro i used to look up to the conservative millennial
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:05.440]  um a whole but matt walsh i used to look up to all of these people and now i see that they're mad
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:11.520]  because i didn't wait my turn i didn't go through crtv it didn't go through the blaze it didn't go
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:18.240]  through all of these g.o.p you know rhino websites or something like that i didn't wait my turn i went
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.440]  out there i was me i left turning yeah you smashed through the glass ceiling and and your average
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:29.200]  video gets a million views and that's that's more than them and they're pissed yeah i mean i was with
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:34.240]  turning point usa at one point and then i realized that that wasn't the brand of conservatism for me
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:41.600]  i didn't like the run of the mill g.o.p stances that they took so i left i did my own thing and i
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:47.280]  am so proud of myself for what i've been able to accomplish and if that bothers the run of the mill
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:53.760]  conservatives conservatives and uh the rhino g.o.p establishment then i'm doing my job well also
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:59.120]  ben Shapiro and a few others put on this affected super intellectual thing with their talking points
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:04.160]  to look really smart to a libtard that's like that's not hard these people came and talk and then
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:07.760]  you're a young woman with a nice southern voice they make fun of you you know that like you're
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:12.800]  stupid and and oh so there's the conservative guys all these little dumb women women you just sit
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.160]  over it they're all the same and and it makes me sick how it's the democrats that tell women we
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:23.360]  own you it's the fake conservative movement tells women we own you and it no they don't own anybody
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:28.320]  and i'm sick of it i've got three daughters i want them to absolutely be as successful as any man
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:33.680]  or more successful that's what real conservatives want is what the west has done we're conserving
[1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:39.040]  our idea of really turning loose the power of women to make our lives better their lives better
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:43.600]  and to be strong mothers we want women know how to use guns women know how to fight women know how
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:48.560]  to cook women know how to kill we want women to know how to do everything that's what we want
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:54.320]  and but it's only real conservatives and christians that want that and real conservative women
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:00.160]  actually do want to advocate for women's rights and that's why kaitlyn has said so many times about
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:06.400]  how important it is for women to carry to be able to have a gun to protect herself and that's what
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:14.080]  really pisses them off about her exactly exactly it's sick it's sick they want to capitalize women
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:19.840]  women's rights these feminist movements when in reality most of what feminists are pushing actually
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:25.360]  hurts women in the long term if you want to talk about abortion well what's happening with abortion
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:31.040]  in our society right now is it's an underlying symptom of the destruction of the male and female
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:38.960]  dynamic and it's simply a symptom of the debauchery that our society has happened after the women's
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:44.800]  sexual liberation absolutely which was nothing but a thing to destroy the family and again it was

[1:59:54.320 --> 2:00:08.480]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:14.720]  you know the number one thing i think you should teach your daughters or your sons but
[2:00:14.720 --> 2:00:20.960]  women particularly is how to be confident and how to not let other people manipulate their
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:29.120]  emotions or control them and how to kill and in good cultures women are brought right along
[2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:33.520]  with the men and taught how to kill people and i'm not somebody looking to kill anybody
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:37.360]  but that's how women particularly get preyed on by predators is because they don't have
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:42.800]  the killer instinct honed and most men have had this removed as well the killer instinct doesn't
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:48.160]  mean you're a killer it means you're ready to kill if you have to to protect yourself and that's why
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:54.080]  the establishment is especially the leftists are so afraid of empowered women like millie weaver
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:58.720]  and of course like katlyn bennett so in closing ladies we salute you we appreciate you and all
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:03.840]  the work you're doing and it's just so exciting to follow all that tell people how they follow your

[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:25.760]  die after they're born and he says i'll kill you so so tell us how folks follow you but then also

[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:47.680]  about the rest of that video there's actually a whole longer video where uh that man that said
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:53.120]  that he would late term abort me would he was yelling at my friend showing his daughter that
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:57.600]  girl right there in the red maga hat he was pointing to her and telling his daughter don't
[2:01:57.600 --> 2:02:02.080]  end up like her she's an idiot don't end up like these women they're they're terrible people
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:07.200]  and right in front of his daughter he said that he would murder me for justice for telling his
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:13.440]  daughter the truth uh so these people know that abortion is murder they know exactly what it is
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:18.080]  they just don't want to admit it because you have the live stream i went and watched it in
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:21.920]  the course of you know the 32nd one's the one that got 20 something million views or whatever it is now
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:26.960]  last time i checked but in full context he was already in your face now here's the video
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:33.120]  do you know what the number one cause of death in the united states is it's abortion no actually
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:41.840]  i it's abortion shei you have a right to one abortion is murder shei stay away from her your
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:47.760]  daddy would have killed you if you do it to me i'll abort you after you'll abort abort me after
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:54.480]  term yes like late term abortion you add a women's march you just said you would murder me i'm not
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:03:03.440]  against uh justice that guy's a total cuck want to be tough guy who then shoots his mouth off of
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:10.400]  it people what what a punk what a what a piece of crap millie what a piece of crap uh where do you
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:17.120]  see this going well i think that it's obvious that the democrats know that abortion is murder
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:21.680]  they just want to deny it because it doesn't fit their political agenda but they'll use children
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:26.240]  when it comes to pushing their agenda against trump and uh saying oh the children are being
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:31.520]  put in cages on the border which was all falls or saying oh we need to ban guns because of the
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:35.840]  children at schools which we know that if there were guns in schools the children would be safer
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:40.720]  so they're more than capable of using children for their political agenda don't you love him telling
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:46.880]  his five-year-old daughter like you can get one too baby you can cure your babies what a freaking
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:51.920]  man i'll be honest with you i mean i don't i'm not calling for violence but i just that's why i can't
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:56.400]  go out in public a lot that guy thinks he's so tough man oh my god i i'll be honest at an instinctive
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:02.160]  level i'm just like i mean it was just like that guy is a piece of garbage well i want to say that
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:07.600]  you can also find more of katlyn's reports on her youtube channel liberty hangout which i know
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  that she said has recently generated i think around 30 000 plus new subscribers just in this

[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.240]  men should pair on a few other people that i know have been joining in on it and it's just uh
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:50.960]  it's it's not what's going to win the planet back from the globalists it's pretty sad

[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:13.840]  like a dog the symbolism of we've saved all these women from sex slavery and children and
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:18.320]  made thousands of arrested convictions and the democrats shaking their heads angry

[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:41.440]  plug last hour and i've told people i'm my own worst enemy because the way we fund ourselves
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:45.520]  is not the ads your own radio stations that's for local stations the network i fund ourselves
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:53.200]  with books t-shirt sales uh supplements water filtration air filtration and everything we sell
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:57.680]  needs to be the best because i want you to really get a good response so i go out and say what's
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:01.520]  the highest rated what's the what's the best system out there for the lowest price for air
[2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:07.440]  filtration and that's the election pure breeze um now everything's getting cheaper because of
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:11.200]  menstruation things but when i first started selling it three years ago the leading competitor

[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:22.320]  helps places like texas with all these allergies as soon as i go outside it's like oh but inside i've
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:28.720]  got them the election pure breeze right there it's awesome also we've got the election pure

[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.400]  from the top company i go and say will you private label and then they do but i got a
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:54.640]  side of contract and i'm so demonized i won't say who they are same thing with the toothpaste
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:59.520]  same thing with but but ours is proprietary the top organic non fluoride maker in the
[2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:03.200]  country everybody knows its name the factory that makes theirs makes ours but we had the
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:08.560]  colloidal silver and the iodine is proprietary and we took three fillers out that are in the other
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:14.640]  top range so that you're not just getting a bunch of sand basically but you're getting all product
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:20.880]  so it's concentrated one tube of super blue toothpaste is like two regular tubes it's amazing
[2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:27.920]  so it's all there 50 off on the brain force plus uh and turbo force combo that is a huge

[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:50.560]  is the top company we have an agreement they'll even let us say their name but i might say their
[2:09:50.560 --> 2:09:58.800]  name we private label it they sell for 40 bucks at all these you know big uh drug stores we normally
[2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:03.440]  sell it for 30 it's 2217 right now we're not making much money on this because we have to
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.120]  they had to pay for all the fda approval all the rest of it and we have to pay a lot for it but
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:15.680]  super silver is private labeled the strongest nano silver legally on the market not for internal
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:22.320]  digestion folks but you put it on wounds and things this is what's used in hospitals it's in fact
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:28.960]  there's some debates like is the prescription stuff even really safe because i mean this is already

[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:36.720]  invasion uh i mean it's just it's like everywhere the crazies have gotten crazier they're supporting
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.160]  aborting babies after they're born on tv they're supporting women being kidnapped and sex slavery
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:48.880]  cortez won't stand for that any of them i mean it's like they've gone from evil to openly like
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:56.080]  something out of a cartoon a do you agree with that uh activist mommy and b why why is it happening
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:04.480]  what's what's going on absolutely uh alex the nation has been reeling ever since quomo signed
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:11.040]  and celebrated the execution of babies up to 40 weeks by lighting up the world trade center pink
[2:12:12.240 --> 2:12:18.320]  my inboxes have been absolutely slammed with citizens who are outraged who are distressed
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:24.240]  and who are saying i am done with sitting on the sidelines help me get on the front lines what can
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:31.440]  we do to end the bloodshed and so we have organized on february 23rd just a couple of weeks away from
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:40.000]  now the day of mourning we are calling for the whole nation to mourn and repent over the sin
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:46.640]  of abortion we are asking the nation to do four things number one wear black number two do not
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:52.800]  shop number three close down your businesses if you have a business you can close down and lastly
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.080]  pray with your friends and church or in your home have a gathering a prayer gathering
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:04.800]  and repent for the sin of abortion ultimately this is not just a horizontal problem alex it's a
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:09.680]  vertical problem that we've got to get right with god that our hearts are not more concerned
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:16.800]  with the bloodshed of these babies also we are holding a large rally right in the devil
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.360]  devil's lair in albany new york where the legislation was signed literally underneath
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:31.280]  the state house at the very well known empire state plaza convention center room that holds 2400
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:39.120]  people we're going to be there with speakers like the benham brothers and david j harris jr the black
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.240]  conservative uh that many of your listeners are probably familiar with many of us are going to be
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:51.120]  there sharing inspiring the listeners but most importantly getting on our faces before god
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:57.520]  and pleading with him not to judge our country because we are due for a very stiff judgment and
[2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:02.400]  and that's what you're saying is absolutely on target these globalists know in this weird satanic
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:07.440]  alchemy that they can get us to do evil it opens the gate up and i use the golden child analogy
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:10.800]  that any murphy movie but they want to get the golden child to eat the blood of a dead kid so
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:17.040]  that he's not protected basically they want the hedge taken down and that's why they celebrate
[2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:22.480]  killing babies already born they celebrate openly doing it in cortex looking at trump with pure
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:28.240]  murderous hate when he's against abortion of already born babies i mean these these people know
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:35.440]  what they're doing alex i am pleading with your listeners to please your viewers to go to day
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:42.080]  of mourning dot org you will find there um that we have a petition you can sign you will find an
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:47.280]  event bright event so that you can register for the event and it will email you your ticket so
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:53.120]  you can get into the albany new york event uh you will find a poster a sign that you can print
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:58.960]  out if you are a business owner you can place that sign on the front door of your business to show
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:03.840]  that you are standing in solidarity with the pre-born for the day of mourning i totally agree
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:08.720]  and this could be a chain reaction i'll wear black uh everybody else should wear black and and then
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.800]  everybody i think even the next day too should wear black and tell people about the event that
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:17.520]  happened because i think a catalyst has been reached i think a flashpoint happened with this
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:22.560]  evil governor talking about keeping them comfortable and killing them and all the rest of it i think
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:28.720]  of i feel a flashpoint with the covington boys and everything i feel a real turning around has
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:33.600]  happened if we take the initiative yeah you're right um you know i kind of got my finger on the
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:40.400]  pulse of culture because of what i do and let me tell you i have never seen uh such righteous anger
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:46.240]  since i would say in 2015 when the Center for Medical Progress Planned Parenthood videos came

[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:39.440]  i'm not to say this be patronizing because it's the truth when you meet democrat women that are
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:46.480]  in charge they're like weird narcissistic ignorant kind of quirky mentally ill people that like don't
[2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:51.840]  exist they're like you pull a string and they just say things like alexandria cortez or pelosi
[2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:58.080]  but then you get around women that are christian and conservative and nationalist like my grandmothers
[2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:04.160]  or my mom and they're like smart and cool and and and neat much more so compared to the average
[2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:11.760]  executive who's a man you run into and then liberals talk all day about how and left is how
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:18.000]  smart they are and npr and and and and you know how great they are and how they're going to empower
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:22.480]  women and then i go to these democratic events and our crucial and we're not cherry picking
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:28.800]  man it's like they have lobotomies it's they're stupid and they're hateful and uh they they they
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:35.360]  revel and killing their babies and it's like central casting for satan's losers or something and then
[2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:39.920]  you've got somebody like the activist mommy here with her new book i can't wait to read it
[2:21:39.920 --> 2:21:45.440]  not on my watch well this is going to be destined to be a a best-seller who's powerful and beautiful
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:51.280]  and effective and smart and has 10 kids and it's just all this success and standing up for unborn
[2:21:51.280 --> 2:21:57.840]  babies and standing up for born babies now that's how far this is gone and it's like she's not the
[2:21:57.840 --> 2:22:02.480]  only one if you went to christian event with real christians or a conservative event it's like all
[2:22:02.480 --> 2:22:06.320]  the women are like that they could be black they could be white they could be hispanic it's like
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:10.080]  you know i'm married and stuff but it's like god the most sexy women you've ever seen her at a bible
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:14.800]  study and then you've got all these slave women over here working for the devil worrying with
[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:18.880]  the system and they have no idea where the real power is with god and stepping into your real
[2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:25.520]  femininity and you've got all these weird leftist women in their weird white kkk outfits so tone
[2:22:25.520 --> 2:22:31.280]  deaf with their own garbage they don't even see what they're doing who won't stand and clap for
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:38.000]  the unborn or a child already born they're so blind they don't know elizabeth what's wrong with them
[2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:43.760]  yeah how dare those women at the state of the union address wear white when they have the blood of
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:50.000]  millions of babies on their hands as they have continued to fight for legislation to kill these
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:57.840]  babies i do call myself the anti-feminist the first video that i did that went uh extremely viral
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:23:05.840]  was the uh initial women's march that took place in i think 2016 and uh that one i think got 15
[2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:11.200]  million views where i basically uh mocked and laughed at the vagina hatters and showed them to
[2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:16.160]  be the hypocrites that they are but uh yeah the anti-feminist is the title actually of one of the
[2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:22.080]  chapters in my book not on my watch i'm really proud of this book i believe that it's going to
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:29.040]  inspire a lot of everyday ordinary citizens because that's what i am a very ordinary citizen
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:34.960]  getting off of the sidelines and on the front lines of the cultural war to save our children from
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:41.440]  the cultural Marxists who are determined to destroy us my book not on my watch is everywhere books
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:46.480]  are sold right now you can pre-order it right now some places are already shipping the book
[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:52.080]  and again it has a lot of my backstory and a lot of inspiring stories about things that we've done
[2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:58.240]  like the global movement to shut down pornographic sex education we shut down sex brothels we dealt
[2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:03.520]  a huge blow to Teen Vogue magazine which five months later had to go out of print because of it
[2:24:03.520 --> 2:24:10.080]  um i am just a very simple ordinary very busy homeschool mom and if i you're not ordinary and
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:15.120]  we all know it elizabeth but seriously because this isn't about it's true and i know you've
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:19.280]  seen everybody seen it you go around left as they look like they've had their soul sucked out you get
[2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:23.760]  around real questions not the fake ones but the real ones they're like on fire like you're just
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:28.240]  glowing right now or we're talking and everything you're saying and don't people see the difference
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:33.280]  don't they don't they know the difference why don't they understand it well thank you alex i
[2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:37.440]  appreciate that and i want to meet your listeners i want to meet your viewers and i'm asking your
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:44.400]  viewers to please come meet me um i'll sign my book for you i want to pray with you at this event
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:51.840]  on february 23rd that is two saturdays from now in alvany new york we have a fabulous venue fabulous
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:56.000]  speakers again you're going to the epicenter where they just passed the law to kill babies
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:01.040]  after they're born and even torture them we are literally underneath the state house building it's
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.680]  like it's like satan thought he had crushed us but he didn't realize we were seeds so we're
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:10.960]  going to be the seeds underneath the ground where they signed that legislation and because of it we
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:17.760]  are going to rise i know you have a lot of generous um listeners and i am asking them to please help
[2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:24.080]  us and donate we have 20 000 of expenses right now and we do not have the money to pay for this event
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:29.280]  it's so frustrating alex george soros and his minions have all the money in the world and i just
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:34.960]  need 20 000 to help rescue these babies and call our nation to repentance over this blood
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:40.960]  absolutely and then i think this broadcast is about where people feel led to give this is a great place to do it we we we we just
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:45.920]  need the fuel and the energy to get our people in place and to fight these globalists and to take
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:50.480]  them on soros put 80 plus billion in the last year trying to crush the liberty movement worldwide
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:55.920]  he totally panicked he he committed his entire arsenal no 38 billion excuse me his entire arsenal
[2:25:55.920 --> 2:26:01.680]  and everybody and it still is failing so day of mourning very very exciting that's coming up getting
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:05.760]  back to this though because you said you have your finger on the pulse and i agree with you and i have
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:13.120]  mine on the pulse i have seen just the last three weeks the the the the commitment the energy the
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:20.240]  focus the dedication uh explode by conservatives and nationalists and christians and i think it was
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:24.640]  the covington kids triggered it and if we didn't have activist reporters out there documenting it
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:28.960]  like our reporters did we wouldn't have known and we didn't have you out there and we didn't have
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:34.080]  tatland bennett out there and millie weaver that's why other listeners have to know if you can't
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:39.120]  donate fine or if you can't even spread the word you can get a youtube channel on the enemy platform
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:45.200]  or you can go out and and just videotape what's happening our eyes and ears being out there
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:51.520]  hitting the streets is critical absolutely and like i said i've not seen rage like this
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:58.800]  in concern and uh desire to activate since the plant parenthood videos that expose the undercover
[2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:04.880]  videos exposed that they were selling the baby body parts but this would even trump that amazingly
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:09.520]  people are just sick of the bloodshed and we know what's going on we know that the left is
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:17.440]  panicked because um ginsberg is probably going to to um die soon and they know that trump is going
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.920]  to get another supreme court pick and they are horrified that they're not going to be able to
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:26.960]  kill these babies they're horrified that they are not going to be able to offer the blood of these
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:34.400]  babies up to you know ultimately the god of convenience and sacrifice these children it's
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:40.400]  unthinkable but they're actually horrified by this and so they're now going to do this effort of state
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:47.600]  by state new york virginia they're all going to try to get uh abortion legal through all 40 weeks
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:53.520]  so that they don't lose the opportunity to shed blood look we are done with half measures we are
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:59.520]  done with this oh just don't kill the baby as long as they're you know 20 weeks no we need to end
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:04.480]  all the killing and we need to repent in the church of our bigotry alix because we're concerned
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:08.880]  about a baby killed at 40 weeks but we're not so concerned about the baby when they're just nine
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:13.520]  weeks no you're right we've compromised and now they're saying we're going to kill grandma we're
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:18.720]  going to kill newborn kids that's the globalist un model peter chagr that's like the head guru of
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:23.920]  of pita and the kind of the head transhumanist he wrote in books 30 years ago we need to perish
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:30.160]  be able to kill their kids up to age three yes you know exactly how it works you know your your
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:35.680]  viewers have probably read um the book the naked communists and they know how the marx
[2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:41.680]  has progressed their agenda and we need to stop taking scraps from under the table and we need
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:47.680]  to end the killing we need to go on the offense and elizabeth johnston the activist mommy's doing it

[2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:31.040]  so we've got major censorship news now i didn't even mention today
[2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:38.080]  that we were banned yesterday on 22 facebook accounts only two of them that we have some
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:41.840]  affiliation with they weren't ours most of them i never heard of except they were all exploding
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:48.720]  and they called it the cynicism which means criminals committing new crimes so citizens
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:55.920]  went and created facebook pages that say info wars and and and the facebook put a press release
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:03.680]  out and said if it says wars in it info wars news wars we will take your page down so they're saying
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:08.640]  you build a page and you talk about alex jones we're going to ban you so see now it's not just
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:14.320]  banning me this big evil horrible person it's now what we first thought it was
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:20.160]  when that youtube group that was even antelope jones got a strike that first day i was banned
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:25.440]  back in august of last year they banned or blocked another site to let them know no no no you don't
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:31.680]  talk about him total social conditioning and then they tell congress we don't censor anything we
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:35.680]  don't we don't know what you're talking about we have all the internal emails we have the undercover
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:41.760]  videos we have it all well i'll i'll do a little bit of the next hour after our guest leaves us and
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:46.560]  rob news printing it all off for me or rob news the nightly news director but
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:58.960]  he put out a video about maduro's death squads killing people and and just showed a link to a
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:07.040]  bbc video that everybody else could air he said wow look at the nightmare of socialism
[2:35:07.040 --> 2:35:11.440]  that alexandria cortege and bernie sears want to give us and somebody countered back
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:16.080]  oh shut up it's the american police killing black people even though whites are about
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:20.800]  two to one killed for blacks but you could argue it was point is there's some bad police or some
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:27.440]  good police point is it's a big divide in congress strategy and he said no here's the statistics that
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:32.480]  more than twice as many whites get killed in blacks on and on and on and by the way learn to code
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:38.960]  because the left always said you're a coal miner you're a ford worker you're a farmer you lost your
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:45.840]  job learn to code learn to code but there are that 20 years learn to code so now there's always big
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:56.080]  layoffs in the you know buzzfeed sphere of fake news because the money got cut off and while you
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:01.440]  don't say that to the delicate little authoritarians who are so creepy and so unschivalrous and so
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:08.240]  evil just bring it all in here right now that they ban you when you say it and then jack dorsi goes on
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:14.560]  joe rogan's um snake farm experience yeah yeah document cam here we're bringing mic in here
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:18.880]  we'll go to our guest she understands this breaking news this is what we're fighting
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:26.240]  document cam shot police so here it is the following message has been approved by et sanders
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:33.680]  and aoc enjoy your socialism now with improved motorcycle death squads and then it links to
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:38.640]  mainstream news with motorcycle death squads going on so cnn can show you that but he can't
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:43.360]  looks like they learn from american police shooting african americans meanwhile half the
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:49.360]  blacks get aborted in the country we're trying to stop it two sanders and the groups police kill
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:55.360]  more whites than blacks you link the statistic learn to code boom then twitter tells you
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:01.760]  you agree to remove this or you won't ever be restored right and that'll be in 14 days my
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.720]  response appeal yeah so i appealed it tell people about it just tell people about it i'm gonna go
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:11.520]  to our guest so i basically appealed it and said uh this is a response to a guy saying
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.840]  looks like and i even quote him in there they look like they learned shooting american uh look
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:19.920]  from american police shooting african americans and i just sent a link to a group that's been
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.520]  tracking this since the year 2000 of the deaths and there's about 8 000 whites there's some
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:31.440]  unspecified number and then there's like 5000 blacks i mean it's here's here's here's i mean
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:37.440]  all i did was show proof it's fbi statistics so somebody says cops are targeting black people
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:43.520]  you send a link proving it's not the case in the in the main obviously some are some aren't
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:48.400]  and then you get banned for that i get banned and it's probably for this learn to code thing which
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:51.920]  i didn't even tell him to learn to code it's just a problem it's because you're effective and you're
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.960]  accurate and you're real and you know here's the problem we're looking at who to sue over this and
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:01.040]  twitter is one of the main ones but there's more than one way to get a cat we're just gonna get
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:06.960]  securities and exchange commission indictments um for folks instead like you know we're not gonna
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:12.160]  play your game and like oh and when you get indicted joe or you get indicted jack we'll just say you
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:18.160]  haven't been indicted yeah it doesn't exist so it's ridiculous uh kellen's working on an article
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:22.880]  right now oh they're hitting everybody right yeah and they're literally going through it because i
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:28.080]  did one uh tweet to john brennan who basically just he he gets to say whatever he wants you say
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:32.560]  anything it's the former cia director suddenly you're a bad person he's a total public figure
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.960]  yeah he says we're gonna take the president out he says all this and you call him a wimp yeah i
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:40.240]  called him a wint and they're like oh no you can't do that that violates our rules and i'm like
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:47.040]  the the word i use is just another name for your mouth a puss you know that's all i said
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:50.880]  it's flapping in the wind that's all i you know and that's not even that bad like i didn't cuss him
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:54.720]  out i didn't do anything they can use twitter to organize going to tucker carlson's house sure
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:01.200]  all right rob will follow this is an unfolds just absolute reign of terror and then they go on tv and
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:07.600]  say nobody is being censored activist mommy is with us right now she's organizing a big national day
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:12.640]  in a couple weeks to wear black to talk about now killing already born babies again it's a mother's
[2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:16.720]  choice i guess i guess to kill her 10 year old or whatever i mean where does that end because
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:20.560]  earlier i said hey we're going to show videos of post birth abortions and i showed kennedy
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:24.960]  getting his head blown off because that's literally post birth abortion when does it in
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:32.480]  it alex this will end when god's people decide it's going to end when we get off of the sidelines
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:37.920]  and get engaged in this battle this will end and it has been our silence and our apathy that has
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:43.840]  caused it to go this far and that is why we are joining together to repent on february 23rd
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:49.200]  for our apathy for our lack of action and let me tell you your viewers are just gonna love this if
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:55.280]  you go to the website dayofmorning.org you'll see a business poster there that we're asking
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:00.480]  businesses to place on their front door shut it down america should be like a ghost town
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:06.960]  on saturday february 23rd as we all seek god to change our hearts and grant us repentance
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:12.640]  but on this poster alex it says this business is shut down for the day because we will not allow
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:19.680]  our state a tyrannical state murderous state to collect sales tax from us tomorrow we will reopen
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:27.280]  or monday we will reopen under duress forced to collect tax in this tyrannical murderous regime
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:33.520]  your viewers will love this this is right down their alley we need 20 000 for this venue there
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:40.400]  are there is a donate button right there on the top of dayofmorning.org i have no george soros money
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:47.120]  my son my 16 year old son just loans me two thousand dollars from his account to give to the event
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:51.840]  because we're buying our speaker's plane tickets and we do not have the funds to continue
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:57.680]  and so i know you have a generous audience would you please donate todayofmorning.org it is
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:02.960]  tax deductible um so we really really do need your support absolutely people need to do it and
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:07.680]  i need to get out to these events and i love the fact you're going to albany the capital of new
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:14.080]  york city or a new york state where they did all this and and and it's just so sick i'm sure you've
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.640]  seen the video when they signed it it was like they won the super bowl they were just like oh it's
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:23.040]  for women to kill their babies after they're born but really it's all about now we're going to be
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:28.160]  able to legally sell their organs you know because they've been doing it under the table now boy they
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:34.080]  are really doing it out in the oven this was a giant satanic event sick and you know the exciting
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:40.000]  thing about what we're doing with day of mourning is that all of these local rallies are popping up
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.320]  and you'll see them we're starting to connect those to our day of mourning facebook page
[2:41:44.320 --> 2:41:48.720]  because people who can't make it to albany new york are desperate to do something locally
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:55.440]  and so they're organizing facebook event pages in colorado in georgia and north carolina we've got
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:42:00.640]  events popping up everywhere very organically kind of like the vagina hatters and the women's march
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:07.120]  look if they can get a million people out to their marches to march for the right to kill babies
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:14.560]  and to you know have same-sex relations and whatnot same-sex marriage can we get 2400 people to fill
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:20.800]  the empire state classic convention center for righteousness please i think we can i think we
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:26.080]  can as well um overall and come back for a few minutes what your report card on trump because
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:31.680]  we can say okay trumps doing great compared to alexandria cortez or ancy polosi or you know
[2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:40.080]  tucky schumer but what does trump need to do on the front of censorship on the front of all this
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:45.280]  because if he just keeps letting big tech and like he's doing this new nap to bill this new nap
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:48.880]  to bill is horrible it just legalizes all the censorship people really need to call the white

[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:29.680]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:39.920]  studios it's alex jones so these spokeswoman for the RNC put on her online account that
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:53.040]  Elizabeth Warren falsified her entrance to the bar of Texas because her scores weren't higher
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:57.040]  enough to use affirmative actions saying she was native american to get in
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:03.840]  and once congress complained then instagram backed off that's an example so you complain
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:08.320]  they back off but the only back off if you have legislative power everybody else is
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:15.200]  getting censored en masse and it's gone from bad to absolutely insane and if congress and president
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:22.000]  trump don't take action we would have won the battle but lost the war elizabeth johnson the
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:26.880]  activist mommy activist mommy.com again if you just joined us on alex jones then for worse.com
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:32.640]  i think you know i want to support trump because he's obviously a lot better than the democrats but
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:39.760]  if he doesn't take action on censorship and some of these other issues then i don't know why he
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:45.600]  would leave his flank completely open this new nafta negotiation he has puts into law censorship
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:52.960]  so i'm really concerned. yeah it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to do something
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:58.320]  about this i'm not sure what the delay is i personally have experienced a whole lot of
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:03.840]  censorship over the last two years in fact a story about me that really increased the the
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:09.520]  size of my platform went worldwide when i got banned from facebook this is two years ago when
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:14.160]  people weren't getting banned you know all the time we're very familiar with this this story now
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:20.640]  but two years ago this was not common and this story went worldwide where i got banned for quoting
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:26.960]  what the bible says about homosexuality that's right i'm sorry go ahead no no you're right exactly
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:32.880]  continue yeah and so i um have been you know pulled banned from twitter multiple times facebook
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:39.520]  multiple times i'm shadow banned on twitter my tweets are actually marked as graphic as sensitive
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:44.640]  so if you have your twitter account set up to not see like pornography and graphic images
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:50.160]  you cannot see my tweets they're covered with a graphic image cover and you know i don't curse
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:55.760]  i'm very you know family friendly um activists and you don't want to kill babies to your band
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:01.920]  you know exactly them right and um definitely something could and must be done about this i
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:08.800]  quickly joined joined um parlay when i learned that trumps um campaign manager brad parskell
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:14.560]  was over there and other large conservatives like handis owens and charlie kerrk and i'm hoping that
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:21.280]  once parlay really gets all the bugs out of their system and is large enough to handle uh i'm hoping
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:25.920]  that that that trump is going to move there and that's going to destroy twitter because twitter
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:32.640]  must be destroyed no i agree if trump would just start promoting every day small he won't even like
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:36.640]  talk about info wars or bright bar or whatever and it's not like we need that we brought trump to
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:41.920]  where he is our listeners created the wave he surfed in on which is fine i get that they attack
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:45.200]  him and they you know they demonize info war so he won't link up with it because that would be
[2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:49.760]  total victory but i've been told about some other uh social networks that are about to be
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:52.800]  launching too that are independent and of course those will be demonized they'll try to shut those
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:59.440]  down because silicon valley wants a major major monopoly okay well elizabeth uh johnson the
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:04.800]  activist mommy we look forward to having you back on i'll probably try to cover in a couple weeks
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:09.600]  your big day of mourning for the uh children that have been murdered so thanks so much for coming
[2:51:09.600 --> 2:51:16.800]  on with us thank you so much god bless you god bless you okay i covered a lot here today and
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:22.160]  there's a lot i didn't cover and we got dug hagman with the hagman report uh hosted the fourth hour
[2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:28.000]  he's always ready to go and there's a lot that i want to get to that i haven't gotten to so today
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:34.960]  will be a day where i'm going to stay late and there'll be some live feeds on info wars dot com
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:42.560]  and just remember this isn't words because i know everybody here's hype and there's a
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:49.120]  thousands of channels and this is the channel they're trying to shut down this is what they
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:56.080]  don't want on there this is the wild card time and time again when nobody else is covering it
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:52:03.280]  we're covering it it breaks out and it defeats them so if you want to defeat the globalist
[2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:10.160]  just keep doing what you've already been doing remember that yeah you can get censored or banned
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:14.800]  on youtube or twitter or facebook for promoting an info wars dot com links we make it easier
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:21.120]  promote a news wars link that that doesn't get you banned 10 as much but who cares they built
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:27.280]  these platforms to get us in there like a web so the spiders would have us caught and come up and say
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:32.880]  do what we say or will not let you talk to people and you go okay and they get you're tired on the
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:41.200]  web and then pretty soon it's like you can't get free now delicious and that's exactly who jack
[2:52:41.200 --> 2:52:51.920]  dorsi and all these people are smart-ass spiders that all screw each other and lies oh yeah we've
[2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:58.560]  got a bitcoin pump and dump i dumped my stock before it plunged and now i'm going to sucker
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:09.920]  you back in for square cash and joe rogan's gonna help me so get ready for them that's how the spider
[2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:18.160]  operates we gotta learn to recognize the spider it's in love with itself it's it's it's falling
[2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:26.960]  and it's so sure of itself and how it can destroy everything around it but we're here
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:33.440]  to say no so the planet isn't about being a billionaire like jack dorsi it's about making
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:41.360]  the right decisions and then wealth comes as a secondary thing it's unlimited but that's why
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:46.800]  they struggle and they strive well well let's take jones's funding away he'll he'll he'll give up
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:50.960]  or let's try this and that but then there's still so much freedom in the world so much free will
[2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:58.960]  so much of america left to their rage they can't control it all and that's why
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:07.840]  that's why this is an epic journey this is an incredible experiment we're all in together
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:16.720]  because if you support us by word of mouth and by prayer and by financial support
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:22.400]  you're you're stepping in i mean you you're not like on the sidelines of the fight over here
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:27.520]  when you support info wars when you buy our products when you spread the word when you
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:37.200]  pray for us you are metaphysically dimensionally spiritually teleported to the very front line
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:47.440]  of the fight it's it's in this world of currency and credit and and funds and commerce they've used
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:53.200]  commerce to get control of us enslave us but what if we use commerce to take back control
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:55:01.520]  and that's what's happening and so i'm not a knowledge of evil guy i'm a knowledge of good guy
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:05.520]  but i've studied the knowledge of evil to understand how they operate and i've
[2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:11.760]  i've gotten some understanding of it and everything they do makes you weaker makes you
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:18.080]  dumber makes you more crippled under their control everything god does makes you stronger
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:24.640]  makes you better makes you pure makes you more loving but also commits you to fight evil so the
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:33.120]  two things don't go together and so when i sit here and i tell you that info wars has been chosen
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:42.080]  out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights and the spiders don't like
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:52.160]  light they like dark and so if they're able they believe to shut us down they believe
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:58.640]  they've killed a major nexus point for human expression human freedom i have different views
[2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:03.120]  on it and i've learned to say certain things on air because you need to hear it and other things the
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:07.520]  enemy knows that's all true so they'll they'll use things i say against this because they know
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:12.800]  because they're also blind to a lot of stuff they can't see into other realms they just are here
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:17.680]  temporarily trying to dominate and hurt people and their god says hurt children and be evil so
[2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:25.360]  they do it so they move up the hierarchy of evil but there's a major plan and the lord works in
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:30.560]  mysterious ways but i can tell you this the fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:38.240]  and we just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that
[2:56:39.040 --> 2:56:43.680]  don't just give us the big victories we you've already delivered the list turns by supporting us
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:48.960]  we're all this together but even bigger victories that that that that make
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:54.880]  make was humanity's gotta go through a lot easier it's still gonna be really really rough
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:59.760]  but god doesn't cheat because god has free will gives us free will but you know
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:03.920]  there's kind of a little bit of a cheat sheet here and i realized that's the commitment if i'm
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:09.200]  willing to go all the way and if you're willing to go all the way um there's going to be major
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:14.880]  dividends for our children and for society and culture where you know only a billion people
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:20.240]  are going to die in this in this armageddon instead of like seven billion i mean seriously like
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:25.280]  it's kind of choose your adventure if we really get involved now and say no to all this up front
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  then it's we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough but it'll be okay
[2:57:30.640 --> 2:57:37.760]  if we don't i tell you it's a very very hard road we're going down and so i would just ask

[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:22.560]  something special about the american flag
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:25.440]  martha washington
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:33.440]  something special
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:40.240]  let's look at some 20-year-old news here that's finally breaking the last two days
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:48.720]  a boarded baby parts fused with mice to humanize them for grim frankenstein experiments in u.s
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:53.200]  labs if you read about what they're admittedly doing here is they're creating kameros but they
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:01:00.640]  go oh it's parts of babies yeah their dna is being injected into the mice and their growth
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:10.160]  hormone to create mutations but let's move back to stuff that gets people's attention new bill would
[3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:19.920]  require gun buyers to reveal social media history so now you're guilty until proven innocent
[3:01:20.640 --> 3:01:27.120]  and when you go to buy a gun in illinois they want to have a special political board
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:37.520]  to make you under penalty of perjury give them your whole history that's called discovery
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:46.480]  that means you've been indicted or you've been sued so this is the headline should be gun owners
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:52.080]  in illinois all be sued and to be told to give their social history for witch hunts
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:57.280]  but see um chicago cbs television doesn't put it like that doesn't
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:05.040]  oh they're like before nicolas cruz killed 17 people at florida's parkland high school
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:09.760]  he went online said he was planning to do it yeah the whole school called him uh
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:11.600]  school's here
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:19.600]  the whole school called but he was at in school doing it and there was this a liberal program
[3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:24.000]  in florida i forget the name where well his last name was hispanic show since he was a minority
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.880]  even though he wasn't hispanic he didn't get sent to jail for the robberies and the vandalism
[3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:34.800]  and everything so and then the police stood down as well which is now confirmed which we first
[3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:44.160]  broke but that's okay see it's all about well if nick cruz high school dropout who said he was
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:50.000]  going to kill everybody for years and was under weird psychiatric care of leftist
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:59.520]  you now need to go prove you're not a bad person and show all your social media because of what
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:12.240]  cruz did what an incredible announcement so the real headline is gun owners new law new law
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:20.000]  law would make gun owners give up their social media history in anti-gun witch hunt i mean it's
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.200]  it's it's here
[3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:28.320]  even the acl use against it
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:35.760]  they say how does this list get used how do you make people when they go to get a gun
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:42.720]  like coming and say here's my socials history and i you see you're making yourself a criminal
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:48.960]  like oh you don't want to take dangerous unapproved vaccines no vaccines are approved
[3:03:48.960 --> 3:03:52.880]  they're all under emergency edict because while there's an emergency governmental system run by
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:03:58.800]  the former head of the justice department sister
[3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:03.600]  rose the scene
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:12.000]  that you just are now inducted into some weird star chamber of what you ever did online and you
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:17.360]  can't have guns it's a due process folks they've launched their attack the democrats have just
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:21.600]  bred giant generations of tens of millions of lawyers and they're attacking the country

[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:37.040]  and it goes on to say the national rifle association opposes it and so does the aclu

[3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:25.360]  but i just thought i would go back to the cbs news report of illinois where bills have been
[3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:30.880]  introduced for the democratic state house they say or had the votes to make you induct yourself
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:36.560]  into to discover it's a new form of laws outside of juris prudence to give them under penalty
[3:06:36.560 --> 3:06:42.480]  of perjury all of your social media going back five years twitter facebook google youtube and
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:46.880]  deliver it to them and then say you've done nothing wrong under penalty of perjury which
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:52.000]  then the leftist lawyers wind through to find something you said they don't like to swat team
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:07:00.160]  you and take your guns that's tyranny and that's how they use the social networks and the internet
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:06.000]  for this great purge that's happening and all the incredible things that are going on our own
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:13.440]  news director for the nightly news now now the overall news programs uh rob do got banned uh

[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:41.280]  reaching insane levels ladies and gentlemen this this is what's happening and it's just happening
[3:07:41.280 --> 3:07:46.640]  to everyone so i'm going to say this again because i bitch at myself you know i say we could expand we
[3:07:46.640 --> 3:07:51.200]  could fight back we could win if i plug more because i get so focused on news i plug like one time an hour
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:58.400]  it's simple if you want to beat the globalist if you want to take on the new world order i'm not
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:04.880]  doing bitcoin pumping dumps with jack dorsi i'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures i'm not
[3:08:04.880 --> 3:08:09.920]  sitting here you know selling you late term abortion and all grade it is i just go out and say what is
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:15.360]  the top heart pill what is the top tumor it's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and
[3:08:15.360 --> 3:08:21.360]  anti you know all that stuff what's the best lab in the country okay they're the highest rated
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:26.720]  i'm like you're only 50 percent curcuminoid well yeah they only put five dollars product and bottle
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:32.080]  but that's still incredible sir and i'm like uh what's the highest you could do uh month later uh
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:38.320]  90 95 percent no one's ever done i said how much did that cost for a bottle that cost $10 no one's
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:43.440]  ever done that like you're not going to like be sir the average competitors three to five percent
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:49.680]  you're like the top brand's 50 percent i'm like we're going to have 95 percent curcuminoid that's
[3:08:49.680 --> 3:08:56.000]  i mean you understand like that's like our information is explosive our fish oil i go out
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:01.440]  and i get the cleanest the best my children take it you think i'm going to give you fish oil that
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:05.680]  didn't the very damn best on my soul you think i'm going to screw somebody over like one of these
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:12.400]  devil worshipers never and that's why they attack me constantly because they know i treat you like
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:17.360]  i want to be treated in fact that's just the golden rule that is doing to others as you have them
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:23.520]  doing to you but you know what christ said is lay down your life for your brother and i finally figured
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:28.480]  out what that meant god talked about the little children and suffered a little that means people
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:35.520]  low IQ children whatever it's up to us that have high IQs to pave the way for them and it's up for
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:41.840]  us to lay down that it's it's it's a mission it's not like it's god saying you better lay it down
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:47.120]  for people that aren't as strong as you i don't know who you are because god couldn't be hypocrite
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:54.000]  god had to come down to this planet and literally get tortured unbelievably bad even though god was
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:59.120]  god god had taken on him and body and the guard to get somebody sort of crying saying because god
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:02.400]  could see what's going to happen he was on the present he's like this is going to really hurt
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:12.560]  it that's heavy hidden but god did it and it was worse than that once god had conquered this dimension
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:19.440]  and proven that it's incredible as god is that god can make himself that small then god went
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:26.960]  lower into hell and got the keys to death and hell you think about that you think about what
[3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:32.160]  jesus christ did for us and we can't even stand up for unborn babies and get censored or get
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:38.160]  attacked or have some leftist coffee on us give me a break i'm a wimp compared to jesus christ
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:44.320]  i'm a joke and then i look at all these other men they're a joke compared to me and that's pathetic
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:49.040]  because you're giving up your birthright when you don't stand up against evil so i'll tell you again
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:54.000]  this is the time to decide which sides you're on we need your word of mouth we need your prayers
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:57.520]  we need your financial support and we're selling products they're the best out there we need it and
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:01.680]  i know you've been doing it so i i want to thank you but let me tell you it's our middle class and
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:06.320]  poor listeners at our biggest supporters but i know all these rich billionaires and all the other
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:10.560]  guys that want to fly me around the jet or meet with me and they all they got some big plan and
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:15.120]  they always want me to do something they want before i get the money to fund all this and that's
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:20.480]  why jesus said it's easier for a rich man to go through the eye of a needle than to get to heaven
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:25.120]  and he was pointing at a wall it was a little small wall so the metaphor is you had to get the
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:29.840]  camel out to get on its knees there is what's not as hard as you think but you have to get on your
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:35.600]  knees you have to roll around the mud to deliver victory and stop being on your high horses
[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:44.160]  so import store dot com got some big sales products everybody needs let's go to the
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:47.760]  hagman's here with their great intel and everything they've got to offer and i appreciate them joining

[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:16.400]  there the Ruth Ruth peter ginsberg issue going to be talking about that i just want to open up with
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:22.160]  with with one thing alex was talking about the unborn and about what we have and haven't done
[3:12:22.160 --> 3:12:30.400]  and and about the um my goodness just the uh incredible immorality the incredible bloodshed
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:36.080]  behind this uh coach david obmer coach david live dot com i like to call america's coach wrote
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:41.200]  just a great article back on oh six some 13 years ago and the pulpits are silent it's being
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:48.080]  republished actually with a couple of different uh a couple of updates um at before it's news but
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:52.800]  we'll have it at hagman report dot com and the pulpits are silent but the bottom line here is
[3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:56.880]  despite what the political parties want you to believe the problem in america is not the politicians
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:02.240]  of course they are they are a problem but not the problem it's not the politicians that's not
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:06.560]  where you're finding the problems it's in the pulpits and most of americans pulpists today
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:15.360]  as alex jones was just saying you know um jesus was not a cowardly man when uh when he was walking
[3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:24.160]  the earth um and we look at ourselves and i'll tell you the cowardice uh most of america's pulpits
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:30.000]  most not all but most are filled with america or with the cowardly men they are ashamed to the
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.280]  crisis claim to serve this according to uh dominor that's david dominor before it's news dot com
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:40.240]  i believe i believe that's where it's published right now and it'll be at hagman report dot com
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:47.600]  soon it's not already there but if you think those are harsh words the cheap great good the i'm sorry
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:54.400]  the cheap grace culture in which we live the uh let's uh go along to get along let's not really
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:59.920]  talk about the let's not really talk about the important issues let's not talk about the issues
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:07.920]  that affect impact us all that's the infanticide that's the uh abortions well really infanticide
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:12.640]  or the killing of unborn children and i know that they hate they they're left they just hate to even
[3:14:12.640 --> 3:14:19.200]  hear this disgust by the way uh it's interesting to note that plan parenthood paid listen to this
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:24.320]  6.5 million dollars for a seat for a seat at the state of the union address you don't think the
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:29.200]  killing of babies and the trafficking babies is big business yeah try coming up with six and a half
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.040]  million dollars for a seat at the state of the union address or six point five million dollars
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:38.560]  for anything who gets that payment and then you have to buy a ticket to the state of the union
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.920]  for six point five million dollars or is this this this doesn't sound right at all uh it doesn't
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:51.840]  does it the table uh yeah because uh that's um yeah the washington exam no the washington exam
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:56.880]  reported this by michael watson today in an article today washington exam or plan parenthood
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:00.880]  paid six point five million dollars for a seat at the state of the union what in the hell first of

[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:23.440]  i forget that it was hundreds of millions of dollars that plan parenthood had paid or received
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:28.000]  and then in turn donated to all these different democratic congressmen and governor uh gubernatorial
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:32.640]  candidates and senate candidates and then when they get in power uh you know the money flows back
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:37.520]  to them so it's a big uh you know circle of corruption where money's being taxpayer money's

[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:29.680]  know what we will prevail in the end we will prevail of course we know how it all throws out but
[3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:34.320]  anyway break for the break we're talking about plan parenthood in my view in my personal opinion
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:40.000]  plan butchered hood uh just very quickly wrap this up in total plan parenthood action fund
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:45.200]  and plan parenthood votes the arms of the plan parenthood network allowed to engage in electoral
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:50.240]  politics under tax rate tax regulations spent six and six and a half million folks can you imagine
[3:22:50.240 --> 3:22:53.760]  six and a half million in outside spending supporting the election of democrats of both
[3:22:53.760 --> 3:23:00.240]  houses of congress in 2018 which earned them in turn a seat at the state of the union it's more than
[3:23:00.240 --> 3:23:07.760]  that it's more than that it is 30 million dollars from reports did plan this is from snopes and i
[3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:14.240]  love how i love snopes and not don't take me wrong i love it because of how inaccurate i love it
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:20.000]  because of the uh liberal uh insanity bias that they have and the their ability to think that they
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:25.600]  can change facts and change people's statements what they say uh to twist them to to make their
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:31.360]  claims true or false or whatever the agenda that they're trying to push obviously it's always the
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:35.840]  socialist communist agenda but this is an article from snopes did plan parenthood donate 30 million
[3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:39.520]  dollars to democrats to influence the midterm election well what snopes say they said it's
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:44.480]  a mixture of true or false what's true plan parenthood votes is one member of a coalition
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:50.960]  of organizations which is planning on extending or is to expend 30 million to mobilize infrequent
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:57.040]  voters in the midterm elections and they say that this is not parenthood per se it's an offshoot of
[3:23:57.040 --> 3:24:01.040]  plan parenthood so what's not true it's not actually planned parenthood it's separate from
[3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:06.560]  the organization but it's the same organization the same uh organization at the very top and then
[3:24:06.560 --> 3:24:11.280]  i have a few other things here plan parenthood in recent elections look at think of what happened
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:17.200]  in virginia the governor uh northam who has been uh seen wearing blackface in the yearbook with the
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:22.160]  kkk and refusing to step down as the mess in virginia we can talk about the little bit later
[3:24:22.160 --> 3:24:28.240]  but uh big league politics has an article that shows that they donated plan parenthood donated
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:33.200]  two million dollars to governor northam and endorsed who endorsed infanticide as a form of
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:39.840]  abortion on wednesday so what they did here uh during his election cycle or in the last year
[3:24:39.840 --> 3:24:45.680]  2017 from plan parenthood uh one million nine hundred ninety six thousand three hundred and
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:52.160]  forty six dollars from plan parenthood donations to governor northam's campaign now is it any
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:57.600]  coincidence that we see that money going from plan parenthood to northam's campaign to see northam
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:03.360]  come out and not only promote in a bill that uh you know pushes for third term abortions
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:09.040]  ripping ripping mother babies out of the mother's wombs while they're alive but not only that pushing
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:14.800]  the infanticide issue execution of babies after they've been born by the mother and after they
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:21.680]  have survived abortions wanting to kill them again or try to kill them again so is there any relationship
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:27.760]  between plan parenthood money which is essentially taxpayer funded money going to these candidates
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:33.600]  who then turn around and get these laws implemented in their states which uh take the the infanticide
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:39.920]  issue now and they're taking it to the extreme i can't wrap my mind around how this is even legal
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:43.840]  but this is what we're seeing and what we see with this infanticide and abortion issue
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:48.400]  is it went from the bill clinton years plan parenthood said you know was pushing and the
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:52.880]  left wing bill clinton was pushing to have abortions much more easily accessible for
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:58.480]  women who were in health risks they said they didn't want to use it except for certain parameters
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:02.720]  if the woman was in danger of losing her baby if the woman it was in danger of her losing her
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:07.840]  life in the pregnancy or there was going to be some very serious uh or complications from that
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:14.480]  pregnancy now we went from that in 1990s to what 20 30 years later they are celebrating not only
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:19.360]  abortion but infanticide in the streets in the media in hollywood and it's only going to get
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:25.200]  worse for there because who's next after the baby and let me just say this all right look i
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:30.720]  understand the blackface stuff i get that i understand the the racial instance insensitivity
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:34.960]  okay but but aside from that what should we be talking about what's more important is that the
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:40.480]  racial racial aspect of this or is it the fact that the the very person accused of the racial
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:48.160]  insensitivities is the one that's that's promoting this infanticide this this baby murder and not
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:54.480]  to and enriching and being becoming enriched whether it's via the campaign in my view or the
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:27:02.080]  or personally through PACS and what have you um and campaign funds people who know how that
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:06.640]  worked i understand that there there is a level of enrichment there that does occur in the process
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:12.640]  you got to be absolutely uh the moron not to understand it but the fact is look this is all
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:17.360]  happening and this is on the happening in the backs and people don't understand the the aspect
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:23.440]  that the baroque cusino obama played into uh this import this infanticide i'm not even going to use
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:27.920]  the word abortion anymore it's infanticide because the infanticidal democrats took their
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:33.360]  cues from baroque obama this is a piece from american thinker today as well by trevor thomas
[3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:39.920]  and when you look back uh you know for for decades uh democrats have dehumanized deliberately
[3:27:39.920 --> 3:27:46.160]  dehumanized uh the unborn and argued against protecting the most innocent and helpless among
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:50.960]  us even when they escaped death in their mother's wombs and in order to further their wicked sexual
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:57.040]  agenda which is attached to this so you got the wicked sexual sexual agenda think back to the
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:01.520]  counterculture culture of the sixties and how they impacted american morality and even go back
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:06.640]  further uh into the eugenics and then go a step later now and and and look at what's happening
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:10.960]  on the other side of the coin in addition to infanticide you're looking at uh not post birth
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:16.080]  abortions although that's that's definitely part of it but also what's going on with these comfort
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:22.480]  choices about oh aid in comfort to you know um to expedite the uh the terminally ill and the
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:30.400]  infirm and the elderly it's all look this is satanic go ahead it is and uh taking us out here uh you
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:35.600]  know tax plain parenthood receives millions of dollars from the taxpayers from our corrupt congress
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:40.880]  we are paying them we as taxpayers are paying them to slaughter these unborn children and there is

[3:31:59.040 --> 3:32:04.720]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[3:32:04.720 --> 3:32:11.120]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[3:32:11.680 --> 3:32:17.600]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[3:32:17.600 --> 3:32:24.400]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:30.080]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa
[3:32:30.080 --> 3:32:36.400]  pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was
[3:32:36.400 --> 3:32:43.200]  also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the
[3:32:43.200 --> 3:32:49.760]  water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply
[3:32:49.760 --> 3:33:00.240]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex jones
[3:33:00.240 --> 3:33:19.520]  show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones and now
[3:33:19.520 --> 3:33:29.680]  your host doug hagman and this is the alex well the info wars dot com info wars shows
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:33.680]  that doug hagman and joe hagman sitting for alex jones of course uh in the fourth hour here
[3:33:34.400 --> 3:33:41.440]  you know the do you remember antonio sculia obviously as the supreme court justice who
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:48.800]  passed who passed away allegedly in a ranch on the death of obama's turn right unintended death
[3:33:48.800 --> 3:33:56.800]  obviously this was an unintended death and look i in my capacity professionally i've i've been i've
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:34:02.880]  seen an unintended deaths and handled things and and there's a protocol that that you you adhere to
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:10.160]  for unintended deaths well you know i initially i looked at that i thought well okay things weren't
[3:34:10.160 --> 3:34:14.480]  followed exactly 100 i could see where maybe things might have just slipped by the you know
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:19.920]  through the cracks or whatever but then i again i thought okay wait this is a supreme court justice
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:25.920]  you don't want any kind of you know you don't want anything to be believe me there's a lot i gotta
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:31.440]  tell you there's a lot of people a lot of paperwork in unintended deaths okay a lot of paperwork and
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:38.720]  even more in suspicious deaths that are also unintended but you get the idea all right so
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:44.080]  so here's the bottom line i thought well maybe those people who were saying that this is really
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:50.240]  not right um or or making something more of it then you know kind on the fringe of things okay now
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:56.080]  that's at the end of as joseph said the end of obama's turn basically or the time in office and
[3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:01.200]  and you can see how you can see the impact of the supreme court justice's have
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:07.600]  but what i'm getting to is this uh i want proof of life i want proof of life of Ruth
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:13.920]  Bader Ginsburg and joe and i primarily joe has done a lot of investigative work on uh okay
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:21.520]  where is she and again for those people looking for Ruth Bader Ginsburg look she's not here um
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:28.080]  she's not up you know in in my home in my guest room um uh and i do suspect kind of a
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:33.440]  forgive me but kind of a norm and baits kind of thing going on here where
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:40.000]  maybe somebody will find her in a rocking chair and i would suggest if you do just
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.080]  those people looking for carry a little can of vicks around with you and it always helps underneath
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:50.640]  the nose a little tip for uh from you know leo for the leo community but i i do wonder
[3:35:50.640 --> 3:35:56.480]  at this point if if we're not seeing this deep state uh hiding and for as much as that sounds
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:02.800]  gruesome i'll just say this look we we pray hope and pray that she's on the road to fast
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:07.840]  recovery and all that but you know don't don't PM my leg and tell me it's raining out all right
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:14.800]  just be honest and just tell me what the deal is after all isn't we have the right to know
[3:36:14.800 --> 3:36:20.080]  as american citizens given her prominence position of prominence and we're not getting that so joe
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:25.680]  what do you know i'm going to give you uh uh good to you well let's do this okay with Ruth
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:31.520]  Bader Ginsburg there was a number of interesting things that have happened uh from january till
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:37.520]  just the state of the union and as we all know in late december she fell and broke her ribs
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:44.080]  when that happened they found i believe it was a a polyp or two uh lesions of some kind in her lung
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:49.600]  cancerous uh tumors in her lung they were very small which she had an operation and had them
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:54.800]  removed and people have not seen her since she has not been serving on the bench leaving many to ask
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:58.480]  you know how what's her condition she's there's no public appearances there's no proof of life
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  um are they are the real question is are they holding her in you know the back room on ice
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  till 2020 elections when they believe trump will not be in office and he's not allowing him to get
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:14.080]  another supreme court pick well this is the series of events that have happened by the way hillary
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:19.840]  clinton i just want to push it but this other hillary clinton not sick either okay uh don't
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:25.040]  believe your lying eyes now she didn't fall she didn't lose a shoe that was just one you know
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:29.760]  it was just one of those unfortunate things again you know don't believe your lying eyes
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:35.760]  don't don't believe what the right right uh or you know the new media's telling you okay go ahead
[3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:40.240]  go ahead i just want to make sure people aren't losing their minds with hillary clinton even the
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:44.720]  fact checkers were saying oh no that's not true she didn't collapse you know she didn't she didn't
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:48.880]  fall down she wasn't sick she was fine but uh ruth bader ginsberg and there's a footage of her
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:55.840]  falling right there ruth bader ginsberg uh well in january fox showed a graphic and this graphic
[3:37:55.840 --> 3:38:03.200]  had a date i believe it was 1933 the 2019 and it was a serving as a memorial putting pretty much
[3:38:03.200 --> 3:38:08.000]  what happens when people pass away they put up these little graphics and you know in memory of
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:12.560]  and they had the date so well they further issued a retraction or an apology saying you know we're
[3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:18.000]  sorry we did this on on accident and uh you know there's no don't read anything into it it was just
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:21.920]  hate that one of those on our part right i know and you have to there it is and you have to
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:26.400]  understand that i'm sure news organizations do things like this uh when they expect certain
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:30.320]  people to pass who knows maybe they have one for all their own anchors and and you know people in
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:35.840]  hollywood but they do yeah from from a president down to the yeah yeah the reason to show that on
[3:38:35.840 --> 3:38:40.160]  tv uh and i can understand somebody pressing the wrong button but why is that even in the
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:44.560]  you know in in circulation of things that could make its way to tv that's my question but
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:50.720]  though let's put that aside now monday there was an event and this event was i believe at the
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:59.360]  national women's uh of arts in dc and i'm not sure the correct name i have a pretty obscure place i
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:05.360]  mean it was an obscure event right i mean it wasn't one of these things where the korea's rpg
[3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:14.080]  in song it was an hour and a half uh musical if you will about her life and about the her practice
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:20.000]  on the um supreme court and then this this lady was singing about you know her life using clothes
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:24.400]  that she in cases she ruled on but anyway this is what was reported that supreme court justice
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:28.400]  ruth bader ginsberg is making her first public appearance as undergoing lung lung surgery in
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:34.000]  december this was at the concert at a museum a few blocks from the white house given by her
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:42.240]  daughter-in-law and other musicians now the concert is dedicated to ginsberg's life in the law what
[3:39:42.240 --> 3:39:47.520]  goes on from here and what is reported from here is very interesting because they say she
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:52.400]  was sitting in the room in the very back of the room and it was darkly lit and it wasn't announced
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:56.880]  that she was there and nobody saw her you weren't allowed to take pictures well a lot of pictures
[3:39:56.880 --> 3:40:02.560]  and video from the actual event itself has been released and there has been no pictures of her
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:09.360]  taking taken at this event and they also said uh as i said no cameras there other people took
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:13.520]  pictures of the crowd and it seemed like a lot of younger people and i think it was part of a
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:17.120]  high school was there and then there were other people who attended but nonetheless there was
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:22.720]  no proof of life no pictures of her and no video of her being anywhere near this place and
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:28.000]  sebastian gorka tweeted out the next day saying i believe that this concert or non-appearance of
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:32.480]  hers is going to be her excuse to not go to the state of union address and sure enough right
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:36.320]  before that they announced that she was not going to be present at the state of the union due to her
[3:40:36.320 --> 3:40:42.240]  attendance at this conference but during that there the concert during the concert her son-in-law
[3:40:42.240 --> 3:40:46.880]  got up there and said that uh ruth is fine she walks a mile a day and meets with her personal
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:53.920]  trainer twice a week but here's the question with basically i believe tmz i believe this still is
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:58.560]  true tmz camping out in front of her house or they have people sitting there waiting for her
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:03.680]  uh you know to make her appearance to come out of the house we still have not screen show
[3:41:03.680 --> 3:41:07.680]  hey but you're you're you're you're making yeah i gotta have you just like a sec man
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:14.080]  i gotta have a touch of community so uh anyway the news fox news the ap to everybody else
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:19.360]  reported that she attended this conference a few blocks from the white house that was dedicated
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:25.040]  to her there was no mention of this by the people who were hosting or putting on the concert there
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:30.480]  was no nothing to say you know thank you she's here uh this nothing like that which is pretty
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:35.680]  customary you think that when a concert is given in the honor and memory of her life in the law she
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:40.800]  would be in the front row and it would make it a big deal you know at least one picture at least one
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:47.760]  yeah exactly but but you know what here's what i heard i heard norman was talking to her her son
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:52.880]  norman i heard norman was talking to her and the rocking chair was going back and forth and back
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:58.000]  and forth and i guarantee you yeah in the trophy room go ahead joe i didn't mean that i guess that
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:04.320]  was what so what one other little aspect of this as we're closing out this segment uh was
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:12.320]  an anonymous nurse posted to one of the the forums online and stated that you know Ruth
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:16.960]  Bader Ginsburg is in a coma somewhere out west and they put a picture up you couldn't make heads of
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:21.680]  tales of who it was and they gave this information basically she's on life support being kept alive
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:26.400]  i don't know if that's true or not it's pure speculation and the photographic evidence is
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:32.000]  not definitive either way but where is Ruth Bader Ginsburg are they keeping her on ice is she alive
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:37.680]  and what are the laws i mean if they're if she did pass away or if she is being kept on life support
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:42.000]  do the democrats or do these people have a right to tell the american public is it a law
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:45.680]  should they tell them because if she's unable to serve or will be unable to serve in the future
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:50.000]  is that something that should be uh shared with the public folks you're listening to info wars
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:43:00.480]  hour number four doug and joe hagman hosting we'll be right back

[3:48:15.200 --> 3:48:20.400]  intellectually deficient morons on the left claim we are winning the information war and they
[3:48:20.400 --> 3:48:26.320]  can't stand that as with ruth bader ginsberg they got nothing to say ain't got nothing to say
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:31.520]  because she's what maybe rockin in the chair and norman's talking to her i don't know let me

[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:50.160]  pundit on february 5th posted an article mystery sighting still no picks from ginsberg public
[3:48:50.160 --> 3:48:57.680]  appearance hack reporter who claims he was hugged by rbg deletes tweet locks twitter account and
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:04.400]  this is a an article that goes to show david uh haggard and i'm sorry haggden haggdorn
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:09.600]  and he is uh some kind of the washington post contributor and who said that he was hugged
[3:49:09.600 --> 3:49:14.800]  by ruth bader ginsberg he describes himself as a dining columnist for arlington and bethesda
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:19.600]  magazines washington post contributor freelance reporter anyway he says what a delight to see
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:25.920]  rbg tonight at notorious bg song uh and it goes on from there but he ended up doing that
[3:49:25.920 --> 3:49:33.200]  sir wow everyone saw her and he locked his account now you think that ruth bader ginsberg
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:37.840]  if all the speculation surrounding her health and what she's doing where she is how she's doing
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:43.760]  that if she was there she would be shown on camera on video or at least a still image
[3:49:43.760 --> 3:49:48.480]  to show that she was there in person they apparently couldn't even get a body double
[3:49:48.480 --> 3:49:53.760]  to show uh to make it look like she was there but uh all this these mainstream news media
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:58.720]  outlets reporting that she was there as though it was fact as though they documented in themselves
[3:49:58.720 --> 3:50:04.640]  and without any any evidence to the uh support that claim just it leads me to believe that
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:09.840]  there's something going on here and and if she is too sick still in two weeks to to come and
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:14.560]  perform her duties at the supreme court and to attend events like this that's fine just say so
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:20.240]  but what what's with all those secrecy what's with the line and what was the concert really for was
[3:50:20.240 --> 3:50:25.120]  it a memorial about her life again i go back to that fox news graphic you know ruth bader ginsberg
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:33.200]  1933 to 2019 um what's going on here and legally who would get in trouble if they were keeping
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:39.280]  around us that's my next great and that's that's a great point and you're also fuzzing up your mic
[3:50:39.280 --> 3:50:44.960]  too uh in addition to the balance and so you're making people you're yeah it's right you're
[3:50:44.960 --> 3:50:50.960]  sorry you're making people nauseous as well as uh a little inside baseball here we uh our tech
[3:50:50.960 --> 3:50:56.560]  didn't get here in time we had to set this up ourselves so tech not our usual setup yeah it's
[3:50:56.560 --> 3:51:04.480]  all strings and tin cans right now but anyway uh stone cold uh invasion of privacy stone cold
[3:51:04.480 --> 3:51:09.440]  deep state terrorism in my view roger stone and folks you you know about about the situation
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:16.080]  with roger stone and the deep state the Mueller deep estate mechanism i'm i'm gonna tell you something
[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:22.480]  apple i look i don't yeah and i don't i don't give i don't give a wit if you like roger if you
[3:51:22.480 --> 3:51:27.360]  don't like roger i don't give a i don't i could care less if you like me or don't like me in fact
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:34.320]  i prefer just not to be just i don't care but you you know the people out there and and i
[3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:39.360]  and hear this lot and clear in my view this is my personal opinion but if you don't stand behind
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:46.880]  roger stone if you don't stand behind the fact that the the uh apple for example and this is on
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:53.200]  what the gateway pundit uh today or yesterday or yesterday gateway pundit jayka bingal is writing
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:52:00.720]  about this apple refused to give the federal government the backdoor access to the iphones
[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:05.760]  of the sandburn and deal of terrorists i know i know uh i was talked about this before i maybe
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:11.360]  yesterday i don't okay but think about this all right so you've got you've got roger stone
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:18.560]  apple giving deep state access to roger stones like cloud accounts after refusing to violate the
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:24.000]  privacy of sandburn deal of terrorists there it is right there the uh jayka bingals from the
[3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:31.200]  gateway pundit now now again it doesn't matter it doesn't matter even if you agree with the ideology
[3:52:31.200 --> 3:52:38.080]  agree with the person like the person it's not a popularity contest it's a contest or it's an issue
[3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:44.640]  of rights and it's more than that it's an issue of right versus wrong and then we get into the
[3:52:44.640 --> 3:52:50.160]  good versus evil aspect of this but right versus wrong and if you're out there one of those drunken
[3:52:50.160 --> 3:52:55.120]  seals on twitter clapping and putting up tweets saying well he deserves it and uh info wars should
[3:52:55.120 --> 3:52:59.680]  be shut down or if you're one of these googly eye mental patients out there uh tweeting from from
[3:52:59.680 --> 3:53:04.560]  inside uh you know your straps from your bed you can get just get to your ipad or ipod or whatever
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:13.680]  i whatever thing you use uh you know celebrating this shot shot and froida uh type thing well then
[3:53:13.680 --> 3:53:18.640]  you need to have your head examined because the violation the violations of the civil rights of
[3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:24.320]  roger stone plus added to the mix the deep state match the machinations of the deep state and the
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:31.040]  uh uh activities of the deep state against roger stone and others should have you urinating in your
[3:53:31.040 --> 3:53:36.880]  in your trousers all right or whatever you might be wearing your knickers look what we're seeing here
[3:53:36.880 --> 3:53:42.160]  is a tremendous affront to our civil rights it's it's constitutionally wrong i mean this whole
[3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:48.160]  thing is wrong right from the beginning and it's it's it's even more than a witch hunt it this this
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:55.120]  is this is an attack by these deep state members and and i look i don't have to drill this home understand
[3:53:55.120 --> 3:54:01.760]  the fact that if you again i i guess my message here is this um when you look at the entire
[3:54:01.760 --> 3:54:10.400]  situation the miller situation the angry uh what doesn't have democrats uh uh the revelations of
[3:54:10.400 --> 3:54:16.720]  people like sydney powell who have disclosed the weissmans of the world the judicial overreach
[3:54:16.720 --> 3:54:21.920]  the destruction of arthur anerson the destruction uh through the inron investigation putting people
[3:54:21.920 --> 3:54:26.880]  in prison millers behind this and of course miller's role in uranium one yeah none of this is coming
[3:54:26.880 --> 3:54:31.440]  up and of course it's not only not coming up when it does come up it's it's labeled as fake news
[3:54:31.440 --> 3:54:38.000]  through places like for example like in my professional opinion news guard or these gatekeeping
[3:54:38.880 --> 3:54:44.000]  these gatekeeping facilities on the internet well again they ask you not to believe in this case
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  too just like ruth bader ginsberg you know dude dude dude hey noren started uh look it here's a deal
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:56.240]  they are asking you not to believe your lying eyes all right now what you see don't don't
[3:54:56.240 --> 3:55:03.920]  believe that look over here look just like northam on abortion it's the black face that we must talk
[3:55:03.920 --> 3:55:11.360]  about not as not as pension for you know killing killing uh unborn or children you know at the
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:17.680]  at the moment of birth don't look at that look at the black face ruth bader ginsberg oh hey the fact
[3:55:17.680 --> 3:55:22.720]  that no one saw her there when you didn't see her i was there hey i was there i saw her yeah just
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:28.960]  take my word for it like you mentioned apple apple turning over the data uh i cloud data to
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:35.200]  of roger stone to the miller investigative team uh you know they won't even unlock phones for
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:41.200]  terrorist for the fbi but you know here you go uh have have had it to his almost private information
[3:55:41.200 --> 3:55:45.520]  contacts and whatever else might might be in there but uh just in the last two minutes i want to
[3:55:45.520 --> 3:55:49.680]  talk about this real quick and we saw we are all roger stone i just want to say this yeah if you
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:55.760]  don't support roger stone in my personal opinion you're you're intellectually off the lunch so go
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:56:00.720]  ahead and take it well with the state of the union address this this year uh we saw a few
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:04.480]  interesting things one it was delayed due to the democrats and the government shutdown but
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:09.840]  another thing we saw is a pre-bottle to the state of the union address by camilla harris and then
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:15.200]  we saw the response to the state of the union address given by failed democratic candidate
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:20.240]  stacey abrams from georgia and what is she saying uh just at a speech today democrats
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:24.880]  rising star stacey abrams called for revolution against whites she didn't come out and say it
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:31.840]  but what she did is list and a group or a list listed marginalized groups of people who she said
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:39.840]  and these include uh women native americans african americans and the lgbt community but
[3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:45.280]  and she's called on these groups to revolt against the dominant groups well if you read
[3:56:45.280 --> 3:56:54.000]  who she includes as the marginalized groups who's not in there uh i give up well it's white people
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:59.600]  it's christians and conservatives and um she is saying that this is and they say that she
[3:56:59.600 --> 3:57:05.680]  started her uh in this article that she writes that uh some incoherently the less we have in
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:11.520]  common the more united we all are but in her article you know it's a illogical and dishonest
[3:57:11.520 --> 3:57:15.600]  that's entirely vile as she calls for all identity groups to overthrow the only people left out of
[3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:21.040]  her purported victim class whites and this is a common theme amongst not only uh politicians here
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:25.920]  in america but also in europe where they are bringing in hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[3:57:25.920 --> 3:57:30.320]  illegal immigrants and they are changing the culture and demonizing whites to the point you
