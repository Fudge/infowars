[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.480]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.480 --> 00:46.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:46.880 --> 00:53.640]  Pfizer has commissioned Marvel Comics to publish a pro-COVID vaccine story, where the Avengers
[00:53.640 --> 01:01.160]  superhero team pushes BioNTech's mRNA shot on children, yet another example of Big Pharma's
[01:01.160 --> 01:07.360]  ability to purchase influence from the entertainment industry, this time with kids.
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.600]  Before the story begins, the word from our sponsors page at the front of the comic gives
[01:12.600 --> 01:19.120]  Pfizer's deceptive and deadly message, quote, vaccinate, stay up to date with the latest
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.040]  recommended booster for you and be an everyday hero.
[01:24.040 --> 01:29.680]  Released on October 4th, Avengers Everyday Heroes follows a family in the waiting room
[01:29.680 --> 01:32.440]  of a COVID-19 vaccine clinic.
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.000]  On the television in the waiting room, a news broadcast details the Avengers current battle
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.840]  with Ultron, the villain who is closely compared with COVID.
[01:42.840 --> 01:48.480]  Pfizer's tweet promoting the comic even states, quote, when Ultron wreaks havoc, the Avengers
[01:48.480 --> 01:51.360]  act as the first line of defense.
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.360]  People can help protect themselves by staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.480]  Within the comic book's story, the grandfather of the family further deepens the comparison
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.980]  between Ultron and COVID, quote, Ultron keeps coming back, keeps changing and
[02:07.980 --> 02:13.440]  evolving, so the Avengers keep adapting and re-strategizing again and again.
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.040]  The first time Ultron showed up, we had never seen anything like him before.
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.280]  This villainous comparison is supposed to parallel the COVID variants like Delta and
[02:23.280 --> 02:24.280]  Omnicron.
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.600]  Ultron even sounds like a plausible name for a COVID strain, and the Avengers are supposed
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.800]  to represent the experimental mRNA vaccines and boosters that are reformulated for each
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.400]  new COVID variant as they fight the villain again and again, each time he involves in
[02:41.400 --> 02:42.560]  his attacks.
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.880]  The analogy continues as the wise grandfather character explains that the Avengers had
[02:47.880 --> 02:55.040]  to use new tools and even robots to fight Ultron, but the villain or virus kept getting
[02:55.040 --> 02:57.040]  a step ahead of the heroes.
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.360]  This is referring to mRNA technology itself.
[03:00.360 --> 03:07.600]  The new tool never before administered on humans used to fight COVID as the virus mutates.
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.760]  Scientists are glorified by the grandfather under the mask of the superheroes, quote,
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.560]  the Avengers gather information and take time to innovate and adapt, and then they figure
[03:18.560 --> 03:19.960]  out how to fight it.
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.060]  This high praise leaves out the historically rushed release of COVID vaccines under Operation
[03:26.060 --> 03:31.080]  Warp Speed, skipping years and even decades of trial studies.
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.640]  And it forgets to mention the thousands killed in millions maimed by the experimental jab
[03:36.640 --> 03:39.280]  in the process of fighting COVID.
[03:39.280 --> 03:45.240]  The story ends with the family finally receiving their Pfizer booster shots in the clinic.
[03:45.240 --> 03:50.480]  As the grandfather says, quote, the Avengers are doing their part to keep us safe.
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.920]  Now it's time for us to do ours by staying up to date with our COVID-19 vaccinations.
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.520]  Clearly, Pfizer wants to instill on young minds the idea that their vaccine products
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.640]  are good for everybody, while much of the world is waking up and fighting back to protect
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.280]  children from the horrible side effects of COVID shots.
[04:11.280 --> 04:17.320]  The recent overwhelming popularity of the Avengers movies with young audiences is probably
[04:17.320 --> 04:23.000]  what convinced Pfizer that their corporate-sponsored advertisement would be ultimately successful
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.520]  at reaching kids.
[04:24.520 --> 04:31.600]  However, the thinly-veiled analogy laid out between Ultron and COVID, Pfizer and the Avengers,
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.400]  is so see-through and clumsy that I find it hard to believe that anyone will actually
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.560]  receive their messaging, let alone even read this story.
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.720]  Let's just pray that the young, impressionable minds that take this comic in are smarter
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.840]  than Pfizer's very unimaginative creative team.
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.320]  This is Brian Wilson with Infowars.com.
[04:54.320 --> 05:15.480]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[05:15.480 --> 05:20.800]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[05:20.800 --> 05:28.360]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[05:28.360 --> 05:31.600]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[05:31.600 --> 05:37.360]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.840]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.600]  I don't take the credit.
[05:43.600 --> 05:45.440]  I give you the credit.
[05:45.440 --> 05:47.800]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours.
[05:47.800 --> 05:49.800]  It isn't going to give up.
[05:49.800 --> 05:51.560]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[06:03.480 --> 06:08.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, October 10th, 2022.
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.080]  The reporting Russia has launched attacks, cyber attacks against the U.S., a false flag
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.080]  is here.
[06:14.080 --> 06:22.360]  In the minds of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.360 --> 06:29.320]  There's an emergency report we put out two months ago, warning of stage cyber attacks
[06:29.320 --> 06:34.160]  against the U.S. civilian infrastructure we blamed on Russia as the final escalation
[06:34.160 --> 06:36.280]  into full-bore open war.
[06:36.280 --> 06:40.720]  We are now at war with Russia, and what I predicted here and on Steve Bannon's war
[06:40.720 --> 06:44.800]  room is now happening.
[06:44.800 --> 06:53.800]  As a young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this government are actually
[06:53.800 --> 06:56.280]  young nobleness of the world, I correct you.
[06:56.280 --> 06:58.880]  So we penetrate the cabinet.
[06:58.880 --> 07:01.680]  The change is not just happening.
[07:01.680 --> 07:06.280]  The change can be shaped by us.
[07:06.280 --> 07:11.920]  We have to prepare for a more angry world, how to prepare to take the necessary action
[07:11.920 --> 07:16.440]  to create the fair world.
[07:16.440 --> 07:19.040]  I see the need for a great reset.
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.760]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world, which we had, and everything
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.840]  will be normal again.
[07:26.840 --> 07:31.200]  This is, let's say, fiction, it will not happen.
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.520]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.200]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[07:39.200 --> 07:47.040]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack,
[07:47.040 --> 07:55.640]  which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[07:55.640 --> 07:59.120]  Our society as a whole.
[07:59.120 --> 08:08.200]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[08:08.200 --> 08:18.960]  to a major cyber attack.
[08:18.960 --> 08:25.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, anybody that tunes in on a regular basis knows that every week I
[08:25.640 --> 08:32.920]  warned that the globalist I believe next, after the COVID attack, would launch a group
[08:32.920 --> 08:39.160]  of cyber attacks against U.S. civilian infrastructure and blame it on Russia as a pretext to escalate
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.160]  war.
[08:40.160 --> 08:43.720]  Why did I know that?
[08:43.720 --> 08:49.160]  Because all the pre-programming by the U.N., by Klaus Schwab, the W.E.F., by the Pentagon,
[08:49.160 --> 09:00.040]  by Biden, by Obama, and by Hillary, by Hillary, six years ago, in 2016, she was everywhere
[09:00.040 --> 09:03.960]  saying the Russians are going to launch a cyber attack and when they do, we reserve
[09:03.960 --> 09:07.320]  the right to use nuclear weapons against them.
[09:07.320 --> 09:12.240]  Then you see Zelensky saying he wants preemptive nuclear strikes last week.
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.360]  You see Biden saying it's Armageddon, and I said at least five times last week, I said
[09:17.360 --> 09:24.600]  look for major cyber attacks against the West to be blamed on Russia.
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.320]  Russia had their pipeline blown up, Russia had their bridge blown up, Russia's getting
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.800]  their ass kicked by NATO, they walked right into a trap.
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.680]  I wish it never would have happened.
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.240]  I want to have peace and not have nuclear war, but when you look at all the pre-programming
[09:39.240 --> 09:43.880]  that's taking place, it was easy to look at what their next move would be because they
[09:43.880 --> 09:47.720]  love to tell you.
[09:47.720 --> 09:53.440]  Here's Hillary Clinton six years ago during the campaign, wetting her lips, talking about
[09:53.440 --> 09:58.480]  nuking Russia if there's a cyber attack, but we know from the Vault 7 CIA documents that
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.960]  WikiLeaks put out, now eight years ago they admit are real, it was how the CIA and other
[10:03.960 --> 10:08.360]  groups could spoof IP addresses in any country they wanted to.
[10:08.360 --> 10:19.200]  They could have your computer, your Mac or your PC or your Linux, your cell phone, they
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.720]  could claim had launched a cyber attack and put that address out, hell even your refrigerators
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.160]  now and dishwashers have IP addresses, they could claim your dishwasher, launch an attack
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.760]  seriously, and frame you, and then launch an attack claiming oh, you don't need Japanese
[10:36.760 --> 10:41.640]  airplanes coming in to actually attack at Pearl Harbor, you don't need a real attack
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.200]  to happen, you just claim that you've been attacked when in truth the globalists have
[10:46.200 --> 10:49.080]  attacked we the people who are their main enemy.
[10:49.080 --> 10:51.520]  Here's Hillary six years ago.
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.880]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[10:57.880 --> 10:59.840]  like any other attack.
[10:59.840 --> 11:06.560]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[11:06.560 --> 11:11.000]  And then they put out Washington Post headlines that includes, we should give an interview,
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.320]  nuclear weapons, and remember the people running Hillary are running the O. Biden administration,
[11:17.320 --> 11:19.280]  the third administration of Obama.
[11:19.280 --> 11:21.320]  So what's happened?
[11:21.320 --> 11:24.760]  Cyber attacks reported at U.S. airports.
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.840]  It says the attacker was within the Russian Federation according to a senior official.
[11:30.840 --> 11:34.640]  The Ukrainians are trying to draw us into the war, they're the main suspects.
[11:34.640 --> 11:41.560]  ABC News, some of the nation's largest airports have been targeted for cyber attacks today
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.320]  this Monday by an attacker within the Russian Federation, a senior official brief confirmed
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.320]  to ABC News.
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.360]  Well, they know who did it right away, but nobody knows who wrote the pipeline.
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.800]  Importantly, the systems targeted do not handle air traffic control, internal airline communications
[11:56.800 --> 12:00.000]  or coordination, or transportation security.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.960]  It's an inconvenience, the source said, the attacks have resulted in targeted denial of
[12:03.960 --> 12:11.200]  public access to public-facing web domains that report airport wait times and congestion.
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.960]  The attacks were first reported around 3 a.m. Eastern time when the Port Authority notified
[12:15.960 --> 12:20.200]  the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency that the LaGuardia Airport New York
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.560]  system had been hit.
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.440]  LaGuardia has been restored, but other airports around the country have subsequently been
[12:26.440 --> 12:27.440]  targeted.
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.560]  The websites of Des Moines International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, LAX, Chicago
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.400]  Air and National Airport appeared impacted Monday morning.
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.320]  Hartz Field, Jackson Atlanta International Airport reported around 10.30 a.m. ET time
[12:41.320 --> 12:47.520]  that its site is back up and running and that at no time, roperace is the airport impacted.
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.680]  Engineers and programmers are actively working to close back doors that allow attacks and
[12:51.680 --> 12:54.000]  shorting up more critical computer infrastructure.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.600]  We'll continue to follow the development story as it unfolds.
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.600]  So here's some of the background.
[13:02.600 --> 13:11.240]  Here's a report out of the Washington Post, July 9th of 2001.
[13:11.240 --> 13:17.240]  The U.S. says it can answer cyber attacks with nuclear weapons.
[13:17.240 --> 13:20.320]  That's lunacy, said Allen S. Weiner.
[13:20.320 --> 13:22.160]  Yes, it is.
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.720]  What if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Atlantic hypes up?
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.000]  Why hasn't Russia launched major cyber attacks since the invasion of Ukraine?
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.760]  Because they know it doesn't help them and they'll be blamed for it.
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.880]  Time Magazine asked that question in March of this year, but now it's happening.
[13:40.880 --> 13:43.640]  And it goes on and on and on.
[13:43.640 --> 13:50.040]  Russia hackers suspected over cyber attack on U.S. airports, London Independent.
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.440]  Only Hillary Clinton's prepared for the nuclear threat.
[13:52.440 --> 13:58.040]  That goes back to October of 2016 from the statements we just played.
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.080]  And it goes on and on and on.
[14:02.080 --> 14:10.400]  Meanwhile, I'm surprised the controlled corporate press hasn't come out and blend the bridge
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.400]  being blown up into Crimea out of Russia on the Russians.
[14:15.400 --> 14:18.080]  But the Ukrainians are celebrating it, admit they did it.
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.640]  And of course, the globalists blew up the pipeline as well.
[14:21.640 --> 14:27.920]  I want to open the phones up for veterans and for military folks and for cybersecurity
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.040]  experts to specifically talk about this issue.
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.680]  I'm going to give the number out when we come back.
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.920]  On the other side, we're going to take calls during the shower.
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.600]  And some of the next hour, we have several big guests lined up today that I'm still going
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.840]  to have on, but I'm going to cut back how long they're on so we can mainly focus on this
[14:44.840 --> 14:45.840]  issue.
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.880]  There's also some extremely good news that's come out on a bunch of fronts.
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.920]  Florida's Surgeon General put out a detailed year-long study confirming what other major
[14:56.920 --> 15:04.560]  studies have shown an 84% increase in death in men ages 18 to 39 after taking the Moderna
[15:04.560 --> 15:06.360]  or Pfizer shots.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.480]  The good news is we're exposing the Siebel and big pharma thought they'd get away with
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.480]  it.
[15:11.480 --> 15:12.480]  They're not going to.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.480]  But that makes them even more dangerous.
[15:13.480 --> 15:17.760]  Then PayPal last week said we're going to find you $2,500 and spy on everything you
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.720]  say online and everywhere else, and if we don't like what you say and we call this information,
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.280]  we're going to find you $2,500, truly the social credit score.
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.680]  They backed off of that this weekend.
[15:28.680 --> 15:31.120]  So people are really, really waking up.
[15:31.120 --> 15:37.320]  Also other good news, Democrat cities everywhere are announcing we cannot take any more illegal
[15:37.320 --> 15:42.080]  aliens and declaring states of emergency and saying they've got to stay in Texas and Arizona.
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.320]  So while just like that, suddenly they're not saying to our cities, what's good for
[15:47.320 --> 15:48.520]  the goose is good for the gander.
[15:48.520 --> 15:50.800]  It's all coming up and more today.
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.440]  Spread the word about the live links, override the sensors, share the link info wars.com

[15:59.920 --> 16:04.560]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the global stone documents from their own

[16:08.200 --> 16:10.360]  My credibility has never been higher.

[16:14.600 --> 16:20.320]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.440]  reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.760]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[16:29.760 --> 16:33.600]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced
[16:33.600 --> 16:39.200]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.

[17:00.960 --> 17:05.840]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[17:05.840 --> 17:12.360]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, to the world.
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.880]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[17:17.880 --> 17:18.880]  deserve the credit.
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.560]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason
[17:24.560 --> 17:29.440]  you've had the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[17:29.440 --> 17:31.760]  the new order we've ever had.

[20:01.320 --> 20:11.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.440 --> 20:17.720]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[20:17.720 --> 20:19.440]  be followed.
[20:19.440 --> 20:24.920]  It's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[20:24.920 --> 20:27.240]  launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[20:27.240 --> 20:33.640]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[20:33.640 --> 20:35.560]  like any other attack.
[20:35.560 --> 20:40.520]  We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[20:40.520 --> 20:45.680]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for
[20:45.680 --> 20:47.360]  Hillary, it's war.
[20:47.360 --> 20:52.400]  We came, we saw, we died.
[20:52.400 --> 20:54.600]  With her, you'll end up in world war three.
[20:54.600 --> 20:58.440]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[20:58.440 --> 21:03.480]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us
[21:03.480 --> 21:08.200]  to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[21:08.200 --> 21:12.680]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[21:12.680 --> 21:18.440]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed
[21:18.440 --> 21:20.680]  reports of further hacking.
[21:20.680 --> 21:23.360]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[21:23.360 --> 21:25.160]  Well, of course not, because she's...
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.160]  That's a really loud noise.
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.800]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[21:31.800 --> 21:37.960]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[21:37.960 --> 21:47.960]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[21:47.960 --> 22:03.920]  Hard to believe we put this together six years ago, right before the election, just
[22:03.920 --> 22:10.560]  last week, on November 8, vote like the world depends on it, and we had peace for four years.
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.360]  We were dead on, we were right again, and now, ladies and gentlemen, we have the same
[22:15.360 --> 22:21.040]  globalist consortium that is Hillary and Obama and Biden and the powerful Empress
[22:21.040 --> 22:30.120]  behind them that have gotten us into a proxy war and our full bore war with the Russians.
[22:30.120 --> 22:36.400]  Russian bridges getting blown up, major bridges, pipelines, the Russians are now bombarding
[22:36.400 --> 22:48.040]  major cities like the capital in Ukraine, Kiev, and that's how you get into a full bore
[22:48.040 --> 22:54.160]  nuclear war, and cyber attacks have now been reported at U.S. airports, and instantly,
[22:54.160 --> 22:58.880]  they said the Russians are the suspects at 3 a.m. last night, and then now in the last
[22:58.880 --> 23:05.040]  hour, U.S. unnamed official confirms it's the Russians, and all the pre-programming
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.000]  by the deep state and Klaus Schwab and the U.N. and the Pentagon was, the Russians are
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.840]  going to hit us with a cyber attack, but if you pull up Vault 7 documents from now, seven
[23:13.840 --> 23:22.120]  or eight years ago, headline, CIA has tools to frame foreign individuals, corporations,
[23:22.120 --> 23:28.320]  and governments with cyber attacks, it's not just the government that has those tools,
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.240]  you hear about zombie attacks all the time, where hackers go out, private hackers, and
[23:32.240 --> 23:36.920]  you control a bunch of people's private computers, and then take control of a bunch of computers,
[23:36.920 --> 23:40.640]  and then use them like a mainframe or use them like a computer complex, sometimes they
[23:40.640 --> 23:46.440]  hijack up to 10,000, 20,000 computers, and then just launch devastating attacks with them.
[23:46.440 --> 23:52.120]  So somebody in Russia did it, they claim, it originated out of Russia, when you can
[23:52.120 --> 23:56.000]  make an attack look like whatever you want.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.240]  My IT guys don't do stuff like that, but if they wanted to, they could attack somebody
[23:59.240 --> 24:03.600]  in another country, make it look like it came from Japan, and then attack somebody in Russia,
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.160]  or run computers out of South Africa, and make it look like they attacked somebody, say,
[24:08.160 --> 24:13.240]  in Libya, but really, it was somebody launching an attack from D.C.
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.320]  This is a big escalation, you notice now the escalations are every few days, things are
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.800]  going fast and furious now, I want to open the phones up for cyber security experts,
[24:23.800 --> 24:30.360]  for military historians, for veterans, for active duty, specifically on World War III,
[24:30.360 --> 24:35.400]  and just that huge subject of Biden saying, biggest danger of Armageddon since 1961, I
[24:35.400 --> 24:40.520]  think it's worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the bridge being blown up, and the pipeline,
[24:40.520 --> 24:44.760]  and the mobilization of Russian troops, and the Russians bombarding major cities now,
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.960]  hitting major targets they weren't hitting before, civilian targets, that are also being
[24:48.960 --> 24:51.080]  used for military operations.
[24:51.080 --> 25:03.240]  So things are really heating up fast, toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539,
[25:03.240 --> 25:06.760]  and the Ukrainians are celebrating, and laughing about blowing up the pipeline, and blowing
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.400]  up the bridge, and laughing about videos of wild boars eating dead Russian troops, and
[25:11.400 --> 25:18.720]  just so much fun they think because they haven't been hit yet by a major bombardment, and the
[25:18.720 --> 25:26.880]  globalists are trying to maneuver and push Putin into doing what Hitler did when he was
[25:26.880 --> 25:37.480]  engaging the Brits in the Battle of the Blitz, Blitz bombing London and other areas, he was
[25:37.480 --> 25:45.840]  hitting military targets at first, but they sent in British bombers to bomb German civilians,
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.840]  and so Hitler then took the bait, started attacking British civilian targets, and it
[25:49.840 --> 25:56.200]  turned the Brits from 90-plus percent against the war to 90-plus percent for the war.
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.480]  This is all just military history, repeating itself over and over again, of your TV viewers
[26:00.480 --> 26:09.200]  were showing you shockingly horrible footage of major buildings across the capital city
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.400]  of Ukraine, Kiev, being blown into bits, so the Russians had not targeted civilian targets
[26:15.400 --> 26:21.200]  until now, they had hit some targets that had been taken over by the military, but now
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.440]  the Russians are beginning to engage in a scorched earth operation, so massive, massive
[26:28.440 --> 26:34.440]  escalation, hope everybody says their prayers tonight, because we could go up in flame at
[26:34.440 --> 26:41.440]  any time, 877-789-2539, we're going to come back, take your phone calls, get into so much
[26:41.440 --> 26:44.880]  more, we've got a lot of good news as well, but this is obviously the front and center,
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.240]  we've got some really bad economic news, we've got a lot of really good news on the
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.760]  COVID front, really good news on the social credit score front, and really good news on
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.960]  the open borders front as the Democrats finally start choking on the illegal aliens they're
[26:57.960 --> 27:04.040]  shipping in, but separately, I can't operate and I can't stay on air, and that's the way
[27:04.040 --> 27:09.200]  God's done this, and I love God, it's all in God's plan, but we're constantly in the
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.840]  black, in the red, in the black, in the red, imagine if you had to drive around town and
[27:13.840 --> 27:20.080]  say you were a delivery truck, but you always had to operate on a tenth of a tank, and so
[27:20.080 --> 27:22.760]  you're constantly stopping at the gas station because you're only allowed to fill it up to
[27:22.760 --> 27:27.160]  a tenth of a tank, and then you are almost always running out of gas, and if you run
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.960]  out of gas in operation like this, it's hard to restart it folks, not like a car, so we
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.920]  need your support now, everything we've talked about is coming true, our credibility is the
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.080]  highest it's ever been, we're reaching more people than ever, but we need you, the court
[27:39.080 --> 27:43.080]  audience of badasses, that have kept this operation afloat to understand that when I
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.800]  fired the bat signal I'm serious, we have a $500,000 underage right now, we're making
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.680]  it over the hump of these show trials, a lot of those bills are about to go away, we got
[27:51.680 --> 27:54.800]  a lot of new products coming in in a few months, a lot of good stuff's happening, but right
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.680]  now we're out of money and I'm out of money, plus we've got products you need, go to infowarstore.com,

[28:37.560 --> 28:42.240]  advantage of dozens of other products and support the info war, now is the time to take
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.540]  action.
[28:43.540 --> 28:48.720]  I don't want to prove to you how much we're in trouble here by shutting down, I need you

[29:06.680 --> 29:11.560]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family
[29:11.560 --> 29:14.260]  that is info wars.
[29:14.260 --> 29:19.400]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[29:19.400 --> 29:26.880]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.360]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[29:30.360 --> 29:36.120]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[29:36.120 --> 29:40.600]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[29:40.600 --> 29:46.600]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours,
[29:46.600 --> 29:50.360]  it isn't going to give up, without your support we can be shut down.
[29:50.360 --> 30:00.760]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[30:00.760 --> 30:08.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[30:08.240 --> 30:12.200]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[30:12.200 --> 30:17.720]  We are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war, but I don't
[30:17.720 --> 30:18.720]  deserve the credit.
[30:18.720 --> 30:23.640]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real
[30:23.640 --> 30:29.280]  reason you've had the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[30:29.280 --> 30:31.600]  the new world order you've ever had.
[30:31.600 --> 30:38.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.160]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[30:42.160 --> 30:45.160]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[30:45.160 --> 30:50.800]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.680]  now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[30:54.680 --> 31:20.680]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.320]  Now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them, and I need
[31:25.320 --> 31:26.320]  your support.
[31:26.320 --> 31:30.760]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me this fight
[31:30.760 --> 31:38.520]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com, and saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that
[31:38.520 --> 31:42.880]  gives him go for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[31:42.880 --> 31:47.640]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years of the making is almost over, and right at

[33:01.600 --> 33:18.640]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:18.640 --> 33:33.200]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[33:33.200 --> 33:40.320]  Kanye West in his big interview with Tucker Carlson, in fact, go ahead and cue that up.
[33:40.320 --> 33:46.520]  Talked about how he's not saying they stayed Gevaldi, but he saw them pre-position Matthew
[33:46.520 --> 33:50.120]  McConaughey as the anti-gun guy, talk about Gevaldi.
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.720]  And then within minutes of the shooting happened, he saw an official story on dozens of channels,
[33:55.720 --> 33:59.120]  different networks, different companies and the exact same scripting.
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.280]  Just like we played those videos where it shows ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, local affiliates
[34:04.280 --> 34:08.600]  all saying the exact same thing in the exact same order because they're being given a script
[34:08.600 --> 34:11.600]  by the federal government on record to do it.
[34:11.600 --> 34:19.840]  What happened under George W. Bush headline, Congress legalizes domestic propaganda lying
[34:19.840 --> 34:23.880]  to the American people.
[34:23.880 --> 34:28.840]  And so when you turn on local Fox, local Time Warner, local ABC and you hear white people
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.640]  are terrorists, white people are the number one terror threat, white people commit the
[34:32.640 --> 34:33.640]  most crime.
[34:33.640 --> 34:36.040]  You know it's not true.
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.840]  Who's telling them to say that in the exact same order?
[34:38.840 --> 34:44.160]  The CIA folks, the CIA runs this country and who runs the CIA?
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.360]  The Carnegie Endowment, they set up the Rockefeller Foundation, they set up everything.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.880]  They run the world.
[34:50.880 --> 34:56.280]  Now the average person in the CIA isn't even privy to this information.
[34:56.280 --> 35:00.320]  I've reverse engineered the whole thing and it's actually in the Senator Frank Church
[35:00.320 --> 35:02.240]  committee hearings in the 70s.
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.760]  So we know exactly what's going on and we have a government waging war on us.
[35:06.760 --> 35:08.280]  Now listen to me.
[35:08.280 --> 35:15.120]  I could sit here and show you 50 articles from the last two years, BBC, London Telegraph,
[35:15.120 --> 35:23.000]  National Post, a Canada, Washington Post saying the Pentagon, the British Ministry of Defense,
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.480]  the Canadian Ministry of Defense, the German Ministry of Defense, the Australian military
[35:27.480 --> 35:32.320]  all ran the PSYOP of the lockdowns and the fear.
[35:32.320 --> 35:43.080]  They used secret PSYOP fear program so serious that it's not even allowed to be used overseas.
[35:43.080 --> 35:46.960]  They had an army full bird colonel on last year.
[35:46.960 --> 35:52.840]  We already knew this, but he used to work in there on OAN, laying out the documents
[35:52.840 --> 35:59.400]  how they weren't allowed to use some of these programs that he wrote in Afghanistan against
[35:59.400 --> 36:04.520]  our enemies, but that his particular program on the type of PSYOP was used that he knew
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.480]  of in America.
[36:08.480 --> 36:17.760]  So that's really dangerous and it's really destructive, but when you know a PSYOP and
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.280]  you know it's uniformity, when it's being pushed out, it tells you what's about to happen.
[36:23.280 --> 36:28.360]  If you're awake, it's having an enemy blueprint.
[36:28.360 --> 36:30.000]  If you're asleep, it destroys you.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.520]  I went to the grocery store yesterday with my wife and there were still idiots, probably
[36:35.520 --> 36:41.920]  5% of people, 10% maybe, wearing the mask, almost old, old white women because they believe
[36:41.920 --> 36:42.920]  in the system.
[36:42.920 --> 36:43.920]  They believe it wants to help them.
[36:43.920 --> 36:49.960]  No lady, it doesn't want to help you, it wants to kill your ass.
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.880]  And so people are asking, why are you so concerned about the cyber attack against the U.S. airports
[36:53.880 --> 37:01.720]  today, because all of the pre-programming and scripting is for this.
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.720]  And Clown Schwab and the New World Order and Bill Gates love to brag and say how smart
[37:05.720 --> 37:08.120]  they are.
[37:08.120 --> 37:15.120]  Bill Gates three years ago, a virus will come out of China called Disease X, it's imminent
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.720]  and when it happens, your civilization will never be the same.
[37:19.720 --> 37:26.000]  They were running Event 201 right then in October, November, three years ago.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.320]  And they did it because they treat you like you've got a 70 IQ.
[37:31.320 --> 37:34.120]  They treat you like you're asleep because a lot of people are.
[37:34.120 --> 37:35.780]  But guess what?
[37:35.780 --> 37:38.960]  Those of us that aren't asleep can see what's happening and the good news is their propaganda
[37:38.960 --> 37:40.240]  is failing everywhere.
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.880]  The danger is they're doubling down with a massive war.
[37:44.880 --> 37:46.440]  So let me show you some of these headlines.
[37:46.440 --> 37:51.160]  Again, cyber attack reported at U.S. airports, within hours it's Russia that did it.
[37:51.160 --> 37:55.920]  We've got to have war with Russia.
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.800]  The U.S. says it can answer cyber attacks with nuclear weapons, Washington Post, and
[38:00.800 --> 38:03.600]  it goes on and on and on from there.
[38:03.600 --> 38:09.640]  So this is the doctrine, this is what they've been preparing, and here's some of the background
[38:09.640 --> 38:10.640]  on it.
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.800]  White House warns Russia prepping possible cyber attacks against the U.S.
[38:15.800 --> 38:23.000]  One month into the war, starts in February 24th, on March 21st, less than a month later,
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.640]  oh my God, they're going to strike us, and if they do, we'll have to use heavy weapons
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.200]  on them, and that'll be a pretext for the U.S. to officially go to war with Russia.
[38:31.200 --> 38:35.200]  You wonder how the left's going to keep control of America?
[38:35.200 --> 38:39.440]  A war with the Russians, and they've already said Republicans and Trump are Russian agents.
[38:39.440 --> 38:43.520]  So anybody that wants peace, anybody that doesn't want nuclear war, while we're all
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.480]  Russians, see the scripting, they've not been just been doing this for no reason.
[38:48.480 --> 38:55.200]  They continue, Biden warns Russia cyber attacks coming, again planting that story two months
[38:55.200 --> 39:00.960]  ago, Biden Russia exploring U.S. cyber attacks, again in March, showing the last six months
[39:00.960 --> 39:01.960]  they've been doing this.
[39:01.960 --> 39:07.560]  It's coming, President Biden warns of evolving Russian cyber threat to the U.S., and it goes
[39:07.560 --> 39:09.320]  on, but what do they not want you to know?
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.360]  They don't want you to know about this.
[39:11.360 --> 39:16.640]  The World Economic Forum in consultation with the Rockefeller Foundation in the U.N. put
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.080]  out cyber polygon that's just as important as the Rockefeller Foundation's Operation
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.680]  Lockstep that was the blueprint for the COVID-19 release and takeover.
[39:26.680 --> 39:30.680]  And this plan that they've now removed that came out in 2020, right after the virus was
[39:30.680 --> 39:36.680]  released, says that they're going to be cascading cyber attacks all over the world by governments
[39:36.680 --> 39:41.560]  and private corporations and individuals, and it will finally result in the grid going
[39:41.560 --> 39:46.320]  down in major countries and hundreds of millions dead, but don't worry, they've got a new global
[39:46.320 --> 39:51.480]  ID where you can't get online unless you have it that will fix everything.
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.920]  And then if there's a microchip too, they're going to say that by 2026, you'll take a microchip.
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.880]  That will stop your power being turned off.
[39:57.880 --> 39:58.880]  That will stop the Russians.
[39:58.880 --> 39:59.960]  Of course, it's not the Russians.
[39:59.960 --> 40:00.960]  It's them.
[40:00.960 --> 40:01.960]  It's the New World Order.
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.120]  50 times more evil than the Russians, the worst Russians, okay?
[40:06.120 --> 40:10.720]  So that's what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.240]  The globalists are 100 times more organized than the Russians, and if the Russians were
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.840]  destroying us, I'd be at war with them.
[40:17.840 --> 40:18.840]  They're not.
[40:18.840 --> 40:20.320]  We're being set against each other.
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.120]  In fact, guys, queue up the clip from Russia with Love, the intro scene where they have
[40:25.120 --> 40:27.800]  the Siamese fighting, fish killing each other.
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.640]  It's about a minute and a half long.
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.120]  The smart one hangs back while the other two, one kills the other, and the other is hurt
[40:33.120 --> 40:34.120]  now.
[40:34.120 --> 40:37.080]  The other comes in and kills the other and now has dominance.
[40:37.080 --> 40:38.200]  That's the New World Order.
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.840]  They remove cyber polygon from their website, folks, because we paid attention to it and
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.040]  figured it out.
[40:44.040 --> 40:46.160]  We have the enemy blueprint.
[40:46.160 --> 40:47.160]  They're starting to panic.
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.160]  They don't know what to do.
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.760]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.840]  We're going to come back with Stephen, Derek, Brian, John, Tom, Mike, Joe, Greg, and many
[40:54.840 --> 40:55.840]  others.
[40:55.840 --> 40:58.200]  I'm going to say it again.
[40:58.200 --> 41:03.240]  Now is the time to be praying morning, noon, and night, or whenever you can.
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.920]  I'm not saying five times a day to Mecca, but I mean, you really ought to regimen it.
[41:06.920 --> 41:07.920]  Just get it done.
[41:07.920 --> 41:09.480]  I prayed for 30 minutes this morning.
[41:09.480 --> 41:10.480]  I had meetings I had to go to.
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.160]  I just said, no, I'm praying.
[41:12.160 --> 41:18.480]  I got in my bedroom, turned off the lights, and got on my damn knees for 30 minutes.
[41:18.480 --> 41:20.760]  I mean, I'm going to just walk off right now and go pray.
[41:20.760 --> 41:21.760]  I mean, I'm serious, folks.
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.560]  I don't get into my private life, but I pray a lot.
[41:26.560 --> 41:29.920]  I was intending to come in here today and say, cyber attacks are imminent.
[41:29.920 --> 41:30.920]  Here it is.
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.320]  So, I mean, I'm dialed into the Holy Spirit, so are you, that's why you're here.
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.200]  We need your support, plus we've got products you need.
[41:37.200 --> 41:41.120]  I have got a $500,000 underage for the next month to pay the bills.
[41:41.120 --> 41:45.480]  We got over a lot of the big legal bills, but it took us down to almost nothing, toe-to-toe
[41:45.480 --> 41:47.960]  with top Democrat law firms.
[41:47.960 --> 41:49.440]  The two big show trials are over.
[41:49.440 --> 41:51.120]  There's one more coming up next year.
[41:51.120 --> 41:52.120]  That's a bump in the road.
[41:52.120 --> 41:53.120]  We've got two years of appeals.
[41:53.120 --> 41:54.280]  I'm not even worried about that.
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.800]  I'm worried about nuclear war, but we got new products coming in in a couple of months.
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.400]  We won't have to sit here and ride you so hard in the future, but we need the help now,
[42:01.400 --> 42:02.920]  plus we've got products you need.
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.600]  There's a major run on iodine, high-quality iodine, because of the good effects it has.
[42:06.600 --> 42:07.960]  People are learning about that.
[42:07.960 --> 42:09.720]  We're not selling it for radiation protection.
[42:09.720 --> 42:14.160]  We're selling it for your libido, your stamina, your energy, your immune system, number one,
[42:14.160 --> 42:15.720]  your immune system, and energy.
[42:15.720 --> 42:17.920]  And X3 is the three best types of iodine.

[42:20.720 --> 42:25.680]  We're not raising the price on it, even though it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com,

[43:09.200 --> 43:14.480]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.640]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, and Bolsonaro and
[43:19.640 --> 43:27.120]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[43:27.120 --> 43:30.600]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[43:30.600 --> 43:36.360]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.840]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[43:40.840 --> 43:42.600]  I don't take the credit.
[43:42.600 --> 43:44.440]  I give you the credit.
[43:44.440 --> 43:46.800]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.

[45:59.960 --> 46:05.960]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.480]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  deserve the credit.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.960]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real
[46:23.960 --> 46:26.520]  reason we've had the success.
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.920]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[46:30.920 --> 46:31.920]  had.
[46:31.920 --> 46:38.640]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[46:38.640 --> 46:42.600]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.440]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[46:45.440 --> 46:46.440]  God bless you all.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.440]  I salute you.
[46:47.440 --> 46:48.440]  I thank you.
[46:48.440 --> 46:53.760]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history
[46:53.760 --> 46:54.760]  is happening.
[46:54.760 --> 46:55.760]  The fight is my fight.
[46:55.760 --> 46:56.760]  It's your fight.
[46:56.760 --> 46:57.760]  It's our fight.
[46:57.760 --> 47:05.160]  God bless you all, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:08.160 --> 47:17.160]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:17.160 --> 47:31.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're on your phone calls right now.
[47:31.440 --> 47:37.360]  And then I'm going to play Marble Framework Vault 7, how the CIA was planning to frame
[47:37.360 --> 47:40.760]  Russia for cyber attacks that's mainstream news.
[47:40.760 --> 47:43.840]  We've got a big compilation that we're going to air next hour.
[47:43.840 --> 47:47.960]  It's coming, Joe Biden casually says Russia is planning a cyber attack against the U.S.
[47:47.960 --> 47:50.800]  because the globalists are playing to frame Russia.
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.920]  They have the motives, they have the history, they're the ones behind it.
[47:54.920 --> 47:58.160]  They're behind the pipeline, they're behind the bridge, they're behind cutting off our
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.520]  Keystone pipeline, they're behind shipping in the fentanyl, they're behind shipping our
[48:01.520 --> 48:05.440]  jobs in China, they're behind drag queen pedophile time, they're behind the mutilation
[48:05.440 --> 48:09.720]  and sterilization of our children, they're behind it all.
[48:09.720 --> 48:13.800]  They are the great evil that has hijacked our nation.
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.520]  Let's go to the phone calls here in the order they were received.
[48:16.520 --> 48:19.680]  Let's talk to Brian, who is in cybersecurity calling from Texas.
[48:19.680 --> 48:20.680]  What's your take on this?
[48:20.680 --> 48:22.880]  Alex, how are you doing today, man?
[48:22.880 --> 48:23.880]  Good, brother.
[48:23.880 --> 48:27.760]  Hey, first of all, I wanted to say, you know, really God bless you and your family.
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.720]  I know you have a daughter that's about as young as my oldest child and obviously I pray
[48:31.720 --> 48:34.480]  for the future that they are going to walk into.
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.000]  But, you know, again, I also pray that you continue to stay strong in the face of this
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.680]  adversity because, again, I believe that you are powered by God and with him at your side,
[48:42.680 --> 48:44.560]  you can do anything.
[48:44.560 --> 48:45.560]  Let me plug real quick.
[48:45.560 --> 48:47.720]  I'm a 43-year-old former athlete.
[48:47.720 --> 48:50.480]  My body was banged up for a bunch of years.
[48:50.480 --> 48:54.440]  If I could go back in time, I'd buy about 500 boxes of those vanilla protein bars that
[48:54.440 --> 48:56.840]  you have, those coconut bars.
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.680]  You know, I live on the X2, the B12, the SuperMail and, you know, I really want to challenge
[49:02.680 --> 49:05.360]  the Christian men that are listening to your show today.
[49:05.360 --> 49:08.800]  You're really at a time, you're at a time from a financial standpoint that you need
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.800]  people to step up.
[49:10.800 --> 49:13.800]  There's so many good people out there, there's so many good men that are sitting on their
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.200]  hands in this time when we are past the bell.
[49:18.200 --> 49:22.280]  You know, you listen to the shows that, you know, yourself and Steve Quayle and Mike Adams
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.440]  give and the other people in the media that have been proven time after time to be correct
[49:27.440 --> 49:32.800]  and we're so late in the hour that it's like, how much louder can Alex Jones, do you need
[49:32.800 --> 49:36.960]  to stand up on your desk and tear off your shirt to get people's attention?
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.240]  You know, and again, I pray for you, I pray for this country and again, I am in the telecommunications
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.240]  game.
[49:42.240 --> 49:45.760]  I've been in that real estate part of the business for 15 or 20 years and I propose
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.080]  this question regarding the cyber hacks, you know, many times and more recently and because
[49:51.080 --> 49:56.120]  of how the telecommunications and the cloud computing, all this stuff is decentralized,
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.200]  you know, I wonder how maybe a Bill Binney could talk to, you know, the sophistication
[50:00.200 --> 50:02.800]  of how an actual cyber attack could happen.
[50:02.800 --> 50:08.080]  Obviously the Vault 7 stuff came out and revealed so much, but again, this is a sophisticated
[50:08.080 --> 50:12.440]  system that we have in place that is, you know, it's a worldwide system of communication.
[50:12.440 --> 50:17.640]  So again, of course they can target anything, they can put anything on anybody's back, but
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.440]  I know how easily that can be done in the whole scheme of things, you know, but I also
[50:22.440 --> 50:26.640]  know that they are going to do whatever they can to march us into this conflict with Russia
[50:26.640 --> 50:32.480]  because how else do you hide an economic collapse, a recession and obviously all of the stuff
[50:32.480 --> 50:33.480]  that's about to happen.
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.480]  Well, exactly.
[50:34.480 --> 50:37.340]  I would blame the Russians if they hadn't been restrained just trying to kick out the
[50:37.340 --> 50:42.880]  Azov Italians to protect those Russian ethnic majority groups.
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.240]  Russia does not want to escalate this.
[50:44.240 --> 50:47.320]  That's really been their policy and I don't like that Russia invaded.
[50:47.320 --> 50:48.320]  I think it was a big mistake.
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.880]  I think they walked into a trap, but if you look at the whole climate, the people running
[50:51.880 --> 50:55.160]  our country want escalation, brother, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[50:55.160 --> 50:56.160]  Great points.
[50:56.160 --> 50:57.160]  Let's go fast.
[50:57.160 --> 50:58.160]  Get everybody here.
[50:58.160 --> 50:59.160]  Who's up next?
[50:59.160 --> 51:03.760]  Let's talk to Mike and Michigan, a historian on Russia and the goal of the war.
[51:03.760 --> 51:04.760]  Give us your tag, Mike.
[51:04.760 --> 51:05.760]  Yes.
[51:05.760 --> 51:06.760]  Hello, Alex.
[51:06.760 --> 51:11.560]  I want people to know this plan has been in the making for about 150 years.
[51:11.560 --> 51:15.840]  If anyone knows anything about the Civil War, Russia actually saved the United States from
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.880]  British invasion in 1863 that wanted to partition both the United States and Russia.
[51:20.880 --> 51:25.320]  The entire globalist plan back then, same people, same old, same old, was to partition
[51:25.320 --> 51:29.560]  both countries in an attempt to put the British, the Anglo-British establishment in control
[51:29.560 --> 51:32.920]  of the world as usual, and this time we're seeing it all over again.
[51:32.920 --> 51:37.640]  Russia is the United States' biggest ally, historically always has been until 1903 in
[51:37.640 --> 51:41.840]  the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and if anything, this country should have been courting
[51:41.840 --> 51:44.760]  a new alliance with Russia in order to counter the Chinese.
[51:44.760 --> 51:49.280]  Well, I'm sure the globalist fear of U.S.-Russian alliance, that would take, that would be the
[51:49.280 --> 51:51.600]  dominant force in the world and be checkmate.
[51:51.600 --> 51:55.480]  We could dictate a whole new future of freedom, but that's not happening.
[51:55.480 --> 51:58.160]  I mean, I don't, well, I don't know if it's too late yet.
[51:58.160 --> 52:01.120]  Americans have to stand up and protest this, like, I'm not, like, still like the service
[52:01.120 --> 52:02.120]  civil disobedience.
[52:02.120 --> 52:05.560]  If we don't do this, this is going to be bad Christian, the last messages of Christian
[52:05.560 --> 52:09.160]  civilization are going to get blown up in a glorious fire, and all that's going to be
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.160]  left is atheist China.
[52:10.160 --> 52:12.680]  So I really want people to understand what's on the line here.
[52:12.680 --> 52:13.680]  No, I hear you, brother.
[52:13.680 --> 52:14.680]  God bless you, and thanks for calling.
[52:14.680 --> 52:15.680]  I'm going to move quickly to everybody.
[52:15.680 --> 52:19.600]  Let's go ahead and go to Joe, cyber security expert on Russia's cyber attack.
[52:19.600 --> 52:20.600]  Go ahead.
[52:20.600 --> 52:21.600]  Hey, Alex.
[52:21.600 --> 52:22.600]  How's it going today?
[52:22.600 --> 52:23.600]  Good, brother.
[52:23.600 --> 52:24.600]  Thanks for calling.
[52:24.600 --> 52:25.600]  Just want to say, God bless you and your family.
[52:25.600 --> 52:27.680]  So I just want to touch on a few things.
[52:27.680 --> 52:31.240]  It's interesting that they hit websites for these airports.
[52:31.240 --> 52:34.200]  That doesn't really make a lot of sense from a state actor's perspective.
[52:34.200 --> 52:37.320]  I mean, that's something that layman's people would do.
[52:37.320 --> 52:43.000]  You know, usually these SCADA and ICDS, which is industrial control systems, those things
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.680]  are fairly vulnerable.
[52:44.680 --> 52:50.320]  We don't realize how they don't really do their due diligence in patching these systems.
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.520]  They are wide open to attacks, and if Russia, a state actor, wanted to hit us, they would,
[52:56.520 --> 53:01.000]  and they would hit us hard, and they would hit us fast, and they would shut down multiple
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  things.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.040]  Like when Ronald Reagan blew up the Russian pipeline with software we gave him in the
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.520]  early 1980s.
[53:08.520 --> 53:12.600]  Well, and what happened to the Russian pipeline not too long ago?
[53:12.600 --> 53:18.720]  I mean, they went offline the same day that the new pipeline went online for Europe.
[53:18.720 --> 53:19.720]  That's right.
[53:19.720 --> 53:24.760]  Both Russian pipelines, one got blown up, one went offline when the new European pipeline
[53:24.760 --> 53:25.760]  went on.
[53:25.760 --> 53:28.880]  I mean, the globalists are just out of the open about this.
[53:28.880 --> 53:34.080]  Yeah, Russia's not going to do some Mickey Mouse bullcrap of taking down websites.
[53:34.080 --> 53:35.080]  They're just not going to do that.
[53:35.080 --> 53:36.080]  Sure, they're doing it.
[53:36.080 --> 53:37.080]  They're doing it.
[53:37.080 --> 53:39.680]  The globalists are, in my view, I agree, to introduce us to the idea that the Russians
[53:39.680 --> 53:43.480]  are attacking us, and, oh, look, they shut down airports so you couldn't fly because
[53:43.480 --> 53:45.840]  your credit card wouldn't work, and, you know, exactly.
[53:45.840 --> 53:47.520]  They didn't go after real infrastructure yet.
[53:47.520 --> 53:50.240]  They're just introducing the idea that the Russians are attacking.
[53:50.240 --> 53:51.240]  Right.
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.920]  When they go after the real infrastructure, I mean, state level actors typically have
[53:55.920 --> 53:57.440]  zero days just waiting.
[53:57.440 --> 54:01.640]  A zero day is an exploit that is ready to go that hasn't been discovered yet.
[54:01.640 --> 54:05.160]  You explain that to people that they've got an industrial software, sometimes even in
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.880]  the chips, but that's if you make the chips programmed in, though, where at a certain
[54:09.880 --> 54:12.200]  date it turns on, it was given the order.
[54:12.200 --> 54:13.200]  Right.
[54:13.200 --> 54:18.240]  I mean, they can do multiple different things along those levels, and if they wanted to
[54:18.240 --> 54:20.120]  melt down power plants, they could.
[54:20.120 --> 54:23.000]  If they wanted to melt down pipelines, they could.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.480]  I mean, they changed the pressures in those pipes, and they can cause those explosions.
[54:27.480 --> 54:34.840]  So everybody pointing to, you know, a bomb or a missile or a ship or seals or whatever
[54:34.840 --> 54:36.920]  blowing up those pipelines, it didn't have to be.
[54:36.920 --> 54:40.280]  All they needed to do was change the pressures and cause those explosions.
[54:40.280 --> 54:41.280]  That's right.
[54:41.280 --> 54:42.280]  Let's be clear.
[54:42.280 --> 54:49.640]  When they were taken near the end of the Cold War, they sold Russian software that was used
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.560]  to overpressure their major Arctic pipeline and destroy it, the biggest fire ever seen
[54:54.560 --> 54:55.560]  from space.
[54:55.560 --> 54:56.560]  Appreciate your call.
[54:56.560 --> 54:57.560]  Great points.
[54:57.560 --> 54:58.560]  All right.
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.640]  Up next, let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.520]  John in Texas, retired Army National Guard on Ukraine War and cyber threats.
[55:07.520 --> 55:08.520]  Go ahead.
[55:08.520 --> 55:09.520]  Thank you for calling.
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.520]  Yeah.
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.600]  When I got back from fighting in Vietnam, I was in the infantry, I joined the National
[55:14.600 --> 55:20.440]  Guard for five years, and every summer camp, I had to go through nuclear warfare training
[55:20.440 --> 55:22.880]  five years of that.
[55:22.880 --> 55:28.520]  Now, I'm surprised all the people is not even making any preparations for any of this.
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.320]  Even my own relatives, I tried to talk to them and they just told ignore you, you know,
[55:33.320 --> 55:34.320]  and even now.
[55:34.320 --> 55:35.680]  They have a normal sea bias.
[55:35.680 --> 55:39.600]  They don't realize that mainline analysts say we're the most danger ever.
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.760]  It's worse than any time of the Cold War.
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.360]  Even my family thinks it's not all of them, but a lot of them, they just don't get it.
[55:46.360 --> 55:52.880]  I mean, you can go to Wal-Mart or some place where you buy a rain suit and dust mask and
[55:52.880 --> 55:59.040]  the dust goggles and swim goggles, something to protect you from the radioactive fallout
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.280]  because that fallout, if you breathe it into you, that's what kills you.
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.240]  If you just got it on the outside, it would rain suit and you could brush it off or wash
[56:06.240 --> 56:07.240]  it off.
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.400]  You don't have to get inside you, you know, that's it, game over, you know, and I just
[56:11.400 --> 56:13.800]  can't understand why, not even protests.
[56:13.800 --> 56:18.600]  We're all anti-war protestors, you know, it's just like everybody's in war.
[56:18.600 --> 56:22.800]  Oh, no, no, no, Sean Penn, everybody says, let's have, did you see Sean Penn say we should
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.080]  hit Russia first, that it's liberal than new people?
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.080]  So liberal.
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.080]  These people are degenerates.
[56:30.080 --> 56:35.400]  And I'm just surprised at all this, when it's finally here and everybody just don't
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.320]  care, you know, well, that's how it works.
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.600]  See, it finally hits you when you're not looking, brother, that's how the universe works.
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.160]  But when you, but this goes way back, like Alex, when you look at the Jules Verne when
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.680]  he wrote the time machine, basically, what's going on right now, I mean, the character
[56:53.680 --> 56:57.360]  what got his time machine, he went through two world wars in Germany and when he came
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.200]  on in the third world war with nuclear and he had to jump in there to get through the
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.800]  war and the same with the Albert Pike and the letter from Marzini, where they all explained
[57:06.800 --> 57:07.800]  everything.
[57:07.800 --> 57:08.800]  It's just a plan.
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.720]  That's, you know, 100% from your mouth to God's ears for folks that don't know about
[57:13.720 --> 57:17.680]  that will do a special show on the Illuminati and their plan for nuclear war.
[57:17.680 --> 57:23.320]  They knew about atomic bombs 125 years ago and wrote about it.
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.400]  You know, a lot of HUL's books were not fiction, they were nonfiction.
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.320]  He was the head of the Illuminati.
[57:30.320 --> 57:31.320]  Great points, John.
[57:31.320 --> 57:35.280]  We're gonna come right back with Tom, Greg, Derek, Steve and others.
[57:35.280 --> 57:36.280]  Stay with us.
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.280]  infowars.com.
[57:37.280 --> 57:38.640]  Tomorrow's news today.
[57:38.640 --> 57:41.480]  We are in the greatest danger of nuclear war ever.
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.760]  I feel guilty still sitting here in a target zone, Austin.
[57:44.760 --> 57:50.080]  I mean, but I'm still gonna stay here, folks.
[57:50.080 --> 57:51.960]  Look around you.
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.720]  Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now
[57:55.720 --> 57:56.720]  happening.
[57:56.720 --> 58:01.280]  The info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[58:01.280 --> 58:07.320]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.200]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[58:13.200 --> 58:14.200]  in the fight together.
[58:14.200 --> 58:19.960]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[58:19.960 --> 58:23.880]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[58:23.880 --> 58:29.360]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[58:29.360 --> 58:30.600]  It's unsustainable.

[58:43.880 --> 58:46.120]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.

[59:49.280 --> 1:00:10.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance of escalating violence
[1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:15.560]  in quote terrorists continue to hit Russian targets, both in Russia and outside of Russia.
[1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:18.600]  This thing is just escalating completely out of control right now.
[1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:20.640]  We're taking your phone calls.
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:25.760]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Derek in North Carolina than Tom and others.
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:26.760]  Derek, thanks for calling.
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:29.200]  Hey Alex, how are you doing, man?
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:30.400]  It's a pleasure talking to you.
[1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.120]  Pleasure to talk to you while we still can.
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:34.600]  I just have a really bad feeling.
[1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:35.600]  I do too.
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:38.480]  So I have to agree with one of your early callers.
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:43.520]  I don't think this is Russia and I think this is one is just not sophisticated enough.
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:49.240]  We're not going to go after public facing targets, but I do agree with you that I think
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:53.320]  that they could be doing this just to put the talking points out there, to put the fillers
[1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:58.520]  out there, to see what the public pause would be because people are just kind of losing
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:04.400]  support for Ukraine, Russia, whole garbage that's going on over there, but the escalation
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.320]  just keeps going with the bridge.
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.760]  Now with Russia responding to that, so now we have to get ourselves injected.
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:17.720]  The U.S. does or whoever possibly could be involved in driving this, in driving the narrative
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.160]  that Russia is going to attack the U.S.
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:20.160]  And again, that's key.
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.520]  Zelensky admits he's trying to do provocations to get the U.S. fully in.
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:25.520]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.520]  And there's no need for us to be escalating this any further.
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:31.560]  Russia's getting its ass kicked.
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:32.560]  Exactly.
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:33.560]  Russia's getting its ass kicked.
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:34.560]  That's right.
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:39.240]  The question, well Russia's not, Russia's responding now and the question should be,
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:44.600]  why is Biden not asking or offering to talk to Putin the way that Trump did?
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:47.120]  Trump offered to, and it was good for them to talk.
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.160]  Well, hell Zelensky passed a law saying no peace deals.
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:55.040]  Well, yeah, so he didn't want to be involved in it, or actually Turkey was trying to broker
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:58.760]  that deal to kind of get some peace talks going, and they shut it down.
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:03.320]  So we see the writing on the wall that they want this escalation.
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:08.240]  You've been calling for it, or you've been calling or saying that people are calling
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:12.800]  for it, trying to get us aware of it so that we could possibly stop it, bring up enough
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:14.200]  awareness.
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:20.200]  I think the public's smart enough, I think we know that this is all BS, but what can
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:21.200]  we do?
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:25.200]  Well, the public better know that when the Pope, who's a globalist, and Henry Kissinger,
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:30.400]  who's one of the most important globalists are saying it needs to stop, it needs to stop.
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:31.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:36.840]  Well, then you've got, now you have, you have King Charles and you have the World Economic
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:38.000]  Forum pushing this.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:43.880]  They want to see this destabilization on a global front.
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:47.280]  But what we can do personally, I think that's what it comes down to.
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.280]  What can we do?
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:49.840]  Can we go out there and call somebody?
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:55.000]  We can call our local politicians, but unfortunately, they are not listening.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.360]  The only thing we can do is work on personal excellence, being an example, being an inspiration
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:02.880]  to others, and being a true man.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:08.080]  And what that means is being responsible, and we need to be responsible in our circle,
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:10.640]  our communities, like, hey, enough is enough.
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:11.640]  I agree.
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:13.440]  We need peaceful demonstrations.
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:15.160]  At the same time, we should call to ceaseband.
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:16.160]  We should call Congress.
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:19.320]  A lot of them don't listen, but a big enough buzz they will listen to.
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:22.320]  Look at PayPal, had to back off their new social credit score.
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:26.480]  If they disagree with your politics, they were going to find you $2,500 per infraction.
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.400]  But I agree, being good leaders is the most important thing and getting right with God.
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:31.400]  Thank you so much for the call.
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.320]  I'm going to give this next caller only a minute and a half, so I've got to get to everybody.
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:38.320]  Tom in New Jersey on World War III, Russian threats, currency, economic doom.
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:39.320]  Go ahead.
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:40.320]  Thank you.
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:41.320]  Hey, how's it going?
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:45.920]  So basically, I think the whole kinetic aspect of this is a lot of smoking beers.
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:49.760]  I think a lot of what's happening right now is that the race against the clock as the
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:55.520]  dollar gets more and more valuable against every other currency except for the rule.
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:56.520]  Oil's traded in the dollar.
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:04:01.200]  As the country's become less and less able to purchase oil, it's going to start making
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:04.200]  it more and more attractive for those countries to move to another currency.
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:08.840]  You've got OPEC plus cutting 2 million barrels a day, and Russia would really lose in the
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:09.840]  way everybody thinks it works.
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:10.840]  Hold on.
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:11.840]  Hold on.
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:12.840]  What you're saying is the key to everything.
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  Don't hang up.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:14.840]  I'm going to hold you over.
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  What Tom is saying is everything.
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:18.240]  They admit they're doing this for a great reset.
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:19.480]  They're bringing down the old system.
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:25.040]  They're creating major depression and inflation and crises with the currency crises, with
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:27.360]  only the ruble in the dollar going up.
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:29.640]  Everybody else is going to want to move to a new global system.
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:33.160]  Everybody says he's absolutely dead on Tom.
[1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:34.160]  Stay there.
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:36.160]  We'll get to everybody else.
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.840]  The order of the calls received, Greg, and then Steve, and everybody else.
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:46.600]  And then we've got some special guests joining us as well on some really big topics that
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  are important.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:48.600]  Wow.
[1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:49.600]  What a time to be alive.
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:50.600]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:51.600]  Infowars.com.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:53.400]  Share that URL.
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:55.360]  That is the key part of the resistance.
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:58.960]  Infowars.com.
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:00.840]  Look around you.
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:04.720]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents, from their own admissions, is now
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:05.720]  happening.
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.220]  Infowars' credibility.
[1:05:07.220 --> 1:05:09.400]  My credibility has never been higher.
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:13.640]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:18.760]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:23.640]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:28.800]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:32.720]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:38.240]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:39.240]  It's unsustainable.

[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:18.920]  We have a special guest joining us coming up at the start of the next segment, and I'm
[1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:20.480]  jamming in your calls right now.
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:24.640]  On the top story, we'll be covering throughout the broadcast into the war room today.
[1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:27.360]  I wasn't going to do a special 12-hour broadcast on Wednesday.
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:30.000]  I may even just do it tomorrow and right through Wednesday.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  This is so important.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.120]  Big story up on infowars.com.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.120]  Russia launches large-scale strikes on some 20 Ukrainian cities in response to terrorist
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:42.800]  Crimea, a bridge blast, a series of major explosions, a rock Kiev, and several locations
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:43.800]  across Ukraine.
[1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:47.840]  Today, following Russian President Vladimir Putin's blaming Ukrainian special services
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:52.200]  for the terrorist blast, well, they've taken credit, which partially disabled the Crimean
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:55.760]  bridge that links Russia with the peninsula.
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:01.640]  And Putin went on to say that they can expect massive escalations in the attacks and warn
[1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:06.600]  Ukraine that any other attempts for terror attacks will be met with destruction of Ukrainian
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:07.600]  cities.
[1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:11.280]  If attempts to carry out terror attacks continue, Russian response will be severe at the level
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:12.960]  of threats facing it.
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:15.200]  Nobody should be in any doubt Putin warned.
[1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:19.680]  He threatened the more might follow if attempts to commit terrorist acts on our territory
[1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:20.680]  continue.
[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:23.600]  So, this thing is escalating out of control very quickly.
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:27.640]  Tom got cut off by the break-in line to start over, but some stations just joined us and
[1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:32.880]  explained this is really all about the great reset, the new global digital programmable
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  tow concurrency.
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:35.880]  Break it down for us.
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:36.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:40.280]  So, I think the great reset's happening regardless.
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:43.680]  It's just going to be who's controlling it, Klaus Schwab or Bricks.
[1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:48.120]  As the dollar gets stronger and people, other countries look to move off of it because they
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:53.760]  can't transfer their currency to the dollar and buy oil, you're going to have a new currency
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:55.160]  system emerge.
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:59.120]  And 10 years ago, Saudi Arabia would never have done what they just did to the United
[1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:00.120]  States.
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:03.440]  And now you got OPEC Plus and Saudi Arabia.
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:06.000]  Most of these countries are members of Bricks.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.400]  The Saudis are applying to be a member of Bricks.
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:10.040]  Everybody's getting on side right now.
[1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:13.920]  But Russia was losing the way it was, there's no way on earth.
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:15.600]  I totally agree.
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:20.320]  Russia's winning economically and creating a new, new world order, which they said the
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:24.720]  globalists are losing, but Russia's losing militarily with a major sacrifice.
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:26.720]  But economically, politically, they're winning.
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:27.720]  Yes, I agree.
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:33.520]  And I think at the end of this, it's going to be subjugation to be a CBDC and the World
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.080]  Economic Forum or the collapse of the United States dollar as the World Reserve currency
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:40.280]  and Russia and China making the rules.
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:42.480]  And I don't see a good way out of this.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:44.240]  I think these elections are really important.
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.080]  And I think that's why the cyber attack happened.
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:47.760]  I think it was domestic.
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:48.760]  It's meant to so fear.
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:54.520]  It's a reason to put us into another emergency to stop these elections or do the same old
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:57.520]  mail-in ballot full trap they did last time.
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:08:58.880]  What do you make of the cyber attack?
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:02.360]  Obviously, it wasn't really a real cyber attack.
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:03.880]  Perfect deep state operation in my view.
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:07.880]  No real infrastructure hit, but now they can start the process of setting Russia up
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:09.720]  for the major cyber attack.
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.320]  The deep state will launch that can bring down major power grids.
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:18.240]  I agree with you that it's just another, it's another crumb on the trail with the cyber
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:20.680]  attack and the PSA for the nuclear attack.
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:24.760]  And New York, not that long ago, it's all meant to set a narrative.
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:29.240]  So come November, they can declare some sort of emergency and stop the elections.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:30.240]  That's right.
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  God bless you.
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:32.240]  Absolutely.
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:35.480]  And all the pre-programming that Russia's going to launch a cyber attack, all the propaganda.
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:36.480]  Now it happens.
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:40.920]  Russia's saying more is coming and that's the perfect pretext for limited power outages,
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.920]  things of that nature to say it's a Russian cyber attack to declare an emergency or to
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:50.480]  have such hysteria going on during the election with mail-in ballots that, oh, you know, the
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:56.240]  Republicans are pro-Russia and Trump's a Russian agent, all that pre-programming to then basically
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.920]  try to outlaw the Republican Party.
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:00.440]  The deep state knows they're losing political control.
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:03.920]  They know we're peacefully winning, so they're going to want to overturn the chessboard and
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:05.000]  declare victory.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.720]  We're in the most dangerous position this country has ever been in since its founding
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:10.680]  in July 4, 1776.
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:12.720]  Bet your bottom dollar on that.
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:13.720]  Anybody can see it.
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:16.760]  Greg in Iowa, Cold War veteran army on Russia.
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:17.760]  Go ahead.
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:18.760]  You're on the air.
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:19.760]  How you doing today, Alex?
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:22.600]  It's awesome to listen to you as always.
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:23.600]  Big supporter.
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  Love the great reset.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:25.600]  Love the vitamins.
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:26.600]  Bodies.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:27.600]  Love it.
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:32.400]  As a disabled vet, it's helped me get mobile again, get off the pharmaceutical chuck that
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:33.600]  they push.
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  Love it.
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:35.600]  We love it.
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:36.600]  Thank you.
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:42.080]  On the gun range today, I teach survival and other things of that nature, work with ex-military
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:47.800]  intel guys doing farm security work around the country.
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:54.840]  About a year ago, when this started about a year ago, they sold their houses, their cars.
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:59.200]  They're still downsizing and moving to different locations.
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:01.200]  Freak me out.
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:02.200]  Why?
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:03.200]  All of this.
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:04.840]  Don't tell me why.
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:09.720]  Just say, get your money out of the bank like you have and get stuff.
[1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:12.600]  Get stuff that you and your wife need.
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:19.160]  I'm free because I spent almost 20 years teaching Cold War tactics, Russia tactics, you name
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:22.920]  it, for the army and the Marine Corps.
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:28.840]  I've had a recently just teach my wife how to react to a NBC attack and I'm pissed.
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:36.280]  Even my language as a Christian, I'm pissed because I had to teach a good Christian woman
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:41.400]  how to freak and react to this stuff, how to put a gas mask on, how to put an NBC type
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:44.400]  suit on, how to decontaminate.
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:45.400]  And I'm furious.
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:47.920]  Where are the Christian men in this country?
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:50.320]  We keep saying they're losing, but they're winning.
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:52.200]  Their economy's booming.
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:55.000]  They control the air, the sea.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.440]  They control what goes in and out of Ukraine.
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.880]  Their economy's awesome.
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:03.800]  Our fuel is $8 a gallon for diesel some areas.
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:04.920]  We don't have food.
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:07.280]  We don't have electricity to meet our needs.
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.720]  We don't have the water to meet our needs.
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:11.560]  How are they winning?
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:18.120]  I've taught it and every time they draw you in, they close the door on you.
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:20.880]  That's what we taught each other.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:22.800]  We used high helicopters.
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:24.440]  We used their tanks.
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:27.080]  We used their BMPs back in the late 80s and 90s.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:33.320]  We had that equipment to teach with and all their tactics.
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:39.880]  And I just want to know, when are we going to stand up and say, we're not with this
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:42.360]  our Nazi government?
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.800]  When are we going to do that in mass?
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:50.160]  Because until we get off of our Netflix and our play stations and get out there and say
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:55.640]  something, yes, we're going to be targeted by the Gestapo FBI, the Stasi, yes, we're
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:57.120]  going to be targeted.
[1:12:57.120 --> 1:13:02.040]  But until that happens, they're going to just run rough shot over us.
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:04.720]  Greg, I hear your points, great points, and God bless you.
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.640]  Think about how cynical the globalists are, that the feds ran ads in New York, they're
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:13.240]  still running them, saying, here's what you do when the nuclear bombs hit or when the
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:15.200]  nuclear missiles hit.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:18.480]  You just tune into your local radio station online or the government app.
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:20.880]  None of that will be on, folks.
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:26.720]  If you're in Manhattan, you'll be dead or you'll be under rubble crawling out into
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:27.720]  radiation.
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:30.720]  I mean, that's what they're telling people to get ready for.
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:34.600]  All right, look, we got loaded phone lines here, and I want to go to Stephen, I want
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:35.600]  to go to everybody.
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  We've got a special guest coming on.
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:37.600]  I'll continue with calls after that.
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:39.400]  Stephen in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:40.400]  Welcome.
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:42.440]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:44.880]  Hey, quit product plug last week.
[1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:51.920]  I got a package in the mail from you folks, which was SuperMailVitality, Ultra12, Brain
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:59.160]  Force Plus, my Brain Force Ultra, and I've also had the Basil Beat.
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:03.600]  The only thing I was lacking was the TurboForce because you guys ran out, but over the week
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:09.080]  and I got to run a four race series called the Aiken Quad Challenge in Lakeland, Florida,
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:13.520]  and I want to praise God and thank God for these products because they definitely enabled
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:19.320]  me to get first place for men aged 60 to 64 in all four races.
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:21.680]  So you definitely felt the difference in the products.
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:22.680]  They're all top flight.
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:24.160]  Thank you so much for the support.
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.160]  Yes, sir.
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:28.880]  Now, what I wanted to say, first of all, if you want to see realistically what we're
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:32.800]  facing with global thermal nuclear war, don't watch war games.
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:34.720]  That's a simulation.
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.640]  Watch the 1983 movie.
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:42.720]  It's still on YouTube called The Day After starring Jason Robards and put out by ABC
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:48.960]  of all things, very realistic to show what we're facing if we get hit with nukes.
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:54.240]  That being said, I want to say this, Mike Adams has interviewed several times, including
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.640]  on InfoWars when he's hosted JR Nyquist, who's brought out about how Russia and China have
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:07.840]  been doing joint military war games, exercises over the last five to six years.
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:14.720]  He's also joined in on this, and just recently there were Russian and Chinese warships spotted
[1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:17.000]  off of our Alaskan coast.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:22.560]  If you remember earlier this year, I think it was late last year, there was Russian warships
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:26.560]  spotted about 35 miles from Hawaii.
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:31.200]  So what I want to say is this, I don't believe Putin walked into a trap.
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:38.320]  He baited us between what Biden did, leaving all that hardware in Afghanistan and now putting
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:45.200]  everything into Ukraine, we've left ourselves wide open after the implosion that we're
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:49.640]  going to have here in the United States because of what the globalists have done here for
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:51.600]  invasion by the Russians.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:53.200]  All right, Steve, interesting points.
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:54.200]  Thank you so much.
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:55.200]  God bless.
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:58.560]  Our special guest, Nick Raketa, straight ahead.
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:03.400]  Think about a world without Info Wars.
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:07.680]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:13.000]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is Info Wars.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:18.120]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:25.600]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.120]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.880]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:39.360]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:41.120]  I don't take the credit.
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:42.960]  I give you the credit.
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:45.320]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:47.320]  It isn't going to give up.
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.080]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:52.520]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:58.360]  And donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:04.360]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support, Info Wars continues
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:09.280]  to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:10.280]  media.
[1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:11.280]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:13.640]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:18.040]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept Info Wars and free speech on the
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:19.040]  air.
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:20.040]  And I thank you.
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:24.080]  I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and I need
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:25.080]  your support.

[1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:16.360]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Monday, October 10th broadcast.
[1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:19.160]  I'll continue your calls to start the next hour.
[1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:21.960]  Those that are holding, who you're gracious enough to hold, love to talk to you about
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:27.040]  the out of control escalation into thermonuclear war that even mainline analysts say we're
[1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:29.240]  on the very edge of.
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:31.800]  I want to get Nick Raketa on because I've seen some of his reports.
[1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:34.280]  He's very popular online commentator.
[1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:37.640]  He's also a lawyer and I know that Robert Barnes thinks very, very highly of him and
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:39.280]  I think highly of Robert Barnes.
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:47.040]  Nick Raketa is our guest and he's RaketaLaw.locals.com, RaketaLaw and Rumble and YouTube and he's
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:50.040]  here with us to discuss the waterfront.
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:55.400]  You've got PayPal and its social credit score they pushed last week, $2,500 fines, but actually
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:59.120]  Robert Barnes broke that last week, I didn't even know that, but I saw that later in the
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:00.120]  news.
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:02.720]  They've now backed off of that.
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:06.520]  He was, Raketa's been banned for calling out transgender activists who claim to provide
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:11.120]  hormone replacement therapy drugs to minors without their parents knowledge or consent.
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.560]  Phase 45 ethics complaints to the lawyer ethics board of Minnesota.
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:18.620]  He's talking about free speech, big tech, tyranny of the courts, COVID and the test
[1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:21.320]  run for government to control the populace through fear.
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:24.000]  But also just up front, it's not about my case.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:29.560]  It's about the Democrats, the deep state admitting, defaulting me when we gave them all the discovery,
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:34.600]  then not letting me defend myself in these show trials, is the model they're admitting
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:37.840]  on MSNBC and CNN they're going to use because everybody else.
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:44.080]  So the cherry on top of tyranny with the surveillance and the open borders and all of it and the
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:49.280]  forced injections and the intimidation to lockdowns is now completely weaponized judiciary
[1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:52.760]  and he's been a defender of info wars, even though he doesn't agree with all of our topics
[1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:55.640]  and points, and he's been censored and attacked for that.
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:58.400]  So that's a feather in his cap.
[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.920]  So Nick Raketa, thank you so much for joining us.
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.840]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:04.280]  Nice to be here, man.
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:06.280]  It's nice to have you here.
[1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:07.360]  We're on a bunch of radio stations.
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:11.280]  We have like 14 minutes break an hour, I apologize, but what's going to give you the floor?
[1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:15.120]  You're a smart guy to roll with any of the topics first you want to hit.
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:20.920]  Well, Alex, I mean, first, I hate what they've been doing to you in court.
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:25.800]  Like I just want to say that straight out the gate, I think that you have an extremely
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:31.160]  important case, which was an interesting exchange you had with the plaintiff's attorney in your
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.080]  Connecticut case.
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:34.200]  Is this case important?
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:35.440]  Of course it is.
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:39.720]  The problem is the important part of the case is the part that we missed.
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:44.760]  We just went ahead and defaulted you and skipped over the question of was there any defamatory
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:45.840]  statements.
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:50.840]  So much so that there's nothing in the record about what you actually said that we can link
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:56.280]  to any sort of tangible damages, and that I think is just an affront to the First Amendment.
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:02.480]  I think it's an affront to your due process, and I think that that's just absolute garbage.
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:04.920]  So I'd kind of like to start there if you're going to talk about it.
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:05.920]  Please do.
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:08.280]  You're a well-known successful lawyer, and people want to get your take on this.
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:14.520]  I mean, even Barnes a few months ago looked at her, I'm not a lawyer, but the pretrial
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:18.520]  stuff we were allowed to say, and people didn't believe Barnes when he said that I can't
[1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:19.520]  say these 12 things.
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:23.760]  And then she said on the stand three times, can't say I'm innocent, can't say I'm bankrupt,
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:25.400]  can't say I never said their names.
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:26.400]  I still did that.
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:29.080]  So she said, I'm going to arrest you the next time you did.
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:30.760]  So I did the show back up.
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:31.760]  Right.
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:38.640]  And it was crazy that the whole idea that you're supposed to defend yourself without
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:43.360]  being able to speak about any of the aspects of what's going on with you with this case
[1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.040]  is ludicrous.
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:52.800]  And I was watching your examination, and I was really looking forward to the cross-examination,
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:59.920]  but once the judge said, frankly, straight to your attorney, look, you got mad about
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:02.640]  how I treated the plaintiff's attorney.
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:07.400]  So next time when you're up, I'm going to do it whole differently and have zero tolerance.
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:11.840]  So she basically said, yeah, when you get up on the stand, you and your attorney are
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:15.760]  likely to be held in contempt of court, but the other guy gets to do it scot-free.
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:17.200]  It was a complete imbalance.
[1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:18.800]  There's no impartiality.
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:23.640]  And I said from the get-go, the moment your case got removed from federal court to Connecticut
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:29.120]  under extremely bogus circumstances, might I add, once that happened, I said, there's
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:31.200]  no way Alex gets a fair trial in Connecticut.
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:32.200]  It's not possible.
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:33.920]  It's not going to happen.
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:37.480]  I didn't think you'd get that fair of a trial in federal court, but at least you'd have
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:40.960]  a little bit of diversity between you and the other parties.
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:43.880]  Well, exactly, Lister's got mad that I declared bankruptcy.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:45.040]  I'm out of money.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:48.880]  And from what I've seen, at least the federal court won't be completely out of control,
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:51.800]  hopefully, because everything they're saying is a lie.
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:52.800]  Right.
[1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:56.720]  And the reality of bankruptcy is when you're out of money, you're out of money.
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:59.640]  It doesn't matter what else is going on.
[1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:00.640]  But yeah.
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:05.000]  What do you make of them asking for 8.25 billion?
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  That's official.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:07.120]  Even law.com confirms it.
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  That's what they want.
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:13.440]  8.25 million per plaintiff, 15 plaintiffs.
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:14.520]  Absolutely absurd.
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:19.840]  You know, one of the things that came out, I think you said during the trial, was people
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:26.240]  are blaming you for the kids being shot more than they're blaming the actual shooter, which
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:27.680]  seems to be 100% true.
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:33.320]  You've become the scarecrow, the scapegoat, the punching bag for these parents.
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:38.600]  And frankly, that's not a healthy way to deal with things, to be mad at someone who gave
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:43.800]  an opinion you don't like, as if they're the cause of your child's unfortunate death.
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.040]  And that was the three plus weeks of testimony.
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:49.240]  It was all about their kids being shot, but then they talk about me.
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:51.400]  They would never even say Lanz's name.
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:55.400]  They talk about their kid not coming over to school, then talk about me for an hour.
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:58.320]  Right, as if you would have had anything to do with it.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:01.640]  And 550 million is obviously a ridiculous number.
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:09.000]  I mean, frankly, I thought the Texas judgment was a ridiculous number as well.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:14.440]  The big problem I have with this is, I didn't see them tangibly link what their damages
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.520]  actually would be, even assuming there was some sort of guilt there.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:19.960]  I didn't see some-
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:21.840]  Explain that in layman's terms.
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:25.800]  No proof I said anybody to harass people didn't.
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:29.240]  One person I said the name, one plaintiff I said his name, and said, yeah, that video
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:30.240]  looks suspicious.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:33.320]  I mean, I literally hardly ever covered it.
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:34.320]  Right.
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:38.640]  And it's like you got punished for the opinions of other people is what happened.
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:42.760]  And then, of course, projections upon you about what you might think.
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:48.760]  But what I was talking about is there's no link to what has happened to these people.
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:52.840]  And I'm frankly unclear on what exactly has happened to them in the first place, but there's
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:58.400]  no link to how what you have said has caused directly that thing.
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:02.200]  It seems like you're consistently being held liable for the actions of others, which as
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:08.520]  an online commentator with a decent size audience, that's extremely concerning.
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:13.560]  Because if I say something, I express an opinion about a case or about a subject and then someone
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:18.760]  else takes that and runs with it and does something that I never asked anybody to do,
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  that's not my fault.
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:20.880]  There's nothing I can do about that.
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.840]  And I think everybody who talks about this needs to be really examining where they fall
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:26.840]  down on this.
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:28.840]  I agree.
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:29.840]  What about the FBI agent?
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  I never knew his name till he sued me.
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:31.840]  Never talked about him.
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:32.840]  We never talked about him.
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:33.840]  Didn't even know who he was.
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:34.840]  He wants $550 million.
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:36.840]  I don't even know who the guy is.
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:37.840]  Right.
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:41.680]  I can't figure out what damages that guy suffered.
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:44.720]  First of all, the biggest damages, I saw that guy's picture.
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:47.640]  I mean, I think that was more damaging to him than anything else.
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:50.760]  It was a sad estate for an FBI agent.
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  Yeah.
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:53.760]  He looks like a little kid dressed up for army.
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  He really does.
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:56.800]  It was kind of embarrassing.
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:57.800]  If you ask me.
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:04.000]  But no, the whole thing is just, it's a huge blow to free speech and it's a pulse check
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.300]  on our country.
[1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:08.480]  We have this constitution that says, no, we get to speak freely.
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:12.520]  We get to voice opinions, even if other people don't like them, those opinions can be popular
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:13.520]  or unpopular.
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:14.520]  They can be dangerous.
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:15.520]  They can be safe.
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:16.920]  And we have to protect all of them.
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:19.760]  And we also get to put on a defense, which I was barred.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:22.440]  Even the local news said, Jones is barred from defending himself.
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:23.760]  That was in the newspaper.
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  Right.
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:29.400]  Which is, again, that whole fifth amendment due process comes in.
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:30.400]  Where was it?
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:34.560]  Where do we, where do we get our rights if they're, they're recognized by the constitution,
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:37.040]  but they're just snuffed out by, by a judge with an agenda.
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  All right.
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:41.120]  Well-known lawyer, Nick Raketa, giving us an analysis of the waterfront, key information
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  straight ahead.
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:46.280]  Nick, what's the best website for folks to visit to find all your great material?
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:51.960]  RaketaLaw.locals.com is the centralized hub, but you can find a ton of it on YouTube.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:54.800]  I've been doing this for five years, talking about anything.
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:55.800]  All right.
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:58.400]  Stay right there.
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:03.040]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the global stone documents, from their own
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:06.680]  admissions is now happening, info wars credibility.
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:08.320]  My credibility has never been higher.
[1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:13.080]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.200]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:23.040]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:28.240]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:32.080]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:37.680]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:38.680]  It's unsustainable.
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:47.080]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five,
[1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:51.240]  ten, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:52.240]  I'll never give up.
[1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:54.440]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:55.760]  Thank you for your support.
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:58.360]  Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:03.160]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:07.480]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:09.680]  and stories we've broken together.
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:12.760]  This family that is info wars.
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:17.880]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:25.360]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:28.880]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:34.640]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:39.120]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:40.880]  I don't take the credit.
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:45.120]  I give you the credit, and now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:47.120]  It isn't going to give up.
[1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:48.880]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:57.880]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.

[1:32:57.320 --> 1:32:59.120]  products.
[1:32:59.120 --> 1:33:12.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:12.600 --> 1:33:31.160]  Let me put bookends when we were just talking about it, we're going to shift here to other
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:32.840]  big serious topics.
[1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:37.240]  If I saw another talk show host being real-rodded not allowed to defend themselves, I would
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:40.880]  be just as upset as I am about what's happening to me.
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:44.880]  But one thing that's hurt us, that I didn't think of, is listeners see this big judgment
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:49.680]  in Texas for $50 million, it's really $5 million capped, and they see these other $8
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:50.680]  million things.
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:55.120]  People say, sorry you're going out of business, sorry you're going to close, no, no, no, we're
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:58.640]  going to appeal it for years, if there's any country left, it's going to be overturned.
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:03.120]  A lot of mainline judges have said that, I mean this is crazy what they've done, so
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:05.640]  we're targeted but we're going to win in the end.
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:09.040]  We just need support and funding now to keep us on air.
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:10.040]  We're not going away.
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  So make us go away, it's not these lawsuits, it will be you not supporting at infowarstor.com.

[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.240]  body, 50% off the spider run on iodine that's happening right now for all the nuclear war
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:23.240]  reasons.

[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:32.160]  your immune system, X3, infowarstor.com, back in stock, 50% off.
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:36.520]  So Nick Raketa, you wanted to get into the banks and the money and the social credit
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:43.000]  score and the whole PayPal fiasco, what would make them officially put in their terms of
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.160]  services last week, that if we don't like your political views, we're going to take
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:49.600]  $2,500 out per pop.
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.800]  That really gives us a window into what the big banking establish was planning.
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:59.160]  Yeah, I mean this has been coming down the pike for years now.
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:05.280]  We saw it first, or I saw it first I guess with the de-platforming of people from Patreon
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:09.760]  that was a little bit confusing, and the first one I saw was Jihad Watch.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:15.120]  And some information came out about that where we found out it was actually the payment processors
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:18.720]  that demanded that Patreon shut them down.
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:23.520]  And basically the exchange is, well, we don't want you to do business with these people,
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.920]  so if you do business with these people, we won't do business with you.
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:30.400]  And the banks became absolutely untouchable.
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:35.280]  They got to this place where they could control who the next person down the chain's customers
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:38.000]  were by just threatening to cut off their banking.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.640]  And now we see PayPal, which was kind of an alternative independent processor that rises
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:46.440]  up, threatening by an effective social credit score.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:51.200]  If you say hate speech or misinformation, whatever the hell those even are, if you
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:53.920]  say that, we're going to just take money from you.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  We'll extract it.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:59.680]  And since PayPal operates as a pseudo bank, they just have access to take your money right
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:00.680]  away.
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:04.680]  No court, no consent, and good luck fighting in court to get that back.
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:06.840]  They just say, well, we have a term of service.
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:07.840]  You agreed to this.
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.200]  Like, when did I agree for you to take my money?
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:16.680]  But banks really are the ultimate, they're the ultimate linchpin in our society.
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:25.280]  We run on such a financially driven economy that if you can cut off someone's access to
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:27.440]  banking, you can cut off their access to anything.
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:29.320]  It doesn't matter what your platform is.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:32.920]  It doesn't matter what your bank account is or how much money you have, you can't exchange
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:33.920]  it.
[1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:35.080]  You can't send it to someone else.
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:40.400]  And to me, it's just crazy that we're allowing this to get as far as it is.
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:42.720]  And Nick, there's another aspect too.
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:45.080]  They're not saying we're going to find you for what you do on the platform.
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:46.080]  We're going to watch you.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.280]  So they're saying, we've got a spy agency.
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:50.720]  We're going to watch you with these other groups.
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:53.600]  And if you don't do what we want, we're going to find you.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:56.640]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:00.000]  I mean, if the federal government acted like this, that would finally bring them down,
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  but instead it's the corporations doing it.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Right.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.480]  And the scary thing is, I mean, we know they have their own surveillance.
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:12.080]  They have algorithms to watch just about anything because they have unlimited amounts of money.
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:17.280]  But the other thing that they've got is an army of complicit idiots out there willing
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:22.120]  to go out and flag and report every single piece of wrong thing that they come across.
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:29.000]  And it becomes a tool to weaponize the economic system of the United States against your enemy.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.880]  And so many people are just willing to give into it because they think they're on the
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:39.920]  correct side of whatever, and they don't realize the implications that once their opinion becomes
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:43.160]  unpopular in any way, it goes right back against them.
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:47.040]  Well, let's remember 1984, George R. Will, real name Eric Blair, but the highest level
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:52.040]  of pavement socialist fought against the fascists with the communists in Spain, he wrote 1984
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:56.600]  because he saw the communists for what they were, and in the book, the neighbor that tattles
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:01.920]  on him the day after he's put in the torture camp, the neighbor is there now too.
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.600]  So the neighbor thought he was getting ahead by tattling, no, that's not how this works.
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:10.160]  You're destroying your own social safety net.
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.440]  Exactly.
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:15.680]  This country was founded with the idea that we were all kind of united together and there
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:20.240]  is this governmental entity that we suffered a little bit because we needed security.
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:26.320]  We needed someone to gather the guns to fight back if someone came to our shores.
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:27.920]  But that was the key to it.
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:30.120]  We didn't trust the government.
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:33.400]  We didn't trust like a policing system that was around.
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:36.720]  We just hoped they wouldn't oppress us too much, and we wrote down some law that says
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:38.120]  maybe they can't.
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:42.240]  And now we're just, our entire society is giving right into it.
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:46.280]  And the worst part is, it's not the government really even doing it anymore because they
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:47.720]  don't have to.
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:52.400]  They've infiltrated corporations with enough propaganda that the corporations will just
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:55.720]  police everyone for us.
[1:38:55.720 --> 1:38:59.840]  Where do you see this going?
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:02.120]  Well I have a hopeful side.
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.920]  My hopeful side says the pendulum is coming to a stop and is going to start swinging back
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:13.960]  the other way and we'll get some people who will notice this is going on at the normal
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:16.800]  levels and they'll start rejecting it and pushing back.
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:21.960]  And I think a big turning point kind of for a lot of mainstream America was Johnny Depp
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:30.400]  oddly enough in his trial because Johnny Depp was no far right insurrectionist or whatever.
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:32.880]  He's just a Hollywood guy, very popular.
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.160]  And people saw how he almost got railroaded into absolute oblivion.
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:42.200]  He was cut off from everything, made a pariah in Hollywood, made a pariah in society.
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:45.520]  And then when the trial comes out and people start listening, they're like, oh, this guy
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:51.200]  was absolutely railroaded and everybody just went along with it because that was the convenient
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:59.840]  narrative of the Me Too movement and this sort of socialist agenda that hits.
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:03.240]  And so once that happened, I saw a lot of people start to turn and say, hey, I've been
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:09.320]  a liberal my whole life, but this is garbage and I don't like how they're treating people.
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:12.960]  And so I think more cases like that are going to bring us back.
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:15.560]  Same thing with transgenderism.
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:19.560]  Taking over parents' parental rights, targeting the children, putting them in databases, sterilizing
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:20.560]  them.
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:21.560]  You've been a big critic of that.
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:24.760]  I see that as really waking people up across the political spectrum.
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:29.280]  Yeah, I think that was the biggest mistake that these people made during COVID was they
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:35.800]  started going to kids, they started pushing transgenderism in schools, they started pushing
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:41.040]  critical race theories in schools, and then they sent all the kids home during COVID and
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:42.800]  all the parents got to see it.
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:44.000]  They got to see it in front of them.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.600]  I mean, they'd hear about some stuff here and there, but you know, oh, mom, dad, listen
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.960]  to what we learned, yeah, sure, cool, whatever.
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:52.160]  Then they're sitting there and their kids are at home, they're hearing the teacher's
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:56.520]  lecture about it, they're getting assignments and looking at them going, what is this?
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:57.800]  What are we even talking about?
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.040]  Where's just math?
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:03.320]  Can we try teaching math or reading or any of those things?
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:09.560]  No, now it's all about race, it's all about gender, it's all about identity and nothing
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:12.280]  about actual classical education anymore.
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:16.240]  I think that was a mistake because yes, going after kids is going to wake up parents, but
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:20.560]  calling out transgender activists is a very dangerous activity I recently learned.
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:25.080]  Oh yeah, I got calls like four years ago from Big Tech, like vice presidents, they said,
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:29.480]  just leave the transgender woman alone and we'll leave you alone, that is so important
[1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:31.560]  to them to control the minds of the youth.
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:34.840]  Now, if you can form a sexual relationship with a child, you control them.
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:38.440]  Now they can't rape them, but they can tell them they're another sex and prepare them
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:39.960]  for medical rape.
[1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:42.680]  I mean, this is really abusive.
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.160]  It's really abusive and the scary part is, you know, you have weirdos individually who
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:49.920]  are out there grooming kids online for this stuff.
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:54.920]  They meet them on places like Discord or whatever and then, you know, these kids get caught
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:58.960]  at this most confusing point in their life when they're going through a bunch of hormonal
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:03.920]  changes, their identities are all out of whack, their peers are all different and then they
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:08.680]  take advantage of that and start trying to push them as a token into their own agenda.
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:12.960]  The worst part, though, is that hospitals and doctors and psychiatrists all across the
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:17.440]  country are seemingly complicit in this and I think it's because a lot of them are just
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:21.520]  flat out terrified to say anything else because if you say anything against it, your medical
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.160]  license goes away, your psychiatric license goes away, the hospital's funding gets revoked,
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:30.200]  grants get dropped and everybody's scared of this.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.200]  So might as well just roll over and take the money like all these video shows, university
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.480]  directors saying, hey, we're making a lot of money off chopping little girls' breasts
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:40.360]  off, little boys, genitals off.
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:45.840]  We'll be right back with Nick Riccati, lawyer, well-known talk show host, to talk about the
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:51.680]  tyranny of tech censorship and the wheels coming off the whole COVID narrative straight
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:52.680]  ahead.
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  We'll be right back with Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:44.680]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:44:18.640]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:48.640]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:45:18.640]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:48.640]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:46:16.640]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:46.600]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:47:12.600]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:43.600]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:48:13.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:43.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:49:13.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:43.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:50:13.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:43.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:51:13.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:39.560]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:52:05.520]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:31.480]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati and I'll see you next time on Nick Riccati.
[1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:57.440]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:23.400]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:49.360]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:54:17.320]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:43.280]  Thanks for watching Nick Riccati.
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:47.920]  You can be punished for it and sometimes you will. You should always speak prudently but
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:53.680]  you should always speak boldly in that prudence. Know that there are so many people out there
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:58.320]  fighting for freedom and fighting for you and there's way more than you think that are
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:54:59.320]  on your side.
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:04.800]  That's perfectly said and anything valuable, anything powerful they're going to attack.
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:08.360]  So as a rule, there's the old saying from World War II they didn't have radar yet or
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:12.720]  wasn't deployed yet fully that they didn't actually know where the German factories were
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:16.080]  but wherever the flak was they steered towards it.
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:20.560]  And sure you're not getting flak you fly around the target. You've got to go into the flak
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:24.920]  and we've got to understand that not flying into the flak is going to be much worse than
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:27.680]  submitting to it and that's really what this comes down to.
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:32.280]  Nick Riccati thank you so much for joining us today. People can find your great work
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:40.640]  at obviously riccatalaw.locals.com and they can also find you a lot of other great places
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:43.360]  so God bless you and thank you for spending time with us.
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  Thank you sir.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:49.120]  All right we're going to come back and take phone calls and hit the latest news on Russia
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:54.920]  and look I'm just going to say this right up front. We were in trouble last week. The
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:59.200]  economy's falling apart, we weren't getting enough orders in to even pay the bills and
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:04.240]  we still aren't out of the red again. We got back in the red again, drives me crazy but
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:09.840]  all of a sudden X3 was like selling out and I went why is that? Oh people are buying because
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:13.400]  they think it protects them from a nuclear war. It does not protect you from a nuclear
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:17.800]  war. Praying and being involved and being engaged and saying no to tyranny does. Yeah
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:22.560]  it protects your thyroid from a few isotubes, the most common radioactive isotubes that
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:30.120]  are given off by hydrogen bomb. Yes but it's like having a life vest in the middle of the
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:34.000]  North Atlantic you're going to freeze death anyways doesn't really matter. That's not
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.960]  why we sell iodine though there's a run on it. We're not going to raise the price despite
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:42.920]  it. It does protect your immune system and your body and your cells and your energy.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:48.600]  It's essential. We have the very best X3 back in stock 50% off selling out very quickly
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:52.600]  so it funds the M4 war. It'll do amazing things. It takes about two weeks for it to kick in
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:55.640]  on average. Take a few drops every morning or every night. I wouldn't take it at night
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:59.760]  because it gives you so much energy and it doesn't have stimulants in it. So many people
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:04.480]  are missing out on real iodine. So much the iodine, the environment's bound to other compounds,
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:09.800]  other things on the periodic table and so you don't absorb it properly. This is bound
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:15.040]  to other elements. This is the pure deep earth crystal iodine than two other types of absorbent
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.880]  absorbent and faster. It's 50% off infowarstore.com and it's selling out quick. I want to thank
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:23.640]  you all for your support. Get your X2 now at infowarstore.com and we're going to end

[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  and I'm doing a special emergency broadcast till midnight Wednesday.
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:55.440]  Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:58:00.320]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together. This family
[1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:07.200]  that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:14.880]  Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:21.160]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order. The only reason humanity is still
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:26.660]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken
[1:58:26.660 --> 1:58:33.080]  action and supported this show. I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:37.800]  info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up. Without your support
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:58:45.000]  we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today. Saveinfowars.com today and donate
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:49.520]  for our legal defense fund.
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:56.960]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:02.880]  the very heights of politics not just in America but in the world. We are engaging the globalist
[1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:08.760]  at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes I've persevered
[1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:13.920]  but the listeners and viewers who support info wars for the real reason we've had this
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:19.200]  success. We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:26.640]  ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:30.960]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:35.720]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:40.960]  you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over
[1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:45.480]  the target and this street is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's
[1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:50.080]  our fight. God bless you all.
[1:59:50.080 --> 2:00:02.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones. Waging war
[2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:17.800]  on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:00:17.800 --> 2:00:21.120]  Again I want to thank all the incredible listeners and viewers for your prayer your word of mouth
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:25.000]  your support. You are incredible. I'm guilty every day coming up here begging you for help
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.880]  but I'd be more guilty giving up. So I'm just going to do it. I'm going to beg even harder
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:31.080]  to stay on air. It was a work we're doing so incredible. I know it's a hard fight and
[2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:36.200]  I appreciate you. I'm going to hit some huge new Reuters. Start of the next segment I'm
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:40.000]  going to get a few calls in right now. We now know the Russians are going to invade
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  out of the north out of white Russia. That's what Belarus means. Blonde Russian and massive
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:50.040]  troop movements hundreds of thousands of troops getting ready to smash in that's very close
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.120]  to Kiev so the real war just started. That's coming up right now. Let's go to Johnny in
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:58.960]  Texas Johnny thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:02.120]  Good afternoon Alex. Thank you for the privilege of being part of your show today.
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:07.960]  The privilege to talk to you. Go ahead. Yes sir. I've been with you. You often comment
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:11.480]  how you've been doing this for 28 years. I'm proud to say I've been with you for 24 of
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:15.800]  those. I remember you when I lived in Austin and you were on cable access. It's awesome
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:22.960]  to watch where you're at today sir. Yes truly this is by design. Yes is the deep state at
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:29.560]  a full tilt boogie and like any Trojan horse it's in all levels of our government and this
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:38.360]  goes to what you spoke of earlier today Alex about the scripted you know media not the
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:43.280]  alternative for the most part but the scripted and this is Operation Mockingbird which you
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:49.720]  know a lot about that too. But going further yes for such a time as this brother for us
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:56.360]  are witnessing what's happening today in the world not just in our country but globally
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:02.880]  it is definitely by design. There's no chance the numbers would be astronomical for all
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.840]  these things to evolve at once. So you know what we can do as individuals well you know
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:14.960]  I believe in Christ and what he tells me I have a sound mind and body and not to be
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:22.640]  afraid and yes just like you I've been vilified for 25 years when I spoke about these things
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:29.120]  that are unveiling themselves today but truly the veil has been revealed right the veil
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:34.720]  has been lifted a lot of the people that have been blind they're seeing now but the problem
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:39.520]  I find Alex not unlike what you said earlier is when I speak about these things to people
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:45.360]  even my family they they they say the same thing they've always said you're crazy you are absolutely
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:51.840]  a nut job but the reality is where I get my information is from people like you certainly
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.360]  but more than that this is predicted and it's predictable because it's from scripture what
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:07.680]  we're seeing is the beast it's rocking it full tilt so we we have to go to who we believe in
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:13.680]  I believe in Christ and you know he'll keep me uplifted and stronger we either stand now Alex
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:21.600]  or we fall just the way I see it so we have to stay strong and I will be donating to your legal
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:27.360]  fund sir I can think of no one that deserves it more than you you've worked so hard for so many
[2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:32.480]  years and you've been very uplifting and positive in my life so I thank you for that sir well I
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:36.560]  appreciate you I just hate having to come to you guys so much for support but we're under massive
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:41.520]  globalist attack they're so angry we're not off the air save info wars.com is the place
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:46.640]  for legal defense funds save info wars.com want to thank folks for the donations we've gone through
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:52.320]  two mega trials that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece hundreds of depositions hundreds
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:55.600]  they just assaultless everything they've got the courts just let them abuse the hell out of us but
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:59.840]  it's okay we're not victims we're overcomers one more show trial coming up next year but
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:04.400]  we've got these big appeals coming up that are very inexpensive we're talking 20 30 thousand dollars
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:08.400]  you know for the appeals maybe ten thousand dollars for the arguments so three of those
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:12.720]  hundred thousand dollars together maybe a little more than a hundred thousand so the bills go way
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:17.440]  down you know in through Christmas and a little a little bit of a bill for the the next show trial
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:21.360]  next year but I'm not even worried about that I want to stay on air to fight the globalist and
[2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:25.360]  expose the war they're trying to start and just do that and so it's a sign of our victory that
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:30.000]  they come after so much and they just hate all of us coming together they fear us having a focal
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:34.560]  point so thank you so much sir uh but the lord works in mysterious ways and info wars is having a

[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:31.520]  and we are back live broadcasting worldwide ladies and gentlemen and here is the big news
[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:40.400]  we'll put it up on screen for everybody poland advises its citizens to leave balarus now again
[2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:47.280]  ukraine was part of russia it's where russia was founded a thousand years ago and north of that is
[2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:52.480]  what they call white russians balarus because they have blonde hair compared to folks in the east
[2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:57.280]  that's just the name of it balarus and here's roiders i just point that out because it's
[2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:04.640]  all been russia forever polish citizens in balarus should leave the country warsaw set on monday
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:10.080]  as relations between the two countries became increasingly tense in part due to the war in
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:17.280]  ukraine the advice follows a similar recommendation given in september to poles in russia a close ally
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:23.280]  of balarus who recommend the polish citizens stay on the territory of the republic of balarus
[2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:28.800]  believe its territory with available commercial and private means the government set in guidance
[2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:33.920]  for travelers published on its website relations between warsaw and minstery 2001 poland crossed
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:38.320]  its eastern neighbor by orchestrating a migrant crisis on the border and becoming even more
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:43.200]  strained with russia invasion since and the reports coming out now are that masses of russian
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:49.280]  troops are massing in balarus that if you look at the map tf the capital is very close to the
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:53.840]  border up there perhaps for an invasion from the north the russians have already invaded
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:58.800]  from the east into the west so i'm going to take a few calls here and then going out to break i'm
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:04.560]  going to play a short compilation of globalist leaders saying a cyberattack with the pretext
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:14.160]  for full war with russia and that is now what we are seeing in a big big big way so this is
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:20.320]  again escalating very very quickly let's talk to roland in oklahoma roland you're on the air yeah
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:28.000]  alex uh good afternoon my belief is they cannot afford to have an election they know they're
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:38.320]  going to be wiped out so i think in my heart that they will have some kind of lost flag maybe a
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:48.960]  nuclear device or three go off in this country as part of the new war or bring destroying
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:58.880]  america we have chinese troops to the north biden would love to call the united nations in
[2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:12.800]  to our problem setting up a complete war war in this country similar to that what i experienced
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:20.400]  in vietnam and that's what's scary to me because the countdown is less than 30 days
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:27.440]  i think the globalist are trying to push russia into a bigger confrontation before the midterms
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:30.880]  because the globalists know they're about to lose their main command base i mean i agree with you i
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:36.960]  think we're in the maximum danger right now absolutely and it's scary and people had best
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:39.840]  realize that and wake up now
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:49.360]  but maybe maybe this is god's will that we'd be brought down to our needs
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:54.080]  well that's why the satanists do the transgenderism and the pedophilia
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:58.320]  and all of us they know if they can do enough evil and we don't stop it god will remove protection
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:02.480]  it's a ritual the satanists do to make us wide open because they're already sold out
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:06.320]  they don't care what happens to them they want to bring us down with them absolutely you're
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:13.840]  absolutely right and and my what they have done to this country the last two years bringing in all
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:23.280]  these children pedophilia sex trade everything drugs it it we got to stand up and stop it and
[2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:33.840]  that's going to be we need some good leaders because that is a time of choice do you fight
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:40.480]  or do you surrender absolutely it's all been turned up on overdrive thank you rolling the games
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:44.720]  are over folks let's talk to dean and pencil vanya dean thanks for holding them we'll go to paul

[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:18.560]  seen the situation and the corruption the corruption in ukraine is unbelievable i mean
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:24.960]  absolutely it's out in the open unbelievable a lot of people may not understand this they may not
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:31.120]  like it but like i said i live there i'm now back here in pennsylvania with my wife we still have

[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:02.960]  um things are going to happen things are definitely going to happen over there
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:09.840]  um i just talked to my little brother my brother in law i call him my little brother anson
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:18.240]  good morning zapparocia got hit very hard very hard the mood of the people over there
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:23.360]  they're just tired they're just tired of it they're tired of the corruption
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:31.280]  which happened before all of this before russia invaded people are just tired
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:40.720]  we may just want to survive and what we're doing and what i've seen when i went over there to be
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:47.680]  a contractor i don't want no part of it i hear you doing great points and i appreciate your call
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:51.040]  we're going to go to break with a compilation of world leaders saying a cyber attack will be
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:54.400]  launched by russia they're obviously setting them up we'll come back with more of your phone calls
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:00.080]  on the other side stay with us another area we spent a great deal of time on was cyber and
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:06.160]  cyber security i talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:12.560]  limits to attack period by cyber or any other means i gave them a list if i'm not mistaken
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:20.480]  i don't have in front of me 16 specific entities 16 defined as critical infrastructure under u.s
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:27.760]  policy from the energy sector to our water systems of course the principle is one thing
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:33.680]  it has to be backed up by practice responsible countries need to take action against criminals
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:41.360]  who conduct ransomware activities on their territory so we agreed to task experts and
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:48.640]  both our both our countries to work on specific understandings about what's off limits and to
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:54.560]  follow up on specific cases that originate in other countries in either our countries
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:15:01.840]  today we are reiterating those warnings and we're doing so based on evolving threat intelligence
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:07.760]  that the russian government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks on critical infrastructure
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:14.400]  in the united states to be clear there is no certainty there will be a cyber incident on
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:22.320]  critical infrastructure so why am i here because this is a call to action and a call to responsibility
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:33.280]  for all of us but still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:43.360]  cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply transportation hospital
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:53.520]  services our society as a whole the kovai 19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small

[2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:04.800]  here hello alex alex uh believing the mainstream media on this war is like believing what fiser
[2:21:04.800 --> 2:21:09.600]  says about cobit you know the fact of the matter is there's a money angle to this
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:16.720]  and the mainstream media is all supported and subsidized by uh the arms manufacturers
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:24.400]  and uh the media is going to respond dutifully to make sure that the advertisements and and um
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:28.160]  you know oh yeah i don't believe a word coming out of the media about what's happening over
[2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:32.800]  there but i do out of i do out of russia and from our own sources in the u.s military and
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:38.160]  russia's getting a lot harder fight than they thought they'd get yeah but but uh don't forget
[2:21:38.160 --> 2:21:43.280]  this is you know they're planning the long strategy here already if you think about what
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:49.200]  they wanted in the beginning of the war which was just two provinces and keeping Crimea they wanted
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:55.840]  the donetsk and luhansk liberated now they're getting zaporizhia and kerson thrown in so they're
[2:21:55.840 --> 2:22:01.920]  going to gain four oblasts from the look of this and and they're doing and they're winning russia is
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:07.280]  absolutely winning it's all a matter of time they're taking their time they're using excellent
[2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:11.760]  strategy and i think what's going to happen now and i we're seeing this today is i think they're
[2:22:11.760 --> 2:22:19.120]  going to open up in a can of uh william tecumseh sherman whoop ass by bringing so they're going to
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:25.600]  burn everything to the sea well more not so much that they're going to bring the war to the civilians
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:31.360]  and make them how because remember what sure he brought up sherman so he burned everything from
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:36.640]  Missouri all the way to the ocean yeah but more importantly he brought the pain of the war
[2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:42.240]  to civilians and once you do that that undermines the war but that's what hitler thought with the
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:48.880]  british yeah but here's the thing the western ukrainians to me have been very smug they've
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:55.200]  been the main supporters of the the made dan revolution they've been supplying a lot of support
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:23:00.240]  for the war when they start getting a taste of the cold and and are sitting in their apartments
[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:05.280]  shivering in the dark because they don't have electricity they're not going to have water
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:08.880]  and they're not well it is true that the most the power lines to the nuclear power plant have
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:15.360]  been blown up so a lot of ukraine is in darkness yeah so i think russia is going to turn on and
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:20.000]  you know they didn't do this for months but you know they were trying to keep the kid gloves on
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.760]  but now i think they're going to open up a can of whoop ass and they're going to and they don't
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:29.840]  think they're going to do it they've just done it yeah and and once the infrastructure is down
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:34.160]  and the utilities are down in western ukraine i think the support for this war is going to
[2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:38.960]  start ending and they're going to push for a reasonable uh partition which is well how do
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:43.280]  you know this isn't going to bring nature fully into the war i i just think everybody's going to
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.760]  punk out because there's at the simultaneously there's going to be a lot of protests in europe
[2:23:47.760 --> 2:23:52.400]  already they're having in prog berlin and in france because nobody wants that's how britain's
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:58.000]  winning is the energy so why would the globalists do blow up the pipeline so so germany wouldn't
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:04.720]  punk out it's just it's crazy well that's the west and you know in the united states trying to push
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:12.400]  l and g that's a fantasy of americans to be able to ship uh american gas uh to europe and and uh
[2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:16.400]  in a competitive manner which are amazing points incredible caller thank you sir
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:23.840]  jeff in maryland you're on the air welcome hi man hey uh blessings alex um actually i spoke with
[2:24:23.840 --> 2:24:30.400]  you at the end of august so regarding the theme of climate controls on the east coast um in first
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:36.640]  things first i'd like to have him all the info warriors out there uh go to the greg reef reports
[2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:41.360]  and uh float them around the society because of all the blind incidents just the short oh it's
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:47.920]  so frustrating to me that greg reef reports only yet 400 000 views on average i mean they're so damn
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:52.400]  good it's the same thing on the germany reports they're all at man dot video just waiting to wake
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:57.680]  people up they're they're they're they're weaponized truth they're just ready that's what i bring
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:02.560]  to people whenever they ask questions i think you'll watch this i'll send them the feed so um
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:08.960]  but our conversation uh got me thinking about the 40 chest on how to attack our grid um realistically
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:14.720]  i think the grid will just go down long enough for them to uh launch the credit score system oh i
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:18.160]  agree they're not gonna lock it down long they're gonna they're gonna shut it down say the russians
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:22.560]  didn't go oh don't worry there look look look all the central banks already saying soon your bank
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:27.280]  will be shut in october or november and then a new currency is coming out now i'm not saying
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:31.440]  they're gonna do it but they're saying they're about to do it this is a big deal yeah about mid
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:36.080]  december is what they're saying now my my thought is they can't really do much other than rolling
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:40.320]  blackouts because all the nuclear plants will start melting down and that is just gonna go
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:45.040]  completely opposite of what they want the united states well you know the grids all have certain
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:51.760]  areas that are you know quote backed up by uh generators others that aren't they it'll be so
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:58.640]  obvious they're gonna selectively shut areas off now my my thought is is okay europe ukraine all
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:04.480]  that stuff this is it's a complete distraction um people are going to die in europe it's on it's
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:10.320]  upsetting my thought is is china is going to backdoor send once we start rolling down the
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:15.440]  rolling blackouts because they've been training in obviously canada for a few years they got the police
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:21.920]  um setting up all over the place you know please it's really nice to say that was impossible
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:26.560]  but the media is so controlled that they put chinese generals on tv saying we run your life
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:31.360]  now the average leftist would salute them in a minute yeah actually i spoke with elin last
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:36.480]  february and brought this up to him and uh i thought that it was kind of odd that they were
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.520]  training with the canadians in one time and he was like you know i don't see that happening now you
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:46.480]  see all these ships that are sitting off the coast and there's i see videos out of canada where like
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:52.400]  500 paramilitary troops that don't look like fatasses are just running down the road in canada
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:58.080]  and now they admitted to quote watch chinese citizens in america and canada i mean we are just
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:04.560]  this is a joke i mean our government is totally criminal has sold us out they've been uh chinese
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:08.880]  firms which we know is the government has been buying up farmland all around our military bases
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:16.240]  typically the drone base in north north uh north dakota i'm sorry and uh it's a scary thing now
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:22.800]  my concern is the uh all these ships that are sitting offshore that are painted with the uh
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:27.280]  you know how they painted and look these are all women these are sex operatives they're going to
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.840]  put in and take over the politicians they've got armies of sex operatives in our country now
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:36.640]  this is canada the chinese have been using transport ships to guard the movement of
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:44.160]  military ships um and that's oh yeah the chinese merchant marine is really their navy
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:48.240]  we're completely infiltrated yeah and there's something that said you know he's going to keep
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:55.200]  this uh the board's open and uh you know what's off the what's in those ships offshore no one knows
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:00.560]  there's just going to be a major movement i think take over the entire pacific and the west coast
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:06.560]  um and obviously bill gates has all the farmland real ways in the states in this pocket so
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:12.320]  and you know the chinese really don't like us they keep talking about a hundred year war

[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:35.680]  and there are strikes all over the country it may be a false flag probably not putin
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:43.120]  said he's a start targeting nato targets inside ukraine so you don't need spider sense folks
[2:33:43.120 --> 2:33:47.840]  of the holy ghost know this is dangerous but let me tell you something i've told you this for months
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:52.800]  i'm guilty every day that i haven't loaded up my winnebago i got a winnebago i haven't used in
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:58.480]  years i never get take time off and just left but i'm not doing it because we have a chance to stop
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:04.640]  this but this is real as a heart attack now let's talk about some of the positive news before i
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:08.400]  host some of the next hour and finish up with kevin and others and get all this breaking news on the
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:13.360]  war with thomas rinds who had booked for a full hour he's an incredible patriot i apologize we had
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:18.800]  to cut in 30 minutes but he understands with this huge war news to give me some good news a silver
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:25.520]  lining in this nightmare studies in germany studies the uk studies in canada oxford studies studies
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:32.960]  in the us the surgeon general medical doctor now we learned he's been doing a year-long study
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:40.880]  84 increase in heart attacks 18 to 39 now we already knew that that's bad news but the good news is
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:44.960]  we have champions that are saying no and this literally is going to scare the hell out of the
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:48.720]  globalist so on so many fronts like gain a function you name if people are waking up
[2:34:48.720 --> 2:34:53.520]  thomas rinds is a well-known successful lawyer rinds-law.com he has been spearheading filing
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.960]  lawsuits against big pharma having some really good success he's also a very articulate individual
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:04.640]  told her to get him on with some updates on i see this is extremely positive i've seen national
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:11.920]  numbers we're having uptake of the vaccine down 90 plus percent since its peak and summit jurisdictions
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:16.800]  is 99 percent people are not taking the new so-called booster which we know isn't a vaccine
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:22.320]  so as bad as things are it looks like people are finally waking up what area do you want to hit first
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:28.160]  so mr rinds oh man i tell you alex i actually had the privilege of being able to watch you
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:32.800]  before it came on and i'll tell you i didn't expect to do this but i'd like to talk a little
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:42.320]  bit about coven the war sure so let me put this out there we just filed a billion dollar lawsuit
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:47.920]  against eco health alliance and several others for the creation of saris covet two in the lab
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:54.160]  in wuhan china with the chinese okay so we've alleged that they've created it there we believe
[2:35:54.160 --> 2:35:58.080]  we can prove it in court and we're gonna we're gonna show it i think we're gonna win this we've
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:04.560]  got a firsthand whistleblower we got all these different things this is the greatest conspiracy
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:09.680]  ever unleashed on mankind six and a half million dead by their numbers right they kill six and a
[2:36:09.680 --> 2:36:15.120]  half million dead you've seen the you've seen all sorts of distractions coming up to the election
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:20.800]  coming up to all this you know we file we file the one of the biggest lawsuits in history on this
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:26.080]  sort of thing all of a sudden we've got some major talk of some war stuff we got some
[2:36:27.440 --> 2:36:35.360]  oh no no no sir listen to you go ahead oh okay so we got some major talks of some war stuff we
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:42.320]  got some major talks of some chaos of all this stuff going on so the question i would ask is
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:48.080]  given that we we put this lawsuit out there and given that we've just released a report that tied
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:54.960]  this to hunter biden that tied this to the us intelligence community that tied this to the
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:00.400]  military industrial complex isn't it convenient that with all these ties to all of these people
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:06.880]  that suddenly we're talking about a war no i totally absolutely agree with you thomas friends in fact
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:11.520]  when i was driving into work this morning i was going to say even the nuclear war situation
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:17.200]  is a distraction from this chemical biological nanotech attack that has been the viral release
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:21.840]  and the shots and you're absolutely right tell people about the lawsuit that you just filed
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:30.160]  yeah so i mean listen this is kind of like uh you know if you build a dynamite factory and your
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:34.960]  dynamite factory blows up and kills a bunch of people around the factory well you're going to
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:40.720]  get sued you're going to have to pay for the dead people the people who died from your dynamite factory
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:46.640]  blown up well in this case we've alleged that they created a bio weapon that we've alleged that they've
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:51.120]  created sars-covid two in a lab we've alleged that they've created one of the most dangerous
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:58.960]  biological agents in history and that that agent then got out and killed millions of people well
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:03.120]  if that happens guess who guess who's got to pay for those deaths guess who's got to pay for that
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:08.800]  carnage the lockdowns and all the chaos and that's without the six and a half million dead doesn't
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:16.000]  even count the death from the vaccines the death from everything else i mean the adjet chaos so
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:20.400]  you know this to me is the first major step towards accountability and i'm really excited
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:25.280]  about it i am too and and i know you have my skype fees you can see me talking over you see
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:30.000]  stopped i was telling the crew when we archive this at bandot video i'll tell them hey grab this
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.720]  clip to put it up front but what you were saying was so powerful but i distracted you was telling
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:39.280]  hey grab this clip to put it on front for bandot video this is so huge you've followed a lot of
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:44.880]  suits you've been successful now a billion dollar against peter dazik and this whole criminal cabal
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:51.280]  elaborate on that and then walk through how big this is well you know we've got a first hand
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:56.000]  whistleblower and we released a couple weeks ago report and that report showed a number of things
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:39:03.840]  it showed that first of all it's almost inarguable that this was created in the lab in wuhan china
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:11.760]  it shows that anthony fauci uh almost absolutely certainly lied to congress and perjured himself
[2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:16.240]  when he said that he wasn't funding gain of function i mean these are documents that they
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:21.760]  have given us we have their documentation that basically show this right so we've got all of
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:28.880]  these things coming out we've got uh all these things that show that essentially fauci paid these
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:35.040]  guys they experimented on a bunch of viruses the result was that sarz covet two came out
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:40.960]  it spread out got out of the lab killed people all over the world and you know the rest is history
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:46.960]  so what we've done is we said listen if we can show that you guys have done this and that this
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:53.680]  did escape from the lab there should be liability under current tort law the civil liability so we
[2:39:53.680 --> 2:39:59.520]  filed a suit and you know it's very tough to sue the government on something like this much easier
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:05.440]  to sue a private entity and so we we filed suit where we think it belongs we believe we've got the
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:10.720]  right defendants here but we included john and jane doe one through a thousand and we did that so
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.280]  that if if the evidence shows that someone else is a necessary party should be added we can add
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:20.560]  them to the law so class action yeah well we'll see we'll see where it goes we're going to go where
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:26.000]  the evidence takes us we have to be very disciplined and very careful to do this case exactly right
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:31.600]  and we're doing our very best to do it make americans free again and uh it's helped an immense
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:36.640]  amount with this uh another attorney named patty finn and we've got a couple other attorneys
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:41.840]  patty is a brilliant attorney out of new york she's done a great job on this uh we're just as
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:48.240]  excited as can be because we feel like if we can actually get this get some accountability here
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:52.880]  that it'll open the floodgates and we'll be able to to really kind of move on and hit hit this in
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:56.480]  all these different directions so millions are watching right now and i knew you filed this suit
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.240]  i got distracted with the war and didn't bring that up front what is the headline we give to this
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:06.960]  once we archive and demand our videos and go viral billion dollar americans file billion dollar suit
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:13.920]  against uh falchi uh wuhan or or against peter dazik wuhan or against chinese lab or
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:19.760]  what should the headline be here what's the big takeaway uh you know billion dollar lawsuit
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:25.200]  filed against eco health alliance for the death of 6.5 million i mean we're not right now suing for
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:31.760]  all 6.5 million uh we'll see what happens but if it turns out that they're responsible for the death
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:36.160]  of our plaintiffs they'll probably be responsible for the death of everybody else under the same
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:42.160]  principles of law and you know at the end of the day if you do something that's ultra hazardous
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:48.880]  and ultra dangerous under the law and for whatever reason you know that that causes the death of a
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:55.280]  whole bunch of people well you're typically liable and in this case we've got gain of function research
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:03.360]  going on all over and alex you know let me tell you about punitive damages punitive damages are
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:08.320]  in court called punishment damages right and they're not something that the courts love to do and
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:14.400]  it's not something that we always want to ask for as attorneys but these guys performed gain of
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:21.360]  function research on what they knew was a pandemic type virus they made it more dangerous it escaped
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:27.440]  and these are all things that we've alleged and we'll prove in the case now as if that wasn't
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:32.000]  enough as if the six and a half million dead people around the world isn't enough
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:38.880]  Anthony Fauci just gave peter dasik and eco health alliance another grant to do more gain
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:46.240]  of function in wuhan china more of the same thomas rince stay there i want you to recap this and

[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:13.760]  dazzic the whole front group of the cia and the wuhan lab they've been caught in congress lying
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:20.800]  start over and recap how big this is well i think it's critical right so i mean if you look at what's
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:27.040]  happened and i think your headline today is probably the most important yeah we look we've got
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:34.160]  the same guys that are that are behind you know what's going on with this war in ukraine
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:39.440]  from the us side and we just hit the pipeline right i mean it looks like the us hit the pipeline
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:48.720]  we see the us seeming to be involved with escalation well alex these are the same guys who
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:56.480]  funded the creation of sars covet too they funded this they supported this us aid ink you tell all
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:02.880]  these crews were involved with this right we know this we've got documents we've got paperwork
[2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:10.080]  we can show this it bare minimum does anybody on this planet believe that we traded and put the
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:17.040]  technology in wuhan china to create a what is essentially a bio weapon to create sars covet
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:23.360]  to to do that genetic manipulation and to create a danger dangerous pathogen like that does anybody
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:29.840]  to believe that we did all of that and that our military industrial complex our intelligence
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:34.560]  community and all these other people didn't know about it does anybody believe that
[2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:41.440]  you throw in the fact that we've got ink you tell and and cia involvement and all these different
[2:50:41.440 --> 2:50:47.280]  things that we can show or have witnesses talking about it's hard to fathom that they that they
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:52.240]  aren't panicked right now that their role in this might come out now am i saying that that's why
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:58.000]  we've got things going on in ukraine man i can't prove that but boy the timing sure is funny well
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:02.800]  no let me back you up i said this two years ago i said when the carnage from the shots comes out
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:07.200]  and the virus comes out they'll start a war or something else to distract from the last crisis
[2:51:07.200 --> 2:51:11.920]  i think long before you followed your suit or the public woke up they had the next crisis ready
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:17.920]  to distract us from the last that's just how they operate yeah absolutely i mean listen
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:23.760]  they've got to do something about this you know the mainstream i got to tell you i don't think
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:27.600]  i think i might be the only guy on the planet that's almost as censored as you are in the
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:33.760]  mainstream it's unbelievable you know we've got we're out here we've produced everything that you
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:38.720]  could possibly need to show that anthony fowchee probably perjured himself in front of congress
[2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:42.880]  that hunter biden should be investigated that joe biden should be investigated that this was
[2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:48.080]  created in a lab that anthony fowchee funded it we've given them everything they need yet despite
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:56.400]  this crickets crickets well guess what you want to ignore the report that's fine now you try and
[2:51:56.400 --> 2:52:01.200]  ignore the lawsuit good luck on that one because we're going to hold these people accountable
[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:05.600]  and i'm going to be really interested to see how much loyalty there is amongst thieves you know
[2:52:05.600 --> 2:52:10.080]  fowchee and dasik and all these guys we got their emails of them collaborating and talking about the
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:15.360]  fact that they're going to cover up the the lab origins of this uh you know it'll be really interesting
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:20.000]  to see how loyal these guys are to each other when they start getting drug in front of the court
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:24.640]  for the kind of money that we're going to have us rents of rents law tell us where do we read the

[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:24.080]  this is exciting to have this coming up yeah and i i've met ladapo a few times he's a real good guy
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:29.680]  he's an honest guy he's a legitimate scientist and he's a very very smart guy you know he's uh
[2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:34.160]  he's doing what well whatever scientist ought to be doing looking at numbers and then actually
[2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:40.880]  doing something with it i think alex i think this is the death now of of this whole covid fraud
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:45.680]  i think that's why this is all happening i think this guy i think the the work that we're doing
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:50.880]  you know we wanted to consistently keep pressure on these guys until it finally broke and i think
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:55.920]  that's where we are i think we've won this i think they know we've won it i think it's now just a
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:54:02.560]  matter of time and ensuring accountability i think that the ladapo i think the santus i think all
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:08.400]  these guys are fighting to get truth out on this everybody's done we have to ensure accountability
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:13.760]  i don't isn't it a shame that trump did a good job of so many fronts but he's letting i don't care
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:17.920]  who does it he's letting the sanis the sanis knows the right thing to do he's doing the right thing
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:24.160]  and trump is doubling down very sad for trump i'm praying to god that the donald uh here's our
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:29.680]  message and and gets behind us you know he's done so much amazing work for america uh you know one
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:34.160]  of the one of the most incredible presidents we've had the guy stood through a tax like no one should
[2:54:34.160 --> 2:54:39.600]  have to stand through but he has not been able to get the message from this uh you know for whatever
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:44.320]  reason i know you spoke out on it you know i'm speaking out on it i believe that the donald
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:50.400]  has to come out here you know i support him as a man as a president but on this one issue he has
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:54.960]  not been where he needs to be and i pray that we can get him the information and in fact i will
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:55:01.040]  reiterate what i said i think the last time i was here if the president will let us i will raise the
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:06.720]  money and fly any experts he wants to talk to to marlago to give him a full brief on the actual
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:11.440]  truth about the vaccines the disease and everything else sir because he i would be honored to do it
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:17.840]  he he he spoke out against rindesum here that kills people he spoke up for hydroxychloroquine and
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:23.280]  for you know other things that you know really really really really help people
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:30.240]  and then he you know he he got good things approved uh life to regenerate on he was just
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:34.800]  trying to help but he knows he's tied to it so he doesn't want to believe it but he wasn't a scientist
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:39.280]  they lied to him they created it they set him up he's got to get ahead of this i don't think there's
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:46.480]  much more time for him to do that i agree with you very much you know i mean ultimately you know
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:52.400]  he's not a scientist he had the smartest people in the world who are actually their their brilliance
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:57.280]  isn't so much in science it's in defrauding people i mean these guys are the biggest best
[2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:03.040]  liars on the planet and their entire job was to convince him that you know they were doing right
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:08.720]  they've admitted it berks has admitted her job was to lie i mean i don't know what else you need
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:14.080]  so yeah they did they lied to him but at the end of the day at the end of the day
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:20.240]  the donald did so much there's no question that he's got the best interest of our country at heart
[2:56:20.240 --> 2:56:24.720]  he just needs to come out and get out in front of this one and then absolutely the good news is
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:29.280]  regardless of what he does everybody's turning against him the news is coming out almost no one's
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:33.440]  taking the shots this did not go the way feiser maderna and bill gates wanted it to
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:38.240]  do nope i'll tell you what regardless of what anyone on this planet does
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:43.920]  regardless of my support for the donald or anybody else i'm going to fight this till i win it or
[2:56:43.920 --> 2:56:48.000]  till i can't fight it anymore we're going to win this we're going to have freedom and we're going
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  to get accountability for every single person who had to pay the price of these scumbag monsters
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  trying to steal our country steal our world and make the trillions of dollars that they've made
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:01.920]  we will hold them accountable well thomas rince do five more minutes with us but i totally agree
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:06.320]  with you because i don't just put out puff pieces make people feel good when stuff's really down
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:10.400]  really bad i'm honest like churchill was with folks oh yeah but but things are turning i mean
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:14.560]  fast against them they're they are panicking they are scared it's why they doubled down and gave more
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:19.920]  money the eco alliance to try to act like they've done nothing wrong it's disgusting so i want to
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:26.560]  talk about where else you think this goes but the next shoot a drop is then the latest russia news
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:33.520]  russia confirms they blew up the german consulate in ukraine quite an escalation i don't support
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:40.960]  russia did i don't support what the us did or nato this is insane it needs to stop now you crazy
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:53.040]  people we'll be right back stay with us think about a world without info wars just take a moment
[2:57:53.040 --> 2:57:58.720]  and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:06.160]  this family that is info wars think about how info wars is cited by joe rogan and tucker carlson and
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:14.320]  ball sonaro and other foreign leaders like nigel farage as being the main impetus towards firing
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:21.040]  up their main base to defeat the new world order the only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:27.200]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:34.560]  i don't take the credit i give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours it

[2:58:57.520 --> 2:59:04.160]  just in america but the world we are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information
[2:59:04.160 --> 2:59:09.840]  war but i don't deserve the credit yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:15.600]  support info wars for the real reason you've had the success we're having now the greatest

[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:27.680]  of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:32.240]  you've been in this fight and to continue and the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify
[2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:39.200]  it god bless you all i salute you i thank you and i beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:59:39.200 --> 2:59:44.320]  because we are over the target and this week is happening the fight is my fight it's your fight
[2:59:44.320 --> 3:00:08.000]  it's our fight god bless you all if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:22.400]  live from austin texas it's alex jones we're living in incredible times where i'm denied a
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:27.680]  defense and sued for eight plus billion dollars for questioning sandy hook but then when you create
[3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:34.080]  a bio weapon and release it kill six million people you're good ha ha thomas rins rinsedaxlaw.com
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:38.240]  we got a huge russia escalation i mean this is the biggest news yet it's so insane
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:41.440]  next segment a couple calls from kevin others we're going to finish up for
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:45.920]  gel salante takes over but i wanted to have thomas rins filing this billion dollar lawsuit
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:50.800]  that's at rinsedaxlaw.com against the eco alliance and the terrorists that created
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:56.480]  from my research the covet 19 virus and released it key points you want to add and what what you
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:01:02.880]  think is coming next you know i don't think uh i don't think anybody knows what's coming next
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:08.800]  alex here's the thing if you look at the arc of what's happened and i've been pulled into everything
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:15.040]  because the same people behind covet are behind all of us so if you look so you've got covet
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:19.920]  you've got the lockdowns the lockdowns facilitate this nonsense with the elections you know the
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:25.520]  dropboxes everywhere 2000 mules all that and the economic collapse either the collapse of the third
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:32.000]  world their whole agenda the economic collapse the food now you see it translating down to the food
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:37.360]  and it's always the same people the same people the same people well we know you know i mean
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:41.680]  listen if you watch if you're watching info wars which you ought to you probably know
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:47.040]  that you know some of this stuff's been talked about you know event 2050 all these things going
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:52.480]  way way back right and there's actual paperwork that backs all this stuff when alex is talking by
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:57.280]  the way audience when alex is talking he's not just talking he's done some homework so
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:02.960]  so when we look at this i think they had to expedite things i think they had to rush things
[3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:08.800]  and i think that what's happened now is covet didn't go the way they thought they could never
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:13.680]  account for nobody's like me fighting like we have you know they could never account for
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:19.040]  we the people rising up they could never account for people saying no we're not going to do this
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:24.080]  and that's what's happened and so now you've got this total collapse of one of the core
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:29.200]  tenants of this whole plan well if we start getting accountability and particularly when
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:33.920]  we start tying in the guys who are funding this and behind it which by the way we have paperwork on
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:39.200]  that's going to start really causing some problems so i think they're panicking and i don't know what
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:44.000]  they're going to do next but i will tell you this it is a dangerous time and it's a dangerous time
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:49.840]  precisely because there's no going back on this this killed six and a half million people the
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:55.680]  economic collapse disastrous the results does everything that's happening is disastrous and
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:03:00.400]  now we're doing a war to try and cover things up i'm going to be honest with the alex i don't know
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:05.200]  what's going to happen but what i do know is that the most dangerous animal is a cornered animal
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:10.640]  and we've got some globalist monsters and some communist monsters and some enemies of america
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:14.560]  around the world cornered on a bunch of different things and we're going to start shedding the
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:19.600]  light of truth on them but here's the problem i agree with you they're cornered but so are we
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:24.880]  by poison shots economic collapse out of control crime so that's like the immovable object runs in
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:32.960]  the unstoppable force yeah it absolutely is but i will tell you what there's one universal truth
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.800]  tyranny is always an illusion we the people ultimately have the power and that's the one
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:43.440]  thing they feared that's why they censor us that's why they attack you that's why they try and shut
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:48.880]  down in full wars that's why they go after everybody that speaks out because they fear the people
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:53.680]  so if we can get the word out if we can share this message there's a reason my ugly mug keeps going
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:58.160]  on tv and it ain't because i'm pretty it's because we've got to get the message out if we get the
[3:03:58.160 --> 3:04:04.000]  message out and we got enough people standing up for the truth we will win this that is why they
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  control facebook that's why they control the media that's why they control twitter that's why they
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:14.960]  did all what they did and at the end of the day alex guys like you and i we have the responsibility
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:20.320]  to educate people and to make sure that they're aware of what's going on because we the people win
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:25.280]  thomas rinds i totally agree we're not trying to say we're warriors but it's an info and culture

[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:09.840]  there's been attacks in at least 20 cities the statement noted however that the consulate has
[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:15.520]  not been producing visas or been in operation since the war started so they just blew up the russian
[3:08:17.200 --> 3:08:23.360]  consulate if this is a consulorship where is the ambassador ukrainian armies commander
[3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:30.960]  achieved poses with swastika bracelet i checked this it's true it's in getty images he's wearing

[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:42.640]  half of ukraine was nazi that hitler said his best soldiers were ukrainian so we're right back

[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:20.160]  on so the globalists are anti-human as you know and there's a formula for that i think it kind of came
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:26.080]  up with this disease plus poverty was slavery and death and the inversion of that the inversion of
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:31.120]  that is pro-human fullness which is health plus wealth you can speed them alive think about all
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:36.640]  the things they do a lot of crime in general it affects your health and wealth freedom of life
[3:09:36.640 --> 3:09:42.160]  in a good way and like like i learned from us in your show um inversion is a big part of this
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:46.800]  because really the globalists are safe and it's all about deception inversions a big part of that
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:51.360]  people have to really try and they're not creative all they know how to do is invert what god does
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:56.480]  so whatever god does they flip which is easy to beat them once you realize it's a flipping
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:00.160]  it's not like you're dealing with something you can't calculate it's why my job's so easy
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:06.880]  it's an inversion yeah it's it's flipping it's like simple arithmetic and uh what what they do
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:11.280]  like you start on your show all the time is they create a problem and they offer weaponized solutions
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:16.640]  that problem which makes the problem worse and whether it's covid or uh climate change they
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:21.280]  create this problem like climate change is being man-made it's a fake problem the covid is a real
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:25.680]  problem they create it and they offer this solution and the solution makes it worse because there's
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:30.080]  another bioweapon and then people say why don't they want to fix it they run things because they're
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:34.880]  anti-human they want to kill us and once you get that it all makes sense it's not like oh they're
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:40.640]  just screwing up no they're not screwing up it's a formula to destroy us yeah the weapon they want
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:44.880]  to commit crime but they got to do it in a way that makes them think they're helping you because
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:50.240]  the best weapon is a weapon that is believed to be help and aid and the best enemy the most effective
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:55.040]  enemy is the enemy believes to be a friend and ally so they got to hurt you but they want to do it
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:58.480]  it can't be obvious about it you have to say oh we're trying to help you this problem really
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:03.760]  they're behind the problem and the and the solution they're offering makes it worse another thing i want
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:10.080]  to touch on is trump not admitting that covid vaccines are killing people i think this is critical
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:13.920]  because this is the one issue that if you can't admit that then you really shouldn't be running
[3:11:13.920 --> 3:11:18.880]  for office because this has been catastrophic for the world this is the biggest political issue of
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:24.800]  our time right now no i agree but here's what's happening trump is being made obsolete by joseph
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:32.320]  a ladapo the amazing super smart really cool surgeon general of florida and by ronda sanis
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:36.880]  and so i don't care who gets the job done to stop the poison shots if trump wants to be an idiot
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.240]  and go along with the new world order because he doesn't want to admit he was wrong he'll just be
[3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:47.440]  basically politically culturally made obsolete by not making the right decision so i just say
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:51.360]  my gut a few months ago saying the sanis is coming out against the shot i'm for him
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:56.960]  i don't get political pats on the head not like i'm in some beauty contest here about
[3:11:56.960 --> 3:12:02.560]  i'm judging the best beauty here i want somebody to stops the lockdowns stops the poison shots
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:08.160]  goes after big pharma and let me tell you the sanis is doing it yeah yeah yeah definitely he's
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:11.840]  standing up and if trump doesn't come out against the shots and people are going to look at that
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:15.760]  they're going to see through and say okay well there's something going on here uh you know i think
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:19.920]  he did well did really well first but this is oh i mean i love trump that's what's so sad about it
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:24.480]  i appreciate your call and again this is what frustrates me they've had democratic party
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:31.280]  operatives they've had the system they had the trial lawyers in our negotiations for settlement
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:35.280]  in sandy hookah connecticut they didn't even care we said can we say this yeah go ahead and say it
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:39.200]  they said we want you to come out against the second amendment and we will drop these lawsuits
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:48.400]  i said hell no but to them it's like buying and selling souls they think nothing of it like like
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:52.480]  the average leftist wants a job of the government or a job of the corporation for being a dirtback
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:57.520]  i want to promote freedom however i can wherever i can and i fight to do it but they actually think
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:06.240]  like hey what's your price they've come to me the kissager group you know news core roger ailes who
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:11.520]  wasn't as evil as them but like what do you want book deals jobs everything i was off of the deals
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:17.520]  and i'm like i want to stop tyranny i don't want money for money's sake to live in a hellhole country
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:23.040]  sold out to satan i'll take money all day long nice swimming pools everything i'm not against that
[3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:29.760]  stuff but i'm not selling anybody out for it what i want is success and victory for humanity i want
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:35.200]  my grandkids to look back and say that guy stood up to tyranny that guy stood up for freedom we're
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:43.840]  proud of him and nobody remembers the people that suck satans you know what so i'm not some hero in
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:48.880]  this fight that i'm willing to fight these people what they're selling is collapse and death and
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:56.080]  nuclear war i'm into self-preservation that's why people say i'm a hero no i'm not i'm selfish i want

[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:16.240]  world order it's alex jones
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:30.400]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald solente
[3:20:33.280 --> 3:20:40.640]  alex jones show as that cover the trends journal shows that they just set up there
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:47.760]  that was back in two days before russia invaded not not that one the other one you had there with
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:57.200]  the with the bomb uh the um it was two days before russia invaded ukraine our headline was corrupt
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:06.080]  covet war ukraine war world war you know alex said this is a continuation of world war two
[3:21:06.080 --> 3:21:13.200]  now it's we see it as the it's world war three has begun how about you know it it's not going to
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:21.280]  hit the people until there's a nuclear strike or a false flag a very disastrous one it's already
[3:21:21.280 --> 3:21:31.040]  begun as i say over and over again in school they teach you the baloney that um world war one began
[3:21:31.040 --> 3:21:37.520]  when they assassinated the archduke ferdinand and sarajevo oh yeah what that what's an archduke
[3:21:37.520 --> 3:21:44.880]  and who cares about a sarajevo oh and world war two began when japanese bombed pearl harbour
[3:21:44.880 --> 3:21:51.680]  nothing was leading up to it no no no no no it all began in one strike and that's what they're going
[3:21:51.680 --> 3:21:58.640]  to do and there was a guest that alex jones had on you know he very passionately said we have to
[3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:08.000]  educate the people more so we can reverse this i i i respectfully disagree all the information you
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:13.040]  give the people that don't know already is not going to make one bit of difference i used to get
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:18.640]  upset as a kid and my father would say son take it easy you know when people couldn't understand
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:27.280]  what's going on he said people have little minds what we have to do is unite those of us or will
[3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:36.960]  or who already see what's going on and understand the implication you're not going to the fools are
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:46.880]  going to be fools forever so there's that great quote by samuel adams it does not take a majority
[3:22:46.880 --> 3:22:54.400]  to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:23:04.400]  minds of men and that's what we have to do we have to unite and take action it's no it doesn't
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:11.280]  make one bit of difference if you know what's going on and don't do anything to change it and of
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:18.640]  course you know info wars is doing it we're doing it you know we had this big rally over here
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:29.200]  there freedom peace and justice July 23rd scott ridder judge napolitano philgeraldi gary no
[3:23:30.560 --> 3:23:37.520]  you know fighting for peace but that's not not enough we have to really make this thing happen
[3:23:39.280 --> 3:23:44.960]  you know these stupid people that are building bomb shelters oh your life is going to be wonderful
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:50.400]  after the nuclear explosions and you come out of your shelter oh it'll be so much fun out there
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:57.440]  if a nuclear bomb goes off man i want to be right around that thing too i want to go out like dust
[3:23:58.320 --> 3:24:00.960]  you think i want to live in a post nuclear world
[3:24:03.440 --> 3:24:10.800]  everybody gets this in your head the people that are running and ruining our lives are mentally ill

[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:17.040]  ukraine war i want to talk about what's going on in the economy and this is very serious
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:25.920]  the market's opened up today and then it went back down you're looking at the nasdaq now it's
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:33.680]  had a two-year low and this thing's going down big it's going down hard we are going to go into
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:42.080]  the worst financial crisis socioeconomic crisis in modern history and it's global
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:47.440]  and we're doing better than other countries because the dollar is strong
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:52.080]  the only reason the dollar is strong is because the other currencies are so weak because the
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:58.160]  dollar is not worth crap but he has 31 trillion dollars in official debt when you put the real
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:08.640]  numbers in there it's like 200 trillion so this is very serious and you better prepare

[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:23.840]  advice in the trends journal we tell you what's going on what it means and what to do but you
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:30.160]  do what you want to do we don't tell you and to me even though gold prices are going down
[3:37:30.160 --> 3:37:38.880]  down that's the number one the number one safe haven asset silver number two precious of the
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:45.840]  most precious metal because all these currencies aren't worth anything you're looking at the
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:53.040]  indian rupee hitting new low you got you have inflation over there in argentina it's like
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:38:03.360]  about 80 to 100 some ridiculous numb you're looking at the british sterling sterling nothing shiny
[3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:13.280]  about it it recently hit all time low so as we're looking at the markets there's nothing to push them
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:20.560]  up there's a thing called a plunge protection team isn't that a nice name that the white shoe boys

[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:38.480]  let's rig the market and we use the federal reserve to do it this is serious and it's only
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:43.840]  going to get worse you look at oil prices and they're down a little bit today they're around
[3:38:43.840 --> 3:38:51.120]  95 dollars a barrel for Brent brood huh 95 dollars a barrel oh that's all wait till the winter
