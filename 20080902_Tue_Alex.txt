[01:21.000 --> 01:30.800]  Russia the EU says no we're not going to put basically wartime sanctions on Russia now but
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.640]  on the other side there's escalation Russia says US may have sent weapons into Georgia
[01:35.640 --> 01:42.800]  but independent aid groups are reporting that it is US soldiers quote with the aid
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.800]  on areas of Georgia and that it is being used as cover for weapons heels of the New York
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.560]  Times reporting that they're basically privatizing entire cities and handing them over to private
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.080]  interest complete and total fascism global corporatism will be going over that Russia
[01:59.080 --> 02:06.800]  bombers again cloud the skies in Europe's far north big bears coming in big bear bombers
[02:06.800 --> 02:14.760]  Russia state RNC attacks a none and eight others swept into unmarked van is by police
[02:14.760 --> 02:24.440]  of Minnesota democracy now knows Amy Goodman does absolutely nothing with full Crest credentials
[02:24.440 --> 02:32.040]  is violently manhandled to other to Congress now reporters were savagely had their heads
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.560]  bashed into the concrete repeatedly with blood pouring out the police making themselves
[02:36.560 --> 02:49.720]  with like absolute criminals and they didn't act like that in Denver in Denver it was
[02:49.720 --> 02:57.160]  the most restrained I thought I was somewhat back in the USA back in the land of the free
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.720]  they were wearing Darth Vader outfits they were federalized they were a few times arrogant
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.440]  and told us to turn our cameras off we refused and we're not murdered taser to death shotgun
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.440]  to death rubber bullets at close range you know that's happened to others people die
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.800]  in these things but they only menaced us a bit with bloodlust but I mean that's like
[03:16.800 --> 03:25.440]  wonderful freedom land that's like angel land compared to what I have grown accustomed
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.320]  to so they are back at it arresting two hundred and what forty eight people just this morning
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.800]  alone and I've been really checking local news reports talking to people that we know
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.440]  on the ground and basically the anarchists did not break out windows or overturned benches
[03:43.440 --> 03:50.800]  or slash car tires until last night when they broke up from the approved police route in
[03:50.800 --> 03:59.200]  a caged avenue we were part of permitted marches in Denver they would literally lead you down
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.840]  alleyways with no one looking at you so it was pretty bad and the whole point of demonstrating
[04:04.840 --> 04:11.520]  is to be seen we had our free speech zone March but the people try several thousand
[04:11.520 --> 04:18.640]  protesters demonstrators tried to actually walk down a real city street and were savagely
[04:18.640 --> 04:25.000]  viciously attacked by America killing thugs cancer viruses basically and then the anarchists
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.880]  went nuts sort of breaking windows burning things a few trash cans slicing tires and
[04:31.880 --> 04:39.400]  the media superimposed that nationally first as a pretext with the police and to do what
[04:39.400 --> 04:47.840]  they did so they just juxtaposed the fact we'll be right back
[04:47.840 --> 05:11.560]  if you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[05:11.560 --> 05:18.000]  if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the tenth anniversary

[07:56.800 --> 08:09.440]  government comes for us you want answers well so does he
[08:09.440 --> 08:17.920]  he of our interview with the founder of rage against the machine posted four members at
[08:17.920 --> 08:30.440]  presentplanet.tv by this evening also our course the interview our Ralph nader interview
[08:30.440 --> 08:38.320]  and a bunch of others today tomorrow and out into thursday it is tuesday tuesday i think
[08:38.320 --> 08:47.000]  i even said monday earlier it is it is tuesday the second of september 2008 certainly feels
[08:47.000 --> 09:00.840]  like a monday coming off of that long weekend with memorial day but labor day i see i can't
[09:00.840 --> 09:08.880]  even get all of this information straight ladies and gentlemen so much is happening and going
[09:08.880 --> 09:20.160]  on during the breaks here at the studio okay i've got energy news i've got war news i've
[09:20.160 --> 09:31.800]  got police state news i've got so much important information today but since we have um kyle
[09:31.800 --> 09:39.600]  baker and matt and others from iowa we are change there's also other we are change groups
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.840]  up there visiting the genesis studios i thought why not have them in studio right now because
[09:46.840 --> 09:52.600]  they've been some eyewitnesses to the craziness going on up there for the rnc i want to make
[09:52.600 --> 09:58.960]  it clear though the only reason that i'm talking about the rnc is is not because this woman
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.040]  they're now calling a general you can't make this up if they tell the public that they'll
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.760]  believe it this woman you know was she part of the independence party is she a conservative
[10:08.760 --> 10:15.320]  it doesn't matter presidents and vice presidents are puppets the continuity of government system
[10:15.320 --> 10:24.480]  runs the nation for many years and presidents are titular heads are fronts and if the public
[10:24.480 --> 10:28.840]  doesn't figure that out and the public doesn't understand that they do that at their own
[10:28.840 --> 10:34.920]  peril the reason i'm talking about it is because studying it as an event and to watch
[10:34.920 --> 10:41.000]  the people lose their liberties and freedoms to see the police in the executioner uniforms
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.520]  for maximum intimidation which the police admitted for intimidation beating up innocent men women
[10:46.520 --> 10:54.000]  and children taking reporters to jail they've arrested what three a p reporters of democracy
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.640]  now people women with flowers in their hands and the message is being sent you are scum
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.000]  you are slaves you are worthless you work for us the state owns you cattle you will
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.160]  do what you're told when you're told and so that's why we're covering this and reporting
[11:13.160 --> 11:19.640]  on this the sound cannons the microwave guns the secret FEMA camps and if you study the
[11:19.640 --> 11:34.880]  history of revolution if you study how the systems operate
[11:34.880 --> 11:44.360]  and how the state always tries to create large contingents or stratas of enforcers who despise
[11:44.360 --> 11:50.200]  and hate the general public and serve the imperium you see that's what's being set up and built
[11:50.200 --> 12:01.360]  today because in almost every successful revolution and by successful i mean overturning the existing
[12:01.360 --> 12:09.640]  power structure you have the military and police joining in at least to a certain extent
[12:09.640 --> 12:18.320]  with the populace or the peasantry and so that's why they spend so much time brainwashing
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.880]  and dumbing down the military and police that's why they will not hire police over a hundred
[12:22.880 --> 12:33.400]  iq for at least the last twenty years in any major metropolitan department and every time
[12:33.400 --> 12:41.720]  i mention that i get emails and phone calls saying i'm lying just google police hundred
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.160]  iqs or police not hired of over a hundred iq i mean it's hundreds of news stories detroit
[12:47.160 --> 12:57.640]  dc la dallas houston now does that mean there are cops with over a hundred iq that slipped
[12:57.640 --> 13:05.240]  through certainly the point is they're looking for mindless football player types and i'm
[13:05.240 --> 13:10.600]  not saying football players are stupid i'm saying that that cliche they want to be on
[13:10.600 --> 13:17.600]  average six foot one two hundred pound guy who will uh who likes to crack heads and doesn't
[13:17.600 --> 13:24.520]  really know what state he's living in and who likes to go dove hunting on the weekends
[13:24.520 --> 13:36.760]  and who likes to be macho and crack heads because he won't mind to my up a kyle baker
[13:36.760 --> 13:49.400]  and uh man and others uh guys tell us first about yourselves and what you've been witnessing
[13:49.400 --> 14:05.400]  up there in minnesota uh well i i came up here to uh meet up with the uh minnesota
[14:05.400 --> 14:12.680]  uh change guys here to uh just check out the but i must also say that um while we're
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.280]  bullhorning uh along the uh parade route we had some cop cars going by and they're all
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.280]  giving us a thumbs up so that was uh that was kind of a array of light in the darkness
[14:22.280 --> 14:28.120]  if you will but um yeah it was just uh it was just really crazy especially me coming
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.160]  from island kind of a smaller town just i'm not used to seeing that kind of stuff so it's
[14:32.160 --> 14:39.840]  uh yeah the uh i i do have to say that these anarchists though that they uh for all the
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.840]  sheep out there they're really uh doing great work for the new world order to uh legit legitimize
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.160]  a police state due to their actions i i do got to say that it's it's unfortunate but
[14:50.160 --> 14:59.840]  um you know i i really see a lot of people that are awake at at some level uh so again
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.600]  you know we had a lot of people coming up to us and thanking us for what we're doing
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.840]  we uh um we we got to go there's a there was a concert here that had uh artists like uh
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.240]  mostef and tomorillo playing and all that and we had some guys come up to us backstage and
[15:14.880 --> 15:20.880]  and uh thank us for the for the things we're doing i i had to pass them off to the minnesota
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.160]  we are changed because i i can't consider myself a great activist as of yet i don't have a
[15:26.160 --> 15:31.920]  i don't have all the notches on my on my belt that some of these guys do but uh it was uh it
[15:31.920 --> 15:37.760]  was it was just kind of a mind-blowing experience for me being on uh or seeing uh a the police
[15:37.760 --> 15:42.480]  state but also seeing all the people that seem to be awake and uh appreciate what we're doing is
[15:43.440 --> 15:49.920]  um just all kind of in the same bag there so well all i know is i've talked to several people
[15:49.920 --> 15:58.000]  who've talked to um one of the major police chiefs the st paul police chief there in the
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.440]  twin cities and that he said you want to know what real activism is check out we are changed
[16:03.440 --> 16:09.360]  and so you're telling me that where were you when the police were giving your 911 truth
[16:09.360 --> 16:16.240]  signs thumbs up um i'm not sure what what street were on but they had a they had a path set up
[16:16.240 --> 16:26.000]  for uh or for the uh the uh march um they had a preset path for it and uh we're we we kind of
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.760]  were ahead of the march the whole time and we we stopped uh closer to the end where it's coming
[16:31.760 --> 16:39.760]  back to the capitol building and we started to uh bullhorn uh there and there was uh i don't know
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.600]  if they're responding to something else that was going on but they're all uh driving by us with
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.320]  their lights on they weren't going too fast but they're you know they they obviously they knew
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.960]  who we were because they're driving by us and they're smiling at us and giving us a thumbs up and
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.720]  you know i i gotta say it's uh that really uh that really made me feel a lot better about
[16:59.280 --> 17:04.960]  you know well i mean police are are more than anybody like the military are in a gang mentality
[17:04.960 --> 17:10.160]  when they hear the governor saying it's an inside job you know it again it's all about leadership
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.360]  and if their former leader is saying that uh then it starts breaking down that that control
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.240]  paradigm but i've been out in los angeles you know two years ago for the 911 neocons symposium
[17:21.360 --> 17:28.000]  and exposing the neocon agenda 911 exposing the neocon agenda program we had and we had
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.800]  la cops uh that the hotel hired and then we had other la pd police we saw outside and then we had
[17:34.800 --> 17:40.320]  la pd uh detectives that were some of the bodyguards for some of the movie stars and i mean every
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.760]  la pd cop i ran into was we all knew 911 was an inside job day one what are you talking about of
[17:45.760 --> 17:50.880]  course we knew they blew those buildings up we're not stupid what do you think we're dumb uh and i
[17:50.880 --> 17:55.680]  was just like my god i mean there they were just like but it was real matter of fact like what do
[17:55.680 --> 18:03.120]  you think we're stupid and i was like okay okay well fine uh so they certainly know what's going
[18:03.120 --> 18:05.920]  on i've run into a lot of other police that know the truth and i've had a lot of police
[18:05.920 --> 18:12.640]  environment give us the thumbs up the last few years uh in new york city for what's happened
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.760]  there now i want to hold uh kyle and matt over we are changing iow up they're visiting we are
[18:17.760 --> 18:22.400]  changing minnesota because i want to get your witness accounts your eyewitness accounts
[18:23.120 --> 18:32.000]  on uh what you have seen uh going on with the anarchist because what the news we've gotten
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.440]  from other eyewitnesses we've talked to and reading a bunch of the local news but i'm
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.840]  we're still not sure if this is a hundred percent accurate the fog of war as they say the fog of
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.880]  hysteria but basically yesterday you had a couple thousand demonstrators in the approved
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.240]  route some of them broke off in seven different directions is what we're told the police then
[18:52.240 --> 18:57.840]  attacked those seven different groups including amy goodman of democracy now and two of our other
[18:57.840 --> 19:03.600]  reporters who they bloodied they didn't bloody her or she got beat up famously in each team or so
[19:03.600 --> 19:08.320]  she's been through through tyranny and so i want to get to the bottom of this you know we just report
[19:08.320 --> 19:13.840]  the facts i went to denver and the police were behaving themselves doing a professional job
[19:13.840 --> 19:18.480]  for all intents and purposes compared to the demonstrators and so we we said they did a good
[19:18.480 --> 19:23.360]  job we're trying to find out the truth here have you ever felt like the united states government
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.680]  knows way too much about the anarchist because what she's been through through tyranny and so i
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.240]  want to get to the bottom of this you know we just report the facts i went to denver and the police
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.720]  were behaving themselves doing a professional job for all intents and purposes compared to
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.120]  the demonstrators and so we we said they did a good job we're trying to find out the truth here
[19:44.720 --> 19:47.600]  have you ever felt like the united states government knows way too much about your
[19:47.600 --> 19:52.640]  financial affairs i continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen bank accounts
[19:52.640 --> 19:57.280]  confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the u.s citizen will ever again have

[24:58.880 --> 25:08.000]  john harman and i appreciate paul hartman here in the office and also west and everybody else
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.640]  okay uh let me go back to you guys you heard me preface that going into the break uh you're there
[25:14.640 --> 25:21.200]  at the genesis uh brim closet studio tell me uh exactly what you did see with the protesters
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.200]  with the anarchist what transpired that led to the 200 plus arrest and
[25:25.200 --> 25:42.720]  the police basically on complete ravenous power trips like a
[25:42.720 --> 25:53.600]  shark pack having a feeding frenzy yeah yeah um as far as the uh as far as the anarchists are
[25:53.600 --> 25:59.200]  concerned uh you know i just got the general
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.640]  feeling that they were all kind of hyped up
[26:06.640 --> 26:08.640]  up
[26:10.960 --> 26:12.400]  and looking to get
[26:18.240 --> 26:25.520]  get something going now i can't lie as i was waiting to get billy clubbed or something
[26:25.520 --> 26:31.680]  because uh a lot of the cops that were there and and you know all suited up and everything they
[26:31.680 --> 26:41.520]  looked like they were uh they were definitely i will say again like i said that they uh they
[26:41.520 --> 26:46.960]  look like they're uh getting ready to start some trouble from my uh from my perspective but on the
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.920]  other hand too the cops look like uh you know i gotta say when i was when i was ahead of that
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.880]  march i was kind of waiting to get the crap beat out of me i can't lie i was i was waiting to get
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.520]  billy clubbed or something because uh a lot of the cops that were there and and you know all
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.680]  suited up and everything they look like they were uh they were definitely ready to get down
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.400]  that's uh that's for sure so bottom line from what you've seen i understand it's all a limited
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.440]  perspective we're going to get anthony asha and others on today as well to get their perspective
[27:18.320 --> 27:25.840]  bottom line who do you think's behind this or who was instigating this the police or the anarchist
[27:25.840 --> 27:32.720]  well it you know i i think just having the police there in in the presence that they were in um
[27:33.520 --> 27:39.840]  to me it just seems really backwards and it's almost just kind of uh setting up that atmosphere
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.360]  of uh fear and and when you get people like the anarchists that were behaving the way that they
[27:45.360 --> 27:51.040]  did i think that that would provoke them into their mob mentality of well we got to do something
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.120]  or i don't know if you follow with what i'm saying or not no it's basically like a bullfight
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.080]  you stick the bull in there you stick the matador in there you're going to have a fight it's just
[28:00.080 --> 28:06.480]  like you stick two boxers in a ring i agree in the past they'd have the riot cops off to the side
[28:06.480 --> 28:12.560]  or waiting inside their uh you know command bases then they would come out if something happened
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.880]  this does escalate but because of the anarchist not all anarchists the ones that break and burn
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.640]  stuff in the past doing this again it sets the precedent to bring the police in then that escalates
[28:24.640 --> 28:31.200]  the whole paradigm yeah yeah i think i think matt has uh matt my buddy here has something he wanted
[28:31.200 --> 28:37.280]  to add yeah matt tell us your full name hey alex this is matt oh your full name your full name
[28:37.280 --> 28:42.480]  uh matt waltzine by the way okay mr waltzine tell us what you saw well the thing that surprised me
[28:42.480 --> 28:46.640]  the most is i uh we were ahead of the crowd like kyle was saying and there was one point where
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.520]  being ahead of the rally all of a sudden we were surrounded by cops and i mean they were wearing
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.000]  a gas mask they were just ready um ready to take on whatever and uh sorry that's my first time
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.120]  live on the air but i i got highly highly paranoid i've never been put in such a paranoid state in
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.000]  my life i was standing next to a tree to make sure i was out of the way of the cops when they were
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.480]  ready to start bum rushing people i mean just just the overall site and and the way that the cops
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.840]  were being it just it was overwhelming i couldn't i couldn't handle it i mean i was really really
[29:19.840 --> 29:27.440]  starting to freak out so the darth vader outfits were scary yeah i mean you would think that we
[29:27.440 --> 29:33.840]  were at war that's pretty much like i've seen stuff like this in movies but to be there in person
[29:33.840 --> 29:37.680]  to see all these cops and stuff it was well the american people are the enemy of the private
[29:37.680 --> 29:43.040]  banks that have us coming into receivership right now uh matt stay with us we're gonna come back to
[29:43.040 --> 29:51.600]  you and hear the rest of the story on the other side we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:10.960 --> 33:19.040]  okay let's go back to matt and kyle we are change iowa up there for the r and c it just so happens
[33:19.040 --> 33:28.000]  the jenesis network is based in minneapolis st paul suburb burnsville
[33:30.400 --> 33:35.760]  and we are talking to both of them right now specifically break down what happened
[33:36.320 --> 33:41.360]  why were the police charging people why were they pepper spraying why were they tasering
[33:41.360 --> 33:48.320]  why were they firing rubber bullets and exploding uh these uh pepper spray and mace bombs tear gas
[33:48.320 --> 33:54.640]  bombs what initiated that because as far as i can tell i don't just believe one press report
[33:55.200 --> 34:01.280]  i've seen scores and alternative uh live videos that were fed over the web and people
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.000]  uploading to youtube as well i mean i'll host the sources last night and this morning i spent
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.160]  a few hours total trying to figure out exactly what was happening and it looks like well the
[34:12.160 --> 34:17.840]  mainstream news even admits that the police wouldn't let people march where they wanted to go and so
[34:17.840 --> 34:23.760]  then they came in with quote too much force fought here in a free country you could go where you wanted
[34:23.760 --> 34:30.320]  and uh attacked with rubber bullets and and and other quote less lethal devices and that
[34:30.320 --> 34:35.760]  that precipitated uh the quote anarchists to start smashing out windows and slashing tires is that
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.640]  accurate um that's what it would seem like i i uh one thing that um i do want to mention about the
[34:42.640 --> 34:49.040]  march is we came what you do what house set up you came down a couple streets and there was uh
[34:49.040 --> 34:54.240]  like a i don't know it's like a john deere gator that had a had an led display that said follow me
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.960]  so that's what told everyone where to go um now everyone went down a street and one of the things
[35:00.960 --> 35:07.120]  that really i thought was peculiar was that you went down the street and then you made like a u-turn
[35:07.120 --> 35:13.280]  and came back up the same street but you were now in a cage that was it was that it was basically
[35:13.280 --> 35:21.120]  like a standing cage wall or a fence or something that um it kind of boxed everyone in um i don't
[35:21.120 --> 35:25.840]  i don't know what the purpose of that was besides maybe no they led you into a free speech zone the
[35:25.840 --> 35:34.160]  same thing happened to us um what happened next um well it was pretty unevent i mean as far as like
[35:34.160 --> 35:41.920]  like i said we were up ahead of the up ahead of the the herd if you will um so we heard we did hear
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.440]  some uh i don't know if you want to call them flash bangs or anything like that going off uh i do
[35:47.440 --> 35:54.240]  remember where uh before we started to bullhorn people um we're probably about three quarters
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.600]  done with the uh march and all sudden i seen just a a crowd of people just take off running and then
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.400]  i saw some other people coming running back and uh someone had a bunch of white powder on their face
[36:04.960 --> 36:08.240]  um so apparently they got maced or something i don't know what that
[36:09.040 --> 36:16.480]  powder was but they look like they'd seen they'd had better days um so basically you're confirming
[36:16.480 --> 36:25.360]  what the media says is the case now the police basically wouldn't let people go their own way
[36:25.360 --> 36:31.520]  and that's basically protest ending right in denver i was at several demonstrations where it
[36:31.520 --> 36:35.440]  would come to the place it was supposed to be and then people would break off in four or five
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.480]  different directions and the police would ignore it but in the case of minneapolis st paul at the
[36:40.480 --> 36:47.280]  rnc uh that was not acceptable and that's basically the official story i was just trying to see if
[36:47.280 --> 36:55.200]  you could confirm that and so we have to say the police uh acted badly yet again um yeah i i i would
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.960]  say i mean it definitely looks like it was uh set up to be a situation like that i mean it was like
[37:00.960 --> 37:06.720]  you know i obviously they do all these things uh scientifically they they know how to control the
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.360]  herd mentality and all this and really kind of studying this for a while that's really what kind
[37:11.360 --> 37:17.280]  of stood out to me it's just like wow we're walking through a a cage you know that that just seemed
[37:17.280 --> 37:25.120]  uh uh totally uh foreign and communist yeah the message is you can still demonstrate but inside
[37:25.120 --> 37:33.280]  a cage with men in black samurai armor that have deadly weapons and may kill you and so now uh we
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.960]  see anti-war demonstrations i mean let's go back to the start of the gulf war the second round in
[37:38.960 --> 37:45.200]  nineteen uh 91 was the first one the second one was in 2003 now almost six years ago five and a
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.880]  half years ago back then before they really were rolling out all this uh you know less lethal quote
[37:50.880 --> 37:58.640]  truly is lethal systems you would get hundreds of thousands of people out in anti-war marches
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.760]  but the cops beat the hell out of them tasered them uh ran them over with mopeds horses rubber
[38:03.760 --> 38:09.360]  bulleted them in some cases killed people with rubber bullets and so now you go out and there's a
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.440]  few thousand people but only about 45 percent of the population in major polls was against the iraq
[38:17.440 --> 38:25.440]  war in 2003 but millions would come out total hundreds of thousands per demonstration now
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.960]  you've got 80 plus percent against the war but only a few thousand and that's because people are
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.160]  scared and you said matt you were scared and they tell them to sit there and have dirty looks on
[38:36.160 --> 38:44.240]  their faces to not talk to you uh to be on this power trip uh to uh again us against the mentality
[38:44.240 --> 38:52.320]  and so this is all being war gamed in a wider laboratory when the feds admit that this is all
[38:52.320 --> 38:57.760]  being studied as a laboratory on how to control populations and so the cops think that they're
[38:57.760 --> 39:02.160]  quote kicking the butt of the stupid demonstrators remember the famous uh video from miami a few
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.320]  years ago where they're at rubber bulletting and attacking the peaceful crowd just saying you're not
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.280]  allowed to demonstrate period and then that that real estate lady is in the you know red and black
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.280]  suit all clean cut she's got the sign out in front of her face and uh they rubber bullet her in the
[39:17.280 --> 39:22.480]  face and bloody her face and then it shows the commander later going man i loved how you shot
[39:22.480 --> 39:27.680]  that dumb bitch in the face uh you know but that was really funny and they all laugh see but it's
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.160]  going to be funny when you lose your house it's going to be funny when your grandma loses their
[39:32.160 --> 39:37.520]  house it's going to be funny when the dollar is totally debased it's going to be funny if we go
[39:37.520 --> 39:42.800]  into a nuclear war with russia it's going to be funny as you're going to be slaves to do you
[39:42.800 --> 39:49.200]  understand rubber bulletting a peaceful woman in the face isn't funny comments on that matt and
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.200]  kyle well i want to say first of the cops that do this it's just like okay well let's say that
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.480]  they're uh let's say that their grandma is out shopping in somewhere where a press is you know
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.520]  protests is going on they just happen to be in the vicinity what happens if some other cop in
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.600]  some other town blast their grandma in the face what are they going to get mad about it i mean
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.720]  seriously it's they're not going to get mad ridiculous they don't even know their grandma
[40:14.720 --> 40:18.880]  and as soon as they came they're going to stick her in a nursing home to get her money so yeah
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.920]  you maybe maybe they'd ask the cops to kill their grandmother yeah you're probably right i there is
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.560]  one other observation that um i think may be important you'd be a better judge of this than i
[40:28.560 --> 40:35.840]  but i noticed that there was some press that had gas masks with them they were carrying gas masks
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.400]  with them so they must have thought that people are going to be getting gassed um i i thought that
[40:40.400 --> 40:45.680]  was a little bit odd why the why uh uh official looking media types and i'm not sure what news
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.080]  organization they were they were with i just noticed that there was some guys you know in
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.240]  in a monkey suit well they've been they've been taking those with them since 99 in seattle with
[40:54.240 --> 41:01.520]  that staged event but see after you stage a few events it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.480]  the feds have been caught staging it they've been caught staging in the us canada england
[41:06.480 --> 41:13.760]  australia idly but now it doesn't matter whether it's the united states or russia the same brand
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.240]  of tyranny's coming out where they go after protesters in every case um i do want to say
[41:20.240 --> 41:28.080]  this to i said this to you uh uh off air but um just for the for the listeners uh oh oh gosh i
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.760]  forget his name all of a sudden i want to say it's adam from denver we are changed um he actually
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.200]  came up and there might be a really good fox news interview with him um because he got in a real a
[41:39.200 --> 41:44.720]  lot of really good points it was the same guy that uh all the anarchists were cussing at uh at the
[41:44.720 --> 41:52.000]  dnc uh coincidentally but um uh oh wow i just forgot what point the same fox news reporter
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.720]  that had all the anarchist screaming and cussing and dropping him off interviewed we are changed
[41:56.720 --> 42:01.200]  colorado yep yep and uh he got in a really good interview i mean i don't know how they're going to
[42:01.200 --> 42:06.320]  be able to cut it up and mash it up to make him look uh stupid but i think it's going to be a
[42:06.320 --> 42:11.920]  a difficult task so we'll see i know i did see one other guy taping it so maybe we'll get lucky
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.520]  and see it on uh see that on youtube hopefully what are you guys mainly doing while you're out there
[42:17.520 --> 42:22.960]  um well we uh you know we came up and that was pretty much the first thing we did besides to
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.920]  get a bite to eat was go right to the protest and it was just kind of um you know it was just kind
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.440]  of a learning experience for me you know getting to see all the you know the minnesota we are changed
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.880]  guys you know i i guess i kind of look at him like uh veterans as far as activism going on so
[42:40.880 --> 42:46.080]  i'll just kind of sit back and uh taking everything in i was just really in awe i i i do want to say
[42:46.080 --> 42:52.080]  also that it was at the rally there's just so many it just seemed like there's everyone was against
[42:52.080 --> 42:58.800]  the war like i hardly saw anyone there who was even for it it was just like you would think that
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.680]  you know i well you say that i heard you mentioned that you know 80 90 percent of the people are
[43:03.680 --> 43:08.640]  against the war um after what i've seen today i would definitely believe that that's that's uh
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.840]  for sure i just one thing i wish is just if everyone would be kind of on the same page um
[43:13.840 --> 43:20.080]  you know like all the like all the uh all the uh obama it's which blows my mind that they're even
[43:20.080 --> 43:25.280]  formed considering he voted for the war and their anti-war but and for warrantless wire
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.880]  yeah no no one ever accused them of uh thinking they don't even know what change means i hear you
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.360]  guys i appreciate you spending time with us today and pop back in with us if you've seen

[43:57.280 --> 44:04.400]  i could have done that sunday but there were so many new big important developments concerning
[44:04.400 --> 44:12.800]  russian e u u s global relations that i had uh richard c cook and dr paul craig roberts on sunday
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.280]  will also take a lot of your phone calls today i uh was meaning to come back in the second
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.360]  segment of the show and talk about what i'd witnessed uh via television because i'm not
[44:25.360 --> 44:30.800]  there i'm back in austin texas with my family but what i'd witnessed over uh the computer and
[44:30.800 --> 44:36.400]  over television in minneapolis st paul for the rnc and then since there was some uh we are change
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.120]  guys up there visiting in studio i thought we'd have them on we did have them on for about 30 minutes
[44:43.200 --> 44:49.360]  we have micro vero joining us in about 15 and uh we're going to open the phones up later in the
[44:49.360 --> 44:55.520]  next hour on any issue you want to talk about the anthrax case which even the mainstream media
[44:55.520 --> 45:02.160]  has said is a cover up uh the russia situation that's deteriorating some good signs but more bad
[45:02.160 --> 45:09.600]  signs good signs the e u is not putting grievous sanctions on russia that would truly escalate
[45:09.600 --> 45:16.640]  things bad because the u s is shipping in more weapons into george and the george and president
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.400]  chas vealy has said that he's planning to launch another attack into oseti and abkhazia
[45:20.960 --> 45:30.800]  it's amazing provocations uh we also have a lot of medical news here last week i guess it was uh
[45:32.880 --> 45:40.480]  last sunday show i know it was over a week ago i just mentioned a reuters report
[45:40.480 --> 45:50.800]  report medical study major medical study double blind medical study of vaccines being
[45:50.800 --> 46:05.120]  seriously associated with diabetes and i have really spent time studying this because so many
[46:05.120 --> 46:14.800]  people i know have diabetes one in three if you happen to be quote hispanic it's one in five if
[46:14.800 --> 46:24.320]  you're anglo or black one in three particularly affects the genetic makeup of hispanics for some
[46:24.320 --> 46:32.480]  reason with their pancreas and their metabolic system but hell one in five is pretty bad for
[46:32.480 --> 46:39.200]  the gringos but it is a scourge a scourge and i drive up and down the roads here in austin
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.960]  south lamar south congress i see amputees and wheelchairs everywhere i'll be walking in a store
[46:44.960 --> 46:50.560]  and see some amputee going in and well you know with fresh knobs feel fresh bandages and i'll say
[46:50.560 --> 47:04.000]  are you diabetic no go yeah and uh people say people email me and say oh you know you claim
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.720]  it's giving people diabetes no the medical reports are and so this morning i just googled
[47:12.000 --> 47:20.160]  diabetes vaccines and thousands of mainstream articles and studies popped up and i i am just
[47:20.160 --> 47:28.400]  four of those to curtain mo and steve watson and paul watson that's all i had time to do was was
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.640]  grab four of them from roiders and the and the british medical journal and stuff going back
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.120]  eight nine years i mean i didn't just run into roiders a week and a half ago i ran into all
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.360]  the others and it was like every vaccine you know hepatitis shot the hepatitis vaccine the
[47:45.360 --> 47:53.520]  hp v shot is the newest one and it causes a inflammatory response in the pancreas
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.440]  and it fries your pancreas and then you get
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.760]  diabetes and then you die and you go blind you run off the highway your life is hellish
[48:10.320 --> 48:13.920]  and sure you can quit eating as much sugar and try to control it but it still is going to take
[48:13.920 --> 48:21.600]  a lot of years off your life uh vaccines are a scourge crone's disease is a covered name for
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.840]  thousands of different reactions with vaccines that's been proven in thousands of studies absolute
[48:27.840 --> 48:37.120]  fact uh autism from one in 25 000 two decades ago to one in 60 one in 86
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.000]  that's right from um
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.720]  from one in 168 to one in 86 you'll just pull those numbers up for yourself that's official
[48:52.720 --> 48:59.760]  government numbers we have scourges all around us the gmo is doing the same thing
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.600]  we've also caught the globalist where they'll put multiple things into the food chain knowing
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.200]  that they'll combine and have that effect i was on the stair step for yesterday for like an hour
[49:11.200 --> 49:18.560]  watching cable and i was watching uh i watched an hour of batman returns or the first batman movie
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.560]  that came out in the early 90s and i turned it on i'm flipping through the channels
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.560]  only time i watch entertainment tv is when i'm working out and i'm flipping through
[49:30.400 --> 49:35.040]  and it's the penguin and he's got this other crime boss getting him to run for mayor and he
[49:35.040 --> 49:40.960]  says we got a stage terror attacks like the gulf of tonka and a rise tag and so the penguin has
[49:40.960 --> 49:46.880]  his men go out and blow up buildings and then they blame it on the mayor and batman and of course
[49:46.880 --> 49:58.400]  the public budget and then there's another part of the movie where they have multiple cosmetics
[49:58.400 --> 50:05.840]  and multiple cosmetics that you then mix together that makes the people have the illness that then
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.640]  the drug company sells you i mean they love throwing this in our face i mean i can't even
[50:11.440 --> 50:20.800]  turn on hbo on the stair stepper it's just everywhere now you can say is that movie trying
[50:20.800 --> 50:28.960]  to warn you but those hollywood people trying to show you that they're on the inside uh is it
[50:28.960 --> 50:32.560]  conditioning sometimes it's it's either or sometimes it's both
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.080]  point is this isn't a batman movie you give your child those shots
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.560]  they're filled with cancer viruses mercury and they attack every gland and organ in the body
[50:46.560 --> 50:53.920]  i mean you want a brain tumor you want to die go ahead and take it keep laughing you too cops keep

[55:19.280 --> 55:24.240]  link to pancreatics pancreotis
[55:27.920 --> 55:33.120]  we see if you posted all three or all four of them it doesn't matter the point is
[55:35.280 --> 55:42.480]  every vaccine in double blind studies where it has been studied for an increase in
[55:42.480 --> 55:52.400]  and diabetes there is one just like there are tens of thousands of studies because they've
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.040]  been doing studies on it for over a hundred years because naturally occurring sodium and
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.520]  stannous fluoride along with calcium fluoride would get into water supplies and well supplies
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.520]  and they would wander in towns in china and russia and the united states and england
[56:07.520 --> 56:14.640]  and all over the planet why half the children would be brain damaged or why everybody was
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.640]  getting bone cancer or dying or being mentally retarded and they found out real fast over 100
[56:20.640 --> 56:31.120]  years ago that any type of fluoride but especially sodium in levels higher than a few parts per
[56:31.120 --> 56:40.000]  billion attacks every gland and every bone in your body and the russians by the 30s in their
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  work camps learned how to put it in the water to make people be docile that's a Pulitzer prize
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.960]  winning books then the germans picked it up in the 40s and there's a Pulitzer prize winning book
[56:50.960 --> 56:57.680]  in world war two that covers it and guess what happened by 1950 we had the national security
[56:57.680 --> 57:02.320]  state set up at 47 and the feds came in with multi-million dollar programs and said put this
[57:02.320 --> 57:08.560]  in your water and congressman came out and read the wartime reports on the nazis using it and
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.440]  the media would laugh at them and call them cooks and they put it in the water and america stopped
[57:13.440 --> 57:20.800]  caring but america also started learning how to bury their boys at hundreds of times the previous
[57:20.800 --> 57:29.040]  frequency for rare bone tumors bone cancer which of course just type in fluoride bone cancer and
[57:29.040 --> 57:36.080]  you will read thousands of studies on that alone i mean is it fun sticking your boy in the ground
[57:37.040 --> 57:43.040]  is it like a goody goody gun drop for you or something you sick freaks out there but i understand
[57:43.040 --> 57:49.760]  you have to continue to say i'm lying you have to continue to deny what i'm saying is true
[57:52.480 --> 57:53.840]  you have to continue
[57:58.080 --> 58:03.440]  to say i'm making this stuff up because if you admit what i'm saying is true or if you even
[58:03.440 --> 58:09.280]  look into it it's going to get scary isn't it to find out i'm telling the truth to find out it's not
[58:09.280 --> 58:16.400]  made up so
[58:19.680 --> 58:28.000]  maybe just maybe you'll just still call me a piece of film a piece of trash but at least
[58:28.720 --> 58:34.880]  don't look into what i'm claiming and what i'm saying please i'm begging you please do your own

[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:14.640]  on wbap he fills in for rush limbaugh saying i said killer just making me suing these guys get
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:21.040]  an eye get a get a view of invincibility see i have the opposite view i know how weak i am and
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:27.440]  how human and moral i am and i'm looking at myself in a camera shot right now and we go
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:32.560]  live later on prison planet dot tv and i just look like hell i know this body will fail
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:38.080]  i wonder how some people get more power and they become more humble
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:42.880]  and then other people get a little bit of power and just become power mad

[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:31.920]  videos and have them do that first because i'm still having to explain to people that this
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:39.360]  was a setup and i'll i'll i'll do that later it's just is there nothing we can't be made to believe

[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.760]  going on let me just ask you on air what do you want to get into right now the latest russian
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:08.160]  developments the latest economic developments it's all intertwined uh the new vp pic uh that we've
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:14.000]  got here uh which i have to say actually has some good stuff in her pedigree independence party in
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.240]  alaska um apac doesn't like her that's a big plus but it doesn't matter we know mckayne's
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:26.160]  pure evil so he's just picking her for a fresh face we've also got the police going hog wild
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:31.680]  in i mean the apple of st paul but not in denver you know that's kind of the field out there the
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:38.720]  latest anthrax info which are really on top of uh the only time in 200 plus years the sun has been
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  spotless uh now the environmentalists are saying we need a global tax to stop freezing knowing the
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:50.320]  idiot public doesn't remember last week when they said it was heating i mean i mean that's kind of
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:55.040]  the field what do you want to cover first mike well there is so much going on there and uh perhaps
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.560]  we should start with the the last one first because that's that's a fairly short issue uh yeah it's
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:05.440]  basically the classic government pattern of creating a problem and then selling the solution to it
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:09.440]  whether it's global warming will sell you a solution to that global cooling will sell you a solution
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:13.920]  to that the sky is falling will sell you a solution to that the sun doesn't have any spots will
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:18.880]  sell you a solution to that and it just goes on and on and on because government really has run out
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:24.960]  of useful things they can sell to the taxpayers so now it survives by creating problems that we
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:32.880]  have to deal with uh one recent example of course is the no fly list which we know has 99.99999 percent
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:38.400]  you know uh false positive names on there very few real terrorists on the name on the list but
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:42.320]  once you're on there it makes it very difficult to travel the courts have now ruled you can have
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:48.560]  your name removed from that list but you must hire a lawyer to do it and so this whole no fly
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.600]  listing that was supposed to be saving us some terrorists has turned into a jobs program for
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  lawyers and and they're saying but if you do trusted traveler and go through our system we will
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:06.320]  certify you and so you waive your rights to something even more uh intrusive so so basically
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:11.680]  now you need a background check and be government certified to be able to travel and i saw governor
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:15.600]  reg when he was head of homeland security say on c span then it's going to be government certified
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:20.880]  to have a job so it's going to be a new class certification that doesn't even have criminal
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:27.040]  material in it it's just can you get a certification from the government yeah it really is that and
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:31.120]  it's very dangerous and it's tied in with this national id and they're they're trying to sell
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:36.400]  it as the cure for for illegal aliens but the bottom line is as we have learned with the military
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:41.680]  records that follow our soldiers after they uh sever from military service there are codes in
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:47.520]  there about personal behavior that have a direct impact on whether or not you are able to get a
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:53.040]  job in the future and i don't know about you i don't want the government basically keeping
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:57.520]  a permanent record on things i did as a teenager that are going to affect whether or not i can
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:02.800]  get a job here now that i'm fifty well i've had a lot of these cronies who have blogs and websites
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:06.880]  who are former government staffers or military people and they've point blank i've been in
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:11.040]  events they've said yeah jones i know the system's evil and that's why i serve it and you're gonna
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.080]  end up going to a camp you a man american bastard so it's like double think they admit it's evil
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:21.360]  and tyrannical but laugh and say i'm part of it i'm part of the structure and you're an american
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:26.240]  i mean these are really because they know they're being tracked and traced and they love it being on
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:30.960]  their record that they're an evil piece of crap well you know it's basically i'm on the winning
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:35.120]  team and that's all that really matters and unfortunately of course that's how hitler suckered
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:39.680]  in a lot of germany's infrastructure to support him you know he we're not doing things that are
[1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:43.600]  necessarily ethically or morally right but we're going to be the winning team and we've got the
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:48.240]  cool uniforms and badges and stuff so sign up with us and you'll look really cool to your neighbors
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:53.760]  which worked for a while but of course it never lasts for very very long um now getting on to
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:59.840]  sarah paleon this is this is turning into a major embarrassment for the mccain campaign
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.600]  because you know my understanding is that mccain was still pushing for joe Lieberman
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.160]  up to just about a week ago and the gp leadership said we're not going to go with
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:15.520]  joe Lieberman the israeli aspect of it and the fact that he switched parties are both negatives
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:21.280]  that are going to really work and by the way that's not your opinion the jerusalem post ynet news
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:26.640]  they're basically now saying that john mccain's and annie semi because he didn't let israel
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:33.920]  basically be the vice president yeah that's basically it so now uh you know we uh mccain
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:39.680]  seems to have picked sarah paleon in a moment of peak uh you know uh his famous anger coming back
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:44.640]  and saying well if i can't have joe i'm going to go with the hot babe up in alaska and he justified
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:48.480]  it saying we're going to get all those disaffected hillary voters who thought hillary should be the
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:54.160]  vp well now we've got a woman vp and they'll come over to us unfortunately he could not have picked
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:14:00.560]  a more self-destructive choice to try and woo the disaffected hillary voters than an ex-beauty queen
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.880]  you know who basically uh you know she's got so much uh a baggage she's carrying in this trooper
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:12.160]  gate which is the really big scandal because it proves that she is willing to use her political
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:18.720]  power for personal petty vindictiveness and you know that's okay for small town politics
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:24.160]  but we cannot afford to have that on the national stage but that fits right in with mccain's demo
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:29.520]  yeah it it may but you know the voters are not going to go for that because we've seen
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:34.320]  eight years of bush and cheney using their political power i mean we saw the last vice
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:39.760]  president shoot a guy with a shotgun and then force the shooting victim to apologize on tv
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:45.760]  we don't need another vice president with that kind of godlike delusions of power yeah
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:52.000]  and uh and really for for for this woman to come on to the ticket and i think mccain really
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:58.880]  created himself with women voters and he really created himself you know with with this uh situation
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:03.520]  with trooper gate have you seen them try to spend for honesty hey mike have you seen them try to
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:08.240]  spin that she's really a general have you seen that new headline they're going well she's really a
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:14.000]  general because she commanded the national guard and she's been to iraq have you have you seen that
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.120]  well they're calling oh yeah and they're trying so hard to pop her up because there's so much negative
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:27.360]  stuff coming about uh coming up about her uh you know this this latest spin on the the baby issue
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:32.640]  that her daughter is pregnant now instead of having been pregnant last year you know it is
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.120]  obviously an attempt to obfuscate a question uh an issue that raises a lot of questions
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:42.720]  and in my perspective is you know i agree with obama we we don't go after the children but this
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:50.480]  issue of the pregnancy calls into question uh serapelon's character and together with trooper
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:55.520]  gate you know we have to ask some very difficult questions about this new candidate and remember
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:01.680]  in this post iraq war when we the people know the government lies to us all the time the burden of
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:07.520]  proof is on anybody seeking office to prove they are honest and trustworthy and serapelon fails to
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:14.640]  come up to that measure but compared to joe biden corruption and and uh again i'm not weighing in
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:20.320]  for either one of them but while we're analyzing these puppets i mean sure she's got some skeletons
[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:26.240]  in the old closet but joe biden is the king daddy of corruption and back room smoky room deals and
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:32.800]  you've got all these communist sympathizers and and land scams and weathermen running around in
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.560]  the background of obama's past and then you've got mccain the keating five and the mob boss wife and
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:44.800]  the i mean it's just all about your crooks and so her there there is nobody in the race that is
[1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:50.480]  really an honorable person uh but you know it's once again we're faced with having to pick the
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:55.360]  lesser of two evils and it's a darn stupid way to run a country if you ask me
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:01.120]  me well what about some of the positives that she was part of the constant uh the independence party
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:06.720]  to you know get out of the united states and set up their own country up there i like that
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:12.320]  and i like that party itself their anti-neural order folks she's she's been pro-bucannon
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:18.320]  in the past showing that she's not pro-war and currently she is uh i mean i'm i'm not right
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:23.520]  right there is the issue she flips and flops a lot and we're seeing a lot of indications that she
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:29.440]  will get involved in movements and issues uh basically to suit her own political expediency
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:34.160]  at the time and it's not a matter of deep commitment the the bridge to nowhere project she was on both
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:38.960]  sides of that no she was forwarded first and then against it and and then against it and
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:42.880]  there have been a lot of issues like that she basically she's she's a politician she sees
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:47.760]  which way the majority of people are going that's what she's going to do and you know this is a
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:52.880]  person who is operating on a basis of a political expediency rather than showing any kind of
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:58.480]  true leadership and now we have this issue where people are now realizing that uh in her governor's
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:03.760]  office she had a flag of israel and so these ideas that she was not a friend of israel and
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:09.120]  that she was uh uh the alternative to joe Lieberman for that very reason that's gone out the window
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.840]  oh you think that's some type of elaborate this info because the military and america people
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:18.400]  are worried about too big of an israeli influence kind of like the red red menace now the israeli
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.240]  menace you're saying that that that that that whole thing with attacks in the in jerusalem post
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:32.080]  and harrotson and winet may may just be me thinks you protest too much or yeah i think it may well
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:37.520]  be the bottom line is that israel and apac like to have candidates on all sides of the contest
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:42.480]  so it doesn't matter who the voters vote for israel will still win and i think one of the
[1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:47.360]  reasons they're afraid of obama is that even though as he moves center he makes all the correct
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.920]  political statements about support for israel and and uh reining in iran and everything
[1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:57.840]  but i think careful analysis has concluded that uh whereas both candidates are saying the same thing
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:03.600]  mccain would actually be enthusiastic about it and obama considerably less so okay it's a very
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:10.480]  okay because that's what i'm hearing from paul craig roberts and richard c cook and yourself
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:17.280]  and so many others that i really respect are saying obama is better i just can't make myself
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:23.040]  wade in again and pull a lever for two parties i know we're bought and paid for in all part of a
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:29.520]  one-party dictatorship when we come back mike a am i right in saying you're saying lesser of two
[1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:36.560]  weevils uh barack obama joe biden and if i am correct in in that that's what you're saying tell
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:42.400]  me why you're saying looking at the subtleties tell us those subtleties on the other side he's a
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:48.240]  great political mind he's my mother's favorite person we have on air she listens in austin
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:56.320]  mommy my wife likes listening to him too so uh that's what we've got in here micro vero stay with us

[1:23:54.480 --> 1:24:11.680]  99 88 today
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:24.000]  we are
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:33.200]  examining the produce here looking at joe biden prepared to
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:40.320]  do john mccain's a little sweetheart
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.320]  micro vero um are you saying that you think the
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:58.320]  obama ticket is better than the mccain ticket um marginally i believe that it is now i understand
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:05.440]  your concerns about biden and i share them um but obama is a young man and absent an act of
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:10.800]  violence biden is not going to get into that oval office with the mccain ticket with his health
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:16.560]  situations i mean we have to judge sarah paleon not just as a potential uh vice president but as a
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:22.000]  potential president as well and and that is where the hair really goes up on the back of my neck
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.160]  now before we went to the break you were talking about how the members of your family
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:33.120]  like to listen to barack obama and in this he no i was saying listen to you oh oh me
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:38.320]  well i'm not i was saying i i was saying we've got mike revero here because my whole family
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:43.520]  says we love it when you have mike revero and my uncle says it my wife my mom i'm saying i'm
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:48.160]  just saying my family because it's about all i hang out with is my family i'm just saying
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:52.720]  they all like you mike but go ahead okay good well tell them all the checks are in the mail
[1:25:52.720 --> 1:26:00.160]  so anyway getting back to barack obama one thing that he had that i see as a plus right now are
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:05.280]  i guess as you are well aware our nation is in such serious trouble it is just amazing
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:10.320]  and i i think mccain being bush like people are seeing him as you know more the same
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:16.240]  and it's very discouraging if mccain wins we really cannot expect to see much in the way of
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  change and with barack obama the one thing that he does when he speaks he has the ability
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:30.320]  to make people feel that change is possible and right now that is something that has to
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:36.320]  happen so you're saying you're saying things are so bad you you want a puppet that that people
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:40.880]  can actually believe in because we have nothing left i mean that is really what i'm what i'm
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:45.760]  saying is we're not going to get any change at all unless the american people feel it's possible
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:51.120]  and from there are are willing to move to make it happen i think if mccain gets in we're going to
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.080]  see this nation just drift into this incredible torpor where everybody's going to think things
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.080]  are so screwed up and there's no chance of making it any better that we're going to see ourselves
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.400]  become like the soviet union was just before it's collapsed yeah but i think that's good and
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:09.440]  nobody's trying mike i'm not weighing on either side because i can't morally make a decision here
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:15.280]  but i understand that the the perspective you've got but but what if it's evil leadership and and
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.920]  because it visually looks like change they'll be able to fool people into greater levels of tyranny
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.280]  and every indicator is the baton is going to be passed flawlessly from the shadow government of
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:34.560]  george w bush to the camp that controls obama and so i really don't don't see any difference
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:39.200]  there and i say worse is better you're always saying that make a dictator act like a dictator
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:43.840]  why not uh go ahead and and and totally discredit the government i mean don't we want this to be
[1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:50.560]  brought down not continue well no i i i agree with you but it's a question of timing and i'll
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:57.360]  i mean looking at november okay absent a violent revolution we're going to be choosing between
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:02.880]  mccain and obama and i will agree that the the difference between them it seems less and less
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:08.240]  as time goes on you're saying this is an academic analysis well it's more of an academic analysis
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:12.160]  because i don't think the american people are ready for a violent revolution and i'm i'm not
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:18.720]  going to cheer one on just yet uh so if we set that aside if we set the possibility of violent
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:24.240]  change aside and i know the ron paul people are going to hate me for this and i wish he had a
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:29.680]  chance at the white house but practically he does not so we have to decide if we're going to go with
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:34.320]  barack obama or with john mccain now if you want to go with john mccain because you think it'll
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.280]  bring down about the demise of our current government that much faster i understand that point
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.240]  and there is merit in there um but i'm also looking at the point of view of your ordinary
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.800]  average working class american who's trying to find a way out of this mess that we're in
[1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:54.720]  without you know being willing to take up arms at this point and uh i i think if you're in that
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:29:00.720]  kind of a context you know obama again it's a marginal thing it is only a small you know a
[1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:04.640]  marginal difference but now i see what you're saying i mean the whole system is in danger of
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:11.040]  completely collapsing so we don't love the building we're in but but we don't want to fall on top of
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:17.680]  us so you're saying you think uh barack obama might buy us some time before the before the whole
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:22.640]  structure collapses i think obama can pull us back a little bit from the edge of the cliff
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:28.400]  and mccain i think is going to drive us right over okay well we'll flesh that out with any
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:32.640]  other comments you've got on that subject then the russian developments some good stuff and some
[1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:38.960]  bad stuff dealing with escalation has happened the economy anthrax michelle malkin i'm gonna talk a
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:43.520]  little bit about that i haven't talked about that since i got back microveros are guest your calls

[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:22.800]  more to cover uh let's get into uh russia right now or or do you want to first talk about the
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:31.120]  protests since that in a way is connected uh kind of an as an addendum to our discussion of barack
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:36.640]  obama and uh john mccain and and those two camps yeah let's go ahead and get into the
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:41.840]  demonstrations and the police response from denver versus what happened or and is happening in
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:47.760]  minneapolis st paul then we'll get into russia and then the economy well my observation about the
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:53.760]  protests in the the the two cities i am of the opinion that what you experienced in denver
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:00.880]  and we all know it was a setup it was a staged provocation to try and kick up a fuss i i am of
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:08.000]  the opinion that the recreate 68 and other groups like them we're trying to get a violent uh
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:14.960]  reaction going to the democratic convention uh basically to set the stage for what is happening
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:20.880]  at the g.o.p convention now so that when we see these police state tactics going on in minneapolis
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.280]  they can say well look we had to do the same thing down in denver with the democrats that
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:30.480]  failed to materialize all these groups that were trying to get violent protesters going against the
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:36.320]  democratic convention they failed to get any traction and uh as a result i mean when we saw
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:42.080]  the wide views of the so-called protesters in front of the democratic uh convention it was
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.960]  really not a very very large crowd at all and there were very few incidents down there and as
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:51.840]  you yourself experienced the incidents were being manufactured they were trying to provoke a
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:56.400]  confrontation to make an issue that they could basically take to the media and say oh look at
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:01.280]  those the democratic protesters blah blah blah blah so that when we get into this week they can
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:06.240]  say well the republican protesters it's just more of the same instead of course we have you know
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.280]  some very well organized and very sincere uh protest against the g.o.p party mostly it's
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.000]  against the war is what it's really about it's not really all that partisan but it's against
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:21.840]  the war and it's against the people that are seen as supporting the war and urging for more war
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.160]  and already we're seeing all these police tactics people are getting arrested amy goodman got harassed
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  and it's the same story it's the same story we have the anarchist breaking off to go in their own
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:37.600]  direction and it sounds legitimate hey you shouldn't have to stay in these cages and then the police
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:45.840]  attack them and then attack ap reporters amy goodman democracy now go out of their way uh yeah
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:51.040]  they go out of their way to go after mainline groups i mean do you think the police are part
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:57.200]  of this or are they being played oh i it's a combination of the two because remember the fbi
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:02.160]  not only has informants inside college campuses and protest groups they have informants inside
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:07.520]  police departments and tv shows and you know large companies uh you know the network is all
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.120]  pervasive and yes they will there will be people uh you know i uh i'm back in los angeles i mean
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:19.200]  some people who were police officers who had links you know to the cia and they would be in there
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:23.760]  urging the police departments to basically go in the direction the cia wanted and the the people
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:27.840]  who are not part of the intelligence network didn't understand why they were going a particular
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:32.560]  direction but orders or orders or orders so yes the police are being put into play for political
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:38.960]  purposes and a clear indicator of that is the so-called probable cause hold which is a way to
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.320]  be able to grab people and lock them up for 36 hours without uh without actually charging them
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:49.680]  with anything and basically gets them away from whatever uh wherever the news camera yeah that's
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:54.080]  a violation that's kidnapping now that's that that's false imprisonment but they've now given
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:59.520]  it a nice little term yeah they have and they've made it legal to do uh and and it's all part of
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.240]  this whole patriot act situation where the government can now grab you and lock you up
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:08.720]  without a trial and and basically throw away the key and if that is not an indicator that
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.200]  we are in a dictatorship now i don't know what is and by the way in 36 hours they can extract
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:19.520]  whatever type of confession they want yeah absolutely i mean uh i don't think they're
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:25.680]  waterboarding any anybody up there in minneapolis but in a hypothetical it sets the precedent yeah
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:31.280]  it sets the precedent and there are all kinds of coercive tactics you know they could cage you a
[1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:34.960]  couple of times and after that you know you're going to get well just looking at a battery
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:39.760]  well what they did in denver and and and this has been confirmed out of that little secret prison
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:44.000]  that we went out and covered is they would tell them you're being charged with felonies
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:49.040]  unless you plead guilty and bond out yourself and so they were playing that trick on them so
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:54.640]  that's a form of psychological warfare yeah it absolutely is plus what it does is it it plants
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:00.640]  a police record on these uh uh people who haven't actually done anything wrong by tricking them into
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:05.680]  pleading guilty i mean the fbi is known for all kinds of coercive tactics where they'll they'll
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:09.920]  put you in a room full of photos of bloody bodies and said you're you're your associates you're
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:14.320]  doing this and you've got to testify against them and we saw all kinds of stuff like that down at
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.440]  the oklahoma city bombing where they were basically just you know locking tim mcvay's family in these
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:24.400]  rooms with all these pictures of the bloody bodies and saying you know tim did it tim did it tim did
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.240]  it you know you've got to go out there and tell the media that you're really sorry your brother
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:37.280]  did this and just all kinds of uh uh tactics like that amazing or the fbi asking um the
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:42.640]  dividends that they had fire extinguishers and say we'll get ready for a fire just openly letting
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.200]  them know they were going to murder them uh it really takes a cold heart to kill those children
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:52.880]  but i guess being the winners all that matters being on the winning team absolutely and asking
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:57.360]  the branch dividends if they had fire extinguishers was a good way to get the word fire on the bug
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:03.360]  tapes by the branch dividends for later on editing because then they'd say well no there's not going
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:07.840]  to be a fire why are you saying that and then you hear them splice the same and then that they've
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:15.680]  done the audio test folks that's right they then can take that and splice it in very very nice i
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:19.600]  wonder how those guys enjoy murdering little children i guess it's all part of being tougher
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:24.160]  well you know there was this interesting video that came out of one of the weiko
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:30.880]  documentaries where the the guys in the just had a real good time toast on those people
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:35.840]  there are you know there are a certain mindset of people who can do that kind of thing easily
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:41.520]  and governments are always going to find and recruit them uh to do their dirty work and
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:45.840]  unfortunately they're they're not somebody i'd want to ever have in my house but they do exist
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.480]  in our society the government gets them and encourages them and says yes there's a good guy
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:54.320]  and there's the bad guys and the bad guys can look like children but they're still bad guys
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.680]  and you go kill them and god will love you and the president will pin medals on you
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:01.440]  and a lot of these psychos actually believe they're good guys
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:09.600]  they don't see themselves as villains they're fighting in a noble cause or even worse and we've
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:13.920]  we've got this thing that george bush started god told me to go invade iraq and they're trying
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:18.080]  really hard to say this is all god's will that we're doing all this stuff i just put up a story
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:24.160]  on my website about 10 minutes ago where sarah palin in talking to the church where she attended
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:30.320]  church called iraq god's will and said it's a mess ionic mission that we go over and we carry out
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:35.440]  god's will in iraq and you know this this is dangerous when you have these people you know
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:40.000]  with their fingers on the weapons and the nuclear bombs and they honestly believe that if they can
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.080]  kick off world war three god's going to come down and invite them up to the big house after it's
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:51.840]  all over yeah or hail bop comment yeah i mean literally it's basically the same thing i'm sick
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:58.000]  of it of course these cold-blooded politicians uh like palin and and mccain and all of them
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:04.800]  or the democrats doing those weird prayers uh up there i mean they are cold-bloodily manipulating
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:10.400]  christians that is all they're doing absolutely are is they are using it it is cynical and i would
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:14.400]  try to tell republicans that and they'd say no george bush is of the lord and i'm like no he's
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:19.280]  got gay porn stars in there every night and then finally they see democrats do it and they go oh that's
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:27.280]  fake yeah it's it's all about beliefs unfortunately the average voter is still voting based on their
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:31.600]  beliefs and in their shared cultural myths and they're there they don't want to look at the facts
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:35.280]  because the facts are very very unpleasant all right i want to get to the economy get your
[1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:38.960]  take on that and what's happening with russia really serious news there but let's just get
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:48.080]  this out of the way now and that is um michelle melton folks yeah this you know obviously she's
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:52.960]  attempting to uh puff herself up at your expense she knows you've got a huge audience and readership
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:58.400]  out there and so she's probably relying on anybody who's going to google alex jones is
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:03.760]  going to wind up seeing all these articles about about michelle melton was attacked by alex jones
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:10.880]  and i think it's an indicator not only of a desire to try and reverse the trend of audience drift
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:16.400]  away from the corporate media to the alternative media and the blogosphere uh but it's it's just
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:21.520]  outright demonization because they realize the american people know they've been lied to
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:25.280]  the american people are turning away from the liars they're going where they think they can
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:30.560]  find the truth and that is obviously you know your radio show my radio show our various
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:37.040]  respective websites and you know the numbers are inarguable we are winning the war for the minds
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:42.240]  of uh americans and the corporate traditional media they've hit the panic stage well that's
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:48.400]  the point i was going to make is that here's this woman that says put every muslim an americana
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:53.360]  camp put anybody that disagrees with the government in the camp she makes jokes about abu gaib on
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:59.520]  television writes about it says i'm a liar and she cold-bloodedly did that even after the mainstream
[1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:05.440]  is admitted that the marines did kill the puppy off the cliff throwing off the cliff she chose
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:10.960]  because she thought i was a kook to attach that to the story and said i was a liar and made it up
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:16.640]  then she didn't retract after the marines admitted it then she did all these other things and i
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:22.080]  nicely walked over to her and said why are you saying put all americans in camps and then her
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:26.960]  guy came in for the bumping into me so i pushed him back the point here is first they said
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:33.200]  that i said killer then we learned i didn't say killer and that people allied with her said killer
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:40.000]  uh but the neo cons don't care they still run with the headlines alex jones said kill michelle
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.640]  malkin alex jones punched michelle malkin in the face alex jones spit on michelle malkin and of
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:52.400]  course it only further discredits them uh and then now mark davis has had to retract it they
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.760]  pulled it in the Dallas morning news but he's still on wbap gets up there and slanders me
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:04.800]  and uh i there's so accustomed to lying that they just think they can get away with it but uh
[1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:11.040]  uh i mean think about it she writes a book saying put innocence in camps and then it's wrong for me
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:17.680]  when her people have their hands on me to yell at her see it's okay to say put people in camps and
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:23.280]  be for torture oh that's that's that's nice and loving and sweet and good and and mom and apple
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:29.600]  pie but don't you yell at somebody don't you i mean how how timid have we gotten when the founding
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:36.960]  fathers and i'm not calling for this by the way in the committees of correspondence uh in the uh you
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:45.760]  know the sons of liberty for 15 years before 1775 burned down police stations hung people
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:50.720]  tarred and feathered them that your skin burned off folks burned people skin off killed them
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:56.320]  you know the founded though that's that's that's george washington but see he's good but alex
[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:02.960]  raising his voice at her is wrong now mike well it's basically it's a double standard
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:06.960]  and you know the the opposition is not thinking in terms of fairness and justice or even the
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:12.800]  constitution it is we must win at all costs and it's that kind of blind fanaticism and
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:17.040]  unfortunately as a society edges closer towards collapse and i will agree with you
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:22.160]  we're on that path it's just a question of when but you're going to see fanaticism start to rear
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:26.640]  its ugly head and the reason is the people who sign up with a particular point of view
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:32.080]  once you go past a certain degree of abuse once you support torture once you think it's okay to
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.120]  waterboard people or or throw people in jail just because they're muslims once you go past that point
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:42.320]  and you can't look at yourself for what you have supported that's when you become just absolutely
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:48.080]  blind loyalty to the leader because the leader must be right because if the re leader is ever
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:53.680]  shown is wrong then the follower is also shown to be wrong and that's yeah that happened in germany
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:59.040]  and michelle malkin is a clear uh symptom that we have reached that stage in this country no mike
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.920]  you're absolutely right in fact you hit the nail directly on the head there they have committed
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:09.360]  to this evil they have endorsed it they have underwritten it they have supported it they have
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:16.480]  they have vitriolically pushed it and preached it and pushed it on every front and now it's
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:21.200]  coming out they tortured small children and raped them now it's coming out they were all innocent
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.600]  now it's coming out and instead of hearing alex jones say how dare you write this and say this
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:32.480]  they have to scream bloody murder and say that i punch michelle malkin or said killer they have to
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:37.280]  lie because if they don't they'll have to look themselves in the mirror they want to forget
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.480]  about the dog and lying they want to forget about making fun of abu graib they want to forget about
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:49.200]  saying put all muslims in camps they want to move on and we're not letting them move on mike so
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:55.760]  we they have to basically scream rape yeah they're they're basically our function i see our function
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:00.160]  we're holding all the dishonest people in government media to account for their dishonesties we're
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:05.040]  exposing the lies and uh you know we've already succeeded because the average lifespan of a cover
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:10.480]  up now is clocked with an egg timer whereas back in the day that was 33 years before the
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:14.640]  majority of americans knew the truth there and what we're really seeing have you ever seen a
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.200]  small child with their fingers in their ears and their eyes shut tight stamping their feet
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:23.120]  and saying i don't see it and i don't hear it and you can't make me well that's actually what
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:27.760]  malkin is what michelle malkin was doing she physically did that she covered her ears and
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:33.520]  turned her head she looked like a five-year-old yeah that's exactly the mentality that they're at
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:37.840]  right now i i had to run in here with a local affiliate uh from one of the networks and i won't
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:41.920]  say who because i still actually work for them from time to time and i was trying to give her one
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:46.160]  of the deception dollars and she literally was saying i can't look i can't look at it i can't
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:50.560]  you know it was it was like this you know psychological barrier here i you know i can't
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:56.080]  look at this because uh you know uh then my whole worldview will shatter and you know i'll
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:00.800]  have to look at myself as being the prestitute that i am and we've reached that stage there
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.160]  there's the denial is so strong it is getting into violent reaction violent rejection violent
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:11.520]  refusal but don't they understand we're just going to be proven right over and over again
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:17.120]  our credibility is only going to rise as their implodes well they're probably still thinking
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.720]  that they can trick us and trap us into some embarrassing missteps and they're trying real
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:24.800]  hard right now they're feeding out a lot of stuff to try and embarrass the blogosphere
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:29.360]  and the alternative radio with but yeah in the long run you and i have got track record
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.280]  stretch back for years decades and you know yes we make occasional missteps and we will
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:40.480]  you know retractable say okay we goofed we got fed some bad information but overall we're not
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:46.720]  supporting a war based on lies we are opposed to going into uh uh more wars on lies we're
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.640]  definitely opposed to a whole new cold war because you and i are old enough to remember

[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:36.880]  you have no discernment you not look at that woman in torture and being shown up for who she was
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:40.640]  you know i walk up to her and say hey you wrote a book saying put all
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:47.120]  all Muslims and camps and other people as well and she just said get out of my face i'm working i
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:53.520]  said no i'm not leaving so our thug came i'm sort of bumping into me so i pushed him off of me but
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:57.200]  i still kept my distance from her and then she would come over and get in my face if you watch
[1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:03.040]  the video and that's where it's really screaming at her and then she started crumbling like a
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:09.200]  like a tin can you know down to nothing but regardless you're not going to write books about
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:15.680]  putting people in camps and torturing people and destroying the liberties and freedoms we have
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:20.480]  without being confronted without being screamed at
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:23.920]  and the fact that
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:31.680]  that so many people have been so domesticated that they're comfortable with torturing children
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:37.280]  they're comfortable throwing dogs off cliffs they're comfortable with destroying the bill of
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:42.880]  rights and constitution but it's but you don't talk back to somebody when they're talking to you
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:48.480]  you don't raise your voice at somebody that says in your country uh folks we're never
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:53.840]  going to turn this country around if we don't get aggressive uh if we continue to be gelded
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:56:00.720]  to be neutered microvarum absolutely the the one thing that we have to do is we have to realize
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:04.800]  it is our country it doesn't belong to the corporations it doesn't belong to the government
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:11.680]  the government are our employees and we have every right to stand up and say you are lying to us
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:16.480]  i will not believe you i will not follow your directions and your orders because i do not
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:20.720]  trust you and you know you need to get out there because when you speak out like that you're going
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:24.880]  to give other people the courage to speak out and that is how consensus is going to form well
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:28.320]  that's what they're scared of that's what they're scared of in fact i've been meaning to make that
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:32.720]  point when i'm privately reflecting now i always forget to make it on air they're demonizing when
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:37.600]  i did and and still coming after me everywhere because they're scared of you getting aggressive
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.920]  they're scared of you calling them on the carpet and reading them the riot act they're scared of
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:48.880]  you verbally indicting them for their crimes they they want to call you they're scared of the phenomenon
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:55.680]  of the citizen journalist going on and confronting their abusers microvarum yeah absolutely uh the
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:57:01.760]  the u.s government has belatedly realized that they have lost the trust and support of the american
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:06.240]  people and uh you know they're trying to crush down the blogosphere they're trying to basically
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:10.480]  shout down uh the alternative media they're pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:16.480]  propaganda campaigns online activism and uh activists and shills and and uh public relations
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:20.960]  operatives and also i think that's a big reason for this sudden push to create a whole new cold
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:27.440]  war with russia is the planners in in washington realized the war on terror has fizzled as a
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:34.000]  means of scaring the american people into uh uh complicity by the way guess who sponsors michelle
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:40.480]  malkin and her ring of websites her main sponsor is the department of homeland security go ahead
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:44.880]  well that is hardly surprising and and you know one of the things you have to watch out for you
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:49.040]  when you're looking out at the blogosphere and alternative media if you're seeing a group that
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:54.000]  seems to have a lot of money be very careful about the agenda they're pushing because somebody has
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.680]  bought and paid for that now getting back to this thing with russia because i know you wanted to
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:02.880]  talk about it i see our government as desperate to get back to what they see as the glory days of
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:09.040]  the 1950s and 1960s when all they had to do was wave russians at us and american taxpayers would
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:13.440]  salute smartly and stay there stay there stay there mike stay there mike revero what really

[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:54.800]  listeners and i am pleased to say that over the last several weeks i have come to understand
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:02:03.040]  that the viewership readership listenership of the the the blogosphere uh and your show my show
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.160]  we are picking up a younger audience now and that is so important because it's really the younger
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:12.800]  audience that needs to be paying attention to this stuff because they're going to inherit our
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:19.360]  failings and you know this thing with russia the younger people don't remember what the cold war
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:26.160]  was all about and so let me give you a real brief history lesson end of world war two uh we had
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:31.600]  with the japanese and we had beat hitler and all this really feel good stuff and all these huge
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:37.280]  defense contractors these companies that made billions trillions of dollars off the war are
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:42.800]  all of a sudden looking at very very lean times and this is the group of people that eisenhower
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.240]  in his farewell address termed the military industrial complex so eisenhower tried to
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:53.600]  warn us he was a general he'd been in world war two he saw what was going on he tried to
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:03:01.280]  issue a warning to our own distress we ignored him now and the world war two you know uh germany's
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:06.720]  gone japan is defeated uh and all these defense contractors are saying hmm how do we keep the
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.360]  country on a war footing how do we keep the money flowing to us well we're going to go to our friends
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:15.840]  in hollywood who made all those wonderful movies that demonized the japanese and the germans
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:21.120]  and we'll just ask them to start making movies that demonize the russians and maybe the chinese
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:26.000]  as well and all of a sudden we've got a new enemy that we have to be preparing for war with and we
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.520]  don't even have to really fight the war that's the really cool thing about it we'll just wave russians
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:35.920]  at the american people and they will keep on shoveling their money at us as hard as they can
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:41.120]  to save us from those bad old russians and it worked and anybody who spoke out against it
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  got hauled before the uh house committee on unamerican activities they had their career
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:49.520]  destroyed 400 people in hollywood lost their careers for saying wait a minute there's no
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:53.520]  reason to make the russians the bad guys here they haven't done anything and the military
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:58.800]  industrial complex grew richer and richer and the the generals got to pin more metals on their chest
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:03.920]  and the american people got taken for a trillion five trillion dollar ride building up all this
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:08.480]  weaponry which basically rusted and corroded away to nothing in those silos in the midwest
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:13.840]  but the big intelligence apparatus is now being swung around against us they wanted to launch that
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:19.120]  police state growth uh you know the the military industrial complex owning the red light cameras
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:25.360]  the police training the face scanning systems the databases but since that's going to put like you
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:29.600]  said they're now shifting it back to the russkies but then if you study the bankers that own our
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  country they funded the russkies as well micro vero is our guest what really happened dot com

[2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:49.120]  my thoughts on the whole russia situation new york banks british banks openly funded the
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:56.400]  bolsheviks to knock off queen and king's cousins the british royalties cousins
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:04.720]  uh that were running russia they brought them down uh then by the 30s when stalin took over
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.960]  they lost control for a while so they used hitler to menace him then they double crossed hitler
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:18.880]  this has all been declassified now uh and uh brought the soviets in uh then the west used
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.920]  the soviet menace as an excuse to build up the soviets use the west as an excuse to build up
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:30.720]  up when the same financial interest were financing both sides and the russian generals and and and
[2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:38.880]  kgb loved the false threat as much as the us did uh now we uh see some some different things
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:45.040]  happening but on the front of the threat of nuclear war it later was declassified that duck
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:51.920]  and cover wasn't really to keep you safe to jump onto your table it was to it was to drive home
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:10:00.080]  home and to personalize and localize the menace of the soviet boogeyman about to nuke you any minute
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:05.840]  and so if you're ducking and covering once a week at school and and and they're driving you
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:11.440]  in school buses down to the local parking garage for your nuclear fallout you know that is really
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:16.400]  making you hate these russkies that make you cower and fear once a day you know kind of the
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:22.320]  five minutes of hate well it's the same thing with these bio-terror chemical drills it's about
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:27.600]  federalizing police it's about trillions of dollars being conduited into defense contractors to run
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:33.280]  these drills it's about creating the perception and i've seen the feds in belton texas and many
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:38.480]  other places where i physically been tell the mayor to get up at an ounce terrorists have hit
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:43.200]  belton they've killed hundreds and they even blow up cars out in the parking lot and citizens are
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:48.320]  saying what's happening and the cops walk over and say just terrorist and then at the end of the
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:53.200]  day or the next day of the day announced it was just a drill kind of like we had fake bio attacks
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:58.400]  and nuclear spills here in austin and they even sprayed austin cops with stuff and release something
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:05.120]  in the dps and made the cops get sick that was in 99 2000 they had to terrorize their own people
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:11.040]  first before they could create the cadres that would go out and terrorize the rest of us so
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:16.080]  whatever abuse we go through we always see the military and the police getting the first
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.440]  helpings and the double helpings so i bring that up to bring up the way they inculcate and
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:28.000]  localize this the pathology and psychology of fear micro vero yeah absolutely agree it's all
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:32.560]  about you know the the the main terrorist in in the united states is the government itself
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:38.000]  and you know years ago back right after 9 11 i wrote an article in which i said once a government
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:44.560]  starts using terror to control its own population it can never stop it becomes a political addiction
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:48.640]  they must keep the people terrified all the time because once the people
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:53.360]  calm down once they start to think objectively the falsity of it all starts coming through and
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.840]  they begin to realize they're being snookered and the problem is in order to keep up the level of
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:03.280]  terror you have to keep coming up with something more and more and more and that is why i i am
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:10.240]  convinced that if the u.s. government tries a new false flag terror attack like 9 11 it's going to
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:14.320]  have to be something that hits all across the country what you were saying about these bio war
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:20.080]  game simulations they'll literally spray a couple of cities probably with anthrax because there's
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.560]  no runaway contagion with that and we've already been brainwashed into thinking anthrax equals
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:29.840]  terrorist when it's actually a battlefield weapon and you know if they try it's going to have to
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:36.000]  be that great but the problem again is the population you know fear is very tiring and after a while
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:41.360]  you can't sustain the energy to stay afraid and when that fear wears off when you can no longer
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:46.000]  be made afraid no matter how big a boogeyman is that's when the people will start saying okay
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.560]  who's really been doing this to us who's been making us afraid all the time it is an osama
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:56.000]  bin laden we haven't seen him in years he's dead it's the media it's the government that's constantly
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:00.640]  trying to keep us afraid so that we will run to them for protection with our cash in our hands
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:04.880]  our children in our hands and say here take my money take the lives of my children just keep
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:12.160]  me safe from the boogeyman you keep showing me well again mike you spell it out 110 as it is
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:23.840]  expanding on that theme of fear not only do they get as focused on false fears that that
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:30.480]  aren't based on reality or that are greatly exaggerated real things like every major vaccine
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:37.040]  being conclusively connected to diabetes and i've looked at the studies americans are eating the same
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:46.960]  amount of corn syrup that we were eating 15 years ago so why then is diabetes going up and then i
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:52.480]  went and looked and sure enough they've known for 20 years that that vaccines are causing an
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:14:02.240]  autoimmune response that creates an infection in many glands not just the pancreas pancreatis
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:08.800]  and that that's the main thing causing it and then so there you have millions of people now
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:15.280]  a year getting it hundreds of thousands dying sawing arms and legs off you've got millions
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:20.720]  of autistic children from the mercury hundreds and hundreds of studies thousands of studies
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:27.680]  that study in florida is hurting people's glands bones brain organs uh you know same thing with
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:32.560]  mbt e they ordered in all the gasoline and infested 49 states it is deadly to i mean
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:38.400]  there is this eugenics agenda i mean you can't just say all of this is by accident and then
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:43.280]  sure enough you find documents where it isn't by accident so it's not only are they terrorizing us
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:48.080]  with false threats to get control of us these are some diabolical bastards i mean can you speak
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:54.160]  in your own study to what drives the new world order the social engineers the social architects
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:01.600]  well i have a slightly different perspective than you do alex and i say that because i'm not
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:06.320]  going to say which one of us is right but i do have a slightly different perspective uh yes there
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.800]  are some uh social engineering population engineering projects afoot but at least some of what we see
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:18.960]  is explained just by outright greed and a government that no longer is looking out for the interests
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:25.600]  of the ordinary citizen in their haste to placate the large corporations and the reality is under
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:30.800]  our current system companies make a lot more profit off of products that are brand new and have never
[2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:36.400]  been done before and because of market pressures these get sold before they're really tested and
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:41.920]  many of them are not tested at all artificial scent chemicals are of course a major major problem
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:47.120]  because the fda has declared that these artificial aroma chemicals are external
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:52.800]  and therefore don't need to be tested for uh efficacy and toxicity uh the way pharmaceuticals
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:57.040]  would be but of course that's nonsense if you're smelling the artificial aroma then it's inside
[2:15:57.040 --> 2:16:02.000]  your sinuses it's inside your lungs it's crossing into the blood and you know who knows what effect
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.320]  that they're having we're seeing incredible recklessness with genetic engineering experiments
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:10.480]  because the russia's create a new product we can put a patent on and get it out in the market
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:16.240]  well mike mike mike i totally agree that most of it's just palmel greetings but the rationale
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:21.840]  is since there's too many people anyways and just screw them so i'm saying they have that overarching
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:27.520]  attitude yeah i would agree with you that there is a tremendous disregard for individual health
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:33.040]  because the whole population it is so large it's viewed as a herd to be harvested to be taken
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:39.840]  advantage of to have wealth drawn from it and uh there is this disconnect between the ultra rich
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:44.640]  and you know it's kind of funny it's not a new attitude because andrew carneghi personally believed
[2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:49.840]  that the ultra rich were a completely separate species from the rest of humanity kind of getting
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:54.720]  back to uh hga well it's not so she'll learn when i walk yeah the yellow and the more social
[2:16:54.720 --> 2:17:00.560]  Darwinism yeah and i really did see him as two separate populations he did not think that the
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:05.200]  the poor should be educated beyond the whatever was necessary for them to work in the factories or
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:11.040]  work in the fields and this attitude does tend to pervade uh the the upper levels of society well
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:17.120]  he funded he funded modern education and that's why we're now dumber than dirt yeah that's absolutely
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:21.280]  true and you know you find this attitude among the ultra rich because they're looking for some
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:26.800]  kind of a justification why they should have lives of sex wealth and yet so many other humans be
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.560]  poor and they they they conquer they craft these ideas that somehow wealth is the sign of god's
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:38.480]  elect or wealth is the sign of superior genetics anything so they can go on being greedy and take
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:44.400]  from the masses and say this is the way it's supposed to be and they've controlled madison
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:51.120]  avenue what success is it's not being an inventor or an explorer or somebody who had courage social
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:56.400]  courage it's some basketball player that acts like a gang member and and they've written about that
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:01.520]  the social engineering i mean they're doing a masterful job i mean they've got i think more
[2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:06.880]  control over the situation than than maybe you give them credit mic and i and i respect you and
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:11.680]  i agree with your world view of how things work and who's in control i'm just saying i've spent
[2:18:11.680 --> 2:18:16.000]  so much time in their own founding documents which you clearly are aware of you're quoting them here
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:22.160]  that i see a method to their madness i mean i'm not saying they even control things like you said
[2:18:22.160 --> 2:18:31.120]  they know they know how to steer things i would agree with you to a point but uh do you
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:38.240]  know what the word epiphenomenon means yes okay basically i think what we're seeing that that
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:44.640]  that appears to be a consciously directed global plan is really an epiphenomenon of overlapping
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:52.000]  instances of individual greed and avarice and so it may be a function of a group mind or collective
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.960]  mind no that's uh... rather than a deliberately plotted out uh... approach to world domination
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:05.120]  but again it's just a difference of opinion but there's clearly clearly the captains of industry
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:10.080]  though in the angle american system are all teamed up and they're wanting to set up a global system
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:15.040]  i mean they're setting it up yeah there's no doubt that there is a plan to create a global economy
[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:21.200]  which i disagree with i think it's a disaster if it if it's ever fully implemented but but you're
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:27.120]  saying they really don't have global control right now no i don't and i and i think in fact that
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:31.520]  there's actually less control going on because they're spending all of their energy to squabble
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:35.680]  among themselves and and the faction fights among themselves and i think the biggest proof that
[2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:41.440]  they're not as much in control is here in the united states where we have seen this country go into debt
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:47.520]  at the same time we're seeing our manufacturing go overseas and now all these bankers who own it all
[2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:51.600]  are saying well my goodness they can't make the payments on the mortgages and credit cards how
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:56.240]  did that happen and they stand there scratching their heads and looking dumb that was very poor

[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:22.640]  right now the EU said yeah we don't want our gas and oil cut off we're not going to have
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:33.120]  sanctions on Russia over Georgia but still here in the united states the media still reports that
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:40.400]  Russia snuck attack Georgia that there's quote us aid the russians have caught the US government
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  shipping more weapons in they've been threatening us ships in the black sea
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:51.840]  still a continued escalation there and meanwhile very childlike bloggers and others
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:25:00.160]  are saying that i'm a russian sleeper agent all because i reported the facts that the US backed
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:06.240]  Georgia initiated aggressive actions towards russian held enclaves for hundreds of years they
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:11.920]  said i'm lying that osetia south osetia and abkhazia have never been part of russia they said that
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:18.800]  russia attacked first and i know these bloggers don't believe what they're saying they've got to
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:25.600]  be on the payroll uh micro vero absolutely they're paid propaganda the internet is now the high
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:30.160]  ground in the war for the minds of america and indeed that of the entire world and it is no
[2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:34.480]  surprise that various governments are spending millions of dollars billions of dollars hiring
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:40.160]  public relations firms uh... to basically hire people to sit and post to the internet to try and
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:44.560]  control uh... the disguise and that's come out and that's come out
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:48.960]  you know it's been admitted to hillan norton uh... which is the same public relations firm that
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:54.480]  put together that whole stolen incubator uh... thing for desert storm they openly advertise
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:59.520]  that for you know uh... fee they will hire people to go into blocks and try and control the
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:04.560]  discussion and uh... of course uh... as the whole sarah palin thing continues to unravel
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:10.080]  my email boxes being flooded with people saying how how can you attack a baby with down syndrome
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:13.360]  and of course i'm not attacking a baby with down syndrome i'm calling into question the
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:18.160]  character of the woman who would be vice president but it's the same thing how dare you punch michelle
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:23.840]  malkin in the face how dare you beat her with bullwebs how dare you say murder her
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:29.120]  didn't do any of it they don't care yeah they don't really care they're they're basically paid to lie
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:32.720]  it's a growing industry in fact maybe the only part of the american economy that's still working
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:38.160]  but a lot of times they don't even deny it it'll say former congressman's aid former pentagon aid
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:44.400]  former colonel they don't even or or like the intel center run by former cia spooks who upload
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:49.360]  the bin laden videos in the same resolution as their bug i mean it is just obvious
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:55.760]  yeah it absolutely is uh... you know there's a huge propaganda effort uh... on the internet
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:59.440]  and again they're trying to play the game by the rules that worked in the fifties and sixties and
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:04.880]  they're falling flat on their face now getting back to russia it is beyond question that the
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:08.960]  initiating event in the hostilities with the shelling of the russian barracks you're a russian
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:18.240]  sleeper agent no or sleepers it's a lie or kgb i'm sleeping i got coffee right here kgb go ahead
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:25.200]  anyway the the point is that now we're starting to see this spin that it doesn't matter who really
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:31.280]  started the uh... the uh... the conflict that america must back georgia against the russian bear
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:36.720]  that we've got to keep russia contained inside russia that russia has no right to just invade
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:40.640]  countries without reason which of course is an incredibly hypocritic thing for the united states
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:45.760]  to be saying as we uh... you know sit there in afghanistan and iraq and get ready to go into iran
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:50.320]  but after it was proven that there were no wmds in iraq they said we never said that it doesn't
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:56.720]  matter it's democracy we're bringing that's why we came was never about wmds yeah absolutely
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:02.000]  it's just saying whatever they think will hold the people's anger at bay just a little bit longer
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.800]  and uh... but you know it it is going to explode at some point uh... i don't know when
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:12.560]  but you know even even though i'm still playing the game the the the game within the system right
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:17.200]  now ultimately i'm in agreement with you i think the u.s. government is headed for a crash like that
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:21.360]  had that happened in romania somewhere down the road i don't know when but we're headed that way
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:25.680]  and we can't turn back well i mean the new york times announces they're going to hand over city
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:29.600]  buildings and the running of the city to private corporations incidentally then you can't look at
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:34.000]  their books i mean we're going into total receivership just like a third world country right now
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:38.480]  yeah we absolutely are and you know we have this thing on a uh... coffee cup that we sell
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:42.160]  around here says the last official act of any government is to loot the nation
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:46.080]  and i actually had that on a t-shirt i was wearing when i was on vacation i had people come up and
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:51.440]  say you're absolutely right and uh... you know with it was rather uh... a shock i was wearing
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:55.680]  some of the home-baked and for the uh... what really happened t-shirts and we have people come up to

[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:04.160]  you know it was kind of a weird experience to just uh... you know be out there in public like that

[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:13.840]  people are paying attention well mike you bring great analysis and information and that's why

[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:27.600]  final hour we stream live on the web at prismana.tv
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:31.520]  he's like man you sound down you sound out of it no
[2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:38.240]  driving the 18 20 hours whatever it is to Denver from Austin I didn't really sleep
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:44.640]  driving back I didn't sleep and then it was exhausting what happened in Denver and I hadn't
[2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:51.360]  been in the studio doing a live show in 10 days I'd called in some I'd done my Sunday show that's
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:56.720]  another studio and I'm not even tired I'm just more relaxed than I normally am
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:05.760]  and I think in a way that's the danger we we become accustomed to corruption we become accustomed
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.040]  to tyranny and I want to ask microbarrow how he deals with that after we take some calls
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:18.480]  but I'm you know calmly reading about Raynegan in New Orleans saying if we see you outside after
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:24.160]  curfew you will be considered a looter and you'll go right to the state pen no judge no jury
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:30.320]  you will go to jail for being a looter really I thought we had due process see once you get
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:35.440]  rid of the fourth amendment hey we'll just spy on you hey we'll ban first amendment if we want
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:42.800]  speech hey will they're flushing it all down the toilet right now but before I forget you want to
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:49.600]  comment on that briefly and then how do you deal with this Mike because because I mean there's
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:55.680]  always a fresh outrage that gets me angry but people notice when I don't seem as fiery and
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:35:00.800]  it's almost just overwhelming to know that NATO calmly came out a year and a half ago and said
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:07.760]  our new policy is to preemptively sneak attack you with nukes and our policy is to
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:13.120]  provocate Russia I mean this is official policy I mean and I've just kind of gotten comfortable
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.400]  with the fact that we have a bunch of out of control people running things Mike
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:25.600]  well they're they're not out of control in terms of themselves they don't see themselves as villains
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:30.720]  or bad guys they see themselves as serving their own interests and rather ruthlessly as well
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:38.240]  but uh you know the the NATO policy is essentially an extension of the US policy that George Bush
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:44.560]  put in place back in 2003 where he said preemptive war is now our doctrine we're going to attack and
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:49.600]  destroy anybody we think might be a threat to us down the road of course it's a very slippery
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:54.240]  policy because you wait enough time and virtually anybody's going to be a threat and now Russia
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:00.480]  says okay we may nuke you first if you keep moving weapons and and and men in and now and the US is
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:06.080]  still doing it yeah that is exactly right Russia's threatening belligerence to the United States
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:11.680]  really is only an echo of what the US has been saying for the last several years uh Russia's
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:17.680]  comment that an attack on georgia will be seen as an attack on Russia uh uh uh uh rather an attack
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:22.800]  on uh kazi in a city will be seen as an attack on Russia is basically simply mirroring the
[2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:27.280]  kennedy doctrine back at us all over again russia isn't saying anything to the united
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.080]  states that the united states did not already say you know going back for the last 20 30 years
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:36.480]  and by the way if you watch their generals they get up and read from the NATO doctrine saying look
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:42.160]  uh you took Serbia you said you wouldn't break it off you just did now you're taking this
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:47.520]  now you're moving weapons in your NATO document says you may sneak attack nuke us
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:53.840]  for and you want to provocate us what is your problem and and all we're doing stating the facts
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:37:00.000]  and i'm sorry a little neo cons on the payroll out there but i mean you know mike there is
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:07.280]  lunacy here you know i mean there is megalomania going on here there is megalomania there is
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:11.520]  there people get caught up in this idea that they are making history and they're going to be famous
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:16.320]  and there'll be statues and and medallions made of them and everything and you know the bottom
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:23.120]  line is as soon as somebody makes a mistake that's when people start dying uh and and unfortunately
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:29.200]  we seem to as a race have a curse every hundred years or so we get a group of people who think
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:34.160]  we can own it all we can control it all we can be masters of the entire world and we'll build
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:37.920]  pyramids to our own honor and so forth and so on and it doesn't matter how many people
[2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:42.800]  have to die because there's too many people anyway and it really is this kind of callous
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:46.880]  disregard where the people at that level of the government i mean we remember henry kissinger
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:51.680]  saying that military people are just dumb stupid pawns to be used up in foreign policy
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:56.720]  and the idea is you play them like chips and you you calculate so many will die and that's an
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:01.120]  acceptable loss and if so many more die that's unacceptable therefore we're going to change
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:05.680]  our strategy and tactics to keep the deaths down to a certain number because those soldiers are
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:10.000]  the wealth they're the chips that we play the game with and they really do see it as a game
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:14.480]  and they are masters of the game and other people's lives are just the gambling chips and that's
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:19.200]  what carl rove said to a bunch of newspaper reporters five years ago he said look we control
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:25.200]  reality and you don't and and and you just report on the reality we make let's go to calls here
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:32.080]  helen in florida and robert jason vicar and steve go ahead helen yes alex uh take their money this
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:41.120]  is the way it can do it uh write promissory notes to the clerk of court in 1995 one summer 21 he sent
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:46.320]  the clerk of court promissory note and they sent it back which uh of automatically discharged the
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:51.120]  debt but they couldn't let that go they brought him back to court four times finally judge rushing
[2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:55.840]  they start in the jail and everything finally judge rushing said this case is this discharge
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:00.960]  you've done your research well so people can send promissory notes with the same values are paper
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:07.200]  bills zilch and it works or if it can recognize that they can really make changes well a lot of
[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:16.480]  folks go to prison too with all this paper patriot mythology business and i know the banking system
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:22.800]  the stock market system is all based on cuckedom and fraud as well and chicanery and and and
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:30.800]  magic tricks illusion but a lot of people get into these ucc and promissory notes and
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:37.120]  filings and bonds and they go to prison like the freeman so be very very careful helen you want to
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.400]  comment on that microvaro yeah you need to be aware that a lot of the stuff that gets put out there
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:47.920]  along these lines is deliberately planted in order to trick people into doing something that the
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:52.240]  government can then use to throw them in jail like nissara they've been here in for 10 years or
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:57.280]  12 years that everything's fine a secret good government took over just stand down fellow
[2:39:57.280 --> 2:40:03.280]  patriots yeah that's exactly what it is it's just another playcation and you know i remember back
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:07.920]  in how i guess it was the 70s or 80s there was this thing that came out called the anarchists
[2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:15.040]  cookbook and it was full of how to make drugs and how to make bombs and experts in explosives
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.680]  looked at the recipes for the bombs and said these are designed to go off in your face they're
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.160]  missing key stabilizing chemicals there was another one that was online i think was called the
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.560]  pirates cookbook or something similar and it turns out these are more propaganda put out by the
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:33.680]  government the same as the black Panther coloring book another famous one from the 1960s the FBI
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.720]  put out there they're designed to trip people up to get them to do things that are illegal so the
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:43.200]  government can come in and arrest them or even more spectacularly blow themselves up in their
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:48.240]  garage and say aha there was a domestic terrorist and you've got to be afraid and this is the reason
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:53.440]  we got to peek in all your windows exactly and some of the first databases on citizens that were
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:41:00.080]  public and the tracking and control of fertilizers and tracking of chemicals and then setting up
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:06.400]  anti-terror and intelligence units and the first calls to restrict books into track libraries was
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:12.480]  over that yeah absolutely the the anarchist cookbook you know started the hue and cry for like
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:17.760]  there've got to be limits on the first amendment and so this stuff is going back a very very long
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:23.920]  way uh you know it goes back to bankers 150 years ago would fund anarchist and the media would just
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:31.120]  call the hired banker thugs they would just call them anarchist they absolutely would and remember
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:36.160]  back during prohibition most people don't realize that it was the gangsters and rum runners themselves
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:41.040]  that were covertly funding the temperance movement to keep booze illegal because that's what kept it
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:46.720]  profitable and by the way they had 12 deaths in yucatan in one day last week huge national
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:51.520]  marches that got almost no attention millions of people calling for an end to corruption
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:56.640]  the drug war if it was ended tomorrow would annihilate most crime but it isn't going to be
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:42:02.160]  stopped because the drug dealers run the government let's take another call robert in illinois robert

[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:39.360]  everybody getting mad taking actions starting your own blogs calling into talk shows uh starting
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:46.160]  newsletters making copies of films uh standing up but speaking at your church against the war
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:52.400]  it's just saying no no no no no isn't it mike yeah it is saying no i will not cooperate anymore i
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:58.720]  mean even gandhi said the key to resting uh india away from british control was peaceful nonviolent
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:04.560]  non-cooperation i'm not going to do is i'm being told by the lying government anymore and that's
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:09.760]  all it's going to take i don't agree i don't go along you know freedom begins with the freedom to
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:15.760]  say no and you know if we are a free people we have the right to say no to the government
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:20.320]  no we don't believe you no we will not go along with you no we will not give you our money and
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:26.480]  children to kill people with well here's an example um no state would pass a law saying you have to
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:32.080]  have a federally registered premises and each animal i did because it came out the big poultry
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:36.560]  and beef producers and pork producers wanted it turned out they had a waiver for big plants over
[2:45:36.560 --> 2:45:42.080]  a thousand uh it was i think 10 000 with chickens but the numbers varied the point was it was meant
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:49.120]  to shut down small farms and ranches and i saw the number last year were 90 plus percent of
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:55.040]  farms and ranches had just said no so they tried to pass a law in texas but the law itself was just
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:46:01.440]  a hoax saying it's a recommendation so next people show up at the f a a meetings with their prize pig
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:06.960]  or cow or you know goose or you know a whole bunch of animals and they would have the police escort
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:12.560]  them off saying you don't have premise society but then it turned out that was all color of law
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:18.640]  and it was just meant to scare the the parents through their children and i mean i mean again
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:25.840]  this is dastardly it absolutely is and you know you need to look at a lot of the laws that are
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:31.040]  being passed really are intended to keep small businesses from growing and becoming a threat
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:36.560]  to the established corporations it is preservation of wealth and privilege we we are a strongly
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:42.560]  oligarchical society and the oligarchs are this corporate ceo look how much of the andron people
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:47.600]  got away with before the outrage was so great that something had to be done but isn't that
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:53.280]  an achilles heel the incredible corruption and the fact that they can run on so far
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:59.840]  because of the cronyism and protectionism of the system sometimes brings them down
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:05.680]  more often than even we do uh... they can get arrogant and they can go too far and that's
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:10.240]  the point at which enough people realize they have to be outraged they can't pretend it's
[2:47:10.240 --> 2:47:15.360]  not a problem and it really comes down to public anger when the public gets angry enough is when
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:20.240]  the changes are going to get made and if the public knows who is behind the bad things that
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:25.520]  happen then the new world order our masters at posing with the next solution to the crisis
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:29.920]  they created in the first place jason in the uk then victor and steve jason thanks for holding
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:36.640]  hello alex how you doing good sir go ahead okay i've got quite a few questions so um yeah
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:41.280]  okay first of all have you seen that video which is circulating with um bada mate putin shooting
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:50.480]  that tiger well i saw the hoax sunday headline uh... putin murders tiger putin kills tiger
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:55.840]  let me just finish i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i know let me for the listeners finish
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:48:00.560]  and i'll hold you over if need be uh... you asked me a question and then i saw it i said
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:06.320]  wow putin's out killing bingles i thought they were endangered uh... and so i went to the story
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:12.800]  and at the bottom of the times of london it said he was visiting a zoological uh... park and they
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:19.600]  needed to put a new transmitter on it and so you know he uh... he's a good shot being former kgb
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:24.800]  so they had him go out and do it but yes everyone freaking out saying he murdered a tiger but then
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:30.160]  when you read deeper it was a propaganda push uh... and it said oh no it was a tranquilizer
[2:48:30.160 --> 2:48:34.640]  uh... but uh... yes go ahead okay but the point i'm trying to make is do you think it's possible
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:38.800]  it was probably a stretch but you think it could be a reference to uh... george bush's
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:42.320]  new word order speech where he talks about the law of the jungle so could this be
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:46.320]  putin saying you know law of the jungle is here to stay you're not going to get your rule of law
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:54.000]  uh... you know what i don't know that's the case i know this the media misrepresented that
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:49:00.240]  that putin was out shooting tigers when that's an unpopular thing to be hunting uh... knowing
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:05.680]  that people would just halfway pay attention to it and think that he indeed was out shooting tigers
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:12.400]  microvarum yeah again it's another typical uh... distortion by the media uh... you know
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:17.920]  putin was out there and uh... you know he had a tranquilizer gun and uh... they take the video
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.280]  and they try and totally mischaracterize it uh... to say who putin bad guy for killing uh... the
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:29.440]  tiger and it's blatant it's reckless and again it shows that the people who are designing and
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:35.120]  putting out this propaganda are still living in the past they're living in the 1950s and 1960s
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:40.640]  where they could put this stuff out and there'd be nobody there to challenge it and they you know
[2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:44.720]  they just don't see it that this stuff doesn't have any traction any longer
[2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:48.400]  yeah i mean it really is an insult to say that russia attacked georgia
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:53.760]  that said that putin really killed a tiger their back saying iraq did have wmd's now
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:58.320]  i mean there's just no end to these people they say they're conservatives that's another big hoax
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:00.720]  uh... any other comments there jason
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.320]  yeah i've got a yeah i've got a few more um if you've seen nato's response to this um it looks
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:10.560]  like nato is really going to be the force that evolves into the uh... the world army which he
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:15.440]  talked about yes they've said that i agree with you mm-hmm yeah okay and one more thing uh when
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:19.920]  you at the uh... bohemian growth you say that a lot of the top up and coming politicians are there
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:24.720]  did you um did you actually manage to identify anyone you know you see a lot of people you
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:29.040]  recognize but then you can't confirm it because you can't stick a video camera in their face
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:34.720]  you've got a hidden camera on you i was in there five hours in three hours of it i was hiding in

[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:18.960]  dot com go ahead vicar hello um yes i have a question for mike and uh also a comment about
[2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:23.840]  basically the desensitization of people to torture in the media all right you're on the air with kgb
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:30.880]  sleeper agents welcome all right um the russia thing uh is it uh mike do you think that this
[2:54:30.880 --> 2:54:36.000]  whole uh south assessor thing might be a faint or a distraction for russian forces in preparation
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:41.440]  preparation for an attack on iran yes why did russia brutally launch a sneak attack on south
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:48.000]  osetia well i'm being sarcastic go ahead yeah i realize you're being sarcastic here when when
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:53.200]  this whole georgian thing cranked up i mean we know that the u.s and israel were sending in troops
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:58.800]  or rather let me correct that advisors and material support starting in november of last year
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:02.240]  and it seemed like this might have been more of a tactical move
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:09.840]  in order to prevent iran from or prevent russia from supporting iran uh by ground coming along
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:14.320]  that land bridge between the black sea and the caspian sea and i think the thinking was that if
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:19.600]  they could kick up this nice little prolonged border war uh that that would limit iran's ability
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:24.400]  to support iran during an american invasion instead they're now cementing an alliance
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:31.520]  yeah absolutely this has backfired tremendously uh russia is now moving into the political vacuum
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:36.960]  that the u.s has left in the region they're creating strong ties with iran with syria
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:42.080]  they're they're taking advantage of this foreign policy blunder by this administration
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:48.640]  and you know this is really on the strategic level this slavery to israel's will in the mid east
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:53.920]  is absolutely a disaster because we're making enemies of all the other nations in the mid east
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:59.680]  and russia is very happy to move in and take advantage of that situation so geopolitically
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:04.640]  the united states is very much in decline because the only nation we're allowed to be friends with
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:11.360]  anymore is israel and we can't be politically important in the global uh community if we're
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:15.600]  only friends with israel but that actually plays in the larger new world order plan from what i've
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:21.520]  seen to let the united states take over the country's let run up our debt put the new world order on
[2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:28.160]  our bill then demonize us as the uni uniform about polar world and then have china and russia and the
[2:56:28.160 --> 2:56:33.840]  eu rise as the new new world order system i mean i've been saying that for 10 years and it looks
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:40.240]  like every step our government takes is to discredit us is to destroy us but regardless of which it is
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:47.040]  the end result is the same yeah it is it almost doesn't matter matter whether it's a deliberate
[2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:52.000]  plot or just accident and stupidity the end result is the united states is definitely
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:57.040]  definitely in decline and uh you know it's just a question of how low will the american people
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:57:02.720]  ride with it until they decide it's it's time to just let it go i think it's almost unlimited what
[2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:06.880]  the majority will put up with the question is what will that active minority that's always
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:12.960]  changed and made history what will they do anything else victor uh yeah um i've encountered um
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:19.200]  some some videos online that are being passed off as um art pieces but which depict um uh two
[2:57:19.200 --> 2:57:23.760]  young boys getting into um what appears to be a homosexual relationship and also another
[2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:30.560]  video by the same filmmaker uh depicting a five-year-old boy um who basically tortures his uh one
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:37.360]  year old sister um i i contacted our our federal police the rcmp about it and they said that you
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:45.440]  don't since you don't actually see um the torture or um um say kissing and stuff like that taking
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:49.760]  place they they cut away from it um that they can't do anything but it's still um awfully
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:55.440]  disturbing and it's not well you've got nambla and all these groups being protected only so they
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:58:01.120]  can point at those groups and then take our true legitimate free speech away microvarum
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.680]  yeah absolutely agree the presence of these kind of shocking videos on the internet is
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:10.560]  basically uh preparation to try and put the internet under more government control we saw
[2:58:10.560 --> 2:58:16.400]  this way way back with the axon amendment where uh they were trying to put control on the internet
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:21.600]  and it was almost a joke because a month before the axon amendment was proposed in congress
[2:58:21.600 --> 2:58:25.840]  all of a sudden all this hardcore porn was being flooded onto the internet it was going
[2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:31.280]  through the usenet groups which was sort of a pre-web browser situation it was being poured

[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:22.080]  of attacks on the internet and i know you're you're you're well versed on that you have one of the
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:27.440]  first alternative news websites on the web and you expose events foster murder from there more
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:36.000]  than even christopher ruddy did but but yes in closing attacks on the web intensifying right now
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.800]  then we're coming back in the next segment with we are changed minnesota on the scene with new
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:46.720]  breaking developments but let's go back to micro vero right now well basically that was saying
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:51.600]  before the break back during the exon amendment it was very obvious what was going on because a
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:57.040]  month before uh... senator exon went before congress to try and say we've got to control the internet
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:02.800]  all this hardcore pornography i mean really gross and disgusting even for porno it was bad
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:06.320]  and it was being poured all over the internet in very inappropriate places
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:10.000]  and that the internet is very self-policing and people would say to these posters please
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.080]  don't put this in here this is a cooking group and they these bozos have come back and say i
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:18.160]  have a first amendment right to put this anywhere i want blah blah blah blah so we did a little digging
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:22.240]  and we found out these people posting all this trash all over the net we're all routing through
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:27.280]  military servers and government offices and sure enough you know uh... a month later senator
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:31.680]  exon gets up and says we must have control over the internet look at all these fleazy porn pictures
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:36.000]  i'm finding in cooking groups and model airplane groups and music groups and the children let's
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:42.800]  just say what it was it was people eating feces uh... yeah it was pretty bad stuff and of course
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:47.040]  as soon as the exon amendment came and went in congress that the porn flood stopped and i mean
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:51.760]  you don't get much more obvious than that that it was a stage operation bought and paid for with
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:57.200]  your tax dollar dot how do they get these guys you know with these pr firms and out at shayan
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:02.560]  mountain and south common miami and tampa i mean how do they get them to really hurt this country i
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:08.000]  mean like you said i guess they say we're the good guys we can break any rule we want well you
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.600]  know if you got enough money you can get somebody to sell out their own country and we've seen that
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:16.000]  throughout our entire nation's history and they don't see them selling out the country they think
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:20.480]  they're on the winning team they think it's for the greater good they can make all kinds of excuses
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:24.720]  to themselves at the bottom of those scotch glasses they're having at the end of the work day but the
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:31.200]  bottom line is they are paid liars that's what public relations and spin is it's paid lying to
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:36.160]  the public hillan-nolten did that whole incubator story that helped sell the iraq war and they're
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:40.960]  probably convinced themselves it was for a greater good and bringing democracy and blah blah blah
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.240]  but the bottom line is they take money to deliberately mislead the american people
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:48.880]  into making poor choices about what their government is doing
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:56.080]  oh it's just incredible they get away with so much of it uh i'm going to come back and go to

[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:56.640]  than if w and cheney and those guys had shown up it probably would have been a lot worse but
[3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:04.000]  i mean they were doing mass arrests and pitting people against the river with ryan cops and
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:10.960]  making sitting sit on the concrete for two hours and one girl actually uh urinated on herself

[3:09:15.920 --> 3:09:22.640]  boats like armed and ready to go and they were shooting rubber bullets hey uh not tazling
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:28.240]  people but pepper spraying people and it was it was really crazy well this is better than the cold
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:32.400]  war not only were they fighting a fake enemy they funded then now they get to fight women and
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:37.040]  children so imagine going to be a macho guy in a darth vader outfit who just beats up women it
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:41.840]  must feel good yeah there was one yesterday we actually got him on video where he was pretty
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:45.920]  much i mean lady brought her probably about a four-year-old there and he's just telling her
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  how stupid she was for bringing a kid who was supposed to be a peaceful march and it's just
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:56.000]  ridiculous well you don't you don't march in america okay you keep your mouth shut and you
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:01.280]  take your prozac you die of diabetes and cancer you know you take your vaccines you roll over
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:07.920]  and die that's what you do you want to help america die you want to help america jump off a cliff
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:15.120]  lick a boot today that's how you help go ahead that's true we're definitely in full force and
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:20.720]  can't we haven't gotten chance to get down there today yet but sure there's probably just as many
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:27.040]  police as there was yesterday and there's definitely i mean we got um there's some people
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:31.920]  that on there trying to cause trouble and mess it up for everybody because we've we got some
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:36.640]  pretty good footage of a group of anarchists whatever you want to call them running away
[3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:42.720]  after they had pretty much provoked the police from what we understand so basically it's the
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:47.760]  same mo they attacked the police and then they run back in the foundation that brought them in
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:51.520]  always was funded by the government we've been caught red-handed sometimes it's cop dressed
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.920]  up like an artist police dressed up like them and then they'd run off and then the police attacked
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:11:00.080]  the peaceful crowd yeah i'm kind of thinking that's actually what happened out at the river
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:04.400]  yesterday like they mean we were that's what mainstream media says the mainstream media says
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:13.440]  that the slaves the cattle the the scum filth americans uh got off their deviated slave path
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:21.120]  and that the god force that the the lords of the kingdom our rulers our gods the supreme ones
[3:11:21.680 --> 3:11:27.920]  the first class lordships uh then began beating and attacking everybody and that then the
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:35.920]  anarchists began smashing and burning things well i mean breakdown what else you've seen
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:44.720]  their uh slave uh just complete i mean we gotta go to jeremy from ohio changes here adam from
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:50.400]  colorado changes here and they said i mean for being at both on that it was pretty extreme
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:56.080]  yesterday and i say cheney or any of those guys had shot off yesterday it would have been
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:02.960]  probably chaos i know those are supreme lords but the servants of god the the the the angels in black
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:12.800]  um how many angels in black uh well i can say probably at least well how many would you say
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:19.680]  black in black uniforms yesterday we see one thing maybe three thousand they were literally
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:27.040]  everywhere and okay now i mean i maybe saw maybe one two badges out of all of them now now now now
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:34.000]  now how are the slave owners behaving you mean actual protesters no no the police are slave
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:40.800]  owners how are the how are the slave owners behaving most of them are actually pretty decent
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.720]  they didn't like i mean you could see even like the bike cops and stuff there's a lot of people
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:49.840]  that didn't want to be there especially uh our Minneapolis cops and but a lot of them i mean
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:55.680]  we got good footage of yeah i heard some of them i heard some of them uh might be kgb agents
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:13:00.240]  because uh they were actually giving thumbs up in 9-11 truthers maybe they're secretly with the
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:05.840]  terrorist it could be it and we did actually get a couple that drove by yesterday we actually
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.680]  ended up just parking at a bridge and sympathizers were they're sympathizing with terrorist
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:18.240]  it could be oh my god this is horrible news i mean tell me what they were doing
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:25.440]  well they just make sure they followed everybody i mean they were right up on everybody the whole
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:34.880]  time and but you did say that some of the lords police lords were were thumbs up in you though
[3:13:35.520 --> 3:13:40.000]  oh yeah there was quite a few i mean we had like i said we stopped at a bridge and started
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:45.040]  basically bullhorning the whole march as it went by i mean we i can't even tell you how many people
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:50.320]  walked by when we were at a camp but we had a couple police cars on marks come by give us
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:55.520]  thumbs up honk when they came by and they knew i mean they knew we were there and who we were
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:01.280]  yeah well there are some good cops i had some of them do that in denver as well and we've seen it
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:07.920]  in new york uh but you know i went to denver to blame the police uh you know if they did something
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:11.520]  wrong i mean expecting that because i see it everywhere else and then i had to admit they
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:16.640]  were somewhat restrained there and actually were humans the not not they didn't act like they were
[3:14:16.640 --> 3:14:21.920]  from mount olympus or something that i was scum the first time i'd ever seen this i was absolutely
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:27.680]  amazed uh but it looks like in minnesota that uh they were not as restrained but not as bad as
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:33.760]  they could have been yeah it was i mean besides the couple times i mean we were probably a lot
[3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:38.480]  away when they started firing the rubber bullets and stuff and it looked like just a select group
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:43.680]  that had broken off from the actual march and gone over there and kind of provoke something from
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:47.840]  what i heard yeah they were throwing things at police is what the news says is that accurate
[3:14:48.720 --> 3:14:55.280]  yeah well i'm so sick of these anarchists claiming that that that they're not government agents or
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:14:59.040]  they're not hired but they've been caught over and over again i don't know about this particular group
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:05.280]  because i wasn't there but they've been caught and then to come up and attack our cameras and push
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:11.040]  and hit on us in minnesota sounds like the same things happening of what we saw in denver but
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:16.560]  in denver they would come up and attack us and then say we're nonviolent as they broke our cameras
[3:15:16.560 --> 3:15:23.120]  and slapped our equipment and slapped us uh just really despicable group and now have you had any
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:30.800]  more visits from the secret service um actually they've pretty much laid off me i don't know i mean
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:37.040]  my girlfriend got pulled over she was speeding but a couple days ago i but i guess the police
[3:15:37.040 --> 3:15:44.000]  were not speeding not speeding al qaeda ing so your girlfriend was your girlfriend was al qaeda
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:51.280]  ing and then and then and then what happened next um they pretty much went through almost all the
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:55.200]  questions of the secret service that i asked her when she came or when they came over my house
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:15:59.600]  originally so there's no doubt you're in a database oh yeah because they're like well where does
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:04.400]  anthony work and what is he doing these days and where is he a freedom base actually a freedom
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:10.000]  base not a database a freedom base i mean that's freedom man when you're get pulled over and you're
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:14.080]  in a database and they're secret policing you man that is really good that's what the veterans
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:19.520]  fought and died for well makes me feel warm and fuzzy and well because it's because i'm a kgb agent
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:25.920]  that i uh that i don't want to be like russia was or east germany and i don't want secret police
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:31.600]  but see that's because i'm kgb that's so you're against secret police and being pulled over randomly
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:39.120]  and ask questions it's because you're are anthony are you a kgb agent i guess i am you carry a press
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:45.200]  pass from this organization you must be kgb it's like no way out man i've been found i go to the
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:51.280]  safe house and then there's a kgb there and then latimer putin's there patting me on the head
[3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:57.440]  oh my god i mean have you heard the latest that i'm actually a kgb agent people are actually
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:02.640]  saying this because i went on russian tv and said we're sorry the neocons have snuck attack you uh

[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:26.160]  denver but actually at the rnc here in st paul would you say being in denver as well that
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:33.520]  they're much more subdued in denver versus uh there in minneapolis st paul yes what are some
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:38.080]  of the other things you've seen from the protectors the people that protect us from the bill of rights
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:45.760]  um yeah basically back in denver um the people that are attacked us back in denver was mainly
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:53.600]  on the anarchists and some people from msnbc but um god here in um st paul it's basically um
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:59.440]  um what i've seen so far is based on the police have been um provocating incidents out of nowhere
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:03.280]  as those people have just been protesting and just wander around the streets just
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:09.520]  start actions out of nowhere well i mean in america you can't be allowed to be peaceful
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:14.320]  out on the street i mean that's evil uh but but being serious what you witnessed is horrible
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:19.920]  going back to msnbc attacking us they broke my megaphone ripped the strap off ripped the
[3:26:19.920 --> 3:26:24.480]  cord off ripped the front off we're punching me punching everybody else it broke one of our
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:29.040]  seven eight thousand dollar cameras because the camera's six thousand the mic's like a thousand
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:33.760]  they broke that and we're screaming and cheering with glee but then 15 minutes later we came back
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:39.760]  with you guys and it was magic they couldn't stop us and they were so mad i remember we all got there
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:46.880]  dad some msnbc guy actually tried to take out for some of our cameras yeah and a little msnbc
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:52.320]  troll also grabbed our wireless card but then keith oberman asked us nicely from the top to stop
[3:26:52.320 --> 3:26:56.960]  and because he did report on state sponsored terror when dick cheney was planning to blow up our own
[3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:01.440]  ships and i'm being serious now folks it really happened we did shut down after taking over for
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:06.720]  two plus hours for him you think that was a mistake or should we have continued because
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:12.640]  it was pretty pathetic how we took over i mean it was pathetic for them yeah just basically just
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:17.600]  since you don't know how to be the media it's that basically up to us to be the media and just
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:22.640]  basically how they were just trying to at times sabotage us they basically bring us down well
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:28.080]  that's it i mean i mean they're calling us radicals for bullhorning live events and and shouting at
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:33.920]  michelle malkin our founders did 10 000 times that i mean i mean we're not burning down ships
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.640]  setting off dynamite you know our black powder we're not tar and feathering people roasting
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:44.320]  their skin off we're not burning down cities uh... you know we're just out shouting and it's like
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:50.480]  oh my god they're shouting but ban them but the they went to the cops and said ban them and the cops
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:54.960]  said nope so big difference what do you think would have happened in minnesota if we try to take
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:28:01.200]  over a live tv show um well i'm not sure but we've been trying to figure out how to do that here in
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:07.680]  st paul but um well possibly they could shut us down possibly this might make us go away or
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:13.200]  something but possibly at some type of degree i'm like they just make us this have us arrested or
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:20.080]  possibly just harass us is there anything else you noticed uh... that you saw there that you
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:27.360]  want to make everybody aware of um yeah that has arrived i'm guessing there's more harassment here
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:33.280]  at the rnc than at the dnc that um Denver police were asking more polite than the ones here at the
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:38.720]  rnc yeah i haven't seen a cop open a door for somebody in years and they were opening doors
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:44.960]  for everybody they were definitely on good behavior they were uh but not uh you know
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:49.680]  to go to new york or austin or anywhere else just kind of like what are you looking at slave

[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:38.880]  with a felony saying she assaulted them notice how this is why they're losing all their credibility
[3:30:39.440 --> 3:30:43.600]  is that she's done nothing to them and it's not just a false arrest they're gonna slap
[3:30:43.600 --> 3:30:52.080]  felonies on her and then make her beat them yeah exactly but uh god that's criminal

[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:36.480]  control it makes me sick how far this country slid our basic bill of rights and constitution
[3:34:37.280 --> 3:34:44.240]  under fundamental attack being being dismantled and a bunch of idiots in black uniforms running
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:49.520]  around pepper spraying people with and and the anarchists aren't even starting it
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:55.920]  and then you've got uh the delegates all straight jacketed basically
[3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:02.960]  you know let's play that audio i sent you a bunch of audio clips john i forgot to ask you do you
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:08.000]  have the one of mccain the last couple weeks bumbling around not knowing uh the name of his vp
[3:35:08.640 --> 3:35:13.360]  not thinking thinking that i ran as al qaeda backed it's ready let's go ahead and play that
[3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:20.080]  well we get the phones back up and uh while um we get anthony yasha and then we are changed
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:28.960]  minnesota people back on here it is so anybody is it's tired paying four dollars a a box four
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:34.640]  dollars a gallon for gasoline is there anybody is sick and tired of it we continue to be concerned
[3:35:34.640 --> 3:35:41.360]  about iranian uh taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back well it's
[3:35:41.360 --> 3:35:47.280]  common knowledge and has been reported in the media that uh the that al qaeda is going back
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:53.200]  into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran that's that's well known
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:01.200]  i'm sorry the iranians are are training extremists
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:07.680]  not al qaeda not al qaeda i'm sorry you might have kind of a senior moment there to find and connect
[3:36:07.680 --> 3:36:14.720]  up a real leader with a real bow borrower the first thing i would do is make sure
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:21.680]  that we have a missile defense system in place in check list of akia and and uh president putin
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:31.120]  and former president putin uh the president putin of germany gave one of the old cold war style
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:42.880]  speeches and that's and that's not change we can believe in tight household budgets are getting
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:47.440]  tighter we should have used a word timetable pardon me you shouldn't have used the word timetable
[3:36:47.440 --> 3:36:53.280]  i didn't use the word timetable i think it's a pretty good timetable as we should have horizons
[3:36:53.280 --> 3:36:59.840]  for withdrawal oh well look anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the
[3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:06.640]  ground anything is good one introducing the energy supplies to check list of akia i'm not the
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:12.480]  youngest candidate in this race you know that i'm older than frankenstein i got a few scars and
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:17.440]  that i've and i'm older than dirt and i've got more scars than frankenstein screwed up that line
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:26.480]  and uh but i've been around we should be able to deliver a bottle hot water to dehydrated babies
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:34.880]  i don't that look that that is that it's so it's a very hard struggle particularly given the situation
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:42.160]  on the iraq pakistan border what how can we think pressure to bear on the government of Somalia
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:50.160]  how can we uh pardon me soon in i'm sorry soon i will conduct a respectful debate now it'll be
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:56.720]  dispirited it'll be spirited i'm a proud conservative liberal republic a conservative republican
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:10.320]  hello easy there and that's not changed we can believe in the the oil supplies to the republic
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:19.760]  of checklist of akia remember excuse me the check republic i used to call it and the the check
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:27.040]  republic uh as you know to return our property our party to the principles if you believe you
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:36.480]  should pay more taxes i'm the wrong candidate for you senator obama is your man i think he's inside
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:43.120]  a bubble i think he's been ginned up a little bit i will veto every single beer bill senator can you
[3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:49.520]  explain why you and your campaign manager have specifically said that obama played the race card
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:54.400]  with his comments the other day and can you elaborate when you said that you fought for equal
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:58.960]  rights for your entire life what specifically you've done focusing on improving the lives of african
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:13.120]  americans all right uh first of all um the the first question that you said why am i well what
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:18.000]  what it is when when your campaign manager and you reiterated that you backed david thank you very
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:24.880]  much it's wonderful to be here in nevada nevada nevada nevada it's wonderful to be here in nevada
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:32.400]  you still view al-qaeda in iraq as a major threat uh it is still a major threat though it is uh
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:38.720]  certainly not as major a threat as it was say 15 months certainly not an obscure sect of of the
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:46.000]  shiites all over all or sunnis or anybody else and so many other tragic stories who of people
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:53.760]  who are being held caught hostage by this very cruel and inhumane organization
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:10.880]  for a guy whose official seal carried the motto yes we can senator obama's agenda sure has a
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:19.840]  lot whole lot of no we can't including reduction in oil supplies to check the sabaki at where are you
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:31.120]  is are you still here are you not oh mayor sparks is here that's not change we can believe in
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:39.360]  and i'd love to see my friend she keel o'neill who just finished the playoffs last
[3:40:45.760 --> 3:40:50.000]  well there you have it ladies and gentlemen john mccain and there's a lot of other stupid gaffes
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:55.600]  now that he has but don't worry he won't be running anything of his president neither will
[3:40:55.600 --> 3:41:02.640]  barack obama remember that all these debates about who has more experience or who has cancer or who's
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:08.560]  senile or who's young or who has communists in their background or whose daddy's a muslim
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:15.520]  none of it amounts to a hella beans because since 1947 we've had a complete shadow government
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:20.800]  and it's taken full control in 2007 and it's called congress it runs absolutely nothing
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:34.080]  and to sit down and shut up period end of story end of debate the network phone lines are still down
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:37.440]  if the we are changed folks want to try to call in on our local line they can or
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:43.440]  you can call them john if you have a local line this happens a few times a year
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:50.160]  here because things are held together with bailing wire and chewing gum around here
[3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:52.640]  all right i'm going to quit screwing around
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:01.600]  i do have a stack of news here i haven't even really gotten to yet and i i really should cover
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:05.520]  all of this i mean that that would really be the best thing for me to do here
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:12.880]  eu dependent on russian energy bulks at georgia war sanctions this is out of bloomberg european
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:17.760]  union leaders refuse to impose sanctions on russia over the invasion of georgia
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:25.120]  kind of love that deception they refuse to put sanctions on them over them invading georgia
[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:29.680]  when they were being attacked by georgia and they just moved in and kicked their military
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:36.000]  out and pulled back good god acknowledging their reliance on russian oil and gas at a time of
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:43.280]  faltering economic growth eu leaders took their symbolic step yesterday of suspending talks over
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:47.840]  expanding trade ties with russia fearing the tougher measures could expose the energy dependent
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:54.000]  block to russian retaliation russia is the 27th nation block main supplier of oil and gas and
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:58.160]  the third biggest trading partner giving it leverage at a time when the european community
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:04.480]  threatens to tip into recession europe's determination to maintain business links
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:10.320]  also undercuts u.s. efforts to line up allies against the recitative russia
