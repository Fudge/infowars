[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.440]  this is it boys the globalist attempted takedown of America and they're trying
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.960]  to start a civil war as well there's a five-minute report Obama's gun grab
[00:30.960 --> 00:36.120]  crosses the Rubicon as one big media insider sent me an email yesterday put
[00:36.120 --> 00:45.520]  it strap yourselves in Obama is set to release hell well you reap the win you
[00:45.520 --> 00:52.640]  absolutely know that in the end tyranny will fall but this this is quite a time
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.400]  to be alive this is a five-minute report we're just gonna play part of it that
[00:56.400 --> 01:03.440]  John bound filed here it is Obama's dictatorial national policy strategy is
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.300]  forming into what can only be described as a global government coordinated
[01:08.300 --> 01:13.920]  subterfuge of the language of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights it
[01:13.920 --> 01:19.120]  wasn't the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting
[01:19.120 --> 01:34.760]  nor would it be the last Fort Hood Binghamton Aurora Oak Creek Newtown the
[01:34.760 --> 01:45.640]  Navy Yard Santa Barbara Charleston San Bernardino notice how he mentioned Fort
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.880]  Hood and San Bernardino those were actually jihad's not mass shootings by
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.080]  the mentally ill or even proven workplace violence so it stands to reason if
[01:56.080 --> 02:01.120]  a small percentage of mass shootings are already jihad's you better believe
[02:01.120 --> 02:08.400]  Americans are gonna need to be packing heat of course this is only the beginning
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.840]  of the propaganda on parade here's a reminder a little known decades old
[02:12.840 --> 02:19.440]  anti-propaganda law known as the Smith month act was silently deep six on July
[02:19.440 --> 02:25.320]  2nd of 2013 essentially unlimited government propaganda can now be
[02:25.320 --> 02:30.040]  unleashed to control the seething grievances of the American people so
[02:30.040 --> 02:35.760]  what is it that Obama is selling this time nothing less than an affront to the
[02:35.760 --> 02:40.560]  absolute law of the land huge swath of social security beneficiaries will
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.200]  become ineligible to own a firearm to protect themselves as Obama nonchalantly
[02:46.200 --> 02:50.240]  placed that into the mental health aspects of Obama's executive gun
[02:50.240 --> 02:55.040]  control Breitbart reports the reporting that ssa in consultation with the
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.480]  Department of Justice is expected to require will cover appropriate records
[02:59.480 --> 03:05.400]  of the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.040]  issue receive disability benefits and are unable to manage those benefits
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.240]  because of their mental impairment sorry grandpa we're turning your home into a
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.240]  gunfree zone where 92% of mass shootings have happened since 2009 it'll be open
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.240]  season on you once the punks down the street find out the gun confiscation
[03:24.240 --> 03:28.880]  SWAT team pay to visit to your house and as the Washington Free Beacon reports
[03:28.880 --> 03:33.720]  Obama's executive order may require those selling even a single firearm to
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.600]  become licensed dealers with gun sales skyrocketing this will send shock waves
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.080]  through the economy not to mention society but how exactly does Obama
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.360]  categorize those that should be restricted from owning a firearm under
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.080]  Obama and the DOJ's proposed rule attached to the health insurance
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.120]  portability and accountability act HIPAA and the national instant criminal
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.240]  background check system and ICS the Department of Health and Human Services
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.160]  expressly permits certain HIPAA covered entities to disclose to the national
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.400]  instant criminal background check system the identities of individuals who are
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.880]  subject to a federal mental health prohibitor that disqualifies them from
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.040]  shipping transporting possessing or receiving a firearm furthermore among
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.360]  the person subject to the federal mental health prohibitors are individuals who
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.600]  have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution found incompetent to
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.960]  stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity or otherwise have been
[04:30.960 --> 04:34.880]  determined by a court board commission or other lawful authority to be a
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.360]  danger to themselves or others to lack the mental capacity to contract or
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.320]  manage their own affairs as a result of subnormal intent there's about a minute

[08:09.080 --> 08:16.720]  to try to take me out I was going to take them with me if I could have gotten
[08:16.720 --> 08:23.960]  51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up
[08:23.960 --> 08:30.640]  every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it
[08:30.640 --> 08:40.520]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[08:40.520 --> 08:47.000]  they promised us over and over again Obamacare was going to be free they told
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.520]  us over and over again nobody'd opened up the borders they swore to us that it
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.640]  was a wild conspiracy theory no one wanted to take any of your guns not
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.480]  your semi-autos not your rifles not your shotguns no one wanted to register them
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.480]  Obama said in more than 20 speeches that are on record that he couldn't sign
[09:08.480 --> 09:18.520]  executive orders to take guns because that would make him a dictator but now
[09:18.520 --> 09:27.920]  he has come out and said he has to act because Congress won't the elected
[09:27.920 --> 09:32.640]  representatives of this country won't pass any more gun restriction laws
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.760]  because they don't stop criminals they don't keep us safe and guns are one of
[09:36.760 --> 09:44.440]  the rarest forms of death in this country compared to literally more than 50
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.240]  different things that kill people more often than guns depending on the world
[09:49.240 --> 09:56.040]  Almanac every year guns are in the 40s or 50s or 60s as the cause of death but
[09:56.040 --> 10:01.680]  it's spectacular it's hyped up like shark attacks
[10:01.680 --> 10:18.080]  now when you look at all of this it signifies that there is going to be a
[10:18.080 --> 10:25.280]  larger assault on the Second Amendment coming not just the unprecedented
[10:25.280 --> 10:33.920]  attack that we have just seen in fact I believe he would just come out with some
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.640]  of their agenda via executive orders set the precedent that he could use
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.600]  executive orders to create law and then would come in with more restrictions in
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.560]  the next few months that's what they said they were going to do no he dropped
[10:48.560 --> 10:54.160]  the hammer yesterday with seven different initiatives three of them just
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.960]  incredibly draconian national gun registration when you buy or sell a gun
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.600]  or trade a gun or give a gun to a family member as a gift that then means
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.120]  they're going to start targeting guns in your house that they claim don't have a
[11:08.120 --> 11:13.080]  record of providence so that you basically have to show when you got them
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.520]  and how you got them or they can basically persecute you and that's what
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.680]  this is is a war on law abiding gun owners of America and branding it via
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.720]  CNN MSNBC the Washington Post and all these big university heads coming out
[11:29.720 --> 11:35.360]  saying gun ownership is racist gun ownership is evil gun ownership is
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.560]  white and if you aren't white you shouldn't have a gun and we should take
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.240]  the guns from the white people that's what Michael Moore has been saying for six
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.800]  seven years as the talking point now you see the talking point from professors
[11:50.800 --> 12:01.920]  and media heads and the entire system because that is the push that is the
[12:01.920 --> 12:12.480]  agenda major study Paul Joseph Watson's reporting on an info wars.com Obama has
[12:12.480 --> 12:16.200]  issued more restrictive executive orders than past six administrations
[12:16.200 --> 12:22.120]  combined uses more words that create binding legal obligations such as
[12:22.120 --> 12:28.880]  shall and must and they're now ordering the ATF the FBI health and human
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.080]  services and more than 20 other federal agencies to make their main mission
[12:34.080 --> 12:40.520]  demonizing harassing interrogating questioning prodding taddling on
[12:40.520 --> 12:48.320]  reporting on gun owners pediatricians dentist regular general practitioners
[12:48.320 --> 12:55.840]  surgeons social workers school counselors OSHA they're putting it all
[12:55.840 --> 13:02.920]  codified into regulatory action outside of law so the big issue is it's an
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.480]  executive power grab unprecedented if Congress doesn't challenge it and
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.640]  doesn't move to impeach Obama it's another incredible precedent setting
[13:10.640 --> 13:19.520]  milestone towards total tyranny totalitarianism it's national gun
[13:19.520 --> 13:25.280]  registration it's banning the transfer of guns it is putting into the instant
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.720]  background check just like the no fly list a system where they magically won't
[13:30.720 --> 13:36.200]  tell you who or what agency just say you can on a gun it takes everything they've
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.520]  done in California as a beta test and takes it nationwide and that's what
[13:40.520 --> 13:43.560]  Bloomberg admitted he's been doing spending hundreds of millions of
[13:43.560 --> 13:49.520]  dollars of his own money and Soros money to get this done wicked evil
[13:49.520 --> 13:55.760]  billionaire insiders war criminals like Soros openly running the White House
[13:55.760 --> 14:06.680]  openly lobbying to take our firearms and we've got Obama in what people say is
[14:06.680 --> 14:13.600]  fake crying certainly looks fake to me up there mentioning this long list of
[14:13.600 --> 14:20.200]  shootings as if each time it's a drumbeat and how much more will we put up
[14:20.200 --> 14:24.560]  with one of our graphics guys Zimmerman put together a satirical piece that
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.000]  supposedly you know shows the teleprompter will roll that in front of
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.200]  the screen for TV viewers they get a full view of it that has a bird's-eye
[14:33.200 --> 14:38.080]  view of the teleprompter telling Obama when to cry at what point you know with
[14:38.080 --> 14:41.840]  John Banner all the crying is mental illness with Obama the rare show of
[14:41.840 --> 14:47.880]  emotion is pure unmitigated unadulterated theater you can even see
[14:47.880 --> 14:54.160]  there's no real tears there and he put something in his eye probably pepper or
[14:54.160 --> 15:00.120]  something cayenne pepper or some oil to then cause that the eye to tear this is
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.680]  something they do in Hollywood theater he puts it in his eye and then 20
[15:06.680 --> 15:12.000]  seconds later a tear comes out and it's not the tear that wells up and bulges at
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.920]  the end and then comes down it just kind of oozes out of the eye that's what
[15:15.920 --> 15:20.360]  pepper does and by the way I've been in films I've been in movies I've been in
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.480]  theater if you haven't been in it you don't know when you look at tears when
[15:24.480 --> 15:27.400]  you look at Hollywood tears you can tell when it's a really good actor
[15:27.400 --> 15:30.640]  thinking of their dead mother or father or dead child they swell up they break
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.280]  down it gushes out it's real but still they're remembering something painful to
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.280]  do it in most movies it's fake and it smeared everywhere because it's not real
[15:40.280 --> 15:48.200]  just like wrestlers with razor blades cutting themselves it's fake so here's
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.760]  the big news the open unconstitutional dictatorial assault is here everything
[15:53.760 --> 16:02.760]  we've seen has been forms of tyranny as they turn the heat up but now it is just
[16:02.760 --> 16:07.160]  completely naked time magazine banning gun sales to people on no-fly list may
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.760]  not be constitutional experts say they put millions of people on some magic no
[16:11.760 --> 16:18.560]  fly list or watch list totally extra judicial just like these executive
[16:18.560 --> 16:26.200]  orders extra legislative and then they say oh we're gonna apply this to your
[16:26.200 --> 16:32.200]  guns the TSA model is the model to break America not the TSA themselves but the
[16:32.200 --> 16:36.320]  system of the Fed's seizing transportation and now saying the IRS
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.880]  won't let you leave the country if they have you under investigation no judge no
[16:39.880 --> 16:47.600]  jury no judges order and now we're going to apply that to gun owners and just
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.000]  magically put you on a list and in his speech and press conference we're gonna
[16:51.000 --> 17:04.840]  play the clip what did Obama say he said that he's a constitutional lawyer and he
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.880]  knows how this stuff works he's taught law and you know if they can have
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.240]  checkpoints at the airport searching you well we can do something to gun owners
[17:14.240 --> 17:17.880]  and that's what he's saying they're gonna take that extra judicial federal
[17:17.880 --> 17:23.760]  global power grab internal checkpoints an internal no travel list directly out
[17:23.760 --> 17:26.800]  of Nazi Germany where you're on a list let me see your papers oh you're not
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.280]  allowed to travel you got to go to the ghetto and then next we're coming to
[17:30.280 --> 17:36.800]  pick you up there this is just unbelievable here's a clip from the press
[17:36.800 --> 17:42.640]  conference I want to be absolutely clear at the start I've said this over and
[17:42.640 --> 17:49.240]  over again this also becomes routine there's a ritual about this whole thing
[17:49.240 --> 17:56.000]  that I have to do I believe in the Second Amendment it's there written on the
[17:56.000 --> 18:06.680]  paper it guarantees a right to bear arms no matter how many times people try to
[18:06.680 --> 18:13.520]  twist my words around I taught constitutional law I know a little
[18:13.520 --> 18:21.120]  about this I could up five seconds please ladies and gentlemen this is the
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.160]  sickest joke of all this is the guy that signed the NDAA the National Defense
[18:25.160 --> 18:34.640]  Authorization Act on January 31st but was it 2012 was it 11 to secretly kill
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.000]  Americans anywhere in the world including here in America torture people
[18:38.000 --> 18:47.080]  disappear him have renditions you name it and now he says he can just sign
[18:47.080 --> 18:54.280]  executive orders and bypass Congress because he taught constitutional law when
[18:54.280 --> 18:57.520]  he's shutting down our power plants ordering the border patrol to complete
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.360]  the smuggling process and commit felonies shipping guns into Mexico to
[19:01.360 --> 19:04.520]  blend the Second Amendment giving stinger missiles to Al Qaeda who are now
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.280]  saying they have them in the news today that's coming up bringing in the radicals
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.840]  to attack us and then taking our rights when we do get attacked I'm gonna skip
[19:14.840 --> 19:17.640]  this network break this is just too important I'm gonna sacrifice it for the
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.040]  Second Amendment it's just too important let's go back to the clip of
[19:22.040 --> 19:29.720]  President Obama here it is around I talk constitutional law I know a little
[19:29.720 --> 19:34.520]  about this
[19:34.520 --> 19:40.200]  press has the IRS going after Christians and gun owners super persecution believe
[19:40.200 --> 19:44.040]  that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second
[19:44.040 --> 19:47.360]  Amendment oh consistent with it like Chicago and New York Total Bands
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.720]  separate you know we all leave in the First Amendment but you're the guarantee
[19:52.720 --> 20:01.720]  savaging beach but we accept that you can't yell fire in a theater we
[20:01.720 --> 20:09.360]  understand can't bring in ISIS people some constraints on our freedom in order
[20:09.360 --> 20:14.800]  to protect innocent people they know they'll always be another shooting we
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.960]  should always want more this is the registration we accept you have to go
[20:18.960 --> 20:23.160]  through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane and then naked
[20:23.160 --> 20:29.800]  bodies can not because people like their children grope but we understand
[20:29.800 --> 20:34.800]  that that's part of the price of living in a civilized society oh not a free
[20:34.800 --> 20:38.560]  country but a civilized society where the borders are open and you bring in all
[20:38.560 --> 20:42.120]  the people from all over the world and don't even check their passports when
[20:42.120 --> 20:48.080]  they fly into JFK from Mexico Russia China you name it 10,000 Chinese women
[20:48.080 --> 20:53.160]  a week land in America to have their babies for free we're a total joke we're
[20:53.160 --> 20:57.920]  a total joke and then you say but we know for civilization we got to go
[20:57.920 --> 21:02.080]  through the naked body scanners by the way father upset over TSA Pat down of
[21:02.080 --> 21:05.920]  his girl 10 yeah they're not supposed to do that to children under federal law
[21:05.920 --> 21:11.200]  but they do it and let's show that article again that's New York Daily News
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.800]  they just put on screen a hundred this is just two weeks ago 150 on flight from
[21:15.800 --> 21:23.040]  Mexico allowed to skip customs leave JFK airport just just walk on through okay
[21:23.040 --> 21:28.160]  but then don't make me do it either so excuse me mr. Jones we're gonna give
[21:28.160 --> 21:33.040]  stinger missiles and tell missiles to al Qaeda and ISIS and al-Nusra and we're
[21:33.040 --> 21:35.800]  gonna bring them in unvetted out of Europe in mass and we're gonna let them
[21:35.800 --> 21:39.600]  just disappear and not even tell governors where we're putting them and
[21:39.600 --> 21:45.480]  it's not an issue we're gonna leave the borders open but we're gonna put gun
[21:45.480 --> 21:50.120]  owners on no fly no gun by list whenever we feel like it and we don't need
[21:50.120 --> 21:55.520]  Congress to pass a law we're just gonna do it we got local police that have been
[21:55.520 --> 22:02.200]  federalized they're part of these task forces run by the UN the strong cities
[22:02.200 --> 22:07.480]  initiative you can't make this up that are going to come and confiscate your
[22:07.480 --> 22:13.200]  guns and then you sue them they'll just use taxpayer money to find it that's the
[22:13.200 --> 22:20.000]  LA model that's the New York City model that's what they're doing creating a
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.880]  whole new political persecution arm of gun owners and the answers open carry
[22:25.880 --> 22:30.400]  nationwide the answers pass and loss for open carry nationwide the answer is
[22:30.400 --> 22:35.480]  taking all these brainwashed fascists who think they're liberal out to teach
[22:35.480 --> 22:40.040]  them what true Thomas Jefferson liberalism is defending themselves being
[22:40.040 --> 22:43.920]  independent and having a right to defend yourself you know the greatest
[22:43.920 --> 22:47.480]  hypocrisy here is they're coming for our guns to enslave us they admit that and
[22:47.480 --> 22:50.960]  they lied and said they never come after our guns which they're constantly
[22:50.960 --> 22:56.880]  doing now we're conspiracy theorists in hundreds of articles with my name in
[22:56.880 --> 23:01.080]  just the last few years hundreds of articles saying Jones is insane he
[23:01.080 --> 23:05.600]  believes they want to take semi-automatics they admit that's their goal the
[23:05.600 --> 23:11.720]  mayor pro team in Austin Mike Martinez two years ago they were having an
[23:11.720 --> 23:19.480]  anti-gun event and that there was a sign there saying registration leads to
[23:19.480 --> 23:24.360]  confiscation there was another sign saying stop gun confiscation I know the
[23:24.360 --> 23:28.400]  fella he's been out there for 22 years at rallies before I was on air when I was
[23:28.400 --> 23:32.600]  on get gun rallies I would see that guy with a stop sign that says stop gun
[23:32.600 --> 23:38.400]  confiscation and Mike Martinez looks right at him and says brother we're not
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.720]  gonna confiscate him with this new law they're trying to pass in Texas Bloomberg
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.960]  he's part of the Bloomberg mayor deal he goes but as soon as we get him
[23:45.960 --> 23:52.520]  registered we are and he laughed at him you talk about slimy you talk about
[23:52.520 --> 23:58.000]  evil you talk about sneaking around you talk about wanting to have his will with
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.120]  the people of Austin he wants us to live just like the poor people in Mexico
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.920]  where the tiny elite all have armed guards and special gun permits and
[24:06.920 --> 24:10.080]  everybody else can own guns you have the highest crime rate in the world he
[24:10.080 --> 24:17.080]  wants you to be his peons his slaves out there on his plantation stepping
[24:17.080 --> 24:20.680]  infection that's what all these elites are I don't care if they're black white
[24:20.680 --> 24:25.120]  Hispanic they all get into recreating slavery in America and let me tell you
[24:25.120 --> 24:28.880]  the number one mark of a free person is they have a right to free speech and
[24:28.880 --> 24:34.640]  that's under attack and the number two right of any free human is the right to
[24:34.640 --> 24:41.440]  have weapons for defense of you and your family and that's the greatest
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.120]  hypocrisy of this mountain of hypocrisy is that these people have their own
[24:46.120 --> 24:55.360]  bodyguards paid for by taxpayers and when you've got mountains of fraud and
[24:55.360 --> 25:02.080]  and and and and and just evil like Michael Moore with his six bodyguards on
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.680]  average that have been arrested at airports trying to get guns through
[25:05.680 --> 25:11.480]  before look it up in the nose imagine being that guy worth hundreds of
[25:11.480 --> 25:18.080]  millions of dollars lives in big mansions with big fences around them
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.960]  with guard shacks with men with guns
[25:25.760 --> 25:32.800]  there it is AP more bodyguard arrested on gun charge it's a sick joke let me
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.480]  tell you something I've been around Michael Moore I've been around Pierce
[25:36.480 --> 25:42.400]  Morgan I've been around Fareed Zarkaria when the cameras aren't on and they look
[25:42.400 --> 25:49.400]  right at you and say you will be defeated they are enemy military officers
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.480]  with rank folks and I'm not joking the CIA is operating domestically it's run by
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.280]  foreign banks all the trendy outfits with little floppy hats and little kitty
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.400]  cat shirts are to make you not be threatened by them these people and I'm
[26:03.400 --> 26:07.000]  telling you I had this from high-level sources they hold rank in the globalist
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.440]  system more is financed with hundreds of millions of dollars every decade to
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.160]  destroy America Robert Rodriguez holds rank in infregard and Obama and the
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.320]  federal government he goes to meetings I have talked to three people that have
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.480]  been in them with the president and others how to finance basically race
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.320]  war in America between Hispanics and others down the road and his entire L.
[26:31.320 --> 26:38.040]  Ray network do you understand these people are in meetings they have been
[26:38.040 --> 26:42.960]  given political offices and rank and high-level security cards to do whatever
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.400]  they want basically they are officers of the enemy takeover they are they are
[26:49.400 --> 26:57.880]  known enemies of you and your family these are literal collaborators and of
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.800]  course the Republican leadership is going along with it because they've been
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.440]  told we will arrest you we will set you up we will kill you if you don't go
[27:07.440 --> 27:13.080]  along with this you understand how many times I'm gonna try to find one of the
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.600]  clips and Obama say hey I want to restrict the guns I want to do it but
[27:17.600 --> 27:22.520]  she can't do that outside of law in Congress I'm not a dictator selling the
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.400]  idea if he was a dictator he could and I remember saying over the years I said
[27:26.400 --> 27:31.040]  he's gonna start doing stuff dictatorial persecuting the press shutting off our
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.680]  energy opening our borders selectively giving waivers to his own laws like
[27:35.680 --> 27:41.360]  Obamacare the big corporations so then shut down their competition and now
[27:41.360 --> 27:50.480]  they're doing it at a level never before seen in the history of this country
[27:50.480 --> 27:56.800]  God help us is all I can say and let me tell you the one sharing on top in this
[27:56.800 --> 28:03.720]  whole nebula of issues is they want false flags and they've laid the ground
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.200]  work in media in entertainment in culture that patriots that are promoting
[28:09.200 --> 28:13.320]  private property the family of the Second Amendment and pro-life are racist
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.440]  scum who deserve to be arrested and who are going to blow things up so they can
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.160]  blow things up and blame it on us and I'm telling you as sure as the sun came
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.440]  up this morning they've got the teams on the ground in place waiting for the
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.800]  phone calls with the trucks loaded with the plastic explosives to blow up
[28:33.800 --> 28:39.600]  federal buildings and they're gonna blame me by name and Matt Grudge by name
[28:39.600 --> 28:48.160]  and Rush Limbaugh by name and Donald Trump by name within 20 minutes of the
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.480]  bombs going off or a special ops team from Europe shooting up a school
[28:53.480 --> 29:01.840]  killing a patriot leaving them at the scene I know their playbook I know what
[29:01.840 --> 29:07.000]  they've done before I know this Justice Department and God help us is all I can
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.280]  tell you God help us this is the takeover of the Republic this is the fall
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.120]  of the Republic now there's gonna be great resistance to this politically
[29:17.120 --> 29:23.160]  they've bitten off more than they can shoot but they just list these shootings
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.160]  imagine they listed all the stabbings you know guys that stab six seven people
[29:27.160 --> 29:30.520]  or whatever here and there it would take them days to list all those but see
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.040]  it's not that it's just a this Chinese water torture of and then this shooting
[29:34.040 --> 29:36.520]  and that shooting and then they'll always be another shooting no matter how
[29:36.520 --> 29:40.320]  much gun control then the answer oh we have a registration now we have a
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.760]  confiscation which is what they've done everywhere else and what they've done in
[29:44.760 --> 29:49.720]  cities that these dirtbag mafia criminals control on the march the
[29:49.720 --> 29:56.640]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.440 --> 30:03.840]  while President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action a new
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.440]  Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun
[30:08.440 --> 30:13.480]  control are among the country's top problems Gallup asked about 1,000
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.440]  Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were
[30:17.440 --> 30:23.560]  in 2015 at out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans guns gun control ranked near
[30:23.560 --> 30:29.160]  the bottom at 19th in comparison 16% of Americans said that the government was
[30:29.160 --> 30:34.800]  the nation's biggest issue 13% said the economy 8% said unemployment and
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.480]  another 8% said immigration but rather than working on these hot button issues
[30:39.480 --> 30:43.960]  both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun
[30:43.960 --> 30:48.800]  control with a president even stating that he wants to quote make gun control
[30:48.800 --> 30:54.120]  part of his legacy end quote according to CNN you can find more reports on

[33:28.240 --> 33:33.320]  there's no where to run pretty much the whole planet some of the control of the
[33:33.320 --> 33:38.840]  private central banks that in the last hundred years or so took over the planet
[33:38.840 --> 33:46.360]  via fraudulent digital trash on reserve money they came up with then they're
[33:46.360 --> 33:51.680]  militarily backed by the West and if a country doesn't go along with the
[33:51.680 --> 33:56.120]  globalists they'll go hire communist or other organizations to overthrow the
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.040]  country they'll put them into total slavery for 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 years
[34:01.040 --> 34:05.480]  depending on the nation and then after that the public so broke back and trained
[34:05.480 --> 34:10.520]  they then collapse and then Rothschild banks take it over turned out that
[34:10.520 --> 34:15.600]  basically every oligarch in Russia turned out to be a Rothschild front the
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.400]  Rothschild sued two different newspapers a few years ago saying it wasn't true
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.520]  and then it turned out the judge said I can't believe the Rothschilds came into
[34:24.520 --> 34:31.240]  court and lied to us like this this suit has proven the claims of the newspaper
[34:31.240 --> 34:38.320]  Morris Yeltsin all those people totally on the payroll of the Rothschilds
[34:39.160 --> 34:46.200]  can't make that up Putin starts arresting all their people and so they
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.720]  start moving NATO in weapons in try to overthrow the Russian country Russia
[34:52.720 --> 34:56.320]  comes out and says the sky is blue and says that NATO is encircling it and
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.840]  threatening it yet NATO generals top generals saying we're prepared for war
[35:00.840 --> 35:04.760]  will destroy the Russians top US general saying body bags let's murder Russians
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.440]  you've got all these statements on TV by presidential candidates about bloody
[35:08.440 --> 35:12.720]  their nose shoot down their planes attack them put a no-fly zone in and
[35:12.720 --> 35:19.680]  Russia says it appears that NATO is going into an aggressive posture we need
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.680]  to prepare to defend ourselves and our media goes look at the conspiracy theory
[35:23.680 --> 35:31.660]  of the Russians how insane they claim that we're a threat to them oh no
[35:31.660 --> 35:37.280]  NATO just publicly financed al-Qaeda al-Nusra ISIS to take over a bunch of
[35:37.280 --> 35:43.080]  countries and murder every Christian they can get their filthy hands on murder
[35:43.080 --> 35:47.720]  every Shiite they can get their filthy hands on murder every Alawite they can
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.480]  get their filthy hands on blow up churches chop people's heads off blow up
[35:52.480 --> 36:07.040]  Roman ruins they are a menace and then Obama gets up on TV and he cries there's
[36:07.040 --> 36:17.640]  a hundred and sixty something people that die in mass shootings area and yeah
[36:17.640 --> 36:24.080]  they can personalize each man each woman look at this poor Jewish man killed
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.920]  by a gun owner and the second amendment in San Bernardino the news said no
[36:28.920 --> 36:35.480]  mention it was a jihad and again I'm against corrupt police but the cops
[36:35.480 --> 36:41.320]  maybe kill 150 people a year questionably all I'm saying is they're
[36:41.320 --> 36:45.320]  aborting three four five million people a year I'm you know bad drug
[36:45.320 --> 36:48.080]  interactions are killing hundreds of thousands flesh-eating bacteria are
[36:48.080 --> 36:51.360]  killing hundreds of thousands every year I mean we're the issue we got
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.480]  autistic kids everywhere like a third of the kids I see walking down the
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.800]  street obviously aren't ever gonna be back home again so there's gonna be one
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.840]  in three kids aren't able to talk there's nothing going on press cancers up
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.560]  3,000% in the US oh nothing's happening there's no problem glyphosate
[37:11.560 --> 37:17.200]  basically give you cancer of the pancreas or the liver or the bladder or
[37:17.200 --> 37:26.880]  the kidneys faster and you can say coffin and he's up there we can't get
[37:26.880 --> 37:31.000]  their guns and he goes through and mentions these shootings some of them
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.320]  like Aurora that I mean the mainstream newspapers read like a born
[37:36.320 --> 37:44.960]  supremacy his dad's the top DARPA super secret scientist in the secret
[37:44.960 --> 37:49.160]  aircraft and space program for computer brain interfaces where they actually
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.800]  plug your brain in and then the Sun is in a secret high-level program and they
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.440]  got a top Air Force psychiatrist that's run whole bases meeting with him three
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.280]  four times a week and then everybody says there's a second shooter and he's in
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.240]  the jail saying they drug me they drug me I didn't do it and that comes out in
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.680]  the paper and we're not supposed to question that when the LAPD in the
[38:14.680 --> 38:28.080]  original report said sir hand sir hand was drugged and did not shoot RFK I mean
[38:28.080 --> 38:31.040]  once you see him do a few false flags you start looking at other things could
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.440]  it be we know the names of the agencies we know the names of the people from
[38:36.440 --> 38:39.880]  multiple police officer witnesses and people to survive the bombing of who
[38:39.880 --> 38:46.840]  was in the building for three days before they blew it up April 19th 1995 we
[38:46.840 --> 38:51.960]  even have the receipts world net daily got them they came out in lawsuits were
[38:51.960 --> 38:57.640]  family members of people that died sued where the head of the FBI hostage
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.720]  rescue team and others that claim that they were in Dallas until the day of the
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.160]  bombing and then they came that night they had been seen there and guess what
[39:06.160 --> 39:17.200]  they stayed at a La Quinta we know what rooms they stayed in the week before we
[39:17.200 --> 39:27.440]  know who ran Elohim City the Southern Poverty Law Center which is at a foreign
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.880]  intelligence agency front the research points to we're in trouble folks the
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.480]  same people that just overthrew Ukraine two years ago and are starting war with
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.160]  Russia and blowing up power plants and cutting the electricity and running
[39:43.160 --> 39:54.440]  around crucifying people that don't go along with it literally they're financed
[39:54.440 --> 40:00.200]  by George Soros the actual deputy president they put in two years ago
[40:00.200 --> 40:08.880]  actually give speeches where they howl Hitler it's okay because the Southern
[40:08.880 --> 40:12.360]  Poverty Law Center the ADL media matters think it's cute and funny that they
[40:12.360 --> 40:19.600]  work for a known Nazi war criminal who now will probably destroy America because
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.880]  we're so weak we're so pathetic we do whatever we're told that we're gonna
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.720]  lay down to these people and let them run all over us because we've got TV and
[40:28.720 --> 40:37.200]  entertainment and live in our own little fantasy lands but when they take
[40:37.200 --> 40:40.680]  their guns and the free speech they're going to take your pension funds they're
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.880]  going to take your social security they're going to take everything else
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.200]  later remember that if you think it's funny all you collaborators all you that
[40:51.200 --> 40:57.120]  went along with this you're destroying your own future you're bringing the
[40:57.120 --> 41:05.200]  United States of America into bondage and yourself into bondage because you
[41:05.200 --> 41:13.240]  were such lazy cowards so I hope you enjoy yourselves I hope you're proud of
[41:13.240 --> 41:20.800]  yourselves now because patriots for the last 50 years exposed this agenda and
[41:20.800 --> 41:24.160]  held it back and slowed it down and the globalists admit they're 15 years
[41:24.160 --> 41:33.160]  behind all over the world and because the military actually sees how really
[41:33.160 --> 41:37.240]  evil it is behind the scenes and even some people in federal agencies I would
[41:37.240 --> 41:41.360]  never thought this 20 years ago there's some of the most awake people and one
[41:41.360 --> 41:46.920]  of the wild cards I don't want to say ace in the hole you would all be aces in
[41:46.920 --> 41:50.560]  the hole you decide to do the right thing whether it's get info out or
[41:50.560 --> 41:58.280]  speak up or say no whatever the case is but aiding and abetting this system
[41:58.280 --> 42:03.000]  takeover is sedition against this Republic and it's never been more cut
[42:03.000 --> 42:10.640]  and dry Obama is officially acting as a dictator by every constitutional yard
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.720]  stick and he's been doing it again shutting down over a thousand power
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.520]  plants selectively letting general electric stay open to massively increase
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.760]  their profits while increasing power prices that was one of the first big
[42:24.760 --> 42:29.000]  things and then executive orders on the military and executive orders on
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.320]  agencies outside of law and executive orders on trade outside of law and TPP
[42:34.320 --> 42:40.640]  outside of law and outside of Congress and telling ice secretly three years
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.880]  ago get rid of the borders give them vouchers load the illegals on buses
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.120]  ship them into the u.s. call them children and we just kept saying it's
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.640]  lawless it's illegal Obamacare he signed how many hundreds of changes
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.800]  himself signing orders memos where he takes this law that says he can do
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.960]  whatever he wants and then changes that
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.240]  there's the quote from the Hill I am not a dictator Obama says I'm not a
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.520]  dictator president Obama said Friday while defending his efforts to stop the
[43:17.520 --> 43:26.000]  sequester I'm the president and he went on to say that he can't just act without
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.240]  Congress you can read the quote and now that you have the actual quote you
[43:29.240 --> 43:35.080]  might just look for the quote I'm not a dictator and he can find it well now a
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.520]  few years later he says we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.760]  gun control boy could you imagine a more dictatorial statement
[43:45.920 --> 43:50.800]  member Obama back in 2013 April 5th said I'm constrained by the systems our
[43:50.800 --> 43:56.680]  founders put in place we have the clip we're gonna play it in a moment but
[43:56.680 --> 44:01.960]  first let's hear the new Obama being hailed the shining eyes of the liberals
[44:01.960 --> 44:07.120]  the shining eyes of Gawker the shining eyes of the Daily Beast the shining eyes
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.560]  of MSNBC and salon saying you know what Alex Jones is dangerous we ought to shut
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.200]  him up yeah we've got those clips those articles now they're like you know what
[44:17.200 --> 44:22.040]  let's just disqualify Donald Trump you know what let's just it's good we're
[44:22.040 --> 44:25.120]  arresting the Tea Party and auditing them and putting them in jail for no
[44:25.120 --> 44:28.720]  reason and not letting them have 501c3s and going after gun groups and
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.520]  veterans groups you people are racist it's like saying you're Jews in Germany
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.840]  you deserve it you're you're a libertarian you're a Christian you did and
[44:37.840 --> 44:41.920]  they're all on power trips you look how soft and dumb they are and how their
[44:41.920 --> 44:45.280]  unemployment's way up how they're getting screwed they're not even gonna get
[44:45.280 --> 44:50.520]  anything like the black uniform Nazis got for a decade before that they all
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.000]  went straight to hell and 20 million Germans got killed you don't even get
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.800]  the power and you don't even get anything but you get to sit there and go
[44:59.800 --> 45:03.640]  along with it and love it
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.160]  Rand Paul came out and slammed the White House for saying that the president
[45:13.160 --> 45:19.840]  says Donald Trump's disqualified oh you're disqualified even Trump's rival
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.120]  Rand Paul came out and said that's very dangerous oh of course it is quote we
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.600]  can't wait for Congress to get in line with me what they're called getting in
[45:29.600 --> 45:33.000]  line for a leader
[45:33.000 --> 45:41.840]  Chalcescu, Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Vi Lenin, Julius Caesar,
[45:41.840 --> 45:48.880]  Genghis Khan, Fetal Castro, you want me to keep going on the line here?
[45:48.880 --> 45:54.800]  and they write this stuff for him this is meant to be naked better get in
[45:54.800 --> 45:59.560]  line with me I'll sign any foreign treaty and keep it secret if I want I'll
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.720]  open the border up if I want I'll take your guns if I want I'll persecute
[46:03.720 --> 46:08.000]  whistleblower media the most liberal members of the media exposing me for
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.640]  torture and war I'll sign the NDA to arrest you in the middle of the night and
[46:12.640 --> 46:18.440]  put you on a plane to fly to Romania to torture you to death cuz I'm black and
[46:18.440 --> 46:21.720]  so it's okay
[46:21.760 --> 46:26.600]  political correctness like Lewis Farrakhan sitting down with him two days
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.840]  ago said they put Obama in to neutralize black people and further
[46:31.840 --> 46:34.920]  enslave us it's it's incredible interview and I'm trying to get out by next
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.880]  week I'm working with them on it people say Lewis Farrakhan he's bad folks
[46:38.880 --> 46:41.760]  Lewis Farrakhan you say what you want about him he's one of the biggest black
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.320]  leaders in the world not just America people listen to him all over the world
[46:46.320 --> 46:49.560]  and he's saying we're trying to stage a revolution and he doesn't want it and
[46:49.560 --> 46:55.600]  the media is coming out saying Farrakhan wants it regardless this is good
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.240]  news this is important and he's got a lot of courage the stuff he said I went
[47:00.240 --> 47:03.680]  in there intending to do a part you know a fair report some positive some
[47:03.680 --> 47:09.160]  negative but the things he said it's like Drudge came here to say such epic
[47:09.160 --> 47:15.200]  things I'm just blessed he said some things that are just over the top epic
[47:15.200 --> 47:23.120]  but but but let's go to that clip from yesterday CNN Obama straight face and
[47:23.120 --> 47:29.560]  where's the alt cry to Congress didn't get in line with me
[47:31.080 --> 47:36.240]  Kettler until World War two was going didn't go to the Reichstag the
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.360]  Bundestag and sit up there and say you will get in line with me he'd given in
[47:41.360 --> 47:45.680]  passion speech had the people support and they'd vote for it was behind the
[47:45.680 --> 47:52.080]  scenes he'd come after if you didn't I mean you rarely even in like third world
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.080]  dictatorships they act like they're not a dictator so they get up and then the
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.680]  and then the puppets vote no no we got a president in America coming after our
[48:00.680 --> 48:04.880]  guns and in this NBC saying our kids belong to them and they're telling us
[48:04.880 --> 48:10.880]  how to talk I mean this is a cult this is bonafide folks I mean I don't have
[48:10.880 --> 48:18.880]  rhetoric to reach the level my flesh my selfishness says get out of here now get
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.520]  your family and get out of the United States sure there's nowhere to run
[48:22.520 --> 48:27.760]  long-term but my god I don't have to sit here with with a dictator that hates my
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.560]  guts I mean okay America wants to be slaves I'm out of here but you know what
[48:32.560 --> 48:35.760]  a lot of people don't want to be slaves want to be free and I've sworn I'm
[48:35.760 --> 48:43.520]  staying here to the end and I tell you it is incredible to see a president say
[48:43.520 --> 48:51.440]  we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on gun control
[48:52.200 --> 48:59.680]  get in line that's what you tell your 10 year old when you catch him smoke his
[48:59.680 --> 49:07.040]  cigarettes behind the barn your 12-year-old whatever that's what they
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.560]  tell you in third-world countries behind the scenes the dictator goes you get
[49:10.560 --> 49:17.880]  in line but America they spy on us out in the open they grope our daughters out
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.560]  in the open they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and brain damages out in
[49:21.560 --> 49:30.280]  the open and we're too stupid to see what's happening to us the show transcends
[49:30.280 --> 49:37.120]  though all the lines all the race garbage all of it and that's really what's so
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.280]  important about info wars and the responsibility we have because it doesn't
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.080]  matter if you're Vladimir Putin doesn't matter if you're a top general depending
[49:47.080 --> 49:50.680]  on the matter of your Lewis Farrakhan they listen to this show every day and
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.840]  every week Farrakhan people daily listeners Farrakhan listener every week
[49:55.840 --> 49:59.560]  you're like what does it matter who's Farrakhan listens to you Lewis Farrakhan
[49:59.560 --> 50:03.840]  has changed a lot and he says that in the interview that's what we want to do we
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.080]  want to win folks we don't want to divide and conquer we want to come together
[50:07.080 --> 50:14.920]  and say no to what's happening let's go out to break now I'm gonna come back
[50:15.120 --> 50:20.080]  with Obama just saying you're gonna get in line people say well what's he gonna
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.880]  do he's got a low approval rating how's he gonna do it it's the final chapter

[54:23.680 --> 54:32.600]  During the break, I am in just a state of grief, mourning, but also explosive will to
[54:32.600 --> 54:35.560]  resist and fight and to set my full will.
[54:35.560 --> 54:40.240]  If it's the will of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior against the enemy, God please make
[54:40.240 --> 54:41.240]  me stronger.
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.000]  Please give me the words.
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.640]  Please give me the reach to help reach more people and help others also be moved to stand
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.240]  against this evil.
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.400]  But those of us that love freedom are like high-powered, 700-horsepower cars, NASCARs.
[54:58.400 --> 55:02.840]  We can blow an engine, we can throw a rod, we can get angry, we can be mean to our family
[55:02.840 --> 55:03.840]  members, you name it.
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.800]  I mean, I have been not really mean, but super aggressive and super focused the last few
[55:09.800 --> 55:12.440]  days.
[55:12.440 --> 55:18.560]  And it's because my instincts are clean, my head screwed on straight and man, I love America
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.360]  and I watched that guy up there with his fake tears.
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.440]  I've got tears right now, even though I don't want to have tears.
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.400]  I was so angry, I made myself settle down and I'm angry because I'm so sad.
[55:28.400 --> 55:31.440]  I mean, we're really in the hands of some bad people, but of course we are.
[55:31.440 --> 55:34.880]  We sell babies, they keep them alive and sell them.
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.840]  They don't just chop them up.
[55:38.840 --> 55:41.760]  People thought I was crazy 20 years ago exposing that.
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.360]  That's the first stuff I was doing with George Woolley and the big anti-abortion Catholic
[55:46.360 --> 55:48.360]  groups here in town.
[55:48.360 --> 55:55.520]  I wasn't Catholic, but they were the ones fighting it and man, the feds would go after
[55:55.520 --> 55:58.680]  those groups that were exposing that they were keeping the babies alive to harvest their
[55:58.680 --> 55:59.680]  organs.
[55:59.680 --> 56:02.160]  I mean, of course we're in trouble, folks.
[56:02.160 --> 56:04.360]  We don't even protect babies.
[56:04.360 --> 56:07.600]  Of course they're going to take the guns.
[56:07.600 --> 56:11.840]  Of course they're going to take your pensions, idiots.
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.240]  I'm talking to those of you out there that laugh all day, all you trendies with your
[56:16.240 --> 56:22.840]  smart phones and your fun and your craft beers and the whole world, just your little funland.
[56:22.840 --> 56:30.520]  You were given all this to lull you into a false sense of security.
[56:30.520 --> 56:37.040]  Right up until every German city was burned and destroyed and 21 million were dead, Germans
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.560]  still had little free Nazi beer halls and dances and the women were told, have sex with
[56:41.560 --> 56:42.560]  everybody.
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.240]  Have sex with the factory workers, have sex with all the soldiers, 20 men a week.
[56:47.240 --> 56:48.240]  Do it.
[56:48.240 --> 56:50.360]  We're going to party.
[56:50.360 --> 56:56.680]  And because Hitler let them socially party, they fought to the end because it was okay
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.200]  now to have sex with five women a day if you wanted to.
[57:00.200 --> 57:03.920]  They know what they're doing, people, and I'm not even saying don't have sex with five
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.920]  women a day.
[57:04.920 --> 57:14.360]  But the point is they do that so you're so sexually drunk that you don't even care.
[57:14.360 --> 57:15.360]  I didn't get to the clips.
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.120]  I mean, I've got the clip here of him saying I can't be a dictator because the Constitution
[57:19.120 --> 57:26.080]  two years ago now I've got him saying Congress better get in line.
[57:26.080 --> 57:30.880]  We've had David I scheduled for months now and he's a big guest and I like him.
[57:30.880 --> 57:32.360]  He's a big open free thinker.
[57:32.360 --> 57:39.040]  That's how I guess I'm glad he's coming on, but I am going to play this dictator clips
[57:39.040 --> 57:40.200]  coming up.
[57:40.200 --> 57:47.320]  Briefly, we need funds, we're under attack constantly, which I'm not complaining about.
[57:47.320 --> 57:51.780]  But basically I'm getting stabbed politically all the time and blood's pouring out.
[57:51.780 --> 57:56.560]  But it is literal transfusions as you pray for us, spread the word and buy our products
[57:56.560 --> 58:00.980]  so as fast as they can suck blood and cut me up, the wounds are healing.
[58:00.980 --> 58:04.840]  But when you pray for us, when you buy our products, when you spread the word, we literally
[58:04.840 --> 58:06.400]  are healing as we're being attacked.
[58:06.400 --> 58:07.400]  You understand?
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.240]  This is how these wars are fought, an info war.
[58:11.240 --> 58:16.160]  And so I need you to go to infowarstore.com and I need you to buy the products, I need
[58:16.160 --> 58:17.160]  you to get aggressive.
[58:17.160 --> 58:22.800]  We got the new calendar in, only printed 10,000 of these and then they're gone 15% off everything
[58:22.800 --> 58:28.560]  ends Friday and you can get the new info war calendar for $6.95.
[58:28.560 --> 58:33.160]  It's got Leanne McAdoo as a pen up girl and fun stuff like that.
[58:33.160 --> 58:37.160]  It's really fun way to spread the word and it's got coupons in it worth thousands.
[58:37.160 --> 58:43.520]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, all right, but it's been 60 seconds, fun to see if you
[58:43.520 --> 58:44.520]  will.
[58:44.520 --> 58:46.520]  If you don't, whatever, we'll still fight.
[58:46.520 --> 58:52.160]  I will not kill you, I will not reveal you, fly, fly, fly.
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.880]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[58:56.880 --> 59:01.840]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[59:01.840 --> 59:06.960]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[59:06.960 --> 59:11.080]  sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are
[59:11.080 --> 59:14.480]  being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[59:14.480 --> 59:19.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.000]  drugs.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.920]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[59:23.920 --> 59:25.960]  that children would actually like and take.
[59:25.960 --> 59:29.520]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[59:29.520 --> 59:34.120]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[59:34.120 --> 59:39.600]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.640]  nutrients that taste great.
[59:41.640 --> 59:44.920]  Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com.
[59:44.920 --> 59:51.560]  That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[59:51.560 --> 01:00:09.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.680]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front lines of
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]  the info war.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:24.440]  Well, I'm here to tell you there are no spectators in what's coming up.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]  What's already here?
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:32.560]  You can lie to yourself and say you just stand on the sidelines.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.080]  Out here in the arena, we've got our torches and the wolves are around us.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]  We can see them.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.240]  You think you're safe in the woods?
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.920]  You think you're safe up there in the bleachers in the dark?
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:50.680]  No, I want to take this enemy on head on.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.920]  I need everybody out there to take action.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.400]  You do need to get a piece of the action.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.880]  This is your chance battle for the republic.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.680]  It's an info war.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:12.880]  The enemy wants to make it physical because politically, we have a very unpopular dictator
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.360]  and globalist frontman who's now revealing himself and their desperateness to force the
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:26.120]  agenda and to cause physical resistance so they can have a massive crackdown.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:34.200]  I'm going to be honest with folks if it goes physical.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.520]  I don't even know if I want to say what I think is going to happen, what I know is going
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.840]  to happen because I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:51.280]  I am not for a military coup in this country, but George Soros, Obama, and the rest of them,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.960]  Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, all of you, you guys have gone too far.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:03.120]  Everybody who has a brain knows you are trash and I would really advise you to back off
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.240]  right now.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.680]  Everybody knows we don't play games.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:15.560]  We don't bluff here and I just know the sense of this country and this world in the climate
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:27.080]  and you may be insulated up there on the Potomac like King George was in 1775, but we're never
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.000]  going to submit to you.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.560]  We're never going to roll over to you and we've just begun to fight.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:46.440]  We've just begun to wake up the sleeping giant and we're never going to surrender.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.440]  And as the medical tyranny gets worse and worse and as people realize they submitted
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:03:01.800]  to the system and all it gave them was death, there's not going to be anywhere safe for
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.320]  you people on the planet.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:12.240]  And I know you don't care because it's your lust to hurt us, your lust to break us, your
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:19.720]  spirits will, won't let you give up your attempt to hurt the innocence.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:30.920]  I know that I'm talking to your enforcers, many of which came from good families, many
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.400]  of which are honorable individuals who've been brought into evil incrementally until
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.240]  they woke up one day and didn't know who they were anymore.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:48.440]  The fact that you don't know who you are, the fact that you still are scared shows you've
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:55.520]  still got a soul left and it's never too late until you've totally given yourself over
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520]  to evil.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:04.960]  It's never too late when you still have that whisper of conscience to turn back.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.680]  So many of you have joined this system because you're scared or you want to belong or you
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.000]  got into it and now you don't know where you are.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.640]  The danger isn't going along with this.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.120]  The danger is submitting to globalism.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:29.920]  Globalism is eugenics, it's scientific tyranny, technocracy in their words.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.800]  The public Builderberg meeting, Davos, the last two years running, they say we are dictatorial,
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800]  we are technocratic.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.960]  Remember that article and now for world government five years ago, six years ago in the Financial
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.920]  Times of London, we're the editor.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:53.160]  Our editor says yes, we're authoritarians and we are going to take your freedoms because
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160]  we know best.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.880]  Then you look at what they're trying to set up and it's a nightmare.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.600]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.040]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient and we're going
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.000]  to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.640]  When critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away,
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:25.440]  simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder,
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:32.160]  which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient and hostile
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.400]  behavior toward authority.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:41.120]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.120]  smart guns.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.400]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.680]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.760]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.640]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?

[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:22.520]  Joining us about 20 minutes into the next hour is one of the other leading questioners
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:30.720]  of official thought, and that is David Ike from the UK.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.360]  He'll be joining us here in about three, four minutes from now.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.560]  In fact, we have him now, as a lot of TV viewers can see right there.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:45.520]  We are also simulcasting the radio show, as we've done in the last 16, 17 years, at infowars.com
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.080]  forward slash show.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.800]  I know it gets confusing for some people out there because they hear me talking about put
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.080]  this on screen, put that on screen.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.680]  I would go out and shoot video of UN signs at parks, show the treaty, saying it means
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.480]  they own and control the property around it, UNESCO, people would say I was a liar.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.680]  So I said, well, we'll just start making the radio show, a TV show, as well so we could
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.960]  physically show people things, and that's one of the things that we pioneered and were
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960]  proud of.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:20.320]  Folks, we set up David Ike about a month ago on the show because he's been very busy and
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.520]  because he's being persecuted, they try to keep him from traveling to Canada, they try
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.560]  to keep him from traveling to Australia to give a speech to thousands of people.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:35.800]  He's a guy that's filled stadiums with upwards of 20,000 people I know, if memory serves,
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:40.400]  and whose books have been read by tens of millions, videos seen by hundreds of millions.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.520]  And you notice they want to ban Donald Trump from traveling to the UK now, the government's
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]  looking at it.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.200]  They want to say if the IRS claims they're going to investigate you, no judge, no jury,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.200]  you just can't fly in America.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:00.000]  Obama says he wants to apply that same legalese, he's a constitutional lawyer, what a joke,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.600]  to gun owners, you're not a criminal, they won't tell you why, you're just put on a list.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.680]  This is the essence of 1984, Kafka asked, the essence of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany,
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:18.080]  but he's a constitutional lawyer, so the press all laughs and giggles and smiles at him because
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.480]  I'm going to play these clips right now, it all ties into the classical tyranny we're
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:27.120]  witnessing, regardless of what you think about guns.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:33.480]  The president's protected by guns and taxpayer money, Michael Moore's got bodyguards.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.440]  They're funding ISIS with weapons to carry out all these crimes and then crying about
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.960]  the few hundred people that die a year in mass shootings, statistically very low.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.640]  But notice Obama said on April 5th, 2013, I'm constrained by the system our founders
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.200]  put in place, I'd like to be able to restrict this but I can't.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.200]  Well he said yesterday and we're going to play this clip, we can't wait for Congress
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:04.280]  to get in line with me on gun control, in line with me, can't get them to restrict guns
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:12.680]  in Congress, FBI admits crime rates down upwards of 60-something percent since 1992, I kept
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.800]  saying 51, Professor Locke came on and said no it's really about 61.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.360]  But regardless even the LA Times admit gun crime way down as gun ownership goes up because
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:27.920]  the criminals are afraid, the places that are super dangerous are New York, DC, Chicago
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.880]  where there are no legitimate gun owners and then the criminals just run crazy.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.200]  But regardless, we are a violent barbaric society but they want to be the only ones
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.560]  with the monopoly of power as the UN said.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.880]  So this ties into what David, I've been talking about where he's never said one racist thing
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]  about anybody.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:54.360]  He's what I'd call a classical liberal, the former head of the Green Party, been given
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:12:00.520]  awards by major African tribes in Africa, you name it, and they're now taking people
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.120]  off international satellite because they quote said something bad about Israel, have articles
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.200]  today, people say well good, that's anti-Semitic, no, then you take everybody's free speech
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.400]  away, don't you see folks, they're going after all of our rights, illegal spying, saying
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.880]  we don't have medical rights, it's happening, want to play these clips, they go to David
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.920]  Ike because it sets the table for everything that's happening, Obama, let's go back to
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:27.120]  April of 2013 when he said this, he's not a dictator, here it is.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:33.240]  You hear some of these quotes, I need a gun to protect myself from the government.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:44.960]  We can't do background checks because the government's going to come take my guns away.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.960]  The government's us.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.960]  Oh really?
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:57.720]  The foreign insurance companies that wrote Obama are you.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:04.240]  They are elected by you, I am elected by you, I'm constrained as they are constrained by
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:11.640]  a system that our founders put in place, it's a government of and by and for the people.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.480]  And so surely we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:29.920]  elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent another
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:39.080]  group of families from grieving the way the families of Aurora or Newtown or Columbine
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.080]  have grieved.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.800]  All right, so he's constrained by the system our founders put in place, he's not a dictator,
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:53.720]  fast forward two years and he says we can't wait for Congress to get in line with me on
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720]  gun control.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.200]  So he's admitting he's violating the system, he's violating the law, here it is.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:05.320]  Now I want to be clear, Congress still needs to act.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.160]  The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:27.480]  Once Congress gets on board with common sense gun safety measures, we can reduce gun violence
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]  a whole lot more.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.680]  Like it did in Chicago, made it the worst in the world.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.200]  But we also can't wait.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.880]  Oh, you can't wait, oh, okay.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.400]  Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:47.880]  within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence to save more lives.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.240]  Actions that protect our rights and our kids.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:15:00.440]  After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:08.520]  series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]  had in place.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.520]  Okay.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.400]  And there are some executive actions you could argue they could do, but these are national
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.360]  registration, not letting you transfer weapons, making a biometrics on them and microstamping
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.400]  that bankrupts everything and doesn't work, and saying we can just put you on a mental
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.720]  health list or a no fly list and then a no gun by list, just like David Ike.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.420]  Oh, David, you can't fly to Canada, you can't fly to Australia because you write books about
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:35.080]  a world government coming, but now the Pope announces world government.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.360]  Now they openly announced they want war with Russia.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.880]  Everything David Ike's basically been writing about is now unfolding.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.720]  So they've got a problem, David, I guess now they just need to shut us up.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.000]  You've been doing this 20 plus years, I've been doing it 20 years, you longer than I.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.040]  I mean, wow, it is really happening.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.640]  You said 2016 would be all hell break loose.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.680]  You wrote that 10 years ago, but you said that would be the beginning of the end of
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680]  their system.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.760]  Do you still stand by that?
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.600]  Because I mean, I certainly hope you're right, it's the beginning of the end.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.400]  You've been proven right in your predictions.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.760]  I just hope your latter predictions are right as well, David Ike.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.080]  Well, Alex, you'll have to forgive me.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.000]  First of all, I'm not feeling too good because I'm suffering from a oppositional defiant disorder
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.040]  apparently is catching.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:30.720]  And we are facing, I would suggest, three years that will decide which way this goes.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:39.480]  I think 2016, 2017, and 2018 are going to be pivotal years in deciding where this world
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.800]  goes.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:51.080]  Because if we allow the system to go on, the agenda to go on unchecked, then by the end
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.720]  of 2018, 2019, we're going to be looking at something that's going to be very difficult
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.920]  to turn around.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:05.480]  But if we start to awaken, and the great news, Alex, is that in greater and greater numbers,
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:12.960]  people are beginning to reassess the world and reassess themselves and reassess life.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.520]  And what's giving me tremendous encouragement is where these people are coming from.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.600]  They're coming from within the system now.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.520]  That's my personal experience anyway.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.680]  They're people who would never have questioned anything before.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.960]  And then suddenly they're looking at it and concepts that would have been totally alien
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.160]  to them a very short time ago are now starting to make sense.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.640]  And I said many years ago, there's going to come a time when this agenda is going to
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.160]  have to break the surface.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.760]  People would not believe how long this has been going on.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.520]  This is not a modern thing.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:59.440]  This has been going on generation after generation after generation, as the ground has been prepared
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.040]  for this global fascist or well-earned state.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.400]  And in that period, it's been able to stay under the radar.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.880]  It's been able to manipulate in the shadows.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.240]  It's been able to get things ready to be played out in the public arena.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:26.880]  But of course, if you are going to actually make your world happen, then at some point
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.120]  you have got to start playing those things out from the shadows into the public arena
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120]  where we can see them.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.640]  And that's where we are now.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:41.120]  Now that shows that the agenda has moved on, but there's another aspect to this.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:47.720]  This is a very, very dangerous time for the agenda and those behind it.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.280]  Because they can't hide anymore.
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:56.040]  It's in your face and it's impacting on people's lives.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:05.160]  And what we need to do in this alternative independent arena is to redouble and redouble
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:13.080]  our efforts to present to the widest possible audience another narrative, another explanation
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:22.480]  of world events, which challenge the random presentation of its all random events and
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.120]  show how it all fits together.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:33.320]  Show how 9-11 and what's happening in Syria, gun control laws and mass immigration out
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.280]  of the Middle East into Europe is all connected.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.120]  They're all dominoes in the same line.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:51.080]  And when people take the trouble to read or listen to this narrative, as I know from
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.680]  personal experience, it makes far more sense of the world than that it's all a random accident
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.680]  and the...
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.200]  And David, it goes further than that now.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.920]  It's happening by chance.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.600]  It goes further, as you know, Brzezinski writes books, Kissinger writes books, the White
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.600]  Owl Science are writes books, the head of the Kissinger group writes books, they write
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.360]  books and admit, okay, there are too many of you, okay, we are putting stuff in the
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.280]  water, okay, we are going to merge with machines and become gods, okay, we are trying to create
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.200]  black holes and play God at CERN.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.560]  I mean, what's crazy is they've gone from denying it where I've had the host of ABC
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.320]  News here in Nightline and I show him six or seven clips of world leaders calling for
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.320]  world government just five years ago and he looks at me and he goes, that's a different
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.600]  world government than the one you're talking about, to now they go, yes, world government's
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.760]  here, it's run by private banks, but still you're a kook and you're bad and you need
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.880]  to be arrested.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:52.720]  I mean, it's so bizarre to see how many people are awakening, including world leaders and
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.640]  people and very prominent folks and people in the system, as you said, that's what I'm
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:03.360]  saying, in the system of all places, but then the general public large swaths, like, get
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.880]  off on it and want to join with it, even though it hurts them, it's like they're nihilistic
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:15.200]  and they're in a trance, like Lemmings running off a cliff, it's quite a paradox.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.640]  Well, you know, I've just got a new book that's just come out, it's called Fans Himself and
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:32.840]  the subtitle is How to Find the Real One and what I show there is the scale of programming,
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:38.120]  perception programming, that starts when you leave the womb.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:47.000]  So by the time you get into the adult world, if you have not opened your mind to see beyond
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.680]  the norms you've been programmed to accept is reality, then the only fix, the only way
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.800]  that you can understand the world is on the basis of the perception programming that you've
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:10.840]  – well, it's literally downloaded and so if you come out of the womb, you are then
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:18.560]  influenced by parents, not parents overwhelmingly that do it from a malevolent point of view,
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.960]  they have been programmed by going through the same system I'm just going to quickly
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:29.120]  describe and thus they have taken on these perceptions of reality and they then pass
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:36.760]  them on to the young child and now of course, at an earlier and earlier age, the state is
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:42.600]  getting control of children from the earlier and earlier ages, I mean, we've got a guy
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:48.960]  in the education establishment in Britain a year or so ago called for children to start
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.920]  school at two.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:57.800]  So immediately you come out of the womb, you have a short time, overwhelming with parents
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.160]  that are passing on the programming because that's what they've taken on and then you
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:08.760]  hit the system, suddenly as a small child, you are sitting in a chair in a classroom
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.040]  and an authority figure is telling you what's right, what's wrong, what's real, what's
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.360]  not real, when you can go to the toilet, when you have to be there, when you can go home,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:25.560]  schools, I mean, it's like I say, take a deep breath, take a step back, look at it again,
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:31.920]  schools are prisons for children, but they're worse than that, they are programming centers
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.720]  and prisons for children.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:38.280]  And if you go further back and look at it, at least before, you might have different
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:44.480]  teachers, different ideas in school, but the new systems are dumbing them down, physically
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.120]  the IQ is going down, not just the education, they're openly scrambling the education two
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.160]  plus two equals five to literally fry their brains and it's not even different teachers
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:02.640]  now, it's globally UNESCO approved UN curricula under treaty worldwide in over 90% of the
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:10.720]  schools on the planet, literally teaching them how to be mental midget conformist morons
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.000]  who are never conscious and will accept whatever the new contradictory download is.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.600]  Exactly, well Bill Gates is involved in that in America and anything Bill Gates is in is
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:26.040]  the agenda, you look at everything that he's involved in, it's like a wish list for the
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.920]  agenda that he's funding through his foundation with his misses.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.720]  But this education foundation of the program is so vital because you go on to college and
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:44.040]  you go on to university, or many people do, and then from that base programming, this
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:51.000]  is the world, this is reality, this is how it is, and I've debated Alex many times at
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:59.480]  Oxford University and this is the elite university in Britain and I've not been asked a challenging
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:05.920]  question, the level of programming is extraordinary and then what happens?
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.920]  From that base programming, people go out to be doctors, they go out to be scientists,
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.920]  they go out to be politicians, they go out to be journalists, and from that base programming
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.760]  they're all coming unless they become in any way conscious beyond the program, they are
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.640]  viewing the world the same way.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.880]  So where do the mainstream media go to get a fix on reality when they actually bother
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.440]  to question it at all?
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.600]  They go to scientists or the systems scientists, they go to the systems doctors when they want
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:45.760]  to talk about health and anyone who's outside of that program's sense of everything, medicine,
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:53.400]  science, politics, economics, they are by definition a kook because they are outside
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  the norm.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:02.080]  This is how it works and it's extraordinary, the level of programming, and I would say
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.960]  this, I've said it before in the books, you know, I think there's a very good chance
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:13.240]  that the level of programming is such, the level of perception program is such that vast
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:19.280]  numbers of people, possibly the vast majority, go through an entire lifetime without an original
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.760]  thought or emotional response that hasn't come from the program.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:28.200]  And if people just ask themselves the question, what do I believe?
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.160]  And then ask the next question, why do I believe it?
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:39.240]  Where does it come from? and it will invariably have come from some aspect or some expression
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.720]  of the system and like the Nazis said, you know, give me the child to the age of seven
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.120]  and I'll show you the man, well, they have control of young people now well beyond the
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120]  age of seven.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.800]  And as you rightly say, what we're seeing is, you know, I'm coming up 64, so I was born
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:04.360]  in 1952, I remember the education system as it was in the 50s, and I've seen it change.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:11.320]  This is why our generations are so pivotal in what's happening because we have a point
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.520]  of reference before this got really, really extreme.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.200]  And thus we can see how extreme it is.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.480]  And what's happening with the education system is it's, and again, because of what I said
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.480]  earlier,
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.600]  you see where it's going, oh, you can't have to be a cowboy or a native at Halloween, let's
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.440]  just ban Halloween altogether or ban paper bags, they're hateful, or ban the name Boyer
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.840]  Girl or ban Lynch Hall because it's scary and we all look at that and say that's crazy.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  It's not.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:46.520]  They're getting rid of all the words just like George Arwell warned was the was the plan
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.400]  to where we can't even communicate with these people and they're going to grow up in a system
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.480]  where they have no bearing or no idea or even any sense.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.240]  I mean, they could tell young people that women never had babies, say, vaginally, and
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.680]  I think they would believe that cesarean section was the way babies were born or that women
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]  never breastfed.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.680]  I mean, in the world they're bringing in, they're basically looking at women like they're
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.720]  crazy now if they don't want to have a cesarean up front or if they want to breastfeed the
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.960]  act like it's weird.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:21.360]  I mean, everything normal, everything natural is supposedly evil because you're right.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.440]  We're all in a giant prison.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.920]  We're being forced in to the physical matrix with the virtual reality helmets we're going
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.200]  to put on and the Pentagon admits that's the plan.
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:38.960]  So why would insiders, David, who know where this really leads, want to be for this because
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.240]  they're promised they're going to be part of the power structure in the future?
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.560]  Well, there's a few things I'd like to say about what you just said, because I think
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:53.560]  there's some points there to go with, but in terms of what you just asked, there is
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:29:05.400]  a major incentive for such people in the sense of being frightened not to go with it.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:11.720]  If you've seen consequences for others of not going with something, then if your backbone
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:19.840]  is not made of steel, then you will go with something that merely out of self-preservation.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.280]  And then there's the other incentive that if you go with it, there are rewards for that.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:30.000]  I want to stay there, David, DavidIke, DavidIke.com is our guest, iconic author, researcher, outside
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.080]  the box, kingpin.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.320]  We're going to come back and talk about what he just started mentioning.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:39.320]  You know, China, they're bringing the system here where you have a social score for going
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.080]  along with the system, or you can't buy or sell.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:48.360]  It's called the mark of the beast, you might have heard of it.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:59.320]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:04.120]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:10.160]  poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.680]  top problems.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.680]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:23.000]  problems were in 2015, and out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.400]  ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:30.920]  In comparison, 16% of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.000]  13% said the economy.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.080]  8% said unemployment and another age said immigration.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.880]  But rather than working on these hot button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:47.080]  media would rather focus on gun control, with a president even stating that he wants to
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:52.480]  quote, make gun control part of his legacy end quote, according to CNN.

[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.920]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920]  of brain force.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.320]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives, staring
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.520]  at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.600]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.600]  It doesn't have stimulus.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:47.600]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.760]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:05.240]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.160]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:14.000]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.720]  It's grown into info wars, nightly news, and so much more.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.800]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.720]  for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.800]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's.

[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.520]  Revere in your community.

[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:20.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.840]  Welcome back.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.840]  Alex Jones here, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.440]  David Eich is our guest with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.840]  Former U.S. Attorney Clinton could face criminal indictment.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.760]  We're going to cover that after David Eich leaves us.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.480]  North Korea claims to have fully successfully miniaturized a hydrogen bomb and tested it.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.600]  They've been proven to be liars before.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:45.080]  Pentagon avoids the word combat after another American soldier dies in Afghanistan.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.640]  Study Obama has issued more restrictive executive orders in the past six administrations.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.240]  Combined, he's been a bigger enemy of the press.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.160]  Studies show that any other president, Trump says he will not let Obama screw with the
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.520]  Second Amendment.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.280]  That's some of what's coming up, about to go back to David Eich and get into the point
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.240]  that he was making and that it ties together with the future.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.160]  They just say if you criticize government, criticize corporations, don't play ball.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.400]  You just can't get on an airplane.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.400]  You can't travel.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.400]  You can't live.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.400]  You don't get good credit.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.240]  Your behavior now will affect your social and physical credit.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.560]  This is the model that actually was developed here, but deployed and tested in China that
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.280]  David Eich was starting to get into.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.480]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.440]  But the good news is never lower approval ratings for government, never more resistance
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.960]  to the system.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.400]  They push abortion, abortion's unpopular now all over the world.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.360]  Was popular just 30, 40 years ago is the new trendy thing.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  Gun control was more popular than not 30, 40 years ago.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.920]  Now it's very unpopular.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.760]  The polls show it.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.800]  So the good news is there is an awakening of a large group of people of every race,
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  color and creed happening.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.160]  I mean, you know, we've got Matt Drudge listening pretty much every day.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.720]  I mean, he told me he listens every day.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.720]  I'm flattered.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.120]  We've got, I know for a fact, a lot of the Russian high command government people, Vladimir
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.000]  Putin reported listens and likes the show.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.720]  I was told this years ago, shouldn't be so critical of Putin about, you know, this and
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  that.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.720]  You know, he likes your show.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720]  Then I was like, yeah, yeah, right.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.000]  Till I heard it from a bunch of high level Russians and now you see the type of media
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.560]  they have in Russia talking about vaccines will kill you, you know, cancer's way up because
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:22.320]  a glyphosate, we're banning GMO, it's a global warming's a global government carbon tax to
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.120]  destroy nation states and kill billions.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.280]  I mean, it's not just that, you know, they're Alex Jones listeners.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.240]  They are tuning into the reality.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.400]  It makes sense to them.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.360]  Then they learn more and then they basically get outside the box.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  It's very exciting.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:44.280]  Now, speaking of outside the box, we have the new 2016 calendar in and we've only got
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.800]  10,000 of these and we sell them at cost.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:54.880]  There's 695 and there are literally thousands of dollars of coupons on water filtration,
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:04.680]  on GMO seeds, shortwave radios, all the nutraceuticals, t-shirts, you name it.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:11.600]  And yes, Leanne McAdoo, her idea as a B-52 pent up girl and she really pulls it off.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.200]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:23.640]  So you need to get it just for the coupons alone info wars store.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.600]  We sold out of the 10,000 in just about two weeks last year, but I hope we'll just get
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.240]  it to then give to friends and family also who may not be awake to what's happening.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.800]  Say, Hey, here's a free calendar.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.000]  Just like a prison planet.tv membership, we're going to end this special next week.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.240]  Never had six months free, but I really want to get more people tuning into prison planet.tv.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.120]  20 people can use each membership.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.840]  See the nightly news, all the films.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.120]  It's a platform we have that they can't censor as easily.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:54.480]  And they can shut it down, we had a big, big hack attacks last week, obviously, just got
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.240]  our Twitter back yesterday.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:03.640]  So six months free right now at prisonplanet.tv, but the big special is 15% off everything
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.920]  until Friday and infowarstore.com.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:16.360]  The hundreds and hundreds of items with promo code GIFT15, 15% off and there's 15% off as
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.600]  well, again, on things like brain force and supermobile vitality and survival shield X2.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.040]  They're hitting you with the bad halogens.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.360]  This is the cleanest, purest, true form of iodine out there blocks the bad halogens,
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.400]  helps me detoxify the energy you name it, talk about a game changer, nothing like the
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.480]  X2 infowarslife.com and bare minimum.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.480]  Just try it out.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.360]  You're supporting the broadcast and now is a great time to do it with 15% off.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.800]  We have the New Year's resolution pack.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.800]  It's got specials as well.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.280]  So we've got specials with the 15% on top of it, we're running a bunch of specials
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  as well.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:55.920]  So infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and please also support our local AM and FM affiliates,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.360]  support their local sponsors, become a sponsor, spread the word as well.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.160]  Don't take it for granted that you're able to hear this.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  Don't take it for granted.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.720]  They are pushing worldwide to censor.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.440]  They are coming in with these systems David Eich talked about.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:14.000]  He's getting blocked all over the world traveling when there isn't one racist thing ever said.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.560]  But let's say he said racist stuff.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.560]  He should be able to travel.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.680]  You know, again, I'm not against Muslims in general, I'm going to get into this, but
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.720]  the clash of civilizations is happening to the point Lewis Faircon, the tape is coming
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.320]  out, we're going to put it out very soon, interviewed him two days ago, said we have
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.240]  to block people coming in from the Middle East because we know they're bringing terrorists
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.960]  in on purpose to bring in martial law.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.880]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.200]  They took over Syria, they brought in the terrorists, and then now they're going to
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.120]  bring them here to demonize everybody and take everybody's freedoms.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:50.960]  I mean, it's a really sophisticated problem and reaction solution situation.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.960]  But David, it's here.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.440]  Like you said, the shoe is dropping, you've got the floor, please continue with your point.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.160]  You were getting into how they are going to try to demonize folks, how they're going to
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.120]  reward others that play ball.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:08.440]  But again, it's an evil spider, a monster, as you've said, at the center of the web.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.560]  You can't make a deal with this.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.560]  Can you, David?
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:19.960]  Well, no, and, you know, it's simple what is happening.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:26.680]  You are seeking to bring in a centralized global fascist communists, whatever you like,
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:33.920]  and people living in those situations, they're the same really, or well-earned global states
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:43.840]  in which you have 24-7 surveillance and your freedoms are basically zero.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.480]  Now to bring that in, you can't just come out and say, okay, we've had a meeting, this
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.160]  is what we're going to do.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:58.200]  You have to create in the public mind the reasons why you're doing it.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.440]  And because those reasons are not genuine, you have to make them up.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:11.480]  In other words, you are bringing in your global fascist system by lying and lying and lying.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.480]  Now that's one side of it.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:21.720]  But of course, what lies are very vulnerable to, to say the least, is the truth.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.720]  So you've got a double whammy, you've got two fronts.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:34.200]  One is to lie to the public so that you have your excuses to bring in your global system.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:39.040]  And two, you've got to shut up those that are speaking the truth and thus exposing the
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.040]  lie.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.080]  And that's what we're seeing.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.080]  That's why.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.880]  And this is an important point, where does the real power lie?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:48.880]  It lies with the truth.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.960]  It doesn't lie with the lies.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.040]  You can see behind me how big this room is.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:00.280]  This is my little office where I do all my work and have done so for 10, 12 years turning
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.440]  out the books and all the rest of it.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:11.240]  And I'm currently sitting 13,000 miles away from the Australian government, one bloke.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:17.880]  And yet, they are seeking to delay and delay a speaking visa, where I'm supposed to speak
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:25.320]  in a number of Australian cities in July, because they fear the information that I'm
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.760]  going to circulate.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:33.080]  And Australia, I mean, there was an Australian politician said in Parliament, or a video
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:40.200]  I saw this week, he is saying Australia is in a pre-police state situation.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.800]  I would take the pre-away, if you look at what's happening in Australia, with a situation.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:52.480]  So another take a breath, take a step back, look at it again, in which people are being
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.880]  denied benefits from the government if they don't have their children vaccinated, according
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.360]  to the government's vaccination schedule.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:08.200]  Now if anyone wants the definition of a tyranny, then give me one better than that.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:14.000]  But what they don't want, because that's the lie, that's bringing in the system, they don't
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.080]  want the truth to challenge the lie.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.520]  And the fact that they are frightened of me coming into their country and just talking
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:32.600]  about three, four events, when I'm just one bloke, just shows the power of information.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.680]  And I'm looking at that headline now.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:42.720]  This is a point that I want to pick up from what you were talking about earlier.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:50.360]  The number of people at the centre of this global web who are doing this in full knowledge
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:56.400]  and awareness of what they're doing is very, very small.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:07.000]  And they have to manipulate other people to play out their desires, their agenda, called
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.280]  government administrators and politicians and others.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.520]  They have to manipulate people in uniform to impose their agenda once the laws have
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.320]  been passed by others.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:28.880]  And they have to keep people in the dark of what is actually going on.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:35.520]  And to do that, given there's seven billion people in the world, you have to enlist through
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:42.640]  manipulation and programming large numbers of those people to police each other.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:52.560]  An analogy I used many years ago is that people laugh at sheep because they run from the sheep
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.400]  dog and follow the one in front.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.640]  But humanity in large numbers has outsheep the sheep.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:04.920]  At least the sheep need a sheep dog to keep them in line.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.440]  Humans keep each other in line.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.840]  And of course, that is the whole foundation of what's called political correctness, which
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:20.480]  is the insane seeking to silence the intelligence, the intelligent in my view.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.960]  And they're moving on every front.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:22.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.680]  And it's getting more and more extreme when I read what's happening in the United States
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:27.680]  universities.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.680]  It's extraordinary.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:34.800]  But what they're doing is recruiting the slaves to enslave the slaves.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.920]  And this is what political correctness is.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:40.440]  You start out here and you have debate.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.000]  You have different views.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.480]  You have people having access to different views and different information and having
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:52.440]  the right, oh my goodness me, they'll call the police to make a decision on that information.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:57.800]  And then political correctness is squeezing it and squeezing it in league with other situations
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:04.280]  until what's left is only the official version of everything, which is the lie.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:11.320]  And what's amazing is that people who would otherwise say, oh, yeah, freedom of speech.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.320]  When someone says something they don't like, instead of saying, well, actually, I think
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:22.000]  that's wrong because the response is always, ban them, ban them, silence them.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.760]  And anyone who says that, and there's many on the left who say that, of course, all
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:31.440]  the time, don't tell me you are in favor of a free society.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:37.720]  Don't tell me you believe in freedom because you are a key part of the tyranny.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.240]  Without people like you, the few in the background who are running the tyranny couldn't play
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.240]  the tyranny out.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:49.800]  Wake up before you, in the end, become a victim of the tyranny.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.080]  And so do your children and grandchildren.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.720]  Well, David, that's absolutely right.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:46:00.440]  And again, places like MSNBC and Salon now openly say, arrest Alex Jones, shut him up.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.360]  They go, it's great that the IRS is harassing the Tea Party and Christian groups and veterans
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.560]  groups and auditing them.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.680]  They're evil racists.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.280]  They deserve to be shut down.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.920]  A, they're not racist.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.040]  But even if they were, they're on TV saying, let's persecute people when they would have
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.040]  crucified Richard Nixon for doing one 1,000th of it.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.400]  They're so totalitarian, but they call themselves liberal.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.600]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.800]  We saw great tyranny move forward under the Republicans and Bush.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.040]  But now under Obama, even liberal constitutional lawyers like Jonathan Turley say it's about
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:37.920]  triple what Bush did, because he can get away with so much more.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.880]  And again, we knew there was a clash of civilizations.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.400]  You spoke about PNAC day one.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:46.320]  I spoke about it even before 9-11, the clash of civilizations.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.800]  But it doesn't mean it isn't real once they start it.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.880]  And they're bringing in radical Wahhabist Sunnis back by Saudi Arabia, do they allow
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.320]  to colonize the Middle East and Africa?
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.440]  They're now colonizing here.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.160]  And we're told by the left now, in fact, a German mayor in the Green Party after 35
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.800]  women were raped in public.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.400]  It translates in German to they shouldn't dress like that, and it's their fault they
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.080]  got raped.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.640]  And this is a big feminist liberal.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.680]  So now feminists say Western men, where women were empowered, the best place in the world
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.320]  historically for women, that's bad.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:31.080]  But radical Islam, sexual mutilation, Wahhabist cult garbage is allied with sickening weird
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:37.640]  feminist who are now basically saying women of Germany are like hors d'oeuvres on the
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.240]  table for all these military-age men pouring in with fake passports.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.040]  They're letting planes come into the U.S.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.040]  No one is checked.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:53.000]  That's that CBS News, New York Daily News, I mean, even leftist publications are reporting
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.360]  that they don't even check the ID, but when I fly back into the U.S., they pull me in
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:02.160]  a room and interrogate me and tear through everything I've got for political reasons.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.240]  I mean, it's so clear.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:12.880]  Well, it might be a good point to get into this whole situation with migration into Europe
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:21.440]  and also get back to this section that I'm presenting of the program.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:30.920]  You see, people's beliefs in a world of programming are usually programs.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:36.680]  Many years ago now, back in the 1990s, I was in the old city of Jerusalem next to the Big
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:43.480]  Mosque, and I was watching some Muslim kids play football, and the old city of Jerusalem
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.480]  is a very small area, but it's broken up into four quarters.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.320]  There's a Christian quarter, a Muslim quarter, a Jewish quarter, and an Armenian quarter.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:49:00.960]  I was looking around at these different people, and it occurred to me, the truth, that each
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:07.840]  of them in this small area called the old city of Jerusalem had been born into one of
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.720]  these quarters, and by the age of these kids, seven, eight were playing football, they would
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.320]  have a certain view of the world, a certain view of themselves, a certain view of what
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:25.240]  they call God, a certain view of spirituality, a certain view of themselves.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:32.240]  Had those same kids been born in the Christian quarter or the Jewish quarter, they would
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.760]  at the same age have downloaded a different program and thus would have had a different
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.520]  view of all the things that I've just listed.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:49.520]  What we need to do is realize that we are being, and I say this to every belief, I say
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:50:01.040]  this to every religion, I say this to every color and creed, if you put your belief first
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:10.240]  and the need for your belief to prevail first, then you are setting yourself up and your
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:16.800]  children up to be played off against other beliefs that put their beliefs first and think
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.760]  their beliefs must prevail first, and you are played against each other in a massive divide
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.760]  and rule.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:30.120]  And if we look at what's happening in Europe, see, things are never black and white, they're
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.120]  always shades of gray.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:35.240]  Stay there David Ike, stay there, I want to come back and we'll talk about this, look,
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.120]  look, we're against the class of civilizations, we don't want to kill the Muslims, we understand
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.400]  they're playing us off against each other, but regardless now, they're not bringing,
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:47.000]  you know, the friendly groups in, they're bringing radicals in for a clash, and I know
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.960]  you agree David, so what's behind that, what's coming down the road next, I'm Alex Jones
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.520]  with DavidIke, DavidIke.com's this site, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com are our site, spread
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.020]  the word.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:03.240]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year, just this past August
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.680]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River, I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn,
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.840]  he hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years, his excuse, he simply couldn't afford it,
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:14.440]  he wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:19.400]  At less than $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would have been the perfect alternative for
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.400]  my father.

[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.240]  diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.360]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.960]  unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.960]  How is this even possible? Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:23.200]  special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:27.720]  Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:32.200]  their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past. Previously,
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.720]  this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time, the creator
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:41.520]  of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.080]  conservative friends. All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.

[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:12.320]  The GOP is scrambling for a response to Obama's gun control actions, well led by the speaker
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.440]  of the house. You know, they'll drop the ball and do nothing. I mean, impeachment is the
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:19.920]  only answer. The president came out and said, Congress better get in line with me. I'm doing
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:26.440]  all this with executive action. National registries, no fly list, not letting you have guns. I
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:32.760]  mean, the no fly list is pure tyranny. Doesn't keep us safe. By the way, getting into this
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:38.120]  whole Muslim issue, I'm the guy before 9-11 happened that came out and exposed it and
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.840]  said it's a plan to invade the Middle East and enslave and they kick out all the moderate
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.960]  leaders that let the women go to college and they're freer and they, you know, Saudi Arabia
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:49.080]  is involved in the attack. So we attack Iraq. I mean, I know where David's going to go
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:53.600]  with this because he wants to bring all of humanity together. And so do I. That said,
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:55:00.200]  some of the greatest tyranny in the world is Saudi Arabian, Wahhabist versions of Sunni
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.560]  Islam. And I know David's traveled the world. He, I'm going to get his take on this, but
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:10.400]  I just want to be clear on this. We tried to stop this clash of civilizations so they
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:13.720]  would then flood us with these people. And the argument is, well, we bombed them. Now
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.440]  they're here. This isn't really the Iraqis and folks. So the Christians, they're not
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.920]  letting them in. These are the people, the pilgrims that went to invade Syria that got
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.960]  their butts kicked. They're now coming here. And that's what the numbers show. So I'm asking
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  David Ike, if he agrees with that B, what he thinks the big master plan is with all this,
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.400]  because David Ike has shown, he can really predict how this stuff is going to fall, how
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.720]  the dominoes are going to fall. His new book available at davidike.com gets into finding
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:49.160]  the true self. We'll talk about that more in the next hour with him as well. But David,
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:51.920]  we got five minutes till break. Go ahead.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:59.600]  Well, I want to get back to this fact that it's not black and white. And we have in the
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:05.720]  Middle East, and I've been there a number of times, some of the nicest, most peaceful
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:11.120]  people you'll ever meet in your life, some of the most friendly, some of the most courteous
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:18.280]  and decent people. You also have in the Middle East, some of the most monumental, unspeakable
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.720]  evil involved in any country in the world. And I'm talking not just about Saudi Arabia,
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:30.640]  though that's one of them, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, all these countries who are
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:36.320]  working in league with the United States and Europe to bring about catastrophe in the
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:42.840]  Middle East. And I was writing many years ago now about the plan to divide the Sunnis
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  against the Shia.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.000]  You wrote 15 years ago about the plan to start a civil war.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:55.720]  Yeah. And this is what's happening. And once you realize the game, apparent contradictions
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:01.960]  make absolute sense. Because what you would think is the people like Cameron and Obama
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:09.640]  and all these other people who are condemning dictatorships, though they run them virtually,
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:18.800]  and violence, who say we must bomb Syria and Libya and Iraq to get rid of tyrants, are
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:27.800]  in bed with tyrants in Bahrain, in Saudi Arabia. And people go, I don't understand, that's
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:31.840]  hypocrisy, but it is hypocrisy. If you've got a mind of your own, and you're coming
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:38.440]  from a position of wanting a better world. But if you're coming from understanding the
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:47.000]  game, it's they are in bed with whoever is supporting the agenda that we're talking
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.080]  about. And so they will want to bomb Assad because they want rid of him. They wanted
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:59.640]  rid of Gaddafi and etc. And they actually, far from bombing, they are selling arms to
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:09.320]  Saudi Arabia, this truly evil place. I spent eight weeks there back in the 70s in a thing
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:14.720]  to do with football. And I only lasted eight weeks because I thought this place is so appalling.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:20.520]  The way that people are treated is so appalling. The royal family here, they were not royal
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.320]  at all. They're fake royals. They just made it up.
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:27.960]  Oh, well, I mean, they were actually caravan bandits. So they were actually sex slavery.
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:32.840]  They were sex slavery. Stay there. Stay there. We're going to come right back in 70 seconds,
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:36.240]  looking at the big picture here. And by the way, they just announced they've got Stinger
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:40.760]  missiles. Oh, but no mention who gave it to them. That's in mainstream news. We told you

[01:59:51.520 --> 02:00:17.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:24.000]  Alex Jones. David Iceweather's show, the 20 minutes that I'm going to cover news for
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.160]  40 minutes and then David Knight is hosting the fourth hour today. I'm going to get back
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:32.760]  into the unprecedented attack on the Bell of Rights, the press, free speech, the second
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:38.200]  amendment. I feel bad when I talk about it because I'm not making a big enough deal out
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.400]  of it. We're just kind of calmly reporting on it. It's crazy. But David Iceweather's
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.200]  is a five minute segment, long segment coming up after that. He wanted to get into the fact
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:54.560]  that in many of these radical Muslim countries, if women are unattended, they're fair game
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.800]  to be raped. If the woman then complains, she's executed Saudi Arabia. So they're basically
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.320]  allowed to rape women in Saudi Arabia. And a lot of these folks are running around Germany
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.240]  and the left thinks it's cute. They're actually, the mayors are saying, don't wear short skirts.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.960]  You know, it's your fault. But I mean, imagine if a German did this and the media even spends
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:17.040]  it says German men are doing it, but you were getting into the waves of folks being brought
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:21.600]  into Europe and we'll show some of the footage of the waves, millions of people. David Ike.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:27.840]  Yeah, I mean, the question is, why is it happening? I mean, if you research this conspiracy for
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:34.880]  not very long, you realize that it is like a room of dominoes in a line and you push
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.320]  one domino down and that creates the next domino to fall. So we've had this situation
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.400]  in the Middle East where we've had all this bombing and destruction and chaos and catastrophe
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:55.000]  externally created by the United States, NATO, Britain. And this has forced large numbers
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:03.400]  of people to leave. And this wave into Europe has of genuine people who deserve our help
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:09.160]  because of the situation that the West has put them in, has been joined by vast numbers
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:14.240]  of other people who are not refugees but are seeking to get into Europe. And it's being
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:21.600]  allowed to happen for this reason. And it's been long planned for this reason. They want
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:29.280]  a world government, a world central bank, world army, and world currency, etc. And under
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:34.080]  the world government, they want these super states, they want the European Union, of course,
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.920]  the American Union, the Pacific Union, all these super states under the world government.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:46.040]  And these super states are designed not to be countries any longer, but to be broken
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:51.320]  up into regions, subordinate regions that are easy to control. You've talked about this
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:57.400]  in relation to the United States and North America and it's planned for the world. Now,
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:05.240]  the biggest resistance to the breakup and ending of sovereignty is a sense of national
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:13.680]  identity, a sense of distinct culture. And what is happening, and has been happening
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:18.960]  for a long time, I mean, that's just before I mentioned this, it came out a few years
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:28.840]  ago that during the Blair administration came out in documents and an insider speaking out.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:37.720]  But they had set out to allow unfettered immigration into Britain, not to help the immigrants.
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:45.360]  They were pawns in the game. They didn't realize it. But to quote, change the face of humans
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.520]  of a British society to a point where it would never go back to what it was before.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.120]  Well, that's Peter Sutherland. He even wrote in the BBC that Europeans are bad and this
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.760]  is the end Europeans being homogenous for vulcanization purposes.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:09.200]  This is all connected. Now, look at Europe, Alex, and you look at a country that has an
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:17.120]  enormously strong sense of its culture, sense of itself, sense of its unique, the sense
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:25.440]  of its history. And what you're looking at is Germany. And the resistance to the end
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.200]  of Germany, which they want down the line, and the end of the German culture would be
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:37.800]  absolutely massive if they knew that was going on. And the idea is not just in Germany, but
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:41.280]  that's why Germany has been really picked out in this what's happening.
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.280]  Stay there. This is Keith Seryar absolutely on target. AmazingInfoDavidIke.com, the new
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:51.120]  book, you can find it there. This is it. Germany runs basically and funds all of the EU now.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.840]  The EU is always designing their own words to implode Europe once it got control and
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:58.840]  then fold it into a larger world government.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:05.520]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:10.000]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient, and we're going
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.960]  to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:18.320]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away,
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:25.400]  simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder,
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:32.120]  which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.840]  behavior toward authority. Other measures will allow doctors to report
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:42.440]  patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.360]  We're going to boost gun safety technology. We need to develop new technologies that make
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:53.080]  guns safer. We can set it up so you can unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.600]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:58.600]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:05.560]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:11.160]  We've always offered five months free. But since I announced six free months a few days

[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:03.800]  It has happened. 2015 has passed into history, into lore.

[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:16.960]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a little too epic that Hollywood action adventure, science fiction
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:17.960]  voice I'm using.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:22.240]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.120]  your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:30.360]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling

[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.800]  These are our people.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:28.800]  This is from 1984.
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.800]  Who are they?
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.800]  They are the Dark Armies.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:39.800]  The Dark Murdering Armies was only honored as atrocities.
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:48.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:54.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:59.800]  By the way, we did a historic big interview with Lewis Farrakhan two days ago.
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:02.800]  We'll give you details at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:08.800]  Detailing when that's going to be released, it will be a big newsmaker.
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.800]  Farrakhan said, quote, he's changed in the interview too.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.800]  It's big.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:17.800]  But a lot of people are really assessing, reassessing things happening in the world.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:20.800]  Because everybody can feel that huge change is upon us.
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:22.800]  Some of it good, some of it bad.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:26.800]  But if good people don't get involved, evil will triumph in this time of change.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:34.800]  David Ike was getting into the fact, really deep stuff that's so on target from my research about why they're flooding Europe.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.800]  Destroy the sovereignty of the countries.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:42.800]  We've been telling them the soccer teams can't be named after countries anymore because nationalism itself's bad.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.800]  Then you bring in groups to break up the country, make it all about ethnic stuff.
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.800]  The opposite of multiculturalism.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.800]  And then annex the Middle East in the name of controlling the migrant floods and invade more countries.
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:56.800]  Now David Ike just went over all that.
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.800]  What comes next after that, David Ike?
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:10.800]  Well, the other point I want to make is that people have been taken aback, not least Germans, at what Chancellor Merkel was doing.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:25.800]  When this great flood of migrants began, she opened the doors to Germany without any question, without any policy, without anything.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.800]  And people in Germany were like, well, what are you doing?
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:30.800]  What are you doing?
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:33.800]  Well, what she's doing is this.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:44.800]  Chancellor Merkel is a 100% owned and willingly owned asset of this hidden hand.
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:51.800]  And the reason that she's done what she's done is because the agenda demanded it.
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:11:01.800]  And because of that, she has acted and reacted or hasn't to what has happened in the way that she has.
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:21.800]  And the other point, Alex, is again and again, when you when you study how the hidden hand works, it plays one group of victims or one group of stooges, whatever you want to call them, against another to create the divide and rule.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.800]  And they see, again, we're back to the dominoes.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.800]  If this domino goes down, this domino is going to go down.
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:27.800]  And that means this will happen.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.800]  If you do A, B will.
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:31.800]  And I never want you to think like that.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:35.800]  But in their own books, they admit they're rigging 20, 30, 50 hundred year plans.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.800]  So break down the rest of the plan where this goes from here.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.800]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:48.800]  And so the other point of the migration is they know that certain things are going to happen.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:59.800]  Because if you get a large number of people into any other from one culture into another, then you're going to have some very nice people and you're going to have some very unnice people.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:01.800]  That's what happens.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:14.800]  And as things happen, and we're seeing some of them now, that the hidden hand you would happen, you're obviously going to get an angry reaction from the population, the German population.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:29.800]  And you're going to create conflict, you're going to create resentment, and you're going to create divide and rule conflict in Europe between those who are coming in and those that are already there.
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:36.800]  And some of the decent people in both groups are going to be caught up in the crossfire.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:51.800]  And so the more chaos you can have, order out of chaos, and the more you can break down a sense of culture, a sense of unique culture, that together justifies a number of things.
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:57.800]  It justifies a police state to stop the conflict.
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:58.800]  That's my next point.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:12:59.800]  Let me interject this, David.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:10.800]  I want you to continue, but this is so important, it's where I was going next. They don't want us to ever think about connecting dots or dominoes, because if we ever have common sense, it's over.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:28.800]  They bring in the radical Muslims, they let them attack, and then they say, we're going to take your free speech away across Europe because this happened and arrest nationalists and arrest lapin in a response to them bringing them in
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.800]  and the same European governments backed destabilizing them at least and are involved.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:37.800]  So at every level, they're doing it, and then now they bring even more groups.
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:46.800]  And as we said, when they gave them thousands of Stinger missiles a few years ago, they have articles now in the London Independent going, oh, now they have Stinger missiles from the west.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:51.800]  But then it talks about how they're fixing some of the old ones and might make them work.
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:59.800]  As the cover story for them now shooting down the airliners, I mean, they're literally running it all.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:04.800]  Our governments are, and they never get in trouble because none of the media will point out how ridiculous it is.
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:06.800]  David, I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:15.800]  It's a script, and you know, there are some journalists who are manipulating in full knowledge of what they're doing, but they're the minority.
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:26.800]  We're back to the program again. If you don't see how the dots connect, you don't see how the dominoes fall onto the next domino.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:34.800]  You can't see that it is pre-planned and has been planned to play out like this for a very, very long time.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:41.800]  Then, and you're a journalist, all you can see is dots. You can't see pictures.
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:44.800]  Let me expand on that. Let me, I've got to interrupt because it's so key. You're absolutely right.
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:53.800]  I got up this morning, saw the headline, and instantly knew that it was a cover story for the thousands of missiles,
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:57.800]  and that it would talk about them repairing the ones the West gave them.
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:03.800]  So they make the story about repairing them and make it look like they developed Stinger missiles,
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:09.800]  but then you read the third paragraph, it admits they've given them the Stinger missiles.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:15.800]  But I didn't even need to read it. I'm so used, just like you. I'm so used to their lies.
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.800]  I see the headline, and I know what the spin's going to be. That's not being a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:23.800]  It's knowing how they operate. Go ahead, sir.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:29.800]  Yeah, well, of course, the biggest problem is the coincidence theorist. That's the worst one.
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.800]  There's all the coincidence. I mean, it's a head shaker.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:41.800]  But we're back to the lie and the truth. So you've got the lie narrative for what's happening,
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:44.800]  and you've got to suppress the truth narrative.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:48.800]  And this is why the man child, who is Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:57.800]  and this outrageously censorship-laden organization Facebook, was caught on a live mic at the UN
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:07.800]  with who, Chancellor Merkel, talking about suppressing posts that are saying what's happening in Germany,
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:10.800]  because it doesn't fit the narrative. This is the whole point.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:16.800]  So if you're Google or your Facebook or any of these organizations,
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:26.800]  who are all strands in the web, ultimately, I mean, if Mark Zuckerberg is the one running Facebook, ultimately,
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:34.800]  then I live in a bloody igloo. And so you're seeing this suppression of anything that, I mean,
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:43.800]  many things are censored by Facebook, including a posting of a story about Sandy Hook.
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.800]  And it's because if you're challenging the official narrative,
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:53.800]  you're challenging the lie on which the transformation of society is being justified.
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:57.800]  And this is what's happening. And people should realize this.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:03.800]  If it's in the mainstream, it's almost certainly a lie,
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:08.800]  even though the journalists themselves might not know because they're so ignorant of what's going on.
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:12.800]  And if things are being censored by Facebook, it's not out of...
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.800]  I mean, when you see some of the things that happen on social media and that are posted,
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.800]  the idea that it's to protect the sensibilities of...
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:26.800]  That key stuff, like when I interviewed Navy SEAL families, like within weeks of Benghazi and other things,
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.800]  when I interview key people breaking stuff, it just gets censored and blocked.
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:37.800]  They're definitely blocking key info that exposes their agenda, as you just said, David.
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:43.800]  And that just shows you where the power is. They are terrified of the truth.
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:50.800]  But what we need to do is keep banging it out there. That's why I'm going on this world-speaking tour,
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:53.800]  starting later this year, and it's open-ended.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:18:01.800]  I am going to give every fiber of my being and do everything possible in the next, well, beyond,
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:05.800]  but certainly in the next three years, because this is the eye of the storm.
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:07.800]  This is the eye of the hurricane.
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:15.800]  These are the three years where we can start to make fundamental impacts upon this agenda
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:21.800]  so that the house of cards that it is will fall, because it's a house of cards,
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:26.800]  because A, it's based on lies, and B, it's based on a programmed population.
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:32.800]  Once the people start to break out of what I call phantom self and start to see beyond it,
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:35.800]  start to realize it's a program and they've been programmed
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:38.800]  and their perception of everything has actually been downloaded
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:42.800]  so that they'll see the world the way that the agenda demands.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:48.800]  Once they start to connect the dots and see that actually it's not all random, it's all connected,
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:55.800]  then the house of cards starts to fall, because although it seems so powerful and all-powerful,
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  it ain't because it's based on being secret and it's based on the public being asleep.
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.800]  We put those two things right and the house of cards will fall.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:07.800]  David, we've got a few minutes left here.
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:13.800]  I'm going to skip this network break, because this is so important today to go over all this information.
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:17.800]  Undoubtedly, the point of emergence when the whole program starts coming out in the open
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.800]  has really begun in the last year.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.800]  It's accelerating exponentially.
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.800]  I look at the acceleration.
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.800]  It's going to be crazy within 10, 12, 14 months, obviously,
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.800]  but Newtonian physics is accurate in this point of existence.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:36.800]  The forever action, there's an opposite and equal reaction, basically,
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:38.800]  or equal and opposite reaction.
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:44.800]  I would have never thought, you talked about decompartmentalizing police officers, military,
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.800]  how they're a perfect example of compartmentalization, protecting their own enslavers,
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:53.800]  but particularly, as you said, people on the inside going public,
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:58.800]  in media, in government, in the military, in the police, because they really see how evil it is.
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:03.800]  And because you and I, and countless others, have helped decompartmentalize them,
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.800]  that's really going to give the system a problem.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:09.800]  But then I read white papers that are public and the globalists admit,
[02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:11.800]  oh, we're just going to automation and technocracy.
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:15.800]  They believe that's their holy grail, where everything's going to be robots,
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:17.800]  everything's going to be automated, everything's going to be smart meters,
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:23.800]  self-driving cars, shelf-controlled guns, where you don't have a choice,
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:27.800]  and that's going to be their answer is this total robotic world that, quote,
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:32.800]  makes it all convenient, but really takes all human power away,
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:38.800]  and that's the attacks on farms and ranches and Amish and outdoor farmers markets.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.800]  I'm really getting to the point of, it's true, but we can't just be hippies.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:46.800]  We've got to have people that are on the land, we've got to fight in the cities politically,
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:50.800]  but we've got to work and at least support people that are on the land
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:55.800]  and vote with our money to never support big globalist operations
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:59.800]  and literally keep our children with other like-minded people
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.800]  and understand we are in an occupied planet.
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:04.800]  I mean, it's like childhood's in.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:05.800]  I'm not saying it's aliens.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.800]  I mean, you're saying it's interdimensional, whatever, probably.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:08.800]  I mean, it's just so obvious.
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:09.800]  It's how to destroy us.
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:12.800]  It's anti-human, archetype, whatever.
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:13.800]  It's evil aliens want to get us.
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:15.800]  I mean, you know, I'm not saying that.
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.800]  The point is, is that it doesn't matter.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:18.800]  It's the same thing.
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.800]  They want to abort planet Earth.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:21.800]  They want to play God.
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.800]  They want everything ugly.
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.800]  They want to mutate every species.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:27.800]  They might as well be, you know, whatever from the 9th dimension
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.800]  because they're that anti-human.
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.800]  The elites say they're a new species.
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:32.800]  They say they're splitting off from us.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:35.800]  They say, I don't believe in God, but I'm about to become God.
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:39.800]  You know, if you're Ray Kurzweil, this is their big conferences.
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.800]  I know rich billionaires, as I'm sure you do.
[02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:43.800]  I know powerful Hollywood people and they've come to me.
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.800]  In fact, don't look at the camera and tell the viewers this
[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.800]  and go back to David Ike.
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:50.800]  I'm talking to billionaires, Hollywood stars.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.800]  You've heard a lot of them here on air, folks.
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:53.800]  I don't make this stuff up.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:55.800]  I tell you, Putin listens to the show.
[02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:56.800]  You know, watch this.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:57.800]  He's willing to get an interview.
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:59.800]  I tell you, Matt Drudge, listener, boom, he shows up.
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:01.800]  I mean, we don't, you know, Lewis Furcon, huge listener.
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:03.800]  You're like, well, Lewis Furcon, yeah, and he's changing.
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.800]  And wait till you see the interview.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.800]  The point is, is that I talk to a lot of people, though,
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:12.800]  and they go, listen, I knew you 20 years ago or 15 years ago.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:14.800]  And I thought some of what you're saying was true
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.800]  and liked you and thought you were funny.
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.800]  But listen, I've had elites come to me and say,
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.800]  if you want life extension or you want to be part of the
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:23.800]  breakaway civilization, you go along with the system
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:25.800]  and you shut up.
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:26.800]  And they get scared.
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:27.800]  They go, it's all real.
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:30.800]  And the head of a major media empire or the head of a major bank
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:32.800]  will go, you're damn right, it's real.
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.800]  We're bringing in world government.
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:35.800]  We're going to reduce population.
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:36.800]  You better join the right team.
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:38.800]  And you stay away from that, Alex Jones.
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:41.800]  I mean, they kind of take the mask off.
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:43.800]  And these people are scared.
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:46.800]  So David, they've gotten to the point now in Hollywood,
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:48.800]  especially because you see Kurt Russell going public
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:51.800]  and all these other people, they are going to folks
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:55.800]  and literally basically threatening their families,
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:58.800]  but then saying, or come get on the spaceship.
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.800]  And I'm not saying they don't say spaceship,
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:02.800]  but it's like the high tech reservation.
[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:03.800]  We've got the high tech.
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:04.800]  We're going to be gods.
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.800]  You know, we're going to, I mean, you see it in the headlines.
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:08.800]  The elite are obsessed with living forever.
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:10.800]  World government, it's all out in the open now.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:13.800]  And they're going to the big culture icons
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.800]  that could really change things.
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:18.800]  And they're telling them, and some of these icons say,
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.800]  I'm not going to join you.
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:21.800]  And they go, fine, but you keep your mouth shut
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:24.800]  or we'll kill you like we killed your daddy.
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:26.800]  And I'm going to leave it at that point with that famous group.
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:30.800]  But I mean, that's how hardcore this has gotten, David.
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:31.800]  Go ahead.
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:32.800]  We got six minutes till break and we'll let you go.
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:34.800]  Thank you for the time, sir.
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:35.800]  Right.
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:38.800]  Well, frankly, I could talk for hours now.
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:43.800]  What we're looking at is what I've called for years now,
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.800]  the Hunger Games Society, where you've got a tiny elite of less
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:52.800]  than 1% that control everything, or politics, or government,
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:56.800]  or money, et cetera, world army.
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:04.800]  And you have a mass population that survive in servitude
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:08.800]  and in deprivation and in slavery.
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:11.800]  And I'm talking about people who, this minute,
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:15.800]  might call themselves well-off and it doesn't affect me.
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.800]  And in between those two is the strata of the police state,
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:23.800]  which is there to mercilessly, this is why they're recruiting
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:29.800]  more and more psychopaths, to mercilessly impose the will
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:34.800]  of the less than 1% upon the mass of human slaves.
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:38.800]  And a key part of this is the assimilation.
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.800]  And you've brought up the topic transhumanism.
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:47.800]  Transhumanism, if you listen to people like Kurzweil,
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:53.800]  you are told that transhumanism, putting technology inside the body,
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:56.800]  what they're calling implantables, will make us superhuman.
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:59.800]  No, it won't. It will make us superrobots.
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:02.800]  It will make us super subhuman.
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:06.800]  And so what is happening, and I go into this in the fans
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:09.800]  themselves in some detail, and the chapter I write about this,
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:13.800]  I think is the most important chapter I've ever written in any book.
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.800]  We're seeing what I call the totalitarian tiptoe of assimilating
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:20.800]  human minds into technology.
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.800]  It's one major, major stepping stone to this is what is now
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:29.800]  a global addiction to smartphone technology,
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.800]  where we're losing the young generation to...
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.800]  They admit it's rewiring the brain, brain damaging.
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:40.800]  Yeah, exactly. I go into this in the book and this is absolutely
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:43.800]  what is happening. It's rewiring the brain.
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:45.800]  It's dumbing down the brain.
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:48.800]  And there's perfect peer pressure to have social friends
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.800]  that got to be on it so the human element lures you in to the dehumanization.
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:56.800]  But it's an addiction.
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.800]  If you are an alcoholic, who controls you?
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.800]  The alcohol. If you're a drug addict, who's the controller?
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:08.800]  The drug. If you are an addict of technology, who controls you?
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.800]  The technology. This is bringing the humans in and technology together.
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.800]  They went from smartphones and they've now gone to what they call wearables.
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:24.800]  These are the Bluetooth in the ear. These are the Google Glass.
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:28.800]  And these are the Apple Watches.
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:32.800]  And the next stage, and they're pushing this along faster and faster
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:37.800]  because they have to get this done before enough people awaken.
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:40.800]  And by the way, sir, as you said before they admitted it,
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:42.800]  they admit it's to take over our consciousness.
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.800]  It's basically a holocaust. It's basically genocide.
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:50.800]  They say humans are crap. This new merger will be God.
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.800]  They're announcing they're going to end our world.
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.800]  And we're just sitting here with our thumbs in our, you know what?
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:59.800]  Well, we're probably on the smartphone. Well, I'm not.
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:02.800]  But a lot of people are on the smartphone while it's all happening.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:10.800]  This guy, Ray Kurzweil, this Google executive who is the spokesman for Frankenstein,
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:16.800]  he has said that not too far into what we call the future,
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:21.800]  that most human thinking will be done from the cloud.
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.800]  And what he's referring to, although he won't tell you, of course, for obvious reasons,
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:28.800]  is something I've been writing about in the books for years.
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:33.800]  That is childhoods end. That is the MI6 writer.
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:37.800]  He admitted that was an allegory for the real plan to put us into a collective computer mind.
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.800]  Where we all die and join the ever mind. I can't believe what a cult of freaks these are, David.
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:46.800]  But what we're looking at is what I've been writing about for years,
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:50.800]  what I call the technological sub-reality. That's what he's calling the cloud.
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:57.800]  It's a Wi-Fi, if you like, a massive Wi-Fi cloud,
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:06.800]  a massive Wi-Fi technological sub-reality in the region of the planet that humans live in.
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:10.800]  It's a new dimension. It's an admitted new dimension
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:14.800]  where we can go and live in a false reality that also encroaches on the third dimension
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.800]  and gobbles up all of our data to cheat us and screw us and control us.
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:22.800]  It's literally a cloud of demonic locusts.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:25.800]  It will be doing the thinking.
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.800]  And the chapter I write in Phantom Self is called TransPhantomism.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:36.800]  And I call it that because I've talked about Phantom Self and I am my name,
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:40.800]  I'm my life story, I'm my color, I'm my race, I'm a religion.
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:43.800]  No, your infinite awareness, having that experience.
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:48.800]  And it's taken even that level of the program, what I call Phantom Self,
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:54.800]  it's designed to take it into a whole new level of thought and perception control.
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:02.800]  And so we need to get our asses in gear in 2016, rather, 17 and 18,
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:07.800]  and start to realize that this has to be the focus of our lives
[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:10.800]  because our lives won't exist as they do now.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:12.800]  David, this is incredible. Stay right there.
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:15.800]  You got me so excited to do three more minutes on the other side
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:17.800]  to finish up on how you say we get out of this,
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.800]  because what you're laying out is admitted scientific fact
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.800]  that they're taking away our senses that are meant to experience the world
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:28.800]  by our spirit, by our soul, by the energy.
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:33.800]  They're removing us into those where the soul's actually all by itself now
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:35.800]  being artificially programmed from without.
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:39.800]  This is obviously enslaving us, physically hurting us,
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:42.800]  and is basically demonic possession through the computer.
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:44.800]  And then they admit that's their plan.
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:46.800]  My God, it's incredible.
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.800]  It's an invasion out of another dimension.
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.800]  In March, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:30:20.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:25.800]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:27.800]  or donated to the National Party Committee.
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:32.800]  Democrat FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel believes Reid has the right to the money
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:34.800]  due to his status as a, quote,
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:39.800]  historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.800]  The FEC has deferred action on Reid's request.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:47.800]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:50.800]  will send the wrong message and set a precedent.

[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:28.800]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:31.800]  We have the technology.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:39.800]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:43.800]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:46.800]  Better than it was before.
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:58.800]  Better, stronger, faster.
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:00.800]  Final second of the day, but I've got a few minutes.
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.800]  I'm just going to leave you with something to get into a bunch of news I haven't covered yet.
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:11.800]  But I think of the cheesy kids movie, a Pacific Rim,
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:17.800]  where aliens invade not from outer space, but from a dimensional rift in the Pacific Ocean.
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:19.800]  I'm not saying that's real for the New York Times.
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:21.800]  I'm not getting into space aliens here.
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.800]  What I'm saying is the allegory is still true, whether you believe it or not,
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:31.800]  that what we've created with the Internet and Wi-Fi and these broadcasts
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:37.800]  is creating a new universe, a new world that is absorbing this world
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.800]  and marking everything and then putting it into its artificial system
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:46.800]  so they can artificially map it, track it, control it, predict the future.
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.800]  And I was told by NSA whistleblowers in person,
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:53.800]  literally in parking garages and stuff.
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:55.800]  People would come to me at events or where I worked.
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:58.800]  I had no idea how dangerous it was at the time.
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:00.800]  In other words, you've seen a lot of NSA folks on here since,
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:02.800]  former director of technicals and many others.
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:09.800]  I mean, and they would tell me, this is like 18 years ago, Alex, there's microphones in the Scientific Atlantic things and cameras.
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:11.800]  And I'd tear it open on air and it'd be there and I'd get death threats.
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:16.800]  I mean, on AXS TV, I'd tear it open and everyone was seeing the camera and the microphone 18 years ago.
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:19.800]  And then they would say it's to predict the future, Alex,
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:24.800]  so then decisions can be given to key leaders to position themselves to take over markets.
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.800]  But also, once we can predict the future, we can steer the future.
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:30.800]  They're controlling the future.
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:39.800]  And these guys would get in their $100,000 Mercedes in the parking garage scared and drive off.
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:45.800]  I mean, these were guys that were in the system who were freaked out.
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:47.800]  And so, folks, we're talking God-like stuff.
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:53.800]  So even if aliens aren't real, the elite believes they are and they believe all this power.
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:55.800]  They're gods, basically.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:56.800]  What are the gods of Olympus?
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:57.800]  They're like aliens.
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:03.800]  So the allegories there, where they're playing God, they're trying to force us into this artificial system
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:06.800]  and make the blind see, make the deaf hear.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:08.800]  There's all these things that sound great.
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.800]  My dad's brother was in a motorcycle accident, had epilepsy forever, has a brain chip,
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:17.800]  not just the stimulant system, and he's a lot better now.
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:20.800]  The visitors have come.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:22.800]  It's the global elite.
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:26.800]  The sciences, they're giving us all these goodies.
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:30.800]  But there's Trojan horses in all of it.
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.800]  And our cancer rates way up.
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:33.800]  Our IQs are dropping.
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:35.800]  The death rates are expanding.
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:37.800]  People are unhappy.
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.800]  But no one debates why his breast cancer up 3,000% in the West.
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:44.800]  No one debates why his pediatric cancer is up more than 10,000%.
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:47.800]  No one debates why his diabetes type one up type two.
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:51.800]  No one, it's just, oh, everything just sails forward.
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:54.800]  David, I, three or four minutes, I know you got to go, thank you so much, sir.
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:58.800]  What you're getting to is so important, now there's no doubt, whoever they are,
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:02.800]  they're trying to submerge us as a species and kill us.
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:07.800]  This is a slow extermination program, sucking us in,
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:12.800]  drugging us, poisoning us like a giant spider would do before it eats us.
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:13.800]  David Ike.
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:15.800]  Well, it's an assimilation.
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:22.800]  And it's not just happening in the world that we see.
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:29.800]  I explain in fans himself in some detail how we're being assimilated through nanotechnology.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:37.800]  People should look on the internet and get up to date with something they're calling smart dust or neural dust.
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:44.800]  See, in our chats over the years, Alex, I've talked about the body being a biological computer.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:51.800]  Because it's a biological computer, it can interact with other forms of technology.
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:57.800]  And what is happening when you see that bionic eye story, et cetera,
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.800]  and there are, you know, on the face of it, they're good things.
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:06.800]  And for the people that benefit from one or two of these things, it is a good thing.
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:09.800]  But that's not what the main thing is all about.
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:15.800]  It's about assimilating our perception and our consciousness and taking over our thinking completely.
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:22.800]  And so what they're doing is creating, and this is the word to watch for, synthetic.
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:25.800]  They're creating a synthetic everything.
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:36.800]  We are being systematically made more and more synthetic by breathing in nanotechnology that's coming out of chemtrails, for instance.
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:44.800]  And nanotechnology is not only affecting humans, it's affecting the environment.
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:51.800]  They're now developing synthetic cells. They're now developing synthetic blood.
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:55.800]  And this is the thing, synthetic.
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:02.800]  It's creating a new human, which is not like humans were before.
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:05.800]  They're turning us into replicants. They see us as their property.
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:10.800]  And then when we break free and become real humans again, because we were always real,
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:15.800]  they basically send out their cultural blade runners to kill us. They're throwing it in our face.
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:24.800]  Yeah, and so, you know, if people want to stop this, then they first have to reject completely transhumanism.
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:28.800]  I mean, it's a simple question for people with half a brain.
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:41.800]  Why would an elite that has spent so much time controlling humans and suppressing humans and limiting humans want to make us superhuman?
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:55.800]  I mean, hello. What they want to do is to make us beyond human, to become synthetic computer terminals on their technologically generated web.
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:04.800]  And, you know, I've talked to you before about the plan is, and I think it's already there personally, to make the Internet conscious.
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:07.800]  And what are they talking about, Alex? I mean, we must have a...
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:14.800]  Google admits, 16 years ago, 70 years ago when they were founded, that this was declassified by the company themselves last year to Wired,
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:24.800]  that they have been trying to build a superbrain that is AI from the start to then control humans by manipulating their data and merge with us.
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:26.800]  They use a takeover organ. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:29.800]  Yeah, this is the point where this is where I was going.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:33.800]  And I go into this infant himself in some detail, like I say.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:39.800]  We keep being told, Alex, all the time, you've just mentioned it, AI, artificial intelligence.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:44.800]  Artificial intelligence this, artificial intelligence that. Artificial intelligence will take over this.
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:47.800]  We'll have smart cities run by artificial intelligence.
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:49.800]  We'll have cars run by artificial intelligence.
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:41:00.800]  But this is the question which I answer in the book. What is that artificial intelligence? What is it? What controls it?
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:13.800]  I would suggest very strongly, and I produce evidence in the book, that this artificial intelligence is this non-human force that's been manipulating humanity for a very long time.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.800]  Yeah, they're building the grid to take over. Well, if I was advanced aliens, this is what I would do.
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:31.800]  Alex, they're building the vehicle. They're building the technological vehicles for this artificial intelligence, i.e. not human intelligence, to take over the whole shebang, including the human mind.
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:41.800]  And they have us pay for it, and they have us build it, and then the military step back, turn off all their systems, spike human training for combat so humans can't even resist.
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:56.800]  Everything goes robots, and then it seizes control. And whether it's aliens from deep space, or another galaxy, or another dimension, or an artificially AI supercomputer, it doesn't matter because the elite are psychos, and they run the machine regardless.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.800]  Anyway, whatever it is, you can smell it's not of this world.
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.800]  I would say the artificial intelligence I'm talking about runs the elite.
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:08.800]  Through their genetic codes.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.800]  Yeah, they're just pawns in the game as well. They just don't think that. They don't think they are.
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:14.800]  They're the original biological androids.
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:22.800]  Yeah, they're just vehicles. They're also vehicles for this artificial intelligence I'm talking about.
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:30.800]  So this is what we're looking at, and this is why I say, Alex, that 16, 17, 18 are so absolutely vital.
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:43.800]  It's because they are now going to try to go into overdrive and steroid states to bring in this assimilation through the transhumanism as fast as possible.
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:50.800]  I mean, this is just talking about ships, but there's a story on my website today that I came across.
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:43:04.800]  We have some sausages in this country called Richmond sausages, right? Richmond sausages are now giving away chips, tracking chips with their sausages,
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:11.800]  because they think it's a good play on words partly, to put for children to put on their toys.
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:25.800]  And it's the most blatant conditioning and preparation for young people and kids today to find chipping humans to be perfectly,
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:31.800]  well, this is the way things are, perfectly natural. It's absolutely extraordinary.
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:37.800]  And even if it's unnatural up front, they just do it in an artificial environment, as you said last hour, until they just accept it,
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:42.800]  because it's targeting them, not us. Here's an example. Eight years ago, I was sent a textbook. I showed it many times on air.
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:49.800]  It's somewhere around the office. And it's one of the major textbooks used by sixth graders in science across the United States.
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.800]  Millions and millions of children use it every year. And it said,
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:44:07.800]  the Department of Energy in 1992 launched a program with a Nobel Prize winner to save the earth from ozone depletion and to spray sunscreen over the earth.
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:14.800]  And it's added to the jet turbines with different compounds to protect the earth.
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:19.800]  So they know they've got kids there and they're telling them, we're chemtrailing you.
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:25.800]  Then they have shows on TV, you know, interviewing kooks who talk about fake chemtrails to make it look dumb.
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:30.800]  But to the kids in government approved textbook, they just admit it, you see the different downloads.
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.800]  We're in an earlier download. So we're kept in a paradigm. Here's an example.
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:41.800]  USA Today, I've noticed, will have for people that still read papers, watered down stuff.
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:57.800]  So I shot a video this weekend on it. One headline in the paper Friday was U.S. television news faces its mortality in election coverage and admits they basically have no viewers and are dead.
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:01.800]  The very same author, very same writer on the paper version.
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:08.800]  It was written differently, different headline about how well TV faces a lot of competition.
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:13.800]  You see, for the older folks still reading newspapers, it was everything's kind of okay.
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:20.800]  But for people online, hey, it's dead. And you can just see how this is really hive mind, man.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:26.800]  They've really and now the CIA is going to where the articles are all basically written by computers.
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:30.800]  I mean, wow, I tell you, this is incredible, David.
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:32.800]  How do we stop it? How do we break free from it?
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:46.800]  Because whatever's behind it, it is super sophisticated. But if you just wake up to it and start withdrawing consent and support from it and speaking out against it, we have Titan is forced seven and a half billion of us to change this.
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:46:07.800]  Well, you know, what you're just talking about is worth mentioning this. And I kind of indicated earlier that our generations that have been here long enough to see what was before this extreme of madness are so important.
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:18.800]  Because when you're born into the world, you tend to accept the world and what you find as well. This is how it is to you. It's normal to someone like me born in the 1950s looking at what's happening now.
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:25.800]  It ain't normal to me. It's a form of insanity. But for people born into this world, it's their normal.
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:40.800]  And what they're doing is they're conditioning kids to have the agenda, the cloud, the transhumanist control. And that is the hive mind. The hive mind is the cloud. That's what it's supposed to be.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:51.800]  It's their normal. And so what our generations need to do is to point out at every opportunity that it ain't normal and why it's not normal.
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:47:01.800]  And what we need to do to overcome this, I mean, let's, I mean, I've been saying for years, you can either find a solution to something or you can remove the cause of the problem.
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:10.800]  And clearly, the cause of the problem can be identified by how and where this system wants to take us.
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:27.800]  It wants to take us from even the present program that where we self identify with color, race, religion, name, history and all that stuff to the next stage, which is the transphantomist stage of control through hive mind technological cloud.
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:37.800]  In other words, to control us, they need to constantly limit to our perception and ability to think and perceive.
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:56.800]  To remove the cause of the problem, we have to remove that. And to do that, we need another self identity to go beyond fans himself, never mind trans fans himself, and see what we and realize what we really are.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:04.800]  We are awareness, a state of being aware. Forget bodies, forget form, forget it all.
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:19.800]  We are consciousness with a wicked force trying to literally strangle us and put a hood over our head and enslave us, absolutely shutting off the universe from us and free will.
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:22.800]  It's claustrophobic to feel the spirit of this enemy.
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  They are hijacking our point of attention. You can be the ocean. You can you can open your mind to awareness, insight, inspiration, that is literally infinite.
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:53.800]  And when you do that, you look at this world and it is an open book, or you can disconnect from the ocean, which is what all this is about, and become the droplet disconnected from the ocean.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:59.800]  When you put the droplet back in the ocean, where does the droplet end in the ocean start? It's all one ocean, all one.
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:02.800]  And look at how they're trying to end families, make us all by ourselves.
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:17.800]  Yeah, but if you pull the droplet out of the ocean, you isolate it, and suddenly people in that state, and that's most people because of the programming, instead of getting their insight, their inspiration, their intuitive knowing,
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:38.800]  they're seeing through the lies from higher forms or levels of their own awareness, not some alien in a spaceship, their own awareness. They get so concentrated in the five senses that the only way that they can look to get a fix on who they are and the nature of the world is out into the world.
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:44.800]  And what comes back, the media, the education system, all these vehicles.
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:51.800]  The false reality to tell you that your lying eyes, your lying gut are wrong, you're absolutely right.
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:50:13.800]  Exactly, and the point being that if we're going to get out of this, and we are, but it's a massive challenge, is we've got to reverse that process of going into more and more narrow bands of perception awareness and possibility to coming out to our true self.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:23.800]  And that is to say that I'm not who are you, who are you? I'm David Ike born in Leicester in 1952, I was a footballer, then I did this, then I did that.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:31.800]  No, that's my experience. Who am I? Who are you? Who is everyone? Infinite awareness, having an experience.
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:49.800]  But what the game is, and transphantomism, transhumanism is the big next stage of the game, almost the end game, is to so isolate our point of attention within this reality that we can access no other point of assessment.
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:52.800]  A total prison for the soul, David Ike, always powerful.
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:54.800]  A prison for the mind, it's a prison for the mind.

[02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:01.800]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:06.800]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:08.800]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:13.800]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:09.800]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:14.800]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:16.800]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:23.800]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:31.800]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:34.800]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:42.800]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:45.800]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.

[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:03.800]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing until they kind of hold me.
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:07.800]  Yeah, I got no friends because they read the papers.
[02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:09.800]  They won't be seen with me.
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:11.800]  I'm feeling real shot down.
[02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:13.800]  I'm feeling me.
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:17.800]  Little bit of the legendary Alice Cooper.
[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:19.800]  He's a Patriot pro-gun Christian.
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:24.800]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing until they got a hold of me.
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:26.800]  All right, that's enough.
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:28.800]  Hard to turn that off though.
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:31.800]  Let me get serious here.
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  I have done deep research, as many of you have and our guests have, and all I'm telling you is the global standardization system.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:56.800]  The global standardization system that is being shut up is anti-human and is meant to reduce world population and destroy culture and is super bad.
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:00.800]  And the direction technology is going is to enslave and control us.
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:04.800]  I'm always on the leading cutting edge of it to reach people.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:08.800]  But just because I'm jacking into the matrix, baby, doesn't mean I like it.
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:12.800]  And I'm not some anti-technology person.
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:15.800]  Man, if vaccines work, I want them.
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:18.800]  If bionic eyes work when I'm 75 or 80, I want them.
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:20.800]  If bionic hearts work, I want it.
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:27.800]  The problem is the New World Order folks takes away your health and then gives you a replacement that takes your humanity.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.800]  And I mean, that's not just me sitting back saying that.
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:41.800]  I've looked at this hard and, man, at the bottom of the hole, this rabbit hole is something so scary.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:49.800]  It makes my soul shudder, not wanting to be close to it, not wanting to be around it.
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:55.800]  I mean, you know, there's all these little toys and candies and jewelry laying around that open into this hole.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:57.800]  You stick your arm up in there, baby.
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:03.800]  There's bait outside that hole to get you to go in there.
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:08.800]  And everything's pumpkin pie till you get deeper down that hole.
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:14.800]  And this system doesn't hit you with happy gas at the end before it eats you.
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:22.800]  It's done all this so we can slowly tear your soul and heart and mind apart.
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:26.800]  By the way, Ike talks about, you know, it wants to get our mind, not our soul.
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:29.800]  No, it wants our soul.
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:37.800]  Because if you can get, if they can get us sucked into the mind so much and then poison our soul with these systems,
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:39.800]  there is good and evil.
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:42.800]  We will then resonate with the darkness and it's over.
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:47.800]  They got us, you know, a lot of the more modern folks, the New Ages and stuff, think that, oh, it's all good.
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:48.800]  You can transcend this.
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:50.800]  No, no, no, no.
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:56.800]  There is evil at the highest levels of the spectrum of dimensions.
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:59.800]  I can just know it in my gut.
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:06.800]  And because there's free will in this universe.
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:09.800]  Now, we see the propaganda of North Korea.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:10.800]  It's corny.
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:11.800]  It's comical.
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:12.800]  It's sickening.
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:15.800]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:18.800]  But look at our own propaganda people are buying into.
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:20.800]  You laugh at people crying when Kim Jong-un died.
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:21.800]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:22.800]  Three days of crying.
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.800]  If they don't do that, they're sent to a forced labor camp because that's what the economy is based on.
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:31.800]  But here they are announcing the miniature H bombs they supposedly created.
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:39.800]  And then just look at the false reality with some little fat dictator with weirdo, crazy women and pink dresses announcing they can blow America up.
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:40.800]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:48.800]  But only because you are more conscious than people living under this level of brainwashing.
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:50.800]  But what you face is even more sophisticated.
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:56.800]  Here it is.
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:07.800]  The first H bomb test was successfully conducted at 10 o'clock on January 6, 2016.
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:08.800]  Look at the power trip.
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:09.800]  Look at the totalitarianism.
[02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:18.800]  And this is just a total joke.
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:22.800]  We will not give a nuclear program as long as the United States maintains a stance of aggression.
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:23.800]  Okay, that's enough of her.
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:26.800]  But see, she's bad, they're bad, then our leaders are bad.
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:39.800]  It doesn't make like you choose America or choose these people because America has been hijacked by a bunch of criminals that are coming after your speech, your guns, your health care, your kids, your property, your religion, everything.
[02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:41.800]  It doesn't matter if it's good, bad or indifferent.
[02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:43.800]  They want you to do what they say.
[02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:47.800]  Obama said Congress better get in line with him.
[02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:53.800]  It has happened, 2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:56.800]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[02:58:56.800 --> 02:59:01.800]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:02.800]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:07.800]  That's a little too epic that Hollywood action adventure, science fiction voice I'm using.
[02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:15.800]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.
[02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:22.800]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbo-charge and cleanse the body.

[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:12.800]  And there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:21.800]  By the way, one of the favorite things of trolls on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we let them operate because people need to be educated about it.
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:24.800]  They can see it themselves. They call for violence and stuff.
[03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:31.800]  Obviously, third-party discus has computer systems that censor it, but we don't moderate or control it.
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:37.800]  But if you go on there, our average video now gets about a half million views.
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:43.800]  I mean, I can shoot a three-minute video while I'm getting on an airplane yesterday and it gets hundreds of thousands of views.
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:56.800]  Go to our big Facebook, click on the All Videos right there, and then you can see Congress considers criminal charges against Obama, 797,000 views.
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:05.800]  They're looking at impeachment proceedings. Insider Obama about to unleash hell.
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:12.800]  I wanted to say what the insider told me, but then I didn't want to plagiarize it, but I don't want to get it, but it's off record what they told me, so I just said that.
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:15.800]  And then go back. These are all videos I shot yesterday.
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:28.800]  Obama wants civil unrest. 496,000, 1,168,797,000.
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:33.800]  All right. And then we got some of that with two million views, but it's just exponentially growing.
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:36.800]  People say, what are you doing on Facebook?
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:50.800]  You know, she says Zuckerberg's bad, but I mean, it'd be like Green Berets parachuting in to blow up an, you know, al-Qaeda weapons dump or something, and you're like, what are you doing on al-Qaeda property?
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:52.800]  What are you ever doing?
[03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:56.800]  It just plays on a public that's ignorant.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:06.800]  It's like different characters coming up to the Bundys out there in, so they wouldn't talk to Joe Biggs like Joe Biggs needs to talk to you.
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:08.800]  Be lucky to talk to us, you know.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:12.800]  I'm not against the Bundys. It's just that the people go, hey, Alex says you're a fed Bundy.
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:19.800]  Oh, better not talk to Alex. I mean, it's just like, no proof. Didn't say it, but it doesn't matter because, you know, the infighting is so, so fun.
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:25.800]  We're just there to say, we don't think this is a good idea at this point and to call for peace.
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:28.800]  We're there so that our information gets out to people.
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:33.800]  Not there to talk to you and your cowboy hat, like you're, you know, little Lord Fauntleroy or something.
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:35.800]  I can put a cowboy hat on, too.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:43.800]  The point is, and then walk around and listen to guys going, strike, force, command, you know, all the rest of this stuff.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:48.800]  We're in the Info War. We know what we're doing.
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  And I just see Patriots played by this info so many times over and over again.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  Hey, watch out, feds, which might infiltrate and provocateur.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:02.800]  Alex said we're feds.
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:06.800]  It's like just total straw man stuff. And I know they're good people.
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:10.800]  It's just frustrating to see it.
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:17.800]  I mean, look at this headline by Kit Daniels, info wars.com, American skeptical of global warming can lose gun rights due to executive order.
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:19.800]  That needs to get out.
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:24.800]  We need to get these movements that we know are in Congress to impeach Obama.
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:31.800]  That needs to be the big push.
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:35.800]  Quite frankly, the whole thing out in Oregon, I believe is a distraction and a diversion.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:37.800]  We know there's land grabbing. We know there's criminal activity.
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:40.800]  People have the right to stand up to it. Absolutely.
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:49.800]  I'm saying the optics at this time aren't good because it's wide open for infiltration, wide open for the feds to do something to blame the Patriots.
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:54.800]  And we're winning in the Info War. They want to get a physical war going.
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:59.800]  That's my view. You may disagree with my strategies. It's a free country.
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:03.800]  We're not going to call for escalating anything.
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:10.800]  Obama is pushing and pushing and pushing to get something because you look politically, they're losing everything they got.
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:15.800]  Governors are suing. Open carries passing everywhere. They are panicking.
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:18.800]  The enemy is in trouble.
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:23.800]  I'm going to come back and hand the baton to David Knight and I didn't plug last hour.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:27.800]  I tell David Knight, I really need you to plug. We're losing money right now.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:31.800]  We made good money to fund ourselves the last few months down to the new year.
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:34.800]  We keep it this way. I'll have to let people go.
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:38.800]  I'm not saying that's going to happen because it's just cycles, but I need to get sponsors.
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  I do not skip breaks and I need to plug products and you need to go to infowarslife.com
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  where you can get 15% off everything until Friday.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:51.800]  Infowarstore.com is the big shopping cart. It has everything.
[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:54.800]  Whether it's Hillary for prison shirts that are limited edition. We're not making more.
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:57.800]  You name it. PrisonPlanet.TVMemberships, six months free.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:04.800]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:08.800]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient
[03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:12.800]  and we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:17.800]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away
[03:05:17.800 --> 03:05:24.800]  simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder
[03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:30.800]  which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:33.800]  and hostile behavior toward authority.
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:41.800]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:43.800]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:46.800]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:52.800]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:54.800]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[03:05:54.800 --> 03:06:19.800]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[03:07:50.800 --> 03:08:16.800]  I'm a member of the young Jebedy team at infowarsteam.com.
[03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:28.800]  This information is Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:38.800]  Well this song is really true when you get behind the car with 700 plus horsepower.
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:43.800]  You can pretty much instantly go to heaven in that car, both figuratively and literally.
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:47.800]  Get that accelerator.
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:49.800]  Just one more.
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:54.800]  And then the other thing comes to blur.
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:59.800]  In the county jail.
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:01.800]  Alright, I came in this morning and I told the writers.
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:04.800]  I didn't really go tell the reporters this.
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.800]  But I mean, I can tell you what the big zeitgeist is right now.
[03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:11.800]  And it's the zeitgeist because it should be.
[03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:15.800]  You know, sometimes the artificial zeitgeist is Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:20.800]  Or the other Kardashian baby photos or something stupid that's a diversion.
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:23.800]  But sometimes the zeitgeist is what it should be.
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:28.800]  And when the zeitgeist is on target to promote freedom and defend liberty.
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:29.800]  And I want to be there.
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:30.800]  Let me tell you the big issue.
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:33.800]  Obama is acting as a dictator right now.
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:37.800]  That's the big overarching big enchilada.
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:42.800]  We ought to play these clips again in this hour where he said, I'm constrained by the system of our founders
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:46.800]  and can't go against the guns without congressional action.
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:51.800]  Then we played the new clip of him saying, Congress needs to get in line.
[03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:55.800]  And then I'm moving because they haven't moved.
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:56.800]  It's unprecedented.
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:09:57.800]  So you got that.
[03:09:57.800 --> 03:09:59.800]  Then you've got all the ways he's coming at the guns.
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:01.800]  I mean, it's the worst ever worse than I thought.
[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:02.800]  I'm really wrong.
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:03.800]  I was wrong here.
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:05.800]  This is worse than I thought.
[03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:11.800]  And let me tell you what's even worse than that.
[03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:14.800]  There's an anemic response from the Republicans.
[03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:16.800]  Paul Ryan doesn't know what he's going to do.
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:19.800]  They're going to have some hearings and look at it.
[03:10:19.800 --> 03:10:24.800]  Instantly, they should be saying impeachment for federal power grab, presidential power grab.
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:32.800]  Instantly, the president's already been legislating up there on so many issues and they haven't stopped them.
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:37.800]  I mean, they won't even repeal Obamacare that's ridiculously corrupt and super unpopular.
[03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:42.800]  GOP scrambles for response to Obama's gun control actions.
[03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:43.800]  Exclusive.
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:50.800]  Rand Paul, I will fight Obama, tooth and nail on executive gun control.
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  Trump has come out and said, as president, he'll try to reverse all this.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:58.800]  Okay, fine.
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:03.800]  I get you don't want to make him a political martyr, Trump, as you said on the show a month ago.
[03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:09.800]  But we need, must go after Obama now.
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:12.800]  Everybody keeps saying, oh, leave him in for another 11 and a half months.
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:13.800]  It'll be okay.
[03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:17.800]  No, it's not.
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:24.800]  This is a crazed maniac.
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:31.800]  They say expand background checks, they mean just put whatever they want with a no fly list, the same system of just making stuff up.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:32.800]  No one knows where it comes from.
[03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:35.800]  You just can't buy a gun and turning everybody into tattletales.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:37.800]  If you say something they don't like, they've already got it in place.
[03:11:37.800 --> 03:11:49.800]  Folks, I've talked to two people that went to Cabela's in the last month, two of them, and these folks have talked to other folks.
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:56.800]  It's happened to other gun shops and someone invariably will talk about Obama and the gun control or whatever.
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:12:03.800]  And if they say that guy's a traitor and a piece of filth or whatever, they won't sell it to you and then basically call the police on you and put you in a database.
[03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:07.800]  They've set up their spy networks, folks, all over the country.
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:10.800]  And they're so politically correct complying with the ATF.
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:19.800]  The ATF came to Texas gun owners, a Texas gun shop a few years ago, we got the document, broke nationally here because I was given it by a gun shop.
[03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:25.800]  And they go, you're going to report to us the names of people buying guns in a separate file.
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:32.800]  You're going to call it like it's a suspicious activity on people buying two guns.
[03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:41.800]  And they looked at it and they said, but that's not suspicious. And it's not our job to call you. And they said, you'll do it or we'll shut you down. Here's the memo.
[03:12:41.800 --> 03:12:46.800]  Extrajudicial, outside of law, just turning people into informants like they're criminals.
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:52.800]  Hey, I caught you with that cocaine. Better start reporting for me on who sells it to you and what you do or I'm going to put you in jail.
[03:12:52.800 --> 03:13:00.800]  Well, they're not selling cocaine. They're selling legal guns and following the law.
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:04.800]  And this is what they're doing, folks, because most citizens want to be little secret agents in America.
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:08.800]  They watch 24 and all these other shows about it.
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:12.800]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda now admits they have stinger missiles and so does ISIS.
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:18.800]  Well, of course it was given to them. So how did one independent spin it?
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:21.800]  They came out and they said, I've covered it last hour.
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:24.800]  ISIS now has technology to shoot down airliners.
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:28.800]  And I saw go, oh, that's going to be the missiles. And that's how they spin it.
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:32.800]  ISIS developed sophisticated new weaponry capable of shooting down passengers.
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:37.800]  They didn't develop the sophisticated weaponry.
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:39.800]  But I knew that's how they'd get it out there.
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:46.800]  I heard, and now it's going to be, I heard ISIS got stinger missiles now. They made them.
[03:13:46.800 --> 03:13:50.800]  And then you read, they recharged the batteries on them.
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:54.800]  Oh, because they were old. Oh, they developed the sophisticated weaponry.
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:14:00.800]  And so what's sick is I read that headline and knew it was them putting the cover story out
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:04.800]  so they could start shooting down the jet airliners and bring in real martial law.
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:09.800]  And no one that gave them the missiles in Benghazi four years ago gets in trouble.
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:16.800]  My crime is I know their tricks. My crime is...
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:20.800]  They'll come in here and hand me a news article and I shouldn't do this.
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:24.800]  But I just do it instinctively. I'll read the first line and then I'll tell everybody,
[03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:27.800]  you've seen me do this, and I'll start reading.
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:31.800]  And then three paragraphs down, the exact words I said are in it.
[03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:36.800]  And I really shouldn't do that. I'm so confident that I'm going to give them the major media
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:40.800]  old type of this. I don't care. A lot of times I don't have to read it.
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:48.800]  I know the enemy so well and what stinking frauds you are and the type of stuff you pull.
[03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:52.800]  Then when I read the article, I almost cried.
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:56.800]  Because I keep asking, how are they going to get these missiles to them?
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:59.800]  Everybody knows that they gave them to them because we and others exposed them.
[03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:02.800]  And then they're still going to just roll ahead and let them blow everything up.
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:06.800]  And then they're going to have checkpoints miles away from airports and random ones.
[03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:10.800]  Because you know the jet airliners got shot down. You know.
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:15.800]  I mean, we're not going to let them do that. Why don't you sit down and shut up for America?
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:23.800]  So the big stories are, Obama is acting as a dictator.
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:26.800]  This is the biggest assault on freedom of speech ever.
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:30.800]  Because now they're saying they're going to go after you for your political speech.
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:33.800]  And you may not be able to have guns. That's meant to be a chilling effect.
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:37.800]  They've set up all these spy networks. It's a national registration database.
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:40.800]  It turns your doctors and everybody into spies.
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:43.800]  It's just incredible. That's the big story.
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:46.800]  And we need to start the impeachment.
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:49.800]  Now, I'm going to have this report. It went viral yesterday.
[03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:53.800]  Repostedinfowars.com to the front by Steve Watson.
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:16:00.800]  I want the writers and everybody to go list the crimes of Obama.
[03:16:00.800 --> 03:16:07.800]  And we need to write articles about it's time to push for impeachment.
[03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:11.800]  It is not going to make Obama popular. It's not going to save his bacon.
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:14.800]  He's a lame duck anyways. It's not going to make Hillary look good.
[03:16:14.800 --> 03:16:16.800]  Go after them all.
[03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:19.800]  Look how Trump's tough in front of the thing.
[03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:22.800]  You don't beat these tyrants by playing patty cake with them.
[03:16:22.800 --> 03:16:25.800]  I mean, I'm ready for them to set me up, kill me, whatever.
[03:16:25.800 --> 03:16:27.800]  I mean, folks, don't you get what it takes to be free
[03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:31.800]  and you don't even have to risk your life to fight them.
[03:16:31.800 --> 03:16:34.800]  Those of us at the tip of the spear do.
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:36.800]  And it's an honor.
[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:39.800]  I'm going to watch these demons run around and engage, taking down the country.
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:41.800]  And my family's future.
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:47.800]  And I'm good because I'm standing up for self-preservation.
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:16:49.800]  Come on. No, no, no, no, no.
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:56.800]  That's evil, folks, to say it's good and wonderful to stand up and risk your life.
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.800]  Maybe if we were being conquered by some group that wasn't as evil.
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:07.800]  Folks, you got to be crazy not to stand up against these people.
[03:17:07.800 --> 03:17:10.800]  You got to be nuts.
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:13.800]  You got to be out of your mind.
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:18.800]  I mean, they're coming to take every thing we've got.
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:20.800]  They are eugenicists.
[03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:24.800]  They put glyphosate out there knowing in the 70s.
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:28.800]  It gave the rats cancer across the board big time.
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:32.800]  I mean, it's worse than cigarettes.
[03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:34.800]  I see all these articles about little kids who died
[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:37.800]  and how much courage they got to make the whole industry out of it
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:40.800]  and raising money to find the cure for all these new cancers.
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:43.800]  It's being done on purpose.
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:51.800]  We're being trained to just sit here and die and think nothing's going on.
[03:17:51.800 --> 03:17:55.800]  I'm not on a suicide mission.
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:17:59.800]  A suicide mission would be going along with this.
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:09.800]  I'm not going to sit here knowing all this and just shut up.
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:11.800]  We need urgency.
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:14.800]  Everybody, myself included, many of my crew.
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:17.800]  You name it, we just get comfortable in the tyranny.
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:20.800]  We're so close to it, we almost become it.
[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:23.800]  We're just legendary stuff is happening.
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:26.800]  All of us, patriots, listeners, leaders.
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:29.800]  People like James Woods, who's eloquent and smart.
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:32.800]  He needs to be on TV and radio fighting.
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:34.800]  Chuck Norris needs to go public.
[03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:36.800]  I know Chuck's probably listening right now.
[03:18:36.800 --> 03:18:37.800]  I love Chuck Norris.
[03:18:37.800 --> 03:18:40.800]  I know he's a tough guy, a patriot, done a lot, writes for WorldNet daily.
[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:44.800]  But Chuck, your own family wants you to come out and speak out.
[03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:47.800]  And he does not do it because he's afraid.
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:49.800]  He just is such a perfectionist.
[03:18:49.800 --> 03:18:51.800]  He thinks other people might be better than him at doing it.
[03:18:51.800 --> 03:18:54.800]  No, it doesn't matter whether you are the best at what you do.
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:57.800]  You got to do it now.
[03:18:57.800 --> 03:18:59.800]  We're going to skip this network break.
[03:18:59.800 --> 03:19:02.800]  This is the fourth hour and I got David Knight here with me.
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:06.800]  David, the main focus is, and I know I'm guilty of this,
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:08.800]  getting distracted by the Bundy thing itself
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:10.800]  because I was trying to stop that getting out of control.
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:12.800]  I think people know that stinks now.
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:15.800]  So things are a little bit more, I think stabilized at least for now.
[03:19:15.800 --> 03:19:18.800]  We try to sabotage globalist operations to get a war going.
[03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:21.800]  And we're working around the clock on that.
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:24.800]  But the big issue is, man, it's really happening.
[03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:29.800]  And boy, you know Republicans are going to continue this power grab.
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:33.800]  If we don't shoot it down and punish out of control executive authority now,
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:38.800]  it is just, it's all about the executive power grab.
[03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:45.800]  Impeach him now, announcing basically legal actions outside of law.
[03:19:45.800 --> 03:19:49.800]  I mean, if you're on a no fly database that's totally unconstitutional,
[03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:52.800]  you know, no gun by list, this is so incredible.
[03:19:52.800 --> 03:19:56.800]  And with everything else, the open border, the border patrol completing the smuggling process,
[03:19:56.800 --> 03:20:01.800]  the bringing in the refugees and not vetting them, ordering JFK and other airports
[03:20:01.800 --> 03:20:05.800]  to just let people from Latin America in without even looking at their IDs.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:12.800]  I mean, this is lawless invasion and takedown and illustrates what else is going on.
[03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:14.800]  We don't know about it.
[03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:18.800]  I know you've got a full slate today, David, but I really need listeners.
[03:20:18.800 --> 03:20:23.800]  To go to infowarstore.com and whether it's a Hillary for prison t-shirt
[03:20:23.800 --> 03:20:28.800]  or a Molan Wabbe t-shirt or a seed bank for the spring coming up
[03:20:28.800 --> 03:20:33.800]  or 15% off on everything on the site till Friday, nutraceuticals.
[03:20:33.800 --> 03:20:36.800]  We have the new, I haven't even talked about this.
[03:20:36.800 --> 03:20:39.800]  We have the new calendar, only 10,000 of these.
[03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:42.800]  And when they're gone, they're gone glossy color.
[03:20:42.800 --> 03:20:48.800]  We've been to a document cam shot, got Leanne McAdoo there as the 1940s World War II pinup.
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:52.800]  I tell you, just the good Lord, there's a lot of great creations.
[03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:59.800]  And we've got huge discounts each month that are only in this, thousands of dollars,
[03:20:59.800 --> 03:21:06.800]  of digital coupons that can be used at infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:10.800]  or by calling 888-253-3139.

[03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:19.800]  and then you get huge discounts.

[03:21:39.800 --> 03:21:43.800]  And you have photos, you've done a great job.
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:50.800]  If I had a lot more money, I'd really do aggressive stuff politically with reporters
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:54.800]  and people out doing big things and show.
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:56.800]  Thank you for your support.
[03:21:56.800 --> 03:21:57.800]  We got great products.
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:01.800]  That's another reason we've obviously gotten a lot of support since a win-win.
[03:22:01.800 --> 03:22:07.800]  But closing these windows over here, a bunch of stuff just got launched on here.
[03:22:07.800 --> 03:22:10.800]  I'm sitting basically spitting my arms on the keyboard.
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:17.800]  I'm just up here flailing around like I'll watch them on the wall, watching them burn our culture down,
[03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:23.800]  burn our energy sources, annihilate our families just running around saying your kids belong to us,
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:28.800]  foaming at the mouth, they're coming for our guns, they hate us, bitter clingers.
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:31.800]  I mean, it's just these criminal villains.
[03:22:31.800 --> 03:22:42.800]  They learn from FBI sources, secret service sources that Obama is indeed a Wahhabist.
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:46.800]  I mean, it's people seen it for themselves.
[03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:55.800]  I mean, this guy hates freedom and hates this country and absolutely despises everyone.
[03:22:55.800 --> 03:23:00.800]  These are whacked out chip on their shoulder lunatics.
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:05.800]  And they're not going to, he's not going to leave office without trying to bring the country down, folks,
[03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:07.800]  unless we really get in their face.
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:12.800]  Look, he's been repudiated, gun controls unpopular, abortions unpopular, all his stuff.
[03:23:12.800 --> 03:23:18.800]  Two percent of Americans in Gallup Bowl want it, but they won't stop.
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:26.800]  They won't stop because they're committed and we've got to have a fighting spirit politically
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:30.800]  to run around and to get these articles and videos and stuff out to everybody.
[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:33.800]  And as soon as I end this hand to hand the baton to David Knight,
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:35.800]  I'm going to go in there and shoot stuff for the news.
[03:23:35.800 --> 03:23:37.800]  I'm going to shoot Facebook mentions.
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:38.800]  I'm going to do it all.
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:41.800]  We're going to keep jacking into the enemy operations,
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:44.800]  but having our own platforms to launch these operations from.
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:46.800]  So we've got a lot of systems.
[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:52.800]  So when they take one out, cut one head off, two more replace it.
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:54.800]  And you can know we're committed.
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:56.800]  I could feel your prayers.
[03:23:56.800 --> 03:23:57.800]  I could see your support.
[03:23:57.800 --> 03:23:58.800]  Keep spreading the word.
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:01.800]  Keep spreading our videos in full wars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:02.800]  Keep spreading those links.
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:04.800]  And I want to thank you for all you've done.
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:06.800]  I want to commit to you.
[03:24:06.800 --> 03:24:15.800]  As you've committed to us that I will not falter waiver and I will 110% go with the facts and my gut and the spirit
[03:24:15.800 --> 03:24:22.800]  and we'll never hold back from you or anybody because it's all being done right in front of the creator of the universe.
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:27.800]  That I can see my whole life trained me and prepared me and got me ready.
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:31.800]  And it takes all types of defeat this tyranny, but I am a warrior.
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:35.800]  Ready to take on the enemy and I will never surrender.
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:39.800]  I will never back down until this body fails.
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:43.800]  But the flesh is designed to fail and go back into the earth fertilizer.
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:45.800]  The spirit is transcended.
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:46.800]  David night.
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:48.800]  We just have to be emblematic.
[03:24:48.800 --> 03:24:51.800]  We have to have the talking points that the it's epic.
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:52.800]  It's here.
[03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:58.800]  All the other tyranny was meant to condition us with learned helplessness and normalcy bias and mass Stockholm syndrome.
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:02.800]  And we just all have to realize the incredible history.
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:06.800]  We're witnessing the acceleration of the takedown of this country, David.
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:08.800]  I mean, what do you think's coming next?
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:11.800]  Like Drudge was told by the Supreme Court Justice this year.
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:17.800]  He was told last year, but we're now in 2016 that they're coming out with the first amendment to.
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:21.800]  I mean, they're trying to ban people being able to travel for their speech.
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:24.800]  I mean, this is serious.
[03:25:24.800 --> 03:25:26.800]  It's a full spectrum attack.
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:34.800]  Alex, you're talking about them coming after our ability to have freedom of speech as well as the freedom to read, to educate ourselves.
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:39.800]  But Alex, you know, I think it's interesting because they use this left right divide.
[03:25:39.800 --> 03:25:45.800]  You know, they can push any kind of authoritarian tactic through for the left if they're coming after guns.
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:51.800]  For the right, they can do anything that they want to, no matter how criminal, no matter how unconstitutional, if they're coming after drugs.
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:54.800]  Because people on the right don't like drugs. People on the left don't like guns.
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:25:57.800]  We have to understand what the underlying principles are.
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:06.800]  And Alex, when I look at these executive orders from Obama, just as you're talking about with Cabela's using gun stores to snitch on people,
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:13.800]  we've seen that being done with CISA telling ISPs, telling social media, telling your phone company, that's right.
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:15.800]  Turn this information to us.
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:19.800]  You're responsible for what people do on your service to spy on them and break the law.
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:24.800]  And they're trying to pass a law to do it. I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:30.800]  Taking away these people, these civil liability that they would have for spying on you.
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:36.800]  We have to understand that when somebody collects information about you, that still is your information.
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:38.800]  And we need to recognize that that's privacy.
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:46.800]  Now they're going after the doctor-patient relationship, encouraging and telling them they're not going to hold them responsible if they spy on you and that.
[03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:50.800]  That ought to be obnoxious to liberals to say you're going to destroy the doctor-patient people.
[03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:57.800]  They're on a Nazi power trip. They feel they're rising. It's a great evil. They love the jihadists killing Christians and raping women.
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:02.800]  I'm serious. They hate the West and they just get off on it. It's a cuckolding.
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:09.800]  But what about the point, David, about emblematic? All of that is part of the takeover.
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:14.800]  But the issue is the hammer's coming down now. We need to move for impeachment against Obama.
[03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:20.800]  We need to get this article out to everybody. We need more articles, reports on the news. We need videos about.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:26.800]  We must impeach Obama now. Congress moving to impeach Obama. We need to hear him go public.
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:32.800]  Report. RNC will consider Obama impeachment proceedings. Resolution consists of 48 criminal charges.
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:35.800]  I'm North American Law Center. I want to get them on. This is it.
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:40.800]  David Knight, I'm handing the baton over to you for the next 30, 35 minutes or so.
[03:27:40.800 --> 03:27:44.800]  Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central. It's not even hot in here, folks, and I'm sweating.
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:50.800]  I mean, this is like being French or something and the Germans just took over your country or being Russian and the Huns invade.
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:59.800]  Or being in Hungary and the Muslims invade. I mean, I always knew the globalists hated us, but man, they really are out to get everybody.
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:00.800]  David Knight.
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:04.800]  Absolutely, Alex. And of course, in that article, they said, well, here's 48 things.
[03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:09.800]  I'm sure you could get a much longer list than that. And that's been accumulating for years.
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:14.800]  What Obama is doing just with the IRS? That was something that Richard Nixon was impeached for and rightfully so.
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:19.800]  But Obama has done this to a far greater extent. He's done it with the cooperation of the IRS.
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:23.800]  It was actually an IRS commissioner who said, hey, look, he wants you to spy on enemies.
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:27.800]  So they took him down that way. There were a lot of things that were going on with Richard Nixon to some degree.
[03:28:27.800 --> 03:28:32.800]  It was a coup. Nevertheless, when we tolerate that kind of behavior, we're going to get more of it.
[03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:42.800]  And the reason we're tolerating that is because I believe and we all have seen that there is absolutely no difference between the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership and Congress.
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:44.800]  They have abdicated their authority. They've turned this over.
[03:28:44.800 --> 03:28:50.800]  When you look at the gun control issue, as we pointed out yesterday with Jakari Jackson, here's we're looking at it over and over again.
[03:28:50.800 --> 03:28:55.800]  Whenever they talk about this, they don't talk about the fact that they're removing your freedoms.
[03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:59.800]  They don't talk about the fact that they don't care what your elected representatives want.
[03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:01.800]  That's what Congress is, theoretically.
[03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:05.800]  Obama says, I'm frustrated because Congress won't do what I tell them to do.
[03:29:05.800 --> 03:29:07.800]  And it's because of that gun lobby.
[03:29:07.800 --> 03:29:13.800]  Well, you know, the gun lobby organizations like the NRA, Gun Owners of America, other institutions like that,
[03:29:13.800 --> 03:29:17.800]  they are supported by individuals who are trying to get them to fight for their rights,
[03:29:17.800 --> 03:29:23.800]  trying to get them to put a backbone in these congressmen, trying to stop these unconstitutional power grabs.
[03:29:23.800 --> 03:29:30.800]  And so maybe we ought to start referring to the other people as the statist lobby, or maybe as the tyranny lobby.
[03:29:30.800 --> 03:29:34.800]  But you know, we talk about the gun lobby and say, what an evil thing that is.
[03:29:34.800 --> 03:29:40.800]  What he's saying is he doesn't want the people to have any representation in regulation.
[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:43.800]  Instead, he wants to do it by himself with executive order.
[03:29:43.800 --> 03:29:49.800]  Now, when we come back, we're going to be taking a look at Harry Reid wanting to use the Sush Fund retirement fund.
[03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:51.800]  The Empires on the Run.
[03:29:51.800 --> 03:29:54.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.800 --> 03:30:02.800]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action,
[03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:10.800]  a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:17.800]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[03:30:17.800 --> 03:30:24.800]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[03:30:24.800 --> 03:30:29.800]  In comparison, 16% of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[03:30:29.800 --> 03:30:35.800]  13% said the economy, 8% said unemployment, and another 8% said immigration.
[03:30:35.800 --> 03:30:43.800]  But rather than working on these hot button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control.
[03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:51.800]  With a president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.

[03:33:22.800 --> 03:33:25.800]  I'm going to get back to what Obama is doing, and I want to look at it from a different angle.
[03:33:25.800 --> 03:33:31.800]  I want to give you something that you can talk to, and I'm going to be talking to our liberal listeners out there.
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:34.800]  Because I know that we have people who are not just conservatives or libertarians.
[03:33:34.800 --> 03:33:39.800]  I know we have liberals who listen to us because we talk about a lot of issues that they support as well.
[03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:42.800]  And we need to make common cause with this.
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:50.800]  We need to stop letting them break us down into political parties and getting excited because we got the same letter behind that candidate's name.
[03:33:50.800 --> 03:33:53.800]  We got the same team colors, or we're different colors from each other.
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:56.800]  We need to come together and understand how they're pining us.
[03:33:56.800 --> 03:34:03.800]  When I look at this gun control legislation, one of the first things that sticks out to me is the medical tyranny aspect of it.
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:05.800]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:12.800]  Not only violating the doctor-patient privilege, but also turning psychologists and the medical community,
[03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:22.800]  turning them into essentially judges who can do all kinds of things in terms of removing your property, sending you to, presumably,
[03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:29.800]  we'll get to the point where we were in the Soviet Union where they can incarcerate you based on quick assessments.
[03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:31.800]  Just completely getting rid of due process.
[03:34:31.800 --> 03:34:35.800]  Eliminating privacy, confiscating privacy, confiscating your consent.
[03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:36.800]  That's what you need to understand.
[03:34:36.800 --> 03:34:38.800]  It's not just gun confiscation.
[03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:40.800]  It's privacy confiscation.
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:43.800]  It's confiscation of your informed consent.
[03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:46.800]  And they're working on that in a number of different ways.
[03:34:46.800 --> 03:34:51.800]  I mean, Benjamin Rush, one of the people who was involved in the development of the Constitution, is very adamant.
[03:34:51.800 --> 03:34:52.800]  He was a doctor.
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:59.800]  He says, if we don't put something in the Constitution specifically protecting people's medical rights, we're going to have a medical tyranny.
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:00.800]  Well, here it is, folks.
[03:35:00.800 --> 03:35:04.800]  We've seen this throughout the Obama administration in so many different ways.
[03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:10.800]  And people said, well, we've got the 9th and the 10th Amendment, and they did, and it should be sufficient to stop that.
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:12.800]  But nothing will stop these people.
[03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:15.800]  We're going to have to, I believe, not look to Washington for solutions.
[03:35:15.800 --> 03:35:18.800]  We need to look to ourselves for solutions.
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:20.800]  We need to understand things like jury nullification.
[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:26.800]  This whole massive injustice that was done to the Hammond family could have been stopped with jury nullification.
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:34.800]  It got to the point where the judge says this absolutely offends my conscience, my sensibility.
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:36.800]  He refused to do the mandatory minimum that was imposed by Washington.
[03:35:36.800 --> 03:35:37.800]  That's what they overturned.
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:39.800]  That's why they're going back to jail the second time.
[03:35:39.800 --> 03:35:41.800]  And so he tried to move against that.
[03:35:41.800 --> 03:35:45.800]  But the people who really had the authority were the jury.
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:46.800]  They didn't know their power.
[03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:47.800]  They didn't know their duty.
[03:35:47.800 --> 03:35:50.800]  We have to know what the power is that we have.
[03:35:50.800 --> 03:35:53.800]  We have tremendous power laying on the ground.
[03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:54.800]  We just need to pick it up.
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:35:59.800]  Now, before I go to the gun control issue, I want to point out what happened in Michigan.
[03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:06.800]  And some of you may have noticed that there is a state of emergency in Flint, Michigan's water supply.
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:12.800]  Now it was a state of emergency was declared by the mayor less than a month ago.
[03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:18.800]  Now the governor, Rick Snyder, has declared a state of emergency over Flint, Michigan's contaminated drinking water.
[03:36:18.800 --> 03:36:20.800]  This is a story that's on IT.
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:26.800]  And they point out that the city's water is causing elevated levels of lead in children.
[03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:28.800]  Now think about that, okay?
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:31.800]  This is the water supply provided for you by the government.
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:36.800]  And we just saw the EPA explode a gold mine unnecessarily.
[03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:37.800]  They were warned about it in advance.
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:39.800]  As a matter of fact, a retired mining engineer said,
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:41.800]  I know precisely what is going to happen with this.
[03:36:41.800 --> 03:36:43.800]  And I know you want this to happen.
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:47.800]  So you can increase your little super fund empire that's going on here.
[03:36:47.800 --> 03:36:48.800]  He warned them about it.
[03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:49.800]  They did it anyway.
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:58.800]  They polluted the Animas River, which polluted three states and Navajo Reservation with arsenic and other heavy lead, heavy metals that were in there.
[03:36:58.800 --> 03:37:06.800]  Now we have the situation where the city of Flint, Michigan switched from the Detroit water supply to the Flint River as their water source.
[03:37:06.800 --> 03:37:13.800]  And then what they discovered was elevation in the levels of lead, especially in children, but in everybody, but especially children.
[03:37:13.800 --> 03:37:14.800]  They're more susceptible to this.
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:21.800]  They said the situation became a full blown crisis when during the summer of 2015, rising levels of lead were being detected in children's blood.
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:30.800]  A pediatrician told RT that the highest readings she and the state had recorded for elevated blood levels in Flint were 38 micrograms per deciliter.
[03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:35.800]  Seven times higher than a level that is classified as elevated by the CDC.
[03:37:35.800 --> 03:37:37.800]  Now, this is the issue.
[03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:40.800]  We know that lead takes away your IQ points.
[03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:50.800]  And we've had research from Harvard and other institutions that talk about the association of declining IQ when you put fluoride in the water.
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:53.800]  This particular thing, I don't think they did that deliberately.
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:58.800]  They didn't say let's switch to the Flint River so we can put lead in the water supply.
[03:37:58.800 --> 03:38:05.800]  But we've got city governments all over this country that are deliberately putting fluoride in the water supply.
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:10.800]  And bottom line is this, you have a responsibility to take care of yourself and your family.
[03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:12.800]  And there are ways that you can do that.
[03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:16.800]  You need to not wait until somebody says, oh, you know what?
[03:38:16.800 --> 03:38:23.800]  This weird thing that's going on with your health, we just tested your blood and you got an elevated level of X, whatever it is.
[03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:28.800]  Pick a toxic substance or heavy metal or something that you're being exposed to.
[03:38:28.800 --> 03:38:30.800]  You need to filter your water.
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:34.800]  It doesn't matter if you're on a city water supply or a well, you still need to filter your water.
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:39.800]  When they polluted the Animas River, it was polluting people's well systems as well, okay?
[03:38:39.800 --> 03:38:41.800]  Not just the people who are in the city.
[03:38:41.800 --> 03:38:44.800]  That's why you need a good quality water filter.
[03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:50.800]  And that's why I wanted to talk about this story because people need to understand, you need to act proactively.
[03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:51.800]  You need to be prepared.
[03:38:51.800 --> 03:38:53.800]  You need to prepare for emergencies.
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:38:57.800]  But you know that in most cases, there is runoff that's going under your water.
[03:38:57.800 --> 03:39:00.800]  You need to do something about that for your family.
[03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:04.800]  Now is a great time to do it, as we pointed out, Alex was just talking about this in the last segment.
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:05.800]  We got 15% off.
[03:39:05.800 --> 03:39:09.800]  This is a great time to start out the new year with clean water.
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:11.800]  We've got a variety of water filters that you can get.
[03:39:11.800 --> 03:39:17.800]  Some you can use while you're traveling or some like this particular filter here, the Alexa Pure, where you can do that at home.
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:18.800]  Filter everything that you're drinking.
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:21.800]  You need to guard your family's health.
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:23.800]  It's very important to do that.
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:24.800]  Now is the time for you to do that.
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:30.800]  We've got a 15% off sale through the rest of this week on everything at the InfoWars store.
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:35.800]  And that's one thing that is really vital to make sure that you have is fresh, pure water.
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:42.800]  Something that is going to be available to you with a gravity feed filter, even if you lose power.
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:45.800]  Now quickly, I want to go back to this Obama gun grab.
[03:39:45.800 --> 03:39:49.800]  And I want to look at it first from this legislative aspect.
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:54.800]  Of course, he doesn't want to wait around for the Congress to do what he wants to do.
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:56.800]  He doesn't like what the Congress is doing.
[03:39:56.800 --> 03:39:58.800]  He doesn't like what the current laws are.
[03:39:58.800 --> 03:39:59.800]  He doesn't like the Second Amendment.
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:02.800]  So he's going to act on his own and say, we don't like that gun lobby.
[03:40:02.800 --> 03:40:04.800]  Well, the gun lobby represents people.
[03:40:04.800 --> 03:40:08.800]  These bureaucracies that he's going to be using don't.
[03:40:08.800 --> 03:40:11.800]  You didn't elect anybody in the ATF.
[03:40:11.800 --> 03:40:14.800]  You didn't elect anybody in the EPA or the BLM.
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:18.800]  These are perpetual agencies that persist regardless of who is president.
[03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:21.800]  This isn't going to go away when Obama leaves, okay?
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:26.800]  He's just abusing it in different ways than a Republican is going to abuse the bureaucracies.
[03:40:26.800 --> 03:40:30.800]  Republicans will grab a different agency and abuse the power in another way.
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:33.800]  That's why liberals and conservatives need to come together and say,
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:38.800]  we're not going to allow regulation without representation anymore.
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:40.800]  We're going to allow taxation without representation.
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:44.800]  But when we have these bureaucratic empires building their little fiefdoms,
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:48.800]  extending their control over paper airplanes, over the Internet one day,
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:50.800]  over your water supply the next day with the EPA,
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:52.800]  every week it's a new power grab.
[03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:54.800]  One is more absurd than the other.
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:40:59.800]  And of course, they're all being directed and encouraged at this point by Obama.
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:01.800]  Same thing will happen when a Republican will get in.
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:05.800]  You know that they're not going to undo all of his regulations.
[03:41:05.800 --> 03:41:08.800]  They're just going to add their own and leave the other ones in place.
[03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:10.800]  So let's take a look at what he's saying.
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:18.800]  Because what he is doing here is saying, I'm not happy with the fact that you've got people in Congress and we've got laws.
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  They're not doing what I want to do in terms of changing, remaking the country.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:28.800]  So I'm going to work with the bureaucracy to do it without any input from the people.
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:32.800]  Because when they talk about the gun lobby, that's you.
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:34.800]  That's the people who are members of the NRA.
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:39.800]  People who are members of the gun owners of America and all these other organizations.
[03:41:39.800 --> 03:41:41.800]  That's you.
[03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:43.800]  They want to ignore that representation.
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:45.800]  They want to ignore your congressional representation.
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:47.800]  And they want to do whatever they wish.
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:54.800]  Let's play those clips where you see how Obama has said one thing and now he's saying another about this.
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:56.800]  You hear some of these quotes.
[03:41:56.800 --> 03:42:00.800]  I need a gun to protect myself from the government.
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:08.800]  We can't do background checks because the government's going to come take my guns away.
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:13.800]  The government's us.
[03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:18.800]  These officials are elected by you.
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:26.800]  They are elected by you. I am elected by you.
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:29.800]  I'm constrained as they are constrained.
[03:42:29.800 --> 03:42:31.800]  Yes, those are Congress elected by us.
[03:42:31.800 --> 03:42:35.800]  The system that our founders put in place is the government of and by and for the people.
[03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:58.800]  And so surely we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent another group of families from...
[03:42:58.800 --> 03:43:00.800]  We don't have a direct democracy.
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:03.800]  We have a republic with guaranteed protections of individual liberty too.
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:06.800]  The Newtown or Columbine have grieved.
[03:43:06.800 --> 03:43:09.800]  Now I want to be clear, Congress still needs to act.
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:11.800]  Now here's the new Obama.
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:30.800]  Because once Congress gets on board with common sense gun safety measures,
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:37.800]  it will reduce gun violence a whole lot more.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:41.800]  But we also can't wait.
[03:43:41.800 --> 03:43:45.800]  Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans,
[03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:53.800]  there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce guns to save more lives.
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:59.800]  Actions that protect our rights and our kids.
[03:43:59.800 --> 03:44:15.800]  Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place.
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:26.800]  Okay, and as I pointed out yesterday when we were talking to Jacarie Jackson, I were looking at this gun regulation, and I pointed out that in the 1950s, Harry Truman was in the middle of the Korean War.
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:31.800]  They were very concerned about the supply of steel and there was labor unrest in the steel business.
[03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:35.800]  They had labor unions and steel mill owners were at loggerheads.
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:39.800]  They tried to work it out at the national level.
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:40.800]  They were unsuccessful.
[03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:46.800]  So Harry Truman issued an executive order, said I'm going to take the steel mills and put them under federal control.
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:50.800]  The mills sued and went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court slapped him down.
[03:44:50.800 --> 03:44:53.800]  They said there's some things that you can't do with executive orders.
[03:44:53.800 --> 03:44:57.800]  If you don't have the authority given to you, you can't do it.
[03:44:57.800 --> 03:45:03.800]  And if you're trying to do something that is against the will of the people as expressed by the Congress,
[03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:11.800]  if they have expressly put out that their will is not to do this thing, then you don't have the authority to do it.
[03:45:11.800 --> 03:45:13.800]  And so that's precisely what's happening.
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:21.800]  Now, when Obama looks at this and he wants to give carte blanche to medical professionals to declare people as mentally ill,
[03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:29.800]  understand that in the 1993 Brady law, it already prohibited ownership by those who were involuntarily committed, those who were found incompetent to stand trial,
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:33.800]  otherwise deemed by the court to be a danger to themselves or others.
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:41.800]  But it prohibited doctors from violating the privacy of their clients, okay, of their patients.
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:42.800]  That is very important.
[03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:46.800]  Now, when we go in and we say that we're going to ban people from buying guns if they're mentally ill,
[03:45:46.800 --> 03:45:52.800]  as Kit Daniels brilliantly pointed out yesterday, Obama could ban himself from buying guns.
[03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:56.800]  Because we've had a psychologist issue an opinion back in 2004,
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:45:59.800]  and he said, you know, I think he's got some serious problems.
[03:45:59.800 --> 03:46:01.800]  And let me read you what he had in this article.
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:12.800]  He says, back in 2014, psychology expert Dr. Gina Loudon indicated Obama's decision to trade five high-risk Taliban leaders for Army Sergeant Beau Bergdahl
[03:46:12.800 --> 03:46:16.800]  was an irrational decision that you'd expect from someone with mental issues.
[03:46:16.800 --> 03:46:21.800]  And she said, I am very, very concerned about the mental stability of the president at this point.
[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:23.800]  Some of his behavior seems irrational to me.
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:27.800]  When you're listening to this, just imagine in your mind that somebody is saying,
[03:46:27.800 --> 03:46:31.800]  I'm very, very concerned about the mental stability of your name.
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:36.800]  Okay, at this point, some of your behavior seems very irrational to me.
[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:39.800]  It seems beyond that of just typical narcissistic arrogance.
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:45.800]  Okay, she says, I'm the leader of a big country, and I feel tyrannical at the moment, that kind of attitude.
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:49.800]  She says, it really seems to me like this president is demonstrating behavior that's not only anti-American,
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:55.800]  but irrational, erratic, perhaps not exactly what we might want to deem as sane.
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:46:57.800]  Well, okay, so that's just her opinion.
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:01.800]  If you like Obama, you're just going to say, that's just one person's opinion.
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:08.800]  It only takes one person's opinion to take away your rights if we allow him to do this by executive order.
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:11.800]  That was the point that Kit Daniels was making.
[03:47:11.800 --> 03:47:15.800]  And he said, interestingly, when Obama announced the rules on Tuesday, he referred to himself 76 times.
[03:47:15.800 --> 03:47:20.800]  I would say, ironically, when he did that, he referred to himself as 76 times,
[03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:26.800]  because there's an narcissistic personality disorder characterized by a long-standing pattern of grandiosity,
[03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:30.800]  either in fantasy or in actual behavior, an overwhelming need for admiration,
[03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  usually a complete lack of empathy towards others.
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:37.800]  And of course, he's quoting that from a psych definition.
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:43.800]  Look, you can find some doctor, some psychologist who will write up pretty much anybody,
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:47.800]  if you put enough pressure on them, just like they can pressure your phone company,
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:51.800]  your internet service provider, the social media websites that you go to.
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:57.800]  They can put pressure on anybody to give them information about you, to twist information about you.
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:00.800]  That's what's so dangerous about this.
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:06.800]  That's why you should be concerned about this, regardless of your position on guns.
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:11.800]  You should not want to live in a country where people can, without due process,
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:13.800]  have implications.
[03:48:13.800 --> 03:48:15.800]  Be put on a secret list.
[03:48:15.800 --> 03:48:17.800]  Okay, we've got watch lists, we've got no fly lists.
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:22.800]  Now we're going to have maybe mentally ill lists where you're put on this without your knowledge,
[03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:24.800]  without a day in court.
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:26.800]  You can't confront your accusers.
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:29.800]  You can't call witnesses in your defense.
[03:48:29.800 --> 03:48:31.800]  They just do this.
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:33.800]  And someday you'll find out about it.
[03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:36.800]  That is the pattern of behavior that is developing this.
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:40.800]  It is much bigger than just the single issue of guns.
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:45.800]  And that's why we need to talk to each other and understand that when we're talking,
[03:48:45.800 --> 03:48:50.800]  whether we're talking about guns over here that conservatives like or we're talking and then they hate drugs,
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:53.800]  or whether they're talking about drugs that the liberals are not afraid of,
[03:48:53.800 --> 03:48:55.800]  but they are really afraid of guns.
[03:48:55.800 --> 03:48:59.800]  We need to look at the bigger picture.
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:02.800]  We need to look at the context, the kind of country that we're creating,
[03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:05.800]  the kind of country that we are destroying.
[03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:07.800]  We're destroying the rule of law.
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:12.800]  We're destroying due process and protections that have been put in for a very good reason.
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:15.800]  For hundreds of years, things that are going back to the Magna Carta,
[03:49:15.800 --> 03:49:21.800]  we do not want to have a secret star chamber that is going to secretly evaluate us.
[03:49:21.800 --> 03:49:26.800]  We don't want to have a kind of stuzzy society where everyone is encouraged
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:30.800]  and threatened to become snitches on each other.
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:34.800]  So let me go from drugs now to the war on drugs.
[03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:38.800]  To those of you who are on the conservative side who are not afraid of guns,
[03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:43.800]  but you're so afraid of drugs that you will give any kind of power to the government.
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:46.800]  Let me read you a story here because this is very interesting.
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:49.800]  This is a retired couple. They're white.
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:52.800]  And guess where they retired from? The CIA.
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:49:54.800]  Now let me tell you what happened to them.
[03:49:54.800 --> 03:49:59.800]  They were making tea. They were discarding the leaves and then they got swatted.
[03:49:59.800 --> 03:50:04.800]  Okay, you had a highway patrolman who looked at this, saw them coming out of a hydroponic store.
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:10.800]  And I can't believe, here we are, 25 years after I first started seeing these kinds of stories.
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:13.800]  I remember when I was with the Libertarian Party, there was story after story
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:19.800]  of cops hanging out at hydroponic stores, following people home, and then subjecting them to raids.
[03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:23.800]  Because, you know, if you go to a hydroponic store and you want to do aquaponics
[03:50:23.800 --> 03:50:28.800]  or you want to raise tomatoes in your home as these people wanted to do, that's suspicious.
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:31.800]  Maybe you're growing something that we don't think you should grow.
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:36.800]  Okay, so he puts them on a list and then they go through their garbage. What are they fine?
[03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:42.800]  Tea leaves. Okay, so that gets a SWAT team to break into their homes violently.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:47.800]  No knock raid. They were furious and the district judge says, they had probable cause.
[03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:52.800]  I have no problems with that. Now let me ask you, conservatives, can you read the tea leaves?
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:50:54.800]  Can you see where this is headed?
[03:50:54.800 --> 03:51:00.800]  We need to come together. We need to understand how we're destroying the legal foundations of our privacy.
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:05.800]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:11.800]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment. He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:15.800]  In January of 1998, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital. He waited too long.
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:25.800]  In June of that same year, I almost joined them at 42. What did I do?
[03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:33.800]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call Extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo, biloba, hawthorn, milk, thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:41.800]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, Extendivite is designed to clear block arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:15.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in this last segment. There's a lot of things I'd like to cover.
[03:54:15.800 --> 03:54:24.800]  There's a situation that happened in Raleigh where I'm from with the TSA. We've got Harry Reid retiring and he wants his slush fund to retire with.
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:38.800]  $600,000 slush fund. I want to take a look at where Harry Reid got all of his millions and why he should be a special case, why he should be able to keep all of his money that's in his reelection campaign.
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:45.800]  But before we do, I just want to tell you real quickly, remind you that we've got 15% off across the board, everything at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:45.800 --> 03:54:56.800]  Just use the promo code GIFT15. You'll get 15% off of everything. And as I pointed out earlier, when you look at these stories about what happened with the EPA polluting a river that went through three states,
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:55:04.800]  polluted wells where you look at the story about an emergency situation in Michigan, in Flint, Michigan with lead in the water there.
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:12.800]  You need to take care of your family. And of course, there's a lot of health products that we have at InfowarsStore.com. All of those 15% off as well as water filters.
[03:55:12.800 --> 03:55:19.800]  We have the new Infowars Calendar 695 pays for itself 20% off each month and InfowarsStore special promotions.
[03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:26.800]  Now I want to go first to this TSA story. This is something's breaking in local news in California and local news in North Carolina.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:34.800]  And Raleigh as well as RT has picked it up. Daily Mail had it at the top of their website. This is a situation in Raleigh.
[03:55:34.800 --> 03:55:41.800]  You had a father outraged and there's video of his daughter being padded down. It went for a very long time. And what was her crime?
[03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:48.800]  She had a juice box and her carry-on bag, a terrorist, obviously a terrorist.
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:52.800]  The juice exceeded the limit of three ounces of liquids for a carry-on.
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:58.800]  He said that he thought this was excessive. He says, I'm a very big proponent of security. If they were padding me down, no problem.
[03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:02.800]  But this is a 10-year-old girl. Let me explain to you, Dad.
[03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:09.800]  When you allow them to do that to you, they will do it to your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren.
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:16.800]  It's just like when you're on the airplane itself. Remember when they give you instructions about when that oxygen mass comes down?
[03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:24.800]  They tell you, put that on yourself first before you try to take care of your child because then you'll be able to put it on your child and help others around you.
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:32.800]  If you don't respect yourself, if you don't stand up for your freedom, for your dignity, they'll take it from your family too.
[03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:37.800]  That's the lesson you need to learn. And you need to understand this isn't about security. He still doesn't get it.
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:43.800]  He still sees them doing this to his daughter and he doesn't understand. This is security theater. It's been proven over and over again.
[03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:49.800]  It's totally ineffective. If you think about it, if you just think about what you would do if you were a terrorist, okay?
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:52.800]  If you had criminal actions, you know that this is ineffective.
[03:56:52.800 --> 03:57:01.800]  And we've shown all the different vulnerabilities and the idiocy where that we've even shown you the unredacted publications from the TSA saying there is no threat to airports or airplanes.
[03:57:01.800 --> 03:57:11.800]  As they were saying, if you stop the pat-down of your children as we had the reaction here in Texas, we had local legislator put that in and it passed unanimously in the house.
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:20.800]  So they said, oh, you're not going to pass that in the Senate. They got our former CIA lieutenant governor, Dewhurst, to route that in the Senate.
[03:57:20.800 --> 03:57:26.800]  And they had the TSA say, we'll turn Texas into a no-fly zone if you stop us from patting down your children.
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:34.800]  They know exactly what this is about. This is nothing but obedience training. This is what BF Skinner called operant conditioning.
[03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:41.800]  Let me put my hand on you and I'll reward you with letting you travel on a plane. It's the same thing I do to my border collie.
[03:57:41.800 --> 03:57:47.800]  Because upset when people come to the door, what we do is we say, okay, let's have somebody, we'll stage somebody coming to the door.
[03:57:47.800 --> 03:57:52.800]  And when he starts getting all excited and wants to bite them, what we'll do is we'll hand him some food.
[03:57:52.800 --> 03:58:00.800]  We'll keep handing him food. And pretty soon, we don't have to threaten him. He just likes the positive reinforcement.
[03:58:00.800 --> 03:58:07.800]  It's about security. It's about your ability to travel. This is for your own good. Be a good little doggy.
[03:58:07.800 --> 03:58:36.800]  Do what the government says. Join us tonight at Infowars Nightly News, 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
