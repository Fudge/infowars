[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.960 --> 00:43.120]  the day of the pole chef the day of the planets aligning with the Sun in a
[00:43.120 --> 00:49.480]  magnetic field set to trigger ultramassive coronal ejections from the
[00:49.480 --> 00:57.920]  Sun fable to vaporize the earth neburu planets X death comments
[00:57.920 --> 01:07.640]  thunder the barbarian type destruction well my friends so far we're half way
[01:07.640 --> 01:18.840]  or more globally into 2012 and soon we can leave this hoax behind I hope there
[01:18.840 --> 01:24.040]  aren't any mass suicides I hope there aren't any mass killings in association
[01:24.040 --> 01:27.360]  with it because when you have the mainstream media and that's who's pushed
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.240]  this running around for decades saying that we probably have the end of the
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.520]  world I mean mainstream news saying that giving a credence I am surprised that we
[01:38.520 --> 01:45.600]  have not seen more bedlam but I do have a report here some thought massive power
[01:45.600 --> 01:53.160]  outage in Annapolis marked the end of the world well if you were on a respirator
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.720]  in the hospital didn't have a backup power it would be and about three to
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.960]  four weeks of the power went off the nuclear reactors would all melt down
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.960]  there's 400 plus of those there's a lot of real threats we face but no one ever
[02:04.960 --> 02:08.240]  seems to want to get focused and concerned about those they're concerned
[02:08.240 --> 02:14.640]  about about whatever the media hypes just like people still most people will
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.880]  not swim in the ocean they think Jaws is going to eat them because in the 1972
[02:18.880 --> 02:24.520]  film I know I beat that dead shark to death but that's what this whole
[02:24.520 --> 02:32.640]  shooting hysteria is about and I've got to say this you know the issue of our
[02:32.640 --> 02:39.160]  magazine that came out three weeks ago in late November the December issue this
[02:39.160 --> 02:43.240]  man wants your guns and said he would use executive orders to do it and the UN
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.440]  Treaty it wasn't hard to predict people are like wow how'd you predict that it's
[02:48.440 --> 02:56.200]  like predicting that a person the way 600 pounds is going to go pig out on ice
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.920]  cream it's not a hard prediction or it's like predicting an alcoholic is going
[03:01.920 --> 03:09.400]  to you know drink a bunch of alcohol a non-reformed alcoholic or something this
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.840]  is a no-brainer and this morning I happen to be going around on YouTube looking
[03:13.840 --> 03:19.960]  for news clips and I ran into a National Democratic Party talk show host I'm
[03:19.960 --> 03:22.920]  not even give these people attention because they have such small audiences
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.080]  and the person was admitting that you know these pro-gun people to think
[03:27.080 --> 03:29.960]  there's a world government forming they're dangerous and people are
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.400]  listening to them and you know we're ignoring I'm saying we've taken over but
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.200]  really you know that's just spin these people are dangerous we've got to get
[03:39.200 --> 03:44.720]  their guns now and that's the thing these globalist really think they're in
[03:44.720 --> 03:49.560]  charge because for so long they just tell you hey this is the way it is and
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.200]  then everybody just goes oh well you're the authority absolutely but watching
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.960]  this person's it was video the radio show lecturing people about how there's no
[03:58.960 --> 04:04.480]  world government there's no new world order and no one wants your guns that
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.120]  in fact that's the spin the last few years nobody wants your guns but we are
[04:09.120 --> 04:20.400]  gonna take them no one wants your guns but we are going to take them and I'm
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.560]  like listen do you understand that I'm not in a trance like the general public
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.600]  and more the public's waking up out of the trance and you know you can sit
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.760]  there and like a magician can put somebody in a trance and you know tell
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.600]  them that a potato is an apple and they'll believe it listen bud well I mean
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.400]  you see them on the news Bloomberg there's a new headline out saying no
[04:43.400 --> 04:50.120]  one's more pro-second amendment than him and yes ladies and gentlemen the
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.920]  governor of New York is announcing that it's in the New York Times that they

[05:04.720 --> 05:09.320]  the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist

[08:20.440 --> 08:25.320]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to say that president Kennedy
[08:25.320 --> 08:34.560]  has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new world order
[08:34.560 --> 08:43.720]  it was almost as if we were a planned implosion it's just pancakes either you
[08:43.720 --> 08:48.840]  were with us or you were with the terrorists
[08:48.840 --> 09:04.440]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of
[09:04.440 --> 09:07.680]  soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.080]  guns will be taken no one will be able to be off we can take all the money from
[09:14.080 --> 09:17.720]  many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an
[09:17.720 --> 09:22.360]  American city global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in
[09:22.360 --> 09:26.440]  charge but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do
[09:26.440 --> 09:31.960]  and for me give me liberty or give me death
[09:32.080 --> 09:42.640]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones my friends we are
[09:42.640 --> 09:50.320]  blasting out worldwide and it is the 21st day of December 2012 and this day
[09:50.320 --> 09:54.680]  is already halfway past our more in some parts of the world already getting
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.840]  ready to go into December 22nd by the grace of God there has not been too
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.320]  much crime or hysteria taking place around the world we'll be going over
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.600]  some of that news but across our fingers say a prayer I hope that people don't do
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.000]  anything crazy today though people are always doing things that are crazy
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.080]  obviously we had predicted it wasn't hard that the Mayan prophecy which really
[10:23.080 --> 10:29.760]  wasn't even a Mayan prophecy that the world would end was a fraud and we of
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.840]  course predicted that it was not hard to do though the globalist and many of
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.920]  their Illuminati writers we had a special report on this last week that's
[10:40.920 --> 10:51.000]  online titled 2012 doomsday secrets revealed that Terrence McKenna and many
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.960]  others in the last 30 40 years put out this idea and they actually say it's the
[10:55.960 --> 11:02.160]  beginning of the Luciferian age or as new ages would call it the age of
[11:02.160 --> 11:09.160]  Aquarius so this is a very important date to the Illuminati and they believe
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.400]  this is the kickoff of their big takeover and you can notice they're
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.720]  moving very very quickly on a lot of different fronts yeah there it is 2012
[11:18.720 --> 11:23.640]  doomsday secrets revealed special report and just type that into your NSA two-way
[11:23.640 --> 11:30.640]  spy system and it will come up for you there on Google all right ladies and
[11:30.640 --> 11:36.440]  gentlemen David Ike because you mean you gotta have David Ike on on 2012 he's
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.120]  been saying it's a fraud for decades but he believes that by 2016 the New World
[11:41.120 --> 11:44.520]  Order will be reversed that there will be a true awakening and that this is a
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.240]  counterfeit awakening that they're pushing and he's a very intelligent
[11:49.240 --> 11:52.440]  person doesn't mean I agree with everything he says but he'll be on with
[11:52.440 --> 12:00.120]  us coming up in the second hour today and then we will continue with open
[12:00.120 --> 12:08.520]  phones as well okay let me just stop here for a moment and just read to you a
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.440]  few headlines communist Chinese government calls for Americans to be
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.240]  disarmed we covered this at the end of the show yesterday we're going to
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.600]  continue today because the story is just off the charts incredible and people
[12:22.600 --> 12:26.400]  know it's amazing and it's getting a lot of attention which is good we could use
[12:26.400 --> 12:32.040]  this to really destroy this big anti-second amendment push that's going
[12:32.040 --> 12:38.800]  on the enemy's arrogance in saying that the communist Chinese the biggest owners
[12:38.800 --> 12:43.520]  of the private fellow reserve debt are now influencing our movies our
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.720]  television buying up our media ordering films not be released or re-edited like
[12:48.720 --> 12:55.000]  red dawn than the new release that was postponed almost two years and telling
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.920]  Obama do whatever it takes there's quotes here wage a war on the second
[13:01.920 --> 13:09.520]  amendment and use the massacre to get the guns I mean this is an authoritarian
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.560]  enemy the number one threat to what's left to the US according to Pentagon and
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.680]  I agree that has been basically set up as a globalist command base to leverage
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.880]  out the US deindustrialize us and then bring this nation finally down to its
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.000]  knees and the CFR and others have pushed it as the Chinese century 21st century
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.440]  not the Chinese century it's the New World order leveraging the Chinese people
[13:35.440 --> 13:43.840]  as a military and economic mercenary system leverage that slave block against
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.520]  the rest of the world bringing in slavery worldwide and I'm going to break
[13:47.520 --> 13:53.080]  that down today it's very very important and explain how the globalist are
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.680]  playing the US and China off against each other they want the nations to be
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.480]  degraded the people to be poor we have everything in common with the Chinese
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.040]  people and the Russian people and the people of Europe and the people of
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.720]  Latin America it's the globalist using a worldwide corporate system of playing
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.600]  what's left of the nation-states off against each other to bring in their
[14:14.600 --> 14:19.120]  world government so I will be explaining some of that coming up it's of the
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.800]  paramount importance but first off let me show you some second amendment news
[14:23.800 --> 14:30.680]  here that is just again absolutely off the charts the secret services here
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.760]  will bring them in here bring them in here I need a live mic okay I mean I
[14:37.760 --> 14:43.040]  mean if they want me they can come in here anyways ladies and gentlemen this
[14:43.040 --> 14:46.800]  is not the first time a secret service has been here just nobody talk to them
[14:46.800 --> 14:50.080]  they got to come in here if they want to talk or they can go get a warrant or
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.360]  whatever they want anyways getting back to what I was saying the globalists are
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.400]  scared right now because they know that you're aware of their program and New
[15:00.400 --> 15:07.640]  York governor gun confiscation and forced buyback an option and they're
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.720]  saying oh it's no big deal you ever write the guns we're gonna ban them and make
[15:10.720 --> 15:14.680]  you turn them in but we'll pay it for them so that's being announced Cuomo in
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.280]  the New York Times our article breaking it down is on drudgereport.com
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.080]  and here's the article Cuomo says he'll outline gun proposals next month the
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.960]  proposal is yeah we may just ban your guns make you turn them in okay so we've
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.640]  got that information also we've now put out a petition at the White House in
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.880]  full wars.com has to sign a petition to deport Pierce Morgan for his attack on
[15:36.880 --> 15:44.680]  the Constitution. Now the secret service here? We'll bring them in here get them

[24:26.960 --> 24:31.000]  with a subpoena and wouldn't tell us basically what it was about totally
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.360]  ridiculous you guys just come back at two o'clock or you can waste your time
[24:34.360 --> 24:38.880]  and get a subpoena we've had those before I'm sure it's going to be let me
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.240]  just guess an idiot commenter I bet money on planet info wars.com or on
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.960]  info wars.com and I've tried to tell you trolls this if you go on there and
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.240]  threaten somebody I don't know what it's about yet I mean I'm gonna love it if
[24:55.240 --> 24:58.280]  they're here asking me about what I think about Obama is some intimidation
[24:58.280 --> 25:05.080]  that is lets me know I'm really starting to get to him that could be it too but
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.400]  you know four years ago they were here asking what's this about the Obama
[25:09.400 --> 25:14.080]  deception and that was in March three days before it was supposed to come out
[25:14.080 --> 25:20.880]  and I'm like aren't you here about something else that was FBI so I'm sure
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.600]  it was routine because I just saw the whole bearing guy with a clipboard the
[25:25.600 --> 25:31.040]  rest of it so I'll try to find out what it is not a radio stunt folks I sure you
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.360]  the Secret Service was just standing right there at that door I said come on
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.200]  here and the guy just literally smiled at me turned red and left he didn't really
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.000]  look mad but but some of the crew said he was a little mad you guys ambushed
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.640]  me no I want to talk to Alex Jones and they said okay he's in here on air and
[25:48.640 --> 25:53.200]  he just didn't didn't hear that or didn't and then he was all kind of grumpy
[25:53.200 --> 25:59.400]  at dude said he was like will you ambush me and do sitting there barely got me
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.400]  sleep last night from the Christmas party hair sticking up the looks at him
[26:03.400 --> 26:07.320]  do said and went you asked for Alex Jones you didn't know he was on the radio
[26:07.320 --> 26:14.160]  no I don't know that so again you can come over here at two o'clock for
[26:14.160 --> 26:21.760]  whatever it's about or well me first he said get off air and then I can't just
[26:21.760 --> 26:26.200]  get off air to go talk to you of course I think you may also then got upset and
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.520]  left when everybody pulled cameras on him I think that's what irritated him I
[26:31.520 --> 26:34.840]  mean whatever man you got the NSA reading all our email illegally
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.280]  I mean give me a break give me a break what acting like it's a big deal to be
[26:39.280 --> 26:45.560]  on camera you got all us on camera and all the rest of it okay folks we're in
[26:45.560 --> 26:50.840]  the middle of 2012 so I guess we have marked December 21st 2012 with some
[26:50.840 --> 26:57.600]  something interesting the secret service here at the office and we are
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.320]  also marking 2012 but I feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach with a
[27:00.320 --> 27:04.200]  bayonet right now so that's an interesting thing I'm not getting the flu
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.440]  or something but we are going to continue here on air today with all of the
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.920]  news and you really should call your friends and your family and have them
[27:15.920 --> 27:19.080]  tune into the radio broadcast whether you're listening on XM or AM and FM
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.800]  stations or the internet and full wars calm or watching video streams at
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.120]  prison planet TV you should share your prison planet TV passcode with family so
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.840]  they can tune in and see the video as well because this is a pretty big deal
[27:32.840 --> 27:41.800]  what's going on right now I mean to say that is really not even covering one
[27:41.800 --> 27:47.880]  tenth of what we're facing the New York governor says that they're looking at
[27:47.880 --> 27:53.440]  gun confiscation through a forced gun buyback and they say well look yeah we're
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.600]  gonna make you turn them in and we're gonna pay him and it looks like that's
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.880]  what Obama's task force is going to be calling for because that's what Biden has
[28:02.880 --> 28:06.880]  called for in the past when he's not giving speeches in fact yesterday we
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.580]  had this clip I never got to it Kurt Nemo's article on it was called Biden's
[28:11.580 --> 28:16.240]  Beretta and it's a video clip of Biden four years ago on the campaign trail
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.880]  saying we'll never come after your guns I promise it's ridiculous you won't get
[28:20.880 --> 28:24.760]  my Beretta which is an assault weapon semi-auto that's what they classify it
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.560]  as and you'll never get my shotguns well they want to ban most shotguns most of
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.600]  them are semi-auto and the ATF officially saying they want to physically make you
[28:33.600 --> 28:39.040]  turn those in ban gun show private sales giving a grandson arrival ban
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.120]  junior shooting groups and then once everything's registered then they
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.640]  confiscate them and that's the path they follow in every country and they are
[28:47.640 --> 28:53.560]  now saying well we'll just skip all that and we'll you know adverse possession
[28:53.560 --> 28:58.440]  we'll just order you to turn turn those guns in and then they can just you know
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.200]  wait till you leave work this is how it'll go folks if they ever pick me up
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.320]  and set me up send me off to a FEMA camp or whatever it'll be out on the
[29:07.320 --> 29:12.120]  highway because I'm as predictable as a Swiss watch and they know that you're
[29:12.120 --> 29:16.440]  following you with your little GPS tracked phones and all the rest of it they
[29:16.440 --> 29:21.760]  just pull you over say you resist blow your head off I mean in Houston they've
[29:21.760 --> 29:25.440]  got so many CIA on their police force when they want to kill CIA in Houston
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.760]  they've done this on the news you've seen it they just get the guy out of the car
[29:28.760 --> 29:34.680]  pull the gun out show you right in the head remember that carney guy and Wayne
[29:34.680 --> 29:37.600]  Madsen went down there and confirmed it was a hit and they just on the news get
[29:37.600 --> 29:40.360]  the guy out of his car stands there put the gun to his head killing right in
[29:40.360 --> 29:44.120]  front everybody so you know that's how they'll take me out or plant drugs on
[29:44.120 --> 29:46.960]  me or something like that you know some of the stuff they ship in all right

[33:10.200 --> 33:38.560]  network so ladies and gentlemen I want to break down exactly what's happening
[33:38.560 --> 33:43.800]  here on this planet there is a global corporate crime syndicate above all the
[33:43.800 --> 33:50.920]  major nations of the world they are taking over just a few final countries
[33:50.920 --> 33:55.240]  that the new world order hasn't been able to destroy they're taking them over
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.720]  militarily doesn't mean those countries are good either they're usually run by
[33:59.720 --> 34:03.840]  crooks most governments is history and our founders teach us are run by crooks
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.400]  and the more subservient the people the more enslaved the more crazy the
[34:08.400 --> 34:12.320]  elites get because criminals then compete with each other in the power
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.080]  structure and so and so the very worst gets into control if good people are
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.560]  involved in society then you have a virtuous and successful and wealthy
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.240]  system but then the children always become decadent their children become
[34:27.240 --> 34:33.720]  corrupt and evil their children become satanic everything collapses so there is
[34:33.720 --> 34:39.120]  a problem with a wealthy nation is that we had so much freedom we became the
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.960]  wealthiest people in the world four percent of the population half the
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.000]  wealth and now even though we're a shadow of our former selves people have
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.760]  just incrementally learned how to carry a greater and greater weight on their
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.920]  back and the globalists are getting ready to bring in total agenda 21 double
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.800]  and triple our power prices assign us on to unlimited trillions of dollars of
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.320]  foreign debt that's not ours and having us armed is going to be
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.880]  incompatible with the getting rid of juries getting rid of grand juries
[35:11.880 --> 35:15.200]  doubling tripling the present population we already have the biggest in the
[35:15.200 --> 35:20.440]  world surveilling everyone openly disappearing people forever that film
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.440]  the police they already want life in prison in Illinois for filming the
[35:23.440 --> 35:28.640]  police they want to be able to do full you know cavity searches on the side of
[35:28.640 --> 35:33.840]  the highway with their whole arm not just their fingers they want to fully
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.000]  absolutely dominate you that's the criminal instinct when you know you've
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.880]  committed all these crimes and you know you're sitting on top of tiger you want
[35:41.880 --> 35:46.320]  to go ahead and get that tiger tied down so you can then go ahead and flip that
[35:46.320 --> 35:52.520]  tiger's throat they've stolen the world through fraud now they see us as as like
[35:52.520 --> 35:56.560]  weevils in the pantry that have gotten into the wheat or gotten into the grain
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.800]  and we need to be exterminated and so that's why they have this arrogant
[36:01.800 --> 36:05.240]  attitude where they talked us like we're children they talked us from their fake
[36:05.240 --> 36:12.480]  authority and we're supposed to just grovel and be in complete fear and we
[36:12.480 --> 36:18.480]  now sing the song the creative slaves now the general public's rebellious with
[36:18.480 --> 36:23.000]  their neighbors or their bosses or with themselves but they're not rebellious
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.840]  with the establishment they see uniforms they see black armored vehicles they see
[36:26.840 --> 36:32.960]  the the body armor of the helicopters it is a it is a religious sacrament an
[36:32.960 --> 36:39.960]  icon a relic now to fall to your knees and worship and grovel and fear while
[36:39.960 --> 36:45.320]  saying you live in a free country you're scared of the government and afraid
[36:45.320 --> 36:49.200]  they'll disappear you but you're in a free government in a free country and
[36:49.200 --> 36:55.040]  and you're a conspiracy theorist if you warn people and say we're in grave danger
[36:55.920 --> 37:03.960]  of course you know what the founders said there is liberty when the government
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.680]  fears the people there is tyranny when the people fear the government and and
[37:08.680 --> 37:11.600]  always see emails and comments going that's not the founders that's a V for
[37:11.600 --> 37:16.400]  vendetta no no that's art imitating life the founders all said that over and over
[37:16.400 --> 37:23.720]  again because of thomas jefferson quote when the government fears the people
[37:23.720 --> 37:26.640]  there is liberty when the people for the government there is tyranny thomas
[37:26.640 --> 37:32.320]  jefferson thomas jefferson you may have heard of him one of our founders one of
[37:32.320 --> 37:36.200]  our presidents I believe one of the greatest intellectual minds of all
[37:36.200 --> 37:39.920]  time from my perspective because I've read his writings I agree with him I
[37:39.920 --> 37:46.600]  like him I want to see a thomas jefferson style world not a 1984 stylistic
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.720]  world that's what 1984 is based on is a high-level British intelligence officer
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.280]  who also served as a frontline communist commissar in the Spanish Civil
[37:55.280 --> 38:01.560]  War pre-World War two and he'd also served as an imperial police officer
[38:01.560 --> 38:05.040]  and a lot of other issues that's why George R. Wille Eric Blair was so uniquely
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.840]  suited to be able to really write about what a Soviet tyranny would look like
[38:08.840 --> 38:17.240]  in England well that's why when you read 1984 so much of it is what we're now
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.480]  going into you're like man how do you guess all this he didn't guess it he
[38:21.480 --> 38:30.040]  took what he learned and seen firsthand in India in France in Spain in Russia in
[38:30.040 --> 38:37.200]  England all right side issue let me document cam some of these articles
[38:37.200 --> 38:45.120]  here for you New York gun confiscation and forced buyback an option New York
[38:45.120 --> 38:48.280]  governor Andrew Cuomo and they're just put not the trouble in remember his daddy
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.000]  we got him on videotape and David Rockefeller Bilderberg you know six says
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.560]  that the state of New York is serious about gun confiscation the Democrat and
[38:56.560 --> 39:00.400]  former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development told the Albany radio station
[39:00.400 --> 39:06.800]  he plans to propose a package of draconian legislation during his state
[39:06.800 --> 39:11.120]  of the state address next month hey guys will you tell Kurt there's a typo right
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.080]  there and this is linked on drugs just just just that right there meant to
[39:14.080 --> 39:17.680]  tell him about it like 6 a.m. when this one up this morning and I never forgot
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.880]  to tell him and just got caught doing other things it goes on and then these
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.080]  are quotes out of the New York Times article I don't we'll just proofread
[39:27.080 --> 39:33.560]  this on here I don't think legitimate sportsmen are going to say I need an
[39:33.560 --> 39:39.000]  assault weapon to go hunting Cuomo said according to the New York Times there is
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.480]  a balance here I understand the rights of gun owners I understand the rights of
[39:43.480 --> 39:50.120]  hunters Cuomo indicated the state will likely force some kind of permit
[39:50.120 --> 39:54.320]  process on owners of semi-automatic assault weapons same thing they did in
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.720]  New York City and then they just stop issuing the permits to guns period in
[39:58.720 --> 40:01.520]  addition to generating revenue and expanding the size and reach of
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.360]  government the effort will also allow the state to confiscate the weapons of
[40:05.360 --> 40:10.480]  citizens who do not comply confiscation could be an option mandatory sale to the
[40:10.480 --> 40:15.120]  state could be an option permitting permitting could be an option keep your
[40:15.120 --> 40:21.200]  gun but per minute yeah and they want you to come in and register it then they
[40:21.200 --> 40:24.960]  confiscate it's like will confiscate it if you don't register it and then you're
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.240]  fool enough to come register it then they confiscate it it follows the exact
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.360]  pattern throughout history the Romans in what's Austria what's Romania today
[40:34.360 --> 40:39.240]  what's Switzerland today what's a gall what was France was France today
[40:39.240 --> 40:44.480]  Germania what's Germany today they would come in and say as it took them
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.280]  hundreds of years take the whole area over it's the same story they would have
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.720]  your local scouts they'd hired who could interpret they'd say listen completely
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.280]  give up and we'll only kill all your men we'll let your women and children
[40:58.280 --> 41:03.880]  survive we'll reeducate them we'll put them in our households as slaves and
[41:03.880 --> 41:10.760]  make them run you know Romans basically down the road or we're going to kill
[41:10.760 --> 41:15.200]  everyone and then and then other times they'd say well just show up here and
[41:15.200 --> 41:18.640]  turn all your swords in and then we won't kill you and then a lot of times
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.040]  they would come turn their swords in and they wouldn't a lot of times kill them
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.440]  right away they would then basically say okay well now you've got to go stay in
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.880]  this barracks in the stockade area where we could observe you and then they would
[41:33.880 --> 41:37.640]  kind of have like a reeducation camp where they had their spies and agents in
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.360]  there figuring out who the troublemakers were see reeducation camps the
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.320]  Romans developed them and they develop those out of some systems the Greeks use
[41:45.320 --> 41:50.720]  in occupied areas they occupied thousands of years ago so reeducation
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.400]  camps are very very old that's that's why all of this is done over and over and
[41:54.400 --> 42:00.080]  over again and so they always tell you oh just to come register those you can
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.040]  keep it after you pay a small fee and do a background check and Lord did a
[42:04.040 --> 42:06.720]  background check to get these well this is a new one where we decide if you can
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.400]  keep it just come on in with the guns and we won't swap team you and then they're
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.640]  going to swap team people who don't come and register they're gonna go well we
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.000]  know you have guns because they're already registered with the Knicks they
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.440]  just want specifically what you got so you see a bring them in so they can take
[42:22.440 --> 42:25.920]  them on the spot and then they'll know you've got the guns they'll just swap
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.200]  team you put it on the news maybe kill some people in a few houses to scare
[42:30.200 --> 42:33.520]  everyone then the good old boys will all line up with their tails between your
[42:33.520 --> 42:41.160]  legs and come in and here's my gun cops will be alright keep an eye on you can
[42:41.160 --> 42:43.920]  give us any trouble about this you understand we got to do this and then
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.920]  they're all that writing reports quick reports where they do it you know boxes
[42:49.920 --> 42:55.480]  are checked off seemed angry seemed upset seemed friendly well though that's a
[42:55.480 --> 42:58.480]  sign you're a terrorist and then now you're a terrorist even after you turn
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.040]  your guns in you're always going to be a terrorist under Homeland Security it was
[43:02.040 --> 43:05.760]  always for you it was always for veterans libertarians conservatives it was
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.440]  always for you and see now they're letting you know they're saying it you're
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.040]  in the clan of you own a gun you're a racist you're a murderer you're a terrorist
[43:14.040 --> 43:19.440]  you're a bad man and you're being taught how you're the bad man so this
[43:19.440 --> 43:28.160]  article is up at info wars.com and in the state of the state address he is set
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.920]  to say any guns that aren't registered with us we've got to authorize it now
[43:32.920 --> 43:37.320]  and then basically confiscate them from that point and that is directly out of an
[43:37.320 --> 43:41.880]  article in the New York Times that Como says he'll outlaw gun proposal next
[43:41.880 --> 43:46.440]  month and a Nemo who wrote this article at 4 a.m. did a great job I know as I
[43:46.440 --> 43:51.760]  got up at 5 30 went to info wars.com that's my problem even though I stay up
[43:51.760 --> 43:55.040]  till one in the morning I get up at like 5 30 hurting into an old man I got up
[43:55.040 --> 43:59.240]  earlier and earlier and I noticed Nemo had just posted an article at like 5 30
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.440]  in the morning and I called him and he said yeah I couldn't sleep I said wow
[44:03.440 --> 44:10.240]  good find because this was just buried in WGDWGDJAM they have the audio up
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.840]  there and buried in the New York Times like a little footnote oh there's a
[44:14.840 --> 44:18.360]  little proposal he's gonna have that we're gonna confiscate them and pay you
[44:18.360 --> 44:22.240]  back for them because the way he says it is well we could just confiscate them
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.000]  outright and pay you for them or maybe some people could keep them but register
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.080]  and we'll confiscate them later you know it's no big deal okay I want to get
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.640]  into communist China and break down we're facing with them but but first
[44:36.640 --> 44:42.480]  here's something that you can really send a message with and to a great
[44:42.480 --> 44:51.160]  extent it is symbolic but it's very very important signed petition to deport
[44:51.160 --> 44:55.560]  Pierce Morgan for his attack on the Constitution also by Curt Nemo
[44:55.560 --> 45:01.200]  info wars.com has posted a petition on the White House website calling for
[45:01.200 --> 45:04.320]  British citizen an enemy of the Constitution boy that's putting it
[45:04.320 --> 45:09.440]  lightly and the Bill of Rights Pierce Morgan to be deported and this is a
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.040]  guy that came out and said I am a British supremacist I have invaded you I
[45:13.040 --> 45:17.440]  have dominated you I have taken you over in fact Kurt's so nice he didn't even
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.240]  add that in here I think we should add why we're doing this you know where he
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.760]  says I have invaded I have taken you over I will get your guns the British are
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.280]  superior this we are to retaking you over I mean again this is them to
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.280]  demoralize us to just condition us with the communist Chinese are saying hey
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.920]  we're gonna take your guns Russian TV is saying take our guns Dr. Paul Craig
[45:40.920 --> 45:43.640]  Roberts was blown away when this happened to him when he was on RT a few
[45:43.640 --> 45:49.320]  days ago now our globalist run media CNN it's not really our media MSNBC it's
[45:49.320 --> 45:53.240]  also foreign it's not really state-run media you can say that to a certain
[45:53.240 --> 45:57.800]  extent it's foreign government foreign bank directed it's foreign run media
[45:57.800 --> 46:03.760]  foreign corporatist run media but also our government is that so it's running
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.760]  the media so it is we have an occupied government that then runs a state-run
[46:07.760 --> 46:14.160]  media okay continuing here Morgan Democrats in Congress the Obama
[46:14.160 --> 46:20.120]  administration are trying to outlaw all semiotic automatic weapons firearms and
[46:20.120 --> 46:26.440]  mischaracterizing as military weapons are full automatic if Morgan and the
[46:26.440 --> 46:29.000]  Democrats in the Congress and the White House is successful
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.360]  government will outlaw and eventually confiscate all semi-automatic firearms
[46:32.360 --> 46:37.320]  oh they're not even stopping there but Obama said them in his second debate he
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.240]  said oh and handguns to see Melissa Milton's article on Morgan's treasonous
[46:41.240 --> 46:44.960]  behavior here and Kurt does link to it but people need to see the images of
[46:44.960 --> 46:48.440]  those tweets where he said I will get your guns I am dominating you there's
[46:48.440 --> 46:53.000]  nothing you'll do and again he doesn't do that from a point of arrogance you
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.900]  think he's arrogant it's meant to break your will just like TSA sticking their
[46:56.900 --> 47:00.880]  hands down your pants or dragging your kid off to a private perv room or pulling
[47:00.880 --> 47:04.280]  your wife and daughter over and ramming their hands into them with no due
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.120]  process no judge no jury no probable cause and the state police saying well
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.120]  that's reasonable we say it's reasonable reasonable says oath or
[47:11.120 --> 47:15.240]  affirmation with witnesses with a sworn out oath and the person's places and
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.960]  things to be searched that's what's reasonable not oh I'm gonna have your
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.300]  wife bend over here on the side of the road and I mean I mean the woman
[47:23.300 --> 47:28.080]  literally you know the pushes with force the whole woman moves as she rams her
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.320]  hand into her and then woman we had to go to the doctor it hurt her I mean no
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.320]  kidding this is just brutalizing us like animals total domination is the name
[47:37.320 --> 47:40.800]  of the game of course you just tuned in I'm talking about the state police now
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.240]  are saying it's they're gonna be there well they say it's policy to ram their
[47:44.240 --> 47:47.480]  hands into your body okay and we're not supposed to get upset about that because
[47:47.480 --> 47:50.560]  the country so free and the Communist Chinese the biggest owner of our debts
[47:50.560 --> 47:54.280]  and they're now saying to Obama you will get their guns you will have quotes
[47:54.280 --> 48:00.640]  here wage a war on your gun owners this is a country with forced abortions at
[48:00.640 --> 48:04.800]  the Apple factories and suicide nets where they've aborted 50 plus million
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.480]  baby girls so they don't have enough women for their men I mean this is just
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.320]  the most authoritarian country in the world telling us what to do our petition
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.600]  calls for the feds to Port Morgan because he is engaged in treason he is
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.280]  engaged in sedition he is in he's engaged in espionage and great job
[48:23.280 --> 48:27.880]  Kurt I think I think I'd like to add that he he's not even a US citizen so it
[48:27.880 --> 48:31.000]  can't really be treason though I agree it it could still be called treason because
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.120]  he's here but I mean it's espionage against the Republic it's espionage it
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.000]  is it is agitating in an attempted overthrow of our Bill of Rights and
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.200]  Constitution to deliver us an absolute despotism here is the petition text but
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.960]  treason's good because the public will understand what that means deport
[48:50.960 --> 48:54.600]  British citizen Pierce Morgan for attacking the Second Amendment and you
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.920]  can read the petition in a very short suite at info wars dot com link through
[48:57.920 --> 49:04.120]  to White House dot gov and again these petitions are there so the globalists
[49:04.120 --> 49:08.000]  can call for gun confiscations and things and claim that it has support for
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.560]  the people but that's not the real real context of what's going on here and
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.920]  what's happening here we just use the petition process to get media attention
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.040]  to show how legitimate these people are and make sure that they don't just use
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.880]  the petition system for themselves so again that is all up at info wars dot
[49:28.880 --> 49:33.960]  com and prison planet dot com right now sign petition to deport Pierce Morgan
[49:33.960 --> 49:38.920]  for his attack on the Constitution and I didn't tweet that this morning Paul
[49:38.920 --> 49:44.320]  Watson does stuff on my Twitter to real Alex Jones but if we haven't can we
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.480]  retweet that and ask people to go sign the petition let's get a few hundred
[49:47.480 --> 49:53.000]  thousand petitions in there to tell the red coat you surfer who's here
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.480]  declaring that we are his slaves he's declared he's here conquering us let's
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.200]  deport him to England where he potentially could be facing criminal
[50:01.200 --> 50:06.640]  charges for phone hacking and other yellow journalism illegal activities in
[50:06.640 --> 50:11.000]  England I know the globalists love you here the other bankers brought you here
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.520]  as a mercenary against our Republic and we obviously should be boycotting CNN I
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.880]  mean it is just an absolute anti-American organ of evil Fareed

[53:10.040 --> 53:13.880]  Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time
[53:13.880 --> 53:18.360]  when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now 27 years

[53:58.840 --> 54:13.080]  got
[54:28.840 --> 54:40.920]  All right, my friends, we are here back live on this 21st day of December 2012 and if you're
[54:40.920 --> 54:48.320]  watching on PrismPlanet.tv, you may notice that I have a globe here, a modern world map
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.600]  globe of our planet that was supposed to end today because it was 2012, another mainstream
[54:53.600 --> 54:55.800]  media hyped operation.
[54:55.800 --> 55:05.560]  Now, I have a article here at infowars.com that's also up at drudgereport.com on the
[55:05.560 --> 55:15.280]  left hand side next to an image of the President bowing to the Communist Chinese President.
[55:15.280 --> 55:18.440]  Communist Chinese government calls for Americans to be disarmed.
[55:18.440 --> 55:25.080]  Their official government outlet said that a war should be waged to get our guns.
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.000]  They used the term war that no matter what the political cost, we must be disarmed.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.760]  Now, you have to understand, Communist China was taken over by the colonial powers hundreds
[55:36.760 --> 55:37.760]  of years ago.
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.680]  Then the colonial powers defended China against the Japanese in their brutal attacks during
[55:42.680 --> 55:43.680]  World War II.
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.400]  And then in 49, the CIA actually put Mao Zedong into power.
[55:47.400 --> 55:48.400]  That's now been declassified.
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.040]  The John Birch Society, you know, was saying that back in the 50s and 60s and being laughed
[55:52.040 --> 55:55.280]  at from their sources, but it was all true.
[55:55.280 --> 55:57.240]  They have the sources.
[55:57.240 --> 56:03.800]  So China is teamed up with the globalist, not the United States, okay?
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.800]  The United States is just another vassal state of the corporates who establish a world government
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.720]  of laws through the UN and through the nations, but they are exempt from it.
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.440]  The corporations are like the Vatican and the city of London within London, the corporate
[56:20.440 --> 56:27.320]  structure, and Israel is its own exempt kind of city state where it says it's not according
[56:27.320 --> 56:28.520]  to anybody's laws.
[56:28.520 --> 56:34.920]  This is the globalist model where these megacorporations have these zones and areas like Switzerland
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.120]  again that's exempt and sovereign, but no one else can be sovereign.
[56:39.120 --> 56:46.000]  You understand China is not sovereign, the United States is not sovereign, Russia is
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.520]  not sovereign to a great extent.
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.280]  These globalist oligarch groups come in.
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.440]  Now China and their billion, 300 million people, they have been used to leverage out the jobs
[56:56.440 --> 57:01.640]  here in the US where no one can compete with forced abortions and suicide nets at the factories
[57:01.640 --> 57:07.080]  working for five cents an hour, not even our prisoners for 25 cents an hour, okay?
[57:07.080 --> 57:13.160]  And so that drives down the wages worldwide to reverse development and to reverse a better
[57:13.160 --> 57:14.160]  standard of living.
[57:14.160 --> 57:16.520]  They want to lower the standard, okay?
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.920]  And so now China we're told is the biggest owner of our debt that the Federal Reserve
[57:20.920 --> 57:24.200]  has manipulated us into.
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.680]  And so what's happening is we're going into globalism now with the UN Treaty with Russia,
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.160]  China, India, all these other countries calling for us to be disarmed in the treaty.
[57:34.160 --> 57:39.280]  And now that treaty's coming up, so now we're told by Piers Morgan from the country we got
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.000]  away from that ran its own global empire, but it wasn't the country, it was the city
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.440]  of London, in London that ran that empire, out of the first country they conquered, England,
[57:48.440 --> 57:53.440]  which they then conquered Scotland and Ireland with, then they conquered most of Europe financially
[57:53.440 --> 57:57.320]  and militarily and through economics the rest of the world.
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.040]  The United States was a colony of these people and broke away from it, but now we're going
[58:02.040 --> 58:03.160]  back under it.
[58:03.160 --> 58:09.720]  That's what globalism is and we've been maneuvered to be told China is our biggest owner and
[58:09.720 --> 58:11.000]  we owe all this money to them.
[58:11.000 --> 58:16.520]  So now the authoritarians and all the foreigners, including RT, is now calling for our guns
[58:16.520 --> 58:18.800]  to be taken on Russia today.
[58:18.800 --> 58:22.520]  And Dr. Paul Greg Roberts is outraged by that and speaking out against it.
[58:22.520 --> 58:23.520]  And so am I.
[58:23.520 --> 58:27.000]  So you've got Russian state-run media, Chinese state-run media, and some of this is going
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.240]  into the U.S. lobbying for our guns to be taken because they can't have a world government
[58:32.240 --> 58:36.200]  if the U.S. and Switzerland is allowed to have guns, but everybody else has to turn
[58:36.200 --> 58:37.200]  theirs in.
[58:37.200 --> 58:43.200]  That's what the global government is all about.
[58:43.200 --> 58:52.520]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:52.520 --> 58:58.760]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[58:58.760 --> 59:00.440]  Bend Soap Company.

[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.800]  So, it is being announced that the Chinese and Russians, who are just part of this global
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.840]  government, are demanding that the American people turn all their guns in.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.040]  They're of New York saying they're going to go for a forced gun buyback where you turn
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:41.040]  all your guns in and they disarm you and then pay you back.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.720]  And again, they sell this like we're here petting our guns and obsessed with it.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.120]  No, it's people that don't know about guns that get them and think it's some new powerful
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  thing they've got.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:57.840]  It's that historically, when systems disarm you, they can then accelerate your enslavement.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.840]  So government is arming to the teeth against us, all saying we should be disarmed.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.320]  There's only a few countries they haven't taken the guns from.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.440]  And yes, the United States has always been a violent culture.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.720]  And now, because of guns proliferating even more, crime rates have gone down.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.120]  We still have a high one globally, but not compared to some countries.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.640]  England's more than doubled after they completely banned guns.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640]  And it was a pretty peaceful country before that.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.480]  Somebody who could speak to that is David Ike.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.720]  I really wanted to get him on and I twisted his arm to come on because he's busy writing
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.640]  another book for 2012, December 21st.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.720]  This is the vaunted day.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.400]  We are in the middle of it.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.120]  And he had said over a decade ago that it wasn't going to be the end of the world event
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.120]  like they'd said.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.080]  He's gone and even met with the Mayans and others and none of their prophecies ever said
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]  this.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080]  So why have the globalists pushed this date?
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.200]  Well, they are saying it is the launch of their Luciferian error, which is a counterfeit
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.800]  to the true awakening that we do see happening.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.040]  So everything they do is a counterfeit and David believes the real awakening, which flash
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:04.080]  point or jump point is 2015, 2016 from what he's seeing.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.040]  And I wanted to talk about that today, but also the state of the world and what we're
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]  facing.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]  David Ike of davidike.com.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:17.760]  We just had over 6,000 people attend a big historic event in London that made international
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.760]  attention.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.760]  David, great to have you on.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.760]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.400]  There's so much to talk about, you've heard some of my questions, but going out to break
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.240]  here, after we get into my questions, what are some of the things that are front and
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.720]  center with you today?
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:37.600]  Well, I just think we're heading Alex to a point in the new year in 2013 when so many
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.600]  things are going to come together.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.920]  We have a president now in a second term, he has no other election to win.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:56.240]  We have this fiscal cliff as they're talking about and this obvious agenda to push on down
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.880]  the road of the Hunger Games.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:07.760]  If people saw that movie, there was a few people absolutely staggeringly rich in a high
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:16.120]  tech top of the range luxury capital and the rest of the people who were feeding that wealth
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.720]  were actually in abject poverty and beyond Orwellian levels of control.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.480]  Now, it was interesting to me because I follow symbolism a lot and so-called coincidence
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.520]  that Suzanne Collins, who wrote the Hunger Game book, should be living in that area of
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.800]  Sandy Hook, same with the connections from that into the Dark Knight Rising movie.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.680]  And by the way, it's not just that they renamed it in the new Dark Knight to Sandy Hook.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.200]  They mailed out to the media attack papers, for those that don't know, we'll talk about
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.400]  when we come back, attack papers, orders from Bain of Strike Points and in the last one,
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.560]  that area named Sandy Hook was named Hinckley, the shooter of Reagan.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.720]  Well, you see, if we get really deeper into this, really deep into this, Alex, it's all
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:13.080]  about the manipulation of the human subconscious mind, which then becomes the conscious mind's
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]  perception of reality.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.680]  I want to ask you that when we come back, because I don't want you to waste any of this
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.360]  now and they get cut off, David, but absolutely, they do put things in movies like Fox showed
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.760]  the World Trade Center's attacked by a jet hijacked by the government that used a drill
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.760]  to make NORAD stand down to blame the Afghans, the exact 9-11 scenario, six months before.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.960]  I want to ask you, David, from your deep research, why they do this.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.600]  David Ike, straight ahead, davidike.com, and we'll also talk about his new book that's
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.640]  out, but also the next one coming out.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.800]  And say what you want about David.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.840]  He is a trailblazer, and he means what he's saying, and he has really gotten a lot of
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.800]  people to get outside the Matrix.

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.520]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.520]  storm, the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.720]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.000]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.480]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:36.080]  It's better to spend an hour with us on the vaunted December 21, 2012 than David Ike.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.920]  And David Ike joins us from England.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:49.960]  He is a former champion goalie, a BBC TV and sports national host, head of the Green Party,
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.520]  and now known as one of the, quote, biggest conspiracy theorists, well, there's David
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.960]  Ike and myself, and that's who people will talk about, then there's, and then kind of,
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.640]  then it comes to radio, people like George Norrie, but, I mean, who are the mountains
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.560]  of, quote, conspiracy?
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.480]  There's only three or four people out there, and that's why it's important that those
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.360]  of us that are trying to get people to expand their horizons, to expand their awareness of
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.040]  what's going on in this universe, outside the globalist artificial box or matrix, that's
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:24.240]  why it's important that we work together and not be divided, and that's why it's so
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.400]  important that we support the work that David Ike is doing, because the fruits of his work
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:36.720]  are only good, and of course, Christ was quoted as saying, you judge a tree, buy its fruits,
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.840]  and David joins us now.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  David, first off, because obviously, 2012 is more than half of, we're in many timezones
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:49.720]  in the world, thankfully, within 12 hours or so, he'll be completely gone.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.080]  What was behind from your view this hype put out by non-aluminati people like Terrence
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:04.080]  McKenna and countless others in the 70s that this would be this new age or Luciferian time,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.720]  and then how was that picked up by the media and made to be a doomsday scenario?
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.200]  Your view on that, and then I want to shift gears into Obama, the guns, but also the subconscious
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:20.280]  programming going on with people in a trance, and your research on how we can unlock people
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]  from the trance.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.680]  Again, David Ike, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.640]  Okay, Alex, well, I picked this Mayan 2012 story up a long time ago.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:36.640]  I was doing a lot of traveling in America, and in the early days when I came to America
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:42.400]  in the 1990s, the early mid-1990s, the only people that would put me on, and that was
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.480]  in the smallest room at the end of the day, were like these whole life expos and stuff
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.000]  like that, and then new age type stuff.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.320]  And so I picked up the story there because there's two strands of this Mayan myth.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320]  One is that today is the end of the world.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.200]  Well, we keep having ends of the world, and ends of the world, they have many connotations
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.920]  in the subconscious.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.280]  One is about life being finite, one is about being little me and having no control over
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:17.160]  events, and just being a pawn in the game with no power over it, or will the end of
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.160]  the world come?
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.200]  Everything else has got control except little me.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.840]  And the other part of the other strand of the 2012 myth was that there was going to
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:34.840]  be some grand awakening on this day or around this day, which is closer to the way that
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.560]  I see things, but I just don't see a single day, and I don't see a single year.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.480]  I think it's a progression.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.480]  And since I started talking about this in 1990, 1991, quite demonstrably, there has
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.840]  been a global awakening.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.240]  It's not as big as we'd like it to be, because we'd like it to be greater.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:57.120]  But I was talking to someone last night, I mean, when I think of what I was dealing
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.640]  with in the early 1990s, mid-1990s, even late-1990s in terms of public interest, public derision,
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.320]  public dismissal, and then you look at what you've got now, it's dreamland.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:14.400]  I mean, we need to not get too caught in the frustration that it's not greater and lose
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:21.360]  the fact that how far we have come in this period in terms of awakening people to another
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:27.160]  view of self in the world and world events on a scale that is unprecedented.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.440]  So that's a good thing.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.240]  But this whole idea of an awakening on a day or in a short period of time, I think it's
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:41.920]  always been a myth, and one of the things that happens when you create something into
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.120]  the so-called future, which is when it's all going to happen, and it's kind of a new-age
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.200]  equivalent, Alex, of waiting for the cavalry to come, because it's always, whoa, someone's
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200]  going to come.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:02.360]  I keep seeing this stuff about nice secret societies and the Far East and military groups
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.840]  in America that leave it to them, they've got it sorted.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.680]  It's all holding position, don't do anything, you don't need to, because it's all going
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680]  to be sorted out.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.880]  Yeah, the White Knights, the Nisera group, I've been hearing that for 20 years, 17 years
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.660]  on air, and the globalists, Mirzynski and others, they are saying that there's a huge
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.880]  awakening and the globalists are in trouble, even in their internal documents.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.360]  And so they want people to basically believe that they're powerless.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:36.320]  But when we see this giant build up a police state control, that is the system desperately
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.000]  trying to get humanity back on the reservation.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.040]  Yes, I've been saying this for years, Alex, that the prime reason for this massive imposition,
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:55.560]  an escalation of the Orwellian state globally, it seems to be that they're trying to get
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560]  more and more power.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.040]  And of course, on one level, they are, but it's more, as I've seen it and I've experienced
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.120]  it over the years, it's more an effort to hold on to the power they've already got.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:15.560]  Because as the human mind awakens and expands its sense of the possible, which is what vastly
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.520]  awakening is, instead of, you know, living your life looking through the wrong end of
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.440]  a telescope and seeing everything as I can't, it's impossible, everything's limited.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.880]  You start to expand your awareness of possibility.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.000]  And when you do that, everything changes, not least on this level, Alex.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.640]  If you're looking through the wrong end of a telescope at something like Sandy Hook,
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.540]  you will have no alternative to the official story because you haven't got any alternative.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:55.200]  If you expand your mind and you expand your awareness to the technique of problem reaction
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.560]  solution, of creating a problem to offer a solution to it, i.e. what's happening now
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:07.240]  with the attack on gun ownership, then you do have an alternative to the lie and suddenly
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.960]  the lie is under challenge.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.400]  And let me just bring in one piece of evidence.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.200]  We have a government and governments caught staging all these other assassinations and
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.560]  killings and Operation Gladio, hundreds of mass shootings and bombings in Europe to take
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560]  liberties.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.440]  They've done this before, they passed the 68 gun control act on the backs of RFK, JFK
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.920]  and MLK, which it's all come out in court, were murdered by elements of the government.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.920]  The congressional hearings certified Kennedy was a conspiracy, but the mainstream media
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:41.000]  never reports that and 90 plus percent in polls know the government killed Kennedy now.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.960]  So we've really won in many respects, but the establishment is still in control of the
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.800]  major command centers and is posing and acting like that we are the joke when they are really
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800]  the joke.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.360]  How long can that final domino stand?
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.680]  Well, you know, it will stand as long as people stand for it.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:08.760]  You know, in the end it's about choice and people in very, very large numbers have made
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.800]  that choice in recent times to open their minds to greater possibilities.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.320]  What that process needs to do is continue because what we need to open our minds to
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.360]  is a far, far greater story than it appears to be even on the face of it.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.920]  And even when you've opened to problem reaction solution and manufactured gun attacks and
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:38.920]  manufactured terrorist events, because what we're dealing with Alex is a force hidden
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:46.280]  from human sight that understands how reality operates, how we interact with it and how
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]  we create it.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:54.160]  And it has set up a society through its control of science, not least through funding and
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.280]  peer pressure and all the other stuff that goes on and through the media and through
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:06.840]  what we bravely call education, which is keeping from people this understanding of reality
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.240]  that this force has.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.080]  Thus, if you know how reality works and know how you can manipulate people to perceive
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.840]  the reality you want and you keep that knowledge from the population, the target population,
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.360]  you're going to have the target population laughing ridicule and the dismissing people
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.080]  who stand up and say, this is how reality works and this is what the game is.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.840]  Let me just explain this in terms of, and this will bring in lots of things, Alex.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.720]  The Mayan stuff, it will bring in why they put stuff in Hollywood movies and television
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.880]  programs ahead of what they're seeking to create.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:52.840]  The reality that we're experiencing every day, people listening to this show now is
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.160]  so not like we appear to be experiencing it.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:03.800]  You stand and look into the night sky and you'll see all those lights, all those planets
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.160]  and stars and they talk about billions of light years and all this vast distance.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:19.280]  What you are seeing exists in that form only in a few cubic centimeters at the back of
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:30.080]  your brain where the brain decodes information in electrical form from or in to a illusory
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.640]  physical reality, which is actually holographic.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:43.760]  So if you want to bring down this whole conspiracy, Alex, to its real bottom line, it is about
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:50.680]  what controls those few centimeters at the back of your brain.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:59.160]  Because if they do, by programming your sense of reality, you will perceive and thus manifest
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:05.040]  in our individual and collective experience what they have programmed us to decode and
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.040]  manifest.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.040]  Exactly.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.440]  They've proven that humans are builders, designers, creators, so they simply program
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.520]  us to then manufacture what they want.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.920]  Yes, and this goes much deeper than that for reasons that I'm going to come to because
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:28.320]  this is a very, very interesting and vital area of information that we've got into here.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.800]  When you expand your mind and you go beyond mind into what I call consciousness, the greater
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:42.520]  sense of awareness, you're increasing every time you do that, your power to control those
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.240]  few centimeters of the brain that are creating visual reality.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.360]  And therefore the programming gets harder and harder and harder to impose itself.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360]  Exactly.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.840]  So your mind starts to truly open up and it is incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.120]  Stay with us.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.560]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.480]  storm, the most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.600]  drought in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.840]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.080]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from EatFoodsDirect and I recommend you do
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]  the same.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.600]  It's time to get your own supply from EatFoodsDirect.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.160]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.120]  forward slash alex.

[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.560]  big game.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.360]  But it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.200]  transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.

[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:06.520]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.400]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  IRAs?
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.440]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.120]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.640]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:13.480]  Freedom through self-reliance and personal responsibility.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.880]  All right, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.080]  I want to give the number out if you have a few short questions for David Ike.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:28.600]  I'm going to add a wild card element to things, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.520]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:36.480]  David's shifting years out of the brain and how the globalists are programming things
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.480]  and the globalists themselves believe they're getting spiritual influence to do this, regardless
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.720]  whether that's true or not, they believe it.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.120]  And so it's not kooky whenever for 20 years you've been pointing this out and more and
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.800]  more of it is being revealed.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.880]  But expanding on this, you've been saying, I've been saying clearly it's there.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:00.240]  They're moving with using al-Qaeda to attack countries while saying give our rights up
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.960]  or al-Qaeda will kill us.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:09.200]  Never before has their propaganda gotten thinner and more obvious even for people that are
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.400]  not even very conscious.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.760]  And is that being done on purpose?
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.040]  Why are they getting so sloppy?
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.680]  It's not just you and I and millions of others that are already awake that are seeing this.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.680]  It's more and more people.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.360]  I mean, I'm seeing the globalist move forward with their own inertia like a juggernaut,
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  but they're on fire.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.920]  They're burning down at the same time and moving ahead saying, we don't want your guns.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.080]  We're just going to confiscate them.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.160]  They're actually in the news saying that.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.520]  I mean, they're moving forward with forced inoculations.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520]  They're moving forward.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520]  What's happening?
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:49.200]  Well, you see, I've been saying for years there's kind of a race on, if you like, they've
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:56.400]  been aware that this awakening was coming and therefore they've been preparing for it.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.120]  And what we're seeing now is a race between them locking everything down to the point
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.320]  where there's no margin.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.760]  This is why they want microchips.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:13.280]  In the end, Alex, those few centimeters at the back of the brain are the key because
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.640]  the microchipping is about the external, and many other things too, but it's about the
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.000]  external manipulation of a sense of reality.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And sense of reality becomes created reality by the brain.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.600]  And so they're feeding us stuff in Hollywood movies, which is, I mean, people say, and
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.160]  it's a good question, you know, if you don't realize how this works, why are they telling
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.240]  us what they want and what's coming in Hollywood movies?
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.720]  Surely they don't want us to know, but they do.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.720]  They do because the more that they're feeding that information into the subconscious mind,
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:55.440]  the more that is becoming the future reality of the subconscious mind, which then becomes
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.640]  the manifest reality of the conscious mind.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.240]  This is what it's like putting information into a computer and then pressing enter and
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.680]  it comes upon the screen.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.320]  How is it going for them though, because the predictive programming of, you know, every
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:16.200]  children's cartoon, Star Trek's 35 years ago, being about a global international UN government,
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.960]  all of that preparation where the future's a dystopia where you have chips in your brain
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.640]  and you're not allowed to have children, and then that's what they then start building.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.280]  Clearly, that's what Brave New World's all about.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.800]  Huxley said that that was there to condition us, and he was one of the insiders, as you
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]  know.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.640]  What's going for them?
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:45.000]  Well I think that, you know, if people read my books in real depth, they'll see a lot
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:54.480]  of background to the fact that this force, which is manifest in our reality through these
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:02.200]  bloodlines and, you know, these interbreeding so-called elite bloodlines and families, they,
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.160]  we do not depend upon them.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.600]  They depend upon us.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.440]  It's the relationship between humans and this force and their representatives in human
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:17.200]  form of the parasite to what it's parasiting off, the parasite to the host.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.720]  Humanity is the host.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.440]  These are the parasites.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.960]  We can exist and prosper.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:28.360]  My goodness me, we can prosper even greater than we ever imagined currently without the
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.320]  parasite, but it can't exist without us.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:40.640]  And so that energy, which is the parasite's life force, if you like, is low vibrational
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:46.200]  human emotion, all the emotions around fear and hatred and conflict and frustration and
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:55.680]  worry and terror, and thus they have manipulated and constructed global society to create situations
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.680]  that constantly generate those energies.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:06.320]  So you can look at Sandy Hook, but we're missing the point if we look at it only on one level.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.720]  On one level, yes, it's about an excuse to take guns away because of the same reason
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.320]  that they stopped guns and ammunition being owned by Jewish people before they started
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  rounding them up in Germany.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320]  Yeah, that's one level.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.600]  On another level, it's going to be used to create copycats, more people shooting schools
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:28.480]  because that's the feedback loop, conditioning people to go shoot up schools.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.840]  This will undoubtedly cause more school shootings.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.880]  Yeah, that's another one.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.840]  Another one is to create what?
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.320]  Emotional trauma, collectively in the population, not just in America over Sandy Hook, although
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.240]  obviously much greater there.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.240]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.960]  We're talking about psychic vampires with David Icke.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.000]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.320]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:30:02.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network sick of the globalist, you Genesis control freaks

[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.480]  storm.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.800]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.680]  in agricultural history and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.960]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.280]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct and I recommend you do
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.280]  the same.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.880]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.520]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.920]  I'm taking control of my future and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.320]  economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:14.400]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.400]  to the global takeover.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:21.320]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.920]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:30.000]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.720]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.720]  in the field.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.800]  The magic relocation third edition by Joel Scousum.

[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.160]  yourself during any radiological event.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.240]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:53.360]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.160]  and your purchase makes our info war possible.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.360]  We're getting prepared.

[01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.360]  We've got it.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:08.040]  Thank you, Spain, for coming to you.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:17.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.040]  the info war.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:31.560]  David Angus, our guest, we're going to take some of your phone calls coming up here.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:39.320]  I wanted to get him on with this during the vaunted December 21st, 2012, but he wanted
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.080]  to finish up with his take on Sandy Hook.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:50.040]  I don't cover this a lot, but I have definitely seen it over the years that there were dozens
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:54.360]  and dozens and dozens, I was going to say hundreds, probably were hundreds, of different
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:00.480]  shows and FBI training manuals and other things where they talked about planes flying into
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.360]  the World Trade Center and then Bush came out and said no one had ever heard of such
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360]  a plan.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.000]  Then there were drills of the CIA flying the exact same aircraft into the World Trade Center
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.360]  and Pentagon that day.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.960]  That was in the back of the paper.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:14.000]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.360]  I've made films of the subject showing the news articles and clips.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.880]  We know there was a NORAD stand down.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:26.680]  Well, six months before, on Fox Entertainment Television, the spinoff of the X-Files, the
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.560]  lone gunman with Dean Haglin and others who's been in studio here many times, five, six
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:40.520]  times over the years after that event, the government hijacks a jet by remote control
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.640]  claiming Arab terrorists are on it to fly it in the World Trade Center.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.860]  They use an anti-terrorism drill as the cover for the attack inside government in case other
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.360]  parts of the government find out.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.680]  That's how real terror attacks are bootlegged.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.280]  To attack the World Trade Center to then blame it on Afghanistan and invade.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.160]  And there were countless other things.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.880]  The brother of the Oklahoma governor at the time wrote a book that came out close to a
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:12.480]  year before Oklahoma City where a Tom McVeigh bombs the federal building.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.200]  And then it starts a huge roundup of right wingers.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.840]  This is the kind of stuff that just happens over and over again.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:27.040]  And I know throughout history, the establishment likes to leave calling cards so they can brag
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  to each other.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]  That's kind of the surface.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.280]  But Anton LeVeigh, I studied the globalist.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.160]  I studied some of what Aleister Crowley wrote, but I went back to stuff for a thousand years
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.480]  old, 500 years old, Jewish mysticism, Babylonian mysticism, and looked, and it's all the same
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]  thing.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.280]  And they believe, they call it lesser magic, that's what David Ike's talking about.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.520]  If you do, it's what voodoo is, a model of somebody, then you stab it and then it makes
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.480]  them actually get hurt.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.240]  And whether it's real or not, I don't believe in stuff like that, that it's actually the
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.880]  doll doing it.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.440]  Something spiritual is happening or something in a plane.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.040]  You don't understand to put it, say, in layman's terms.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.320]  They know six senses there.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.520]  It's been scientifically proven.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.040]  They know birds and things no days before a hurricane even forms or an earthquake.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.320]  They have these cells in their brains that pick up magnetic information.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.680]  They've proven humans have these.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.160]  They know birds follow these magnetic lines.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.080]  Well, then you find out all these cultures built temples on these lines.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.440]  So the ancients know what we've now been hidden.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:34.620]  And if Anton Levese talks about it, it doesn't matter even if you don't believe in magic.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.120]  This stuff still works.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:40.680]  Well, whatever the case is, whether it does or doesn't, they believe in it.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.360]  So this is why, and I said Dark Knight Rises us that it's going to cause mass shootings
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.360]  and stuff.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:50.880]  I said that on air, on record, because I could see the programming just watching it.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.640]  And then how they leaked the thing where Bane says the fire goes up and all that.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.240]  I said, this is calling for a revolution of violence to disarm us.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:05.000]  Now Bane and Don Salazar wrote an article about this.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.800]  The company that put it out and we're going to David says he brings up, I want to back
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.480]  him up here, sent out to key media and people a scroll that looks hand drawn on the outside
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.760]  with orders from Bane to strike certain areas.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.160]  And the strike point is Sandy Hook in fictional Gotham.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:26.600]  Now the same map was in the last one as a strike point, but the same area that was Sandy Hook
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.800]  was called Hinckley.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.200]  And we're all freaked out because now we're finding there's names of lone assassins and
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.600]  things all over this.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.640]  Now that could be a coincidence, but when it's then the actual new assassin that happens,
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.120]  something really is going on here.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.120]  Now, coincidence, yeah, one in a billion, one in a trillion.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.960]  It's like they ran a drill of the exact same bus and exact same trains being bombed on
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.120]  the exact same time.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.120]  Look this up.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.120]  It's on BBC News on 777.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]  Now, David, I'm going to shut up.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120]  You've got the floor on the subject.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.480]  I don't want to get to some calls and some other issues.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:05.840]  Well, a voodoo is very straightforward and all this stuff is very straightforward.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:15.520]  When you create a hologram in a studio, the information that creates the apparently three-dimensional
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.560]  form is in a waveform.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.480]  And when you look at it, it looks like a fingerprint.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.960]  It's just wavy lines, but you fire a laser at the wavy lines and suddenly, and apparently,
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:31.320]  the best of them anyway, and apparently solid three-dimensional form appears miraculously
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320]  in front of you.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.680]  And we've seen holographics is being used more and more in stage shows and conferences
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.280]  and all this stuff and on television.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:49.400]  And so if you can get to the waveform level of everything, let's keep it simple and say,
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.160]  keep it simple, the electromagnetic field of everything, then you get through to the
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.840]  holographic projection.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.080]  Therefore, voodoo is focusing the mind.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.840]  The doll doesn't do anything.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:11.080]  The doll is simply a focus of attention that represents the target.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.840]  And by focusing attention on the doll, and what you do when you're focusing attention
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:24.640]  on the electrical magnetic field of the doll, you can connect that frequency-wise, vibrational-wise
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:27.080]  to your target.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.880]  They become, in effect, one field.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  So what you do to the doll then gets transferred to the target through the electromagnetic
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.880]  field.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  This is how it's done.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:45.820]  And this is the level of awareness of reality that those behind those behind those that
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:49.960]  we see as obvious orchestrators of this stuff.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.720]  They're still artisans and oil rags, if you can actually see them.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.360]  That's what they are doing.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:04.360]  And so the more that they can affect that field in terms of your emotional state, your
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:10.600]  perception state, see, with Sandy Hook, very, very quickly, one of the other expressions
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:17.920]  of this is that virtually every parent after that happened, when they leave their children
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.080]  at school the next day, on the next day, on the next day, they're thinking, well, I see
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.080]  them again.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:31.200]  Now, of course, on a statistical chance alone, I mean, it's so minute, it's unbelievable.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:38.480]  But it's so big in their psyche and in their emotional traumatic reaction that it becomes
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.680]  a question of, will I see them again?
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.120]  And that is anxiety, which is constantly being generated into the field, a war, a pepper
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:57.280]  bombing a city is a massive injection of this emotional fear, anxiety, terror that these
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.560]  people feed off.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:05.600]  And answering a question earlier, Alex, you know, how is it going for them?
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:16.280]  I mean, that to eat, to have sustenance to survive, you had to have a target population
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:25.200]  or a target person acting in certain ways, because if they don't, food sources finished.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.880]  Well, that's a certain kind of panic.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.200]  And when you start to see people in greater and greater numbers starting to awaken and
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.600]  act in ways that are denying that food source and are starting to see how it works, then
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.840]  that anxiety is increased and increased and increased.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:49.960]  And what I'm seeing with this massive push from all directions, plus the fact that it's
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  being done with almost so little cover now, that to me is absolute blind buddy panic.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.000]  And therefore we need to keep the pressure on when they come to us and start trying to
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.080]  demonize us for standing up for things that they don't want.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.000]  We just have to stand firm because in the end, and this is what is being shown to be
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:22.080]  done, if we don't stand down and we keep putting this information out, the information is so
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.840]  powerful in its effect in the end.
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  Why?
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.840]  Because it's true.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.360]  Well, I've seen this, I agree, I've seen this a million times when you're dealing with bad
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:34.880]  police, not all police, they're trying to twist them though, a lot of police are resisting
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880]  it.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.560]  When you're scared of government people, they feed and get more wound up and more crazy.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.920]  When you laugh at them genuinely from a place of no fear or talk to them like their children,
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.320]  they absolutely run.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:56.440]  They don't know what to do because they are in a mode, even those that are totally unaware,
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:02.280]  they're just a certain personality type which the authorities love to recruit.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.960]  They are a computer program, Alex, they're software and a computer program reacts to
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960]  programming.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:16.360]  Its programming is, I have a uniform on, people are intimidated by me, I must be respected
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.680]  and obeyed because of what I am.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.920]  When you laugh in their face, because they're little boys in short trousers really, you
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.040]  see these TSA people.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.440]  Make a uniform off mate, where's your power?
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.040]  Your power is in your uniform, it's not in you, go and get another job, where's your
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.040]  power?
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.520]  Gone, it's in the uniform which is just an extension of the state, it's like a uniform
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.280]  is another electromagnetic field they put on themselves and suddenly, oh they're powerful
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.120]  now, take it off, it's gone.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.400]  No it is, it's all symbolism, it's all cloaks, they've done all the psychological studies
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.520]  where you put someone in a different outfit and they behave like the outfit.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:59.720]  Yeah, it's like when you laugh at them or you're not intimidated by them or you give
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:06.240]  them the law that you know better than they do, they can't hack it, they just can't, they
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.800]  don't know what to do and one of the ways that they do respond, because little boys
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.640]  in short trousers with brains the size of a pea, have really in many ways only one way
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.080]  to react if they react at all and that's they pull the bloody taser out.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:27.520]  Because their perceived omnipotence and power is being challenged, this is why when you
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.400]  see extreme versions of these people, they'll stop, they'll pull someone over, a driver
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.760]  and all the driver will say is well quote me the law that says you can do this and out
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.680]  comes the taser and the guys on the floor, it's because they're computer programs and
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:50.960]  they have nowhere to go in terms of treating a situation on its merits in the moment based
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.840]  on the information before them, that takes mind consciousness and a computer program
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]  cannot act that.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.560]  All right, I want to go to some calls here David, but what do you see in 2013 with everything
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.320]  accelerating, what are you on the lookout for, what are you predicting?
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:16.200]  Well you know we are in this race as I symbolically call it between two things, is the awakening
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.760]  going to reach the point where the house of cards comes down before the house of cards
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.600]  is so cemented together that it's very very difficult to bring it down.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:30.800]  This is why they are panicking in trying to push this on as fast as possible, because
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:38.960]  you know what we're seeing now is not something that is moving along at a consistent rate,
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.160]  a consistent speed if you like, I mean you've just indicated the speed that this Orwellian
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.520]  stuff is coming in in all its forms, but the awakening of people is speeding up as well
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:55.960]  and every time it speeds up, it's speeding up from a higher level of starting point because
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.000]  that the greater numbers of people are already there.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:07.960]  Now let me use this as an analogy because I think it's really apt, if you have a dam
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:16.240]  and it's holding back a body of water, that water can take a very very long time to undermine
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:23.160]  the dam to the point where cracks start to appear and you actually see it's being undermined,
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.960]  but the time difference between the cracks appearing and the dam collapsing is very very
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  much shorter and narrower than they took to start the cracks in the first place and what
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:44.240]  we are at now I would suggest in undermining this, exposing it and bringing it to an end,
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.080]  is we're at the end of the beginning.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:54.320]  We have had this long period where from a starting point of zilch, in my case about
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:02.800]  25 nil down in football terms, we have reached this point where there is incredible numbers
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.800]  of people or awakening on different levels to this compared with when it started out.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.920]  We've come from behind or now even.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.680]  Yeah, now we are at the point symbolically in this analogy I'm using Alex where we can
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:22.680]  see the cracks in the dam, now we need to push on and not think, not think that it's
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:29.440]  going to take the same period again that we've been through to have the same effect.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.600]  No, the effect is going to get quicker and quicker and quicker in shorter amounts of
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]  time.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.600]  And everyone can feel it and see it.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.560]  Here's the problem, the Empire is going to strike back, so how do we attack even stronger
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:49.480]  with the truth to overshoot their next attack so that we jump to the point that's not within
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.000]  their next target grid?
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.240]  How do we out-jump them?
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:48:00.040]  Well we become conscious, we move our point of, I mean this may sound trite, I couldn't
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.720]  care less because it's actually true.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:11.600]  If we get caught in hating these people, if we get caught in physically violently fighting
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.800]  them, then we are playing in their stadium.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:24.280]  You see, if you want to feed off human emotional energy of violence and fear and terror and
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:31.120]  what have you, then when what you've done to generate that, let me give you an example
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.280]  of what they've done in Greece to generate that incredible emotional trauma that the Greek
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:45.840]  people are going through, then it's even better if they react with violence to your endeavours,
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:51.440]  what you've done to them, because now you've got twice the energy being generated.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.280]  They don't mind if we fight them as long as it's not in two greater numbers, they don't
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280]  mind that.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:04.000]  It's lunch, but what we need to do is not fight them, not get pulled into their stadium.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  Oh no, I agree.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.080]  They want to start a civil war in the United States between these, quote, security services
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.680]  and the population, and instead we need to go out with the information and wake up the
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.400]  programs and turn them back into humans.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.280]  We need to be reaching out aggressively to wake up their minions because they're victims
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.440]  of the Matrix as well.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:33.880]  The thing is, we need not to play in the stadium of violence and stuff that we're talking about
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.600]  because that's their stadium, that's what they want.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:46.880]  We need to play this awakening transformation out in the stadium in which it's actually
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:51.720]  coming from, which is human perception of reality.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.440]  This is why it's so important when we put this information out about what the plan is
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.120]  and what the agenda is that they want to introduce, that we do never give the impression
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.240]  that it's a done deal and it's going to happen.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:08.280]  It's just information to alert people to what's wanted so we can stop what's wanted happening
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.160]  and we have the power to do that.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:16.200]  No, I agree, but we have to wake them up to the three senses level of manipulation first
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:22.240]  so they know it's a lie so we can then show them the next phase of what is the truth.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:27.480]  That's why throughout my time of doing this, in my books and talks and whenever I've talked
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:34.480]  about it, I've also always done the both because I think one without the other is an imbalance.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:42.760]  This is why people don't talk to me about the conspiracy, it's negative, no, understanding
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:49.120]  knowledge is never negative, ignorance is negative and that's not about ignoring or
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.320]  not wanting to hear negative stuff, that's about escapism from what's really going on.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.160]  All right, we've only got two short segments left with David, we're going to take your
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.120]  phone call straight ahead with David Ike.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:04.640]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book Cancer Step Outside the
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.640]  Box.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.600]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:13.400]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:17.720]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:23.280]  Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.360]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.480]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.640]  normal cell.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.320]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.400]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:52:03.200]  So it's off to grandma's house for the holidays, eh?
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.760]  That's great.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.000]  But while you're going over the river and through the woods, professional burglars are
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.880]  choosing easy targets to break into.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.800]  Don't be an easy target.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:15.800]  Plug in FAKE TV.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.840]  Full criminals into believing someone's home at your house watching TV.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:25.200]  FAKE TV works a bit like a light on a timer, but FAKE TV is far more convincing.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.680]  FAKE TV plugs into any outlet and simulates the light and colors of a real TV.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:34.800]  Burglars will likely move on to easier targets and leave your house alone.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:40.040]  FAKE TV costs less than a month of most alarm-monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:43.360]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays or anytime.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:49.840]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKE TV dot com.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:55.720]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKE TV dot com.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:59.880]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880]  Hi there.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:06.160]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:12.440]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.040]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:22.280]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.480]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:28.960]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.200]  goes.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:35.840]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.280]  and how you can beat them too.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:42.120]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.720]  the last three months.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:49.120]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.120]  your home.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:55.960]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.320]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:06.360]  Well, it's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:11.200]  Alex Jones here, back live, joining us from England.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:17.720]  David Ike joins us and here we are on this globe spinning through space.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.920]  It's supposedly the end of the world right now, but it's not.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.200]  Again, they always want you to think it's the end of the world.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.600]  They mean the end of the world for you, the end of the world for you controlling your
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.760]  own destiny or believing you can affect the world around you.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.320]  The social engineers want you to sit down and just implode.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:37.240]  I want to take some of these calls that are holding for David Ike, but David, he said
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.960]  you have a quote for us.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.960]  Yeah, just one thing I wanted to say, Alex, when I was just before the break, I was talking
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:48.040]  about, you know, the spiritual, so-called spiritual staff, who don't talk about the
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:49.040]  negative conspiracy.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.560]  That's an imbalance, but if we talk about only the five cents level of the conspiracy
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:57.840]  and not the deeper levels of the nature of reality from which that five cents level can
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.880]  be understood from a much greater understanding, that's an imbalance as well.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.280]  This is a quote by George Carlin, the great George Carlin, who said this, did you ever
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.040]  stop to think about all the people we kill?
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.880]  They're always the people who tell us to live together in harmony and try to love one another.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:19.480]  Gandhi, Lincoln, Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Meg Evans, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, John
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:24.200]  Lennon, they all said try to live together peacefully, bam, right in the head.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.400]  Apparently we're not ready for that.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:27.360]  Well, we are ready for that, George.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.320]  It's that that which is manipulating society doesn't want us to be ready for that, because
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:38.320]  that means that the life force on which they feed is removed.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.120]  And that's why massively the heart of this revolution is to start and love each other
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.120]  and care for each other.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:51.720]  Not, you know, oh, I love you and you know, that stuff and that kind of version of love,
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:57.520]  but I love true love, which is, you know, more, more, more the love that you see in
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:05.080]  friendship, unconditional love and it and loving its true sense stands and will not move and
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:11.120]  will not budge because loving its true sense will always do what it knows to be right with
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:18.840]  consequences not even considered because the anything that could be considered not doing
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:23.280]  what you know to be right is simply not in the psyche of love and its true sense.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.240]  This is the power that will bring this down.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.120]  Well, David, then there's the counterfeit of Obama running drama tracks everywhere and
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.520]  then he says the answer is love.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.440]  There's also always the counterfeit as well, where they say, be loving, turn your guns
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:36.560]  into us.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.560]  We come in peace.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.120]  Oh, Alex, I mean, I don't know how long we've got here, but I mean, I could talk to talk
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.840]  to about this.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.120]  You've talked twice here about counterfeiting and you've talked about deceit, right?
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:55.320]  Well, you know, there is an area of research that I've been pulling together for some time
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:58.440]  and that is common themes.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:05.760]  I always find it very compelling when I see very different peoples and very different sources
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.440]  coming to the same conclusions and talking about the same things.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:20.680]  And there is a force which is described in precisely the same way by ancient Gnostics,
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:28.200]  they call them the Archons, by the pre-Islamic Arabians and Islam picked it up, the Jinn.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.880]  They call them in Central America the Flyers.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.760]  The Christians call them the demons and so on and so forth.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:40.800]  And when you look at what he said about these, let's look at what the Gnostic writings from
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:48.280]  2000 years ago say about these Archons, that they are energetic beings, but with a mentality
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.480]  that's robot-like and what we would call computer-like.
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:57.640]  They do not have the ability for what the Gnostics called intentionality, what I would
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:00.720]  translate as creative imagination.
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:06.240]  It's like, try to get a computer to create something, you can't.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:12.480]  You have to put in the information to create through it, it can't do it, scratch.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:21.920]  And so we humans have creative imagination, thus to create the world that they want, which
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:32.640]  is this Orwellian nightmare, and then some, they have to get us to use our creative imagination
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.720]  to create it, and that's why they're programming constantly.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:41.400]  Stay there, this is important, call's coming up.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:45.000]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:55.120]  Humans and people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.480]  Don't be one of them.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.120]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.120]  solution.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:06.360]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:11.120]  daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.120]  healing.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:16.160]  Supernatural silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:21.440]  the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:22.840]  harmful pathogens.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:27.720]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:31.840]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:35.520]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:39.360]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.760]  Okay, we'll cover all the latest 2012 news, get into the unprecedented, I can't believe
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:30.560]  I'm here calmly talking about mainstream news, governor saying we're just going to
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.000]  make you turn all your guns in and we'll give you money for them.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.640]  That's Cuomo in New York, I mean these people are really making their move.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:41.960]  And again, they don't need to really convince everybody to turn their guns in.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:48.560]  They need to convince us that other people were convinced so it's somehow okay in a democracy
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:49.560]  instead of a republic.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.600]  Now, Dave is going to stay with us 20 more minutes so we can take your calls and I appreciate
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:54.600]  that.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.600]  He wants to finish the point.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:01.600]  He was just getting at, when I mentioned the term counterfeit, continue.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:10.240]  Yeah, so I'll use the instance of this force that there's these Gnostic writings from 2000
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.240]  years ago called the Archons, but in saying that, this is what is said by these others
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.240]  too.
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:19.880]  So we have a real common theme here, across different religions and different cultures
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.920]  and different times.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.800]  And let's look at what they say about the Archons.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:32.160]  First of all, they can be described, the Gnostic said in one word, deceivers.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.800]  Their method of manipulation is deception.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:42.000]  They are mind parasites and they parasite off human energy and they parasite off the
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.600]  human mind and manipulate the human mind.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.280]  This is the Christian perception of possession, which is true.
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:51.760]  These things exist.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:59.200]  These energetic fields, energetic entities, they lock into people at the electromagnetic
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:04.680]  field level and then start dictating through that the perceptions and the behavior of the
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:06.280]  possessed person.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:14.400]  They talk about the Gnostics that the Archons are able to create something that they call
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:20.240]  HAL, H-A-L, which translates, as wait for it, virtual realities.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.520]  They have the ability to make people see things that aren't actually there.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.800]  How do they do that?
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:32.600]  By manipulating the way that people construct reality in the few cubic centimeters at the
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:33.760]  back of the brain.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:34.960]  That's how.
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:39.240]  And this is the other thing that has been mentioned already today.
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:44.640]  And another thing on the real top list of what the Archons do and how they do it is they
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.240]  invert everything.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.160]  They turn everything on its head.
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.240]  So when Obama talks about love, he's talking about hate.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:58.160]  You've got to turn everything they say upside down to see what they're saying.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.400]  This is why Satanists who, in their rituals, are worshiping and interacting with these
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.680]  archontic entities, invert everything.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.040]  They invert the cross.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.640]  They invert the pentagons.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.760]  They're turning women into men and men into non-entities.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.080]  Everything is turned upside down.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.200]  That's why this is the force.
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:26.840]  And these hybrid bloodlines, which is why these families and elite families and bloodlines
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:35.160]  are so obsessed with bloodline, have a hybrid genetics, a hybrid energetic field, which
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:39.160]  is much closer to the energetic field of these archontic entities.
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.080]  And by the way, whether that was true or not, all over their writings, as you know, David,
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.680]  even BBC articles, the elite believe they are a separate species.
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.680]  They say this.
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:53.880]  They're a separate species because they have been specifically created on the body level
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:04:02.120]  to be energetically, vibrationally, frequency-wise, closely connected to these archontic entities
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:07.360]  that operate outside of human sight so that the possession of these bloodlines is able
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.240]  to be far more powerful and total than it is of the general population, although it
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.920]  happens with the general population as well as we know.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.760]  So when you're looking at the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the British royal
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:26.240]  family and all these people, you are looking at these archontic entities incarnated in
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  human...
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.960]  It'd be like if I had a remote-control robot or when they send the Mars rover to Mars,
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.840]  it's being run from Houston.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.160]  No empathy.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:43.960]  They have no conscience and that they are running this whole society to bring about
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.760]  an end of total human control.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:52.240]  And those vast majority of people, because compared with 7 billion, these people, these
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:58.080]  bloodlines are so few, vast majority of people who are bringing it in for...
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.080]  Stay there.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.080]  Stay there.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.080]  We've got to break.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:02.080]  David Ike.

[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:26.720]  We'll get into the unbelievable news breaking today at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.200]  Drudge Report is carrying two of the articles.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.320]  In fact, I want to raise this now for David.
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:35.720]  David, what do you make of the Communist Chinese official government with quotes like,
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:39.720]  It is time to have a war against your gun owners.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:42.040]  It is time to take all the guns.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.480]  The Russian media is saying do that.
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:50.160]  This new UN treaty, I mean global government is out in the open and then they have these
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:55.280]  weirdo fake liberal, they were just really monstrous eugenicists talk show host come
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.360]  out and say there's no world government.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.920]  I mean we've now reached a point where the government admits in the New York Times they
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:09.200]  run al-Qaeda to make father suicide bomb and they'll kill their family and they say, isn't
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:10.200]  that good?
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:14.000]  Isn't it good the CIA is torturing people including children?
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.440]  And then separately, we've got to search you though because al-Qaeda might be hiding in
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.200]  your pants at the airport and then they're like, oh yeah, the Communist Chinese own our
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.560]  debt and they say we've got to turn our guns in.
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:32.520]  I mean it really is getting over the top now and what is that where they announce world
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.480]  government and hundreds of newspapers but then if you talk about it, the southern property
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.840]  law center and ADL say you must be a terrorist.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:46.680]  I mean what is this propaganda, this is propaganda I would design David to wake people up against
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:49.080]  me but instead it actually works on people.
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:52.720]  Yeah, there's a few things in there.
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:10:01.640]  First of all, there's one thing telling people almost in a subconscious way that yes we want
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:06.000]  world government because most people don't actually focus on the facts, they get an image
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.500]  of something.
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:12.440]  There's another thing on alerting the conscious mind to it and you see when it's in newspapers
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.560]  and it's there and the mass of staff and their world government, oh yeah, what else is going
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:24.800]  on today but when you focus it as people like we do and many others like us around the world,
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:29.800]  when you focus it and say, hey, look, is the facts, they want world government, that's
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.600]  different because that's talking directly to the conscious mind, it's alerting the conscious
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:40.200]  mind to it and then people can start to see it and put the stuff together but if it stays
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:44.320]  in the subconscious mind as some kind of just part of the maze of information that people
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:46.680]  receive all the time, then it could just pass them by because-
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:52.400]  David, I gotta say this, you really are amazing because there's really no one else I talked
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:56.720]  to that really gets it, that was my answer and that's exactly what I know they're doing.
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:01.520]  They have a background noise of world government, yeah, we're gonna sterilize you, yeah, cancer
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.400]  viruses in the vaccine, yeah, they gave 60 something thousand kids polio in India, Bill
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.320]  Gates Foundation, but it's just kind of buried like it's no big deal, they put this incredible
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.920]  stuff in there like it's not a problem, yeah, the CIA tortures kids and for other parents
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.520]  it's to fight the terrorist, exactly, it's meant to subconsciously just be peppered
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:25.080]  in there but when we connect the dots and say this is really bad, they go, oh, you crazy
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:30.920]  man, there's no world government, I mean, what you just said, the way you crystallized
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.800]  it, that is exactly it, they are targeting the unconscious mass.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:42.480]  Yeah, and the thing is that when you are in a situation, the word you've just mentioned
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.520]  and there may be some background noise, if you're concentrating on what you're doing,
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:51.160]  you might not hear it and then suddenly someone will say to you, hey, can you hear that background
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:56.480]  noise and you stop and you listen, oh yeah, now from that moment on you can't really concentrate
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.760]  because all you can hear is background noise because the conscious mind has been alerted
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.320]  to it and thus now it's hearing you, what he couldn't hear before and this is what this
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:10.840]  information is doing and in terms of Russia and China, this is again very straightforward,
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:16.200]  I've just been talking about this archontic force which possesses people, this is the
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.480]  force that is, you know, the tristans called demons and all the rest of it, that is behind
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:27.960]  all this and it doesn't just possess people in America, in the White House, it does it
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.840]  in the Kremlin, it does it in Downing Street, it does it in Westminster, it does it in the
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:33.840]  Chinese government.
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.200]  And again, even if you don't believe in God, the devil's spiritualism, the point is if
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:42.320]  you look how the bankers are set up, they're playing all the countries off against each
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.960]  other while exempting themselves from their very rules and that's why it's the globalist
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:54.200]  running China, Russia and the U.S. and Iran and Israel running us all into each other
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:59.280]  because the goal is hurt humanity, dumb people down, don't let children ever develop into
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.960]  their intelligence, hold humanity back.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:09.400]  So even if it isn't physically real, it doesn't matter, whatever this dark force is, is manifesting
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.200]  to destroy and hold back humanity.
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:16.080]  All these people are running all these major countries of the world, most of the countries
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.720]  of the world, maybe even all of them, but certainly the vast majority, maybe one or
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:27.760]  two exceptions, but these people, China, Russia, played off against America and Europe and
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:33.080]  NATO and the Cold War and what's going on now, they're all on the same team.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.680]  This is what the penny needs to drop and interestingly you just mentioned something else, the banking
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680]  system.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:45.600]  Well, one of the things that is a common theme of these archon, gin, et cetera, et cetera,
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:52.840]  is that they are parasites, they parasite off the energy and efforts and creative imagination.
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:54.800]  The devil is never a maker.
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:55.960]  No, no.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:57.720]  So what have I just described?
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:00.880]  I've just described the banking system.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:09.400]  The banking system creates nothing, it feeds off the creative imagination and energy of
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.400]  the population.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.720]  Well, here's an example, just like you said, it's like YouTube, it doesn't create anything
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:15.880]  itself.
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:21.120]  You go make it, you go put your content on it and then it acts like you've got a favor
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.760]  to even be there when it's totally parasitic.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  Yes.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:30.000]  And look at Facebook, it's demanding joint copyright of anything you post.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.880]  That is the parasiting of human creative energy, archontic.
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.000]  This is the key to understanding it all.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  Wait, I'll go further.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.720]  They're now saying they actually own it, some of them, and you don't have rights to it.
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.720]  It's classic.
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.040]  I mean, that's just another version of the banking system.
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.040]  It's unbelievable, David.
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:54.640]  And again, I remember first reading one of your books like 18 years ago, I think it was
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.720]  your first book and my cousin, Buckley Hammond, said, you got to read this.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:14:59.960]  This guy knows what's going on.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:01.840]  My cousin is just really, really intelligent.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:05.720]  And I read it and I said, well, some of this is true, but this guy's a lunatic.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.400]  And I said a few things like that 17 years ago on the air and I've apologized.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.680]  It doesn't mean I totally, none of us are out about everything, but I know that you're
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:13.440]  really on to something.
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:18.120]  And because I'm hearing about all this occultism and all this stuff, I mean, when I snuck
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:21.200]  into Bohemian Grove 12 years ago, I was still so naive.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.920]  I thought when Channel 4 paid me to sneak in because they were too scared to do it because
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.320]  I'd snuck into some military bases, so they thought, well, you'll sneak into this.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:31.760]  And I thought it was all made up.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.920]  I didn't think elites were really devil worshipping really 12 years ago, David.
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:38.240]  I didn't even know that.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.400]  So, you know, and then I've done research since then and found out whether it's real
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.680]  or not every one of these stinking high level elites believes they are communicating at
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.040]  sculling bones and everywhere else with fallen angels.
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:54.240]  That's another name that's given to them.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:55.240]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:56.960]  It's another of their many aliases.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:59.520]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:03.560]  Folks on record, the elite, they really do believe in this.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.640]  Whether it's real or not, you could say from a psychological perspective, they are manifesting
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.120]  this idea in their mind and then they're building it in the real world, but it doesn't matter
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:13.120]  either way.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:14.120]  It's happening.
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:15.120]  Go ahead.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.120]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.120]  Yeah, it is real.
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:18.120]  It is true.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:24.840]  And what they're doing, you see, in, well, we talk about the extreme rituals of Satanism,
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:29.240]  where they directly interact with these entities and they create energetic fields that allow
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.520]  these entities to slip through into our reality.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:34.280]  I've talked to endless people around the world who've seen it.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.760]  But in the secret society rituals, let's take the Freemasons.
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.000]  These rituals are not there just for a laugh.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.800]  They're there because they create a certain energetic field that allows possession to take
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:50.920]  place more powerfully.
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.760]  Now vast majority of people that enter the Freemasons and enter the secret society network
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:00.440]  at the lower levels have no clue, and they're not consciously part of this.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:01.440]  They're not.
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:05.880]  They might use it for a bit of stuff in good business and stitching up something in the
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.720]  town or whatever, but they don't know the big picture.
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:13.320]  And they go through the rituals, they'll do this and do that, oh, no, it's just ancient
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.320]  rituals.
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.440]  We're just keeping the tradition going and all that stuff.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:17.440]  No.
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.920]  The reason they're doing the same rituals now that they were doing thousands of years
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:25.080]  ago is because the rituals work in doing what the outcome is designed to be, which is to
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.240]  increase the possession of people.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.560]  And the more people become possessed, especially if they're in politics and stuff like that,
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:37.880]  the more the iconic entities are dictating and dominating their behavior and decisions.
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.720]  And this is why you get people who may genuinely come into politics.
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:43.920]  You see it all over the world.
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.160]  I've seen it in England who generally want to make a difference and they come into it
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:54.160]  and then you see them transform into everything and more that they came in.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:58.600]  They said they wanted to come into challenge because the energies got them.
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.000]  And this is what's happening.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.640]  This is why these people work as one unit.
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:09.880]  Pedophilia is about using the pedophile to draw off the life force of the prepubescent
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.800]  child because these iconic entities want that energy more than anything else.
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:20.520]  This is why you find pedophilia absolutely rife along with Satanism in these elite blood
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  lines.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:25.080]  It's all the same bottom line if you research it.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.400]  And now look how, I mean you said a decade ago that Seville was doing this from your
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:34.440]  BBC contacts as you worked there and now it's all mainstream news and he's best buddies
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:38.720]  with the royal family and they're constantly finding dead bodies of kids and women on the
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:42.360]  royal estates and it's just always swept under the rug.
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:48.160]  The royal family are practicing satanism, apart from looking on booking a palace and
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:53.240]  saying it face to face, I couldn't have said it more often in more places in this country.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.720]  They are practicing satanism.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.400]  What does the Bible say?
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:02.600]  It says that the royalty of the earth, I mean that the devil is going to give them the
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.000]  power, that that's their minions.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.400]  See this is it, Alex.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:08.080]  Why are they royal families?
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.280]  They talk about having the divine right to rule.
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.640]  What is the divine right to rule from their perspective?
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.800]  It is their genetics, it is DNA.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:23.520]  That's why we have a woman who is the head of state and the real power on top of the
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.160]  power structure in this country, who is there only because of her blood line.
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.320]  And the Eastern establishment families of the United States are the same blood lines,
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:39.160]  as are the European aristocracy and their richer elite and corporate elite.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:44.760]  They are the same blood line, it's just that somewhere a crown and humanity reached a point
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.160]  where they weren't going to have that, or most of them weren't, so they moved from crowns
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.880]  and coronets into dark suits.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:55.880]  And that's the only thing that's changed, but they're the same blood line.
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:01.320]  And the reason they are called royal blood lines is because of this hybrid blood line
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.640]  which makes them different to the rest of the population genetically, and thus if you
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:13.000]  look through ancient accounts of these people, whether it's the emperors of China or whatever,
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:19.240]  they talk about they are special because they are descended and are genetically connected
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.920]  to what they perceive as the gods.
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.720]  It's not the divine as most people perceive divine, no, no, quite demonstrably.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:30.480]  It is their gods that they worship, this archontic force.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:34.320]  That's where they say that they are connected to, and that's why they say they have the
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:35.320]  right to rule.
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:39.360]  Let's take a few calls here, I'm skipping this network break, then we're going to come
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:42.120]  back if David leaves us and cover nothing but news.
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:47.040]  Let's talk to T.J. calling in from Minnesota listening on WWCR shortwave.
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:49.040]  Go ahead, T.J.
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:55.920]  Alex Emery and David Ike, by God, I thought my Christmas was smashed to pieces when my
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:02.560]  beagle hound died on 10 December, but now I get to talk to David Ike, and if there was
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:10.000]  ever a man of two or three centuries, his name just happens to be David Ike in my humble
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  house.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.760]  Well, you're on the air with him right now, you're on with Von Helsing right now, go
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:14.760]  ahead.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:20.480]  I've only got one of your videos, David, it's the one, your Oxford dissertation.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.480]  Right.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:29.360]  How does David Ike explain flesh and blood over illusion and what is illusory because
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:35.320]  illusion is illusory, and I think you do believe in flesh and blood.
[02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:38.600]  We got three Englishmen talking here right now.
[02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:39.600]  We got a Jones.
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.600]  I'm not going to give you my last name, and I'm going to give you-
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:47.640]  Okay, okay, well, let me, let me answer that question, brother, sorry about your dog.
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:50.000]  Dogs are certainly sweet little creatures.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  David comment on that.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:58.560]  Well, on my website is the full event from the Wembley Arena just a few weeks ago, and
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:03.880]  in the first two hours, two and a half hours of what is a 10 and a half hour, 11 hour event,
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:08.360]  I explain all this stuff in great detail about the nature of reality, because to understand
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:11.280]  that is then to understand the world.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:19.720]  What we live in is not a flesh and blood reality, it appears to be, it's a holographic reality.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:23.400]  It's an illusory reality, and this is not just me saying this.
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:29.800]  If you look at quantum physics, and I'll give you another quick example, I've been saying
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:35.800]  for a long time now, amazing as it may seem, that actually we living in the equivalent
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:44.120]  of a virtual reality computer program, and that we are being fed artificial information
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:49.760]  into the decoding sectors of the mind, the brain, and we are decoding this fake reality.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:55.980]  Now, all these years later, a science team at the University of Bonn in Germany has come
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:23:02.000]  out and said, we think this is what it is, and they are building a version of the universe
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.760]  to prove it, and what they say that actually when you look at the laws of physics that
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:12.760]  we believe in, it actually makes sense from those laws of physics, and actually we are
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:19.080]  in some kind of advanced computer program, and so the world is so not like we think it
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:25.200]  is, and it's so important that while we deal, yes, with the five cents level of it, we need
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:26.200]  to do that.
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:27.200]  That's what we are interacting with all the time.
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:28.200]  Sure.
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:29.200]  We've got to jump to other calls, great points.
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.880]  We've got to take a bigger picture to fully understand it.
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:35.000]  Well, let me just look at the planet.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:42.680]  Third rock out from the sun, a tiny thin atmosphere about as thin as the skin of an apple of oxygen
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.600]  that we can even breathe.
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:50.320]  I mean, we are already in the middle of a fantastic existence, and seven billion people
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:55.200]  living on this globe are mainly getting the reality off of an artificial television that
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:00.240]  can twist and spin things, and if you look at the messages, it's so destructive so much
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:04.920]  of it, and it is bent towards negativity and ugliness, and I've always seen it from
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:10.680]  the perspective to make us weak because if we see beauty and love and honor, that has
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:16.200]  been shown to bring us into higher levels of just basic IQ so that you're then aware
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  of larger horizons.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:18.200]  But it's David...
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.240]  Two things very quickly, Alex.
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:27.000]  You know one of the other things that they say about the Archons in these Gnostic writings?
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.400]  It's that they are about creating ugliness.
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:31.400]  Yes.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:32.400]  And look at it.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  You're right.
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:34.400]  You're right.
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  Ugliness everywhere.
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:40.720]  Let's go to Scott in Florida, who wants to ask David Eich about Satan worship.
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:41.720]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.240]  Hey, I've actually been on hold for a little bit, so I kind of changed the subject of my
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:47.240]  question.
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:48.240]  One, David Eich.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:49.240]  I'm a huge fan.
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.240]  I've read your books, and so I was 16 years old.
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.400]  I'm 22 now, but let me just make these quick points, and I'll take my answers off the
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:56.400]  air.
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:00.840]  One, what advice exactly would you suggest to the average, not the average person, because
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.200]  I know we're not average people, but what advice would you suggest to, just for lack
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.680]  of a better term than average person, to kind of let his peers or whatever remember exactly
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.520]  where humanity comes from and reach that point of reconnected awareness with the true
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.520]  self?
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:18.080]  Because we all know love does not abandon.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:22.920]  And another thing is the fact that what can we do to become active?
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:23.920]  For instance, Facebook.
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.960]  I mean, I want to move beyond Facebook, but I've created a Facebook page, which I don't
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:30.320]  want to say the name, but it reaches about a million people.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:31.320]  Well, that's fantastic.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:32.720]  Can you tell us your question for David?
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:34.480]  I just asked for quick questions.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.040]  Pretty much what advice would you suggest to the average person to reconnect with their
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:40.040]  awareness?
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:42.800]  And also, I just wanted to know if you were familiar with the products of young Jevity
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.320]  and stuff like that, because I'm aware that you actually suffered with rheumatoid arthritis
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:47.320]  a couple of years ago.
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:49.440]  And I know a lot of people like Joel Wallick have been.
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.160]  Yeah, a lot of that can be mineral or vitamin deficiency.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.160]  Josh and St. David.
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:54.160]  Some of that.
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:59.520]  David, in there, what's the easiest way to snap somebody out of their trance?
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:02.280]  Well, it depends on the person, really.
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:10.440]  I mean, all you can do is put information in front of people in the simplest way, non-aggressively,
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.720]  not trying to convince them, just another version of reality to look at.
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:16.520]  And then they make of it what they will.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.080]  It's as simple as that.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:27.760]  But from a personal point of view, the key for me is to stop having your point of self-identity
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:31.320]  as your name, your job, your life history.
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:33.200]  That's your experience, right?
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:40.160]  That's your experience for three score years and ten or whatever it is within a tiny frequency
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:41.600]  band called Visible Light.
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  That is not you.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.600]  That's your experience.
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.440]  You are infinite awareness having that experience.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.760]  When you move your – I know this from personal and the experience of many other people.
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:58.960]  When you move your point of observation of self from I am Fred Jones to I am infinite
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:05.440]  awareness having an experience as Fred Jones, you then become in this world in terms of
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:10.760]  your interacting with it, physically, if you want a word, but you're not of this world
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:13.080]  in terms of the point of observation.
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:14.080]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:16.360]  But to give people – Everything changes then, Alex.
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  It does.
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:18.360]  Everything changes.
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:19.360]  Everything shifts.
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:21.800]  But to give people something simple – Sure, sure.
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:27.400]  Your power, your sense of personal power absolutely explodes when you do that.
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.200]  And that's the big horizon, just on a basic level.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:32.840]  A lot of times when you tell somebody or give somebody some info, they're not going to
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:34.080]  wake up on the spot.
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.960]  It's like David said where the damn – doesn't even have cracks yet, but it's going to collapse.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:43.560]  You've just got to try to wake folks up and move on and not even worry about so much the
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.000]  pre-programming you get back.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.440]  That's just because they're victimized.
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:48.440]  They've been programmed.
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.360]  Don't let that get to you.
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.800]  Don't receive that information.
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.760]  Give them your info like they're a patient and move on to the next person.
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:58.320]  Jay in Florida has a David Eich 2012 question.
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:27:59.320]  Got to move quick, brother.
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.320]  Go ahead.
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:01.320]  Hi.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.880]  I think that last thing I think is time moves on.
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.640]  More and more people are going to really wake up anyway because of all the things that
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.640]  are really happening.
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:14.440]  It's really coming out in the open.
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:22.240]  Really for David Eich, do you think that this 2012 thing – I see it so much on TV.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:27.080]  Maybe the 2012 thing, it's so in our faces, they want us to think that the world is ending
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.880]  or either that or they want us to –
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:32.400]  And you notice they're doing it in concert with the Sandy Hook thing, which has been
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.000]  made a global hysteria.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.120]  It's the idea the end of your children being safe, only government will keep them safe.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:40.120]  It's all coordinated.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:41.120]  Go ahead, David.
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:45.320]  Well, yeah, very quickly on the Sandy Hook thing, this is the quicker side, but I think
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.720]  it's an important one.
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:51.120]  Satanism is actually Saturnism.
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:53.560]  One of the key things they do is they worship the planet.
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.200]  Actually, it's a dwarf sun called Satan.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:02.240]  In ancient Rome, in the run-up, in the period running up to what we call Christmas, they
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:06.920]  had Saturnalia, which was the worship of their god, Satan, just as the Greeks worship the
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:11.280]  god, Satan, as the god Cronost.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:18.800]  In this symbolically obsessed, subconscious manipulation obsessed arena that these people
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:19.800]  work in.
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:30.000]  There's absolutely no accident that yesterday they, NASA, released a grotesquely dark image
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:36.360]  of Saturn saying it was to celebrate the holiday of 2012, which is what, to them, it's the
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:39.640]  Saturnalia holiday of 2012.
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:43.360]  And of course, this period we're moving into, Alex, now, and we're actually in, moving
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:47.840]  now towards Christmas, is one of the great Satanism –
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:50.400]  Of course it is, David Ike, amazing.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:54.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:30:00.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:06.160]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers, a prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:08.960]  economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:15.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  to the global takeover.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:30.440]  Alright, finishing up with David Eich and going back to the news on what we predicted
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.440]  coming true.
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:35.080]  They're announcing that they want to physically confiscate the firearms and pay you back
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:39.280]  for them and the NRA is not even really making a big deal out of that.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.920]  We're in a lot of trouble, but it has to get bad before it gets better.
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:44.920]  They are really moving in with authoritarianism.
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:51.400]  They're not going to have roadside proctology exams until you still have guns.
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:52.920]  So many freedoms are already completely gone.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:55.040]  They've got to get rid of the rest.
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.200]  But David, you were finishing up your point.
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:58.200]  Yes.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:05.440]  Sorry, I was just going to say, I think it would be nice to quickly, given the subjects
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:10.200]  we've been talking about, if I made a few very, very quick connections regarding Christmas
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:13.520]  and one or two other things, just to show how deep this goes.
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:18.920]  And all these things are there to program the subconscious without us realizing it.
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:24.320]  First of all, the God of Saturn in ancient Greece was called Kronos.
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:31.640]  Kronos was the word from which we eventually get crown, crown in terms of royalty.
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:39.040]  The Kronos was depicted as an old man with a long white beard holding a scythe and holding
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:42.960]  the sands of time because he was also the Greek God of time.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:49.880]  This is why the Kronos, the Saturn God of Greece, is what we call old father time, who's
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:53.320]  an old man with a long white beard holding a scythe.
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:59.360]  And the other expression of this is the Grim Reaper, which is the Saturn is the planet,
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:04.960]  I would say the son of a death, Grim Reaper holding the scythe.
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:07.080]  And so you have the long white beard.
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:13.040]  And so you go to Santa Claus with a long white beard, you go to the way God is depicted
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:17.320]  with a long white beard sitting on a cloud or whatever, the Charlton-Eston version.
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:22.600]  And then you go to the Matrix and you go to the person who created the Matrix, who was
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:27.360]  known in the Matrix as the architect who had a white beard.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:33.320]  And the Freemasons call their God the Grand Architect and the Gnostics called what they
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.360]  call the Demiurge, the leader, their version of Satan, the devil, the leader of the Archons,
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.840]  they called him the Grand or Great Architect.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:45.400]  It's all connected and talking to our subconscious all the time.
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:50.680]  But the point is this, very important, once you bring this knowledge to the conscious mind,
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.920]  to the awareness of the conscious mind, it loses its impact.
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:00.440]  This is why when you show someone a subliminal advertisement and they can't see it and then
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.920]  you point out where the subliminals are, every time they see that advert from that point
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.720]  on, the subliminals they couldn't see are the first things they see because the conscious
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:10.880]  mind's been made aware of them.
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:12.480]  And that's what we're doing with this information.
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:16.080]  I hope you have a great holiday, Alex, and it's been great talking to you.
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:22.080]  Well, I know this, they've certainly taken and laid counterfeits over the entire Bible
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.080]  and we know that the December 25th is not the date of Christ's birth, any of that.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:31.240]  And we know the church steeples are a phallic symbol, all of it.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:34.760]  And there we are teaching our children that Santa Claus is real.
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:39.320]  They arrested a man last month in Canada who was out telling children and their parents
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:41.520]  that Santa Claus wasn't real.
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:48.400]  And it just shows that we are all taught to live and believe the myths that the media
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:55.480]  and the government push and counterfeits, twisted counterfeits to cover up the truth.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:57.320]  David Ike, thank you so much for the time.
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:00.200]  Great interview and look forward to speaking to you in the new year and talking about your
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.440]  new book when it comes out.
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:02.440]  Okay, mate.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:03.440]  Thanks very much.
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:04.440]  Have a good one.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:05.440]  You too.
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:06.440]  There goes David Ike.
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:07.440]  Powerful interview.
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:09.680]  We're going to go to some more of your phone calls, but David had to go.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:17.160]  I mean, I see stuff like some of the questions up there, best way to wake people up, psychic
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:25.360]  vampires, David Ike solutions, and we've got David Ike NRA with Ron from New York.
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:27.240]  We'll get to all of you.
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.360]  Obviously, I am very thankful so far that there's not a bunch of disasters or craziness
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:35.680]  that has gone on.
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:38.640]  There have been some mass arrests in China that the authoritarian government used to
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.800]  go after people's liberties.
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:45.600]  There have been power outages in the U.S. that people panic and think it's the end of the
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:46.600]  world.
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:50.760]  But overall, there are still seven, eight, nine, 10 hours depending on which time zone
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.480]  you're in for bad things to happen, but this is looking good.
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:58.440]  And again, I never said it was going to be a big disaster.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:04.400]  I was worried about crazy responses, though, and it's good so far that that's not happening.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.880]  The Mayan apocalypse, as it didn't happen, is the London Telegraph headline that Drudge
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:16.920]  has linked at the top of DrudgeReport.com.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:21.960]  We've also got Wayne LaPierre, Hollywood media, music, violent videos, cause culture
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:22.960]  of violence.
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.000]  I think that's overall good, but he calls for armed guards in every school.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  That's not good turning the schools into prisons.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.520]  And so-called journalist, anti-gunner, globalist, operative, seethe.
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:37.080]  Now, again, these will be federal police in there.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:39.140]  We need local.
[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:44.000]  And that almost gives into the fear, though, because it's statistically your child is dozens
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.880]  and dozens and dozens and dozens of times, has a better chance of being killed in a car
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:54.360]  wreck or drowning or falling over, hitting her head in the shower or bathtub than they
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:57.720]  do, dying from a gunshot.
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:06.000]  But because of this perception, something obviously needs to be done just so they don't
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.520]  push false solutions.
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:12.320]  But more mental health, mental health, run by a bunch of globalists that have caused
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.600]  a lot of this with their serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other drugs not linked, proven
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:17.880]  to cause psychotic breaks.
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.400]  So that'll make it worse.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:22.480]  I'm not getting on an NRA bashing fest here.
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:25.760]  It's just let the NRA know, no, we don't need more school psychiatrists.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:27.840]  We don't need more people putting kids on drugs.
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:31.440]  That's the battle started since the 70s with the drugging of the kids.
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:36.400]  I mean, that's an absolute cause and effect, open and shut on the drug inserts.
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.400]  And ask for armed guards, yeah, how about you just let, you know, key people that are vetted
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:46.160]  and tested because you need some background with that because there's so many weirdos
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:52.960]  in education now, but then have some people there with concealed carry and stop advertising
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.520]  schools as the place to go, shoot everybody.
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:01.280]  Bloomberg is out saying that he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:04.900]  He says, defend Second Amendment as much as I have as a quote.
[02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:07.560]  No one has defended it as much as he has.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.800]  This is a man who says all guns should be banned on record and they are in New York City.
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:18.600]  And now Cuomo says gun confiscation enforced buyback are an option.
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:25.080]  That's the big news up at DrudgeReport.com on the right hand side, all the NRA news
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:26.640]  and what's happening is right there.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:33.200]  But if you go to infowars.com, you can see the article, New York governor, gun confiscation
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:35.640]  enforced buyback and option.
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.160]  And then it links to the New York Times and then he's quoted by local radio station where
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.840]  he said that you go to the radio station and find the interview right there on the site
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:46.240]  before I go to your calls.
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.600]  I want to air this amazing little one minute piece put together by our own Darren McBreen
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:56.800]  and Rob Do that is up at infowars.com that you should circulate out to everybody.
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:05.800]  I'm also at the next break going to send this out on my Twitter, real Alex Jones, a Christmas
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:08.400]  message from the private Federal Reserve.
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  Here it is.
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:15.760]  And now a special Christmas message from the Federal Reserve.
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:20.800]  This Christmas, the Federal Reserve would like to wish all of our slaves a very merry
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:26.360]  quantitative easing for our current chair, Ben Bernanke, has perfected the art of giving
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:31.760]  money to foreign banks for many years as seen in this rare home movie.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:35.960]  Ben is currently giving these banks 85 billion per month.
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.280]  Excellent work, Ben.
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.360]  Once again, this is the Federal Reserve, wishing you and yours a very merry quantitative
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:49.200]  easing for and we hope to destroy your economy in the new year.
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  And again, that's buried on infowars.com I'm going to ask the guys to post that in the
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:42:00.560]  featured news area, you can also find it on our YouTube channel and at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:04.160]  I'm being pretty calm about this to have the Russian government, the Russian media and
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:08.960]  the official communist Chinese media saying Americans should have all their guns taken.
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:15.680]  The people's official government press outlet put out yesterday calling, you can go read
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:21.680]  the quotes, for a war on American guns and the communists took the guns, a few that had
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:25.160]  it and killed between 40 and 80 million people, nobody really knows.
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:30.480]  CIA says it's 64 million, the Chinese say he killed 80 million, just a mile alone.
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:34.080]  I mean, it's just unbelievable and the most authoritarian government on earth that's been
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:37.360]  used by the globalists to deindustrialize our countries and the globalists are teamed
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:43.200]  up with the corrupt elites of China against the Chinese people and the American people.
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:46.760]  And they just mow down crowds of people there as they're taking their farms and property
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:49.400]  and sending them to the cities to basically starve to death.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:53.720]  It is just unprecedented, former Congressman Bob Barr, NRA board member called for a congressional
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:59.680]  investigation of this and I put out a hard hitting video that's linked at the bottom
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.880]  of the article that's linked in red at infowars.com, communist Chinese government calls for Americans
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:13.080]  to be disarmed where I linked to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts article about how he went on RT and
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:19.360]  RT was funded by hundreds of millions of dollars of Russian government money and you know, I've
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:25.400]  gone on Iranian TV, British TV, French TV, Japanese TV many times, Brazilian TV.
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:29.120]  I mean, if it's skype and easy or satellite and quick, I'll do it.
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  I'm so busy nowadays.
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.880]  I don't even really go on US television when they call me just because half the time they
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:37.880]  cancel you by the time you get there and you get to talk for two minutes.
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:42.880]  I mean, it's pretty much pointless but RT, you know, has interviewed me many times and
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:45.720]  do little five, 10 minute interviews, but I could actually just say whatever I wanted
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:50.560]  to because I was told by multiple people that worked there that the director of RT America,
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.480]  I haven't checked if they've changed who it is, I would suspect they had, was anti-New
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:00.280]  World Order and was a listener and you saw the libertarians and constitutionalists on
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:01.280]  there.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:02.280]  It was wild.
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:07.400]  RT America has gotten rid of most of the patriot people they had on it and now whenever I see
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:13.280]  it, it's guns are bad, turn them in, open borders are good, world government's good.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:15.240]  It's really gotten creepy.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:16.600]  So there's definitely been a change up there.
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.880]  I haven't had time to investigate what the changes are.
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:24.960]  Really it, they would have me on about once a week on average and I was happy to do it.
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:30.040]  Not a big audience domestically but still quick and easy on Skype and I would do it.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:34.880]  They haven't had me on in six, eight months and so there's a definite change there and
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:42.680]  I've put out a video, you know, saying I don't like the fact that we've got a foreign government
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.520]  funded entity calling for our guns to be taken here in the US and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:52.400]  who's gone on RT and, you know, when it's exposing drones, killing people or exposing
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:57.240]  secret arrest or torture, that's a good thing and I will use any venue to get the word out
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:05.400]  on that but it doesn't so much report on that now as it does how much I should be a slave
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:10.160]  and so I want to tell Piers Morgan of England, nothing against the British people but, you
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:15.880]  know, he's a big, swollen authoritarian punk who has a tiny audience less than Larry King
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:21.200]  is a total failure but he tries to make up for it with just dripping arrogance that we
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:26.040]  do have a petition out just to get the word out that Kurt Nemo put up on the White House.gov
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:29.920]  that you can go to info wars.com and link through to the White House and a call for
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:35.480]  him to be deported and I say for sedition and a foreigner over here trying to manipulate
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.320]  our domestic operations, nobody would ever put up with that in the past.
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:45.040]  That's what this globalism is about, Obama serving as the UN head of the Security Council
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:50.360]  violates article one section out of the Constitution, our military being told NATO and the UN give
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:54.240]  Obama orders and that Congress can sit down and shut up.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:58.240]  All of this globalism, the Chinese and the UN treaty saying they're going to tell us
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:02.920]  I mean that isn't rhetoric, we're now going under Chinese and Russian control in the treaty
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.640]  and they're saying, yeah, take the American people's guns.
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:10.120]  I mean that is just so off the charts, so incredible that if people don't get really
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:13.840]  upset and angry they will just intensify it.
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:18.880]  I mean they are really testing us right now to see what we'll put up with and so it appears
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:25.640]  Morgan who's run out of England and to RT of Russia and to the communist Chinese run
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:33.200]  media, listen, whenever the globalists launch the tax on your country on 888 I was against
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:38.400]  it because it was illegal and it was wrong, okay, and I'm a nationalist and the globalists
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:43.480]  are playing our countries off against each other but it's clear that more and more Russia
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:50.360]  and China are completely run by the new world order as well and get out of my internal affairs.
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:56.880]  Nation states are firewalls to tyranny and I really am upset that you think you can come
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:03.500]  here and tell us what to do and I'm going to develop some ideas to really politically
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:05.040]  punish you for what you're doing.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:08.920]  I mean the communist Chinese are already telling us what movies can be released in movie theaters
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:12.680]  aka the new Red Dawn, they went and re-edited that for almost two years.
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:16.800]  All right, let's go to some phone calls, let's talk to Ron in New York, always an interesting
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:18.520]  caller with the Ron, I think it is.
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:19.520]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:21.000]  Good afternoon Alex.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:26.760]  Alex, earlier today I watched the press conference by Wayne LaPierre in the NRA and there's something
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  and you want to talk about I guess a form of psychological warfare in a sense that they
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:35.920]  struck on that they keep doing and I've birded up before many, many times.
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:40.480]  Wayne LaPierre called for a national database for the mentally ill.
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:44.600]  Now this is what you called three days ago about, no that's the put all the troops and
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:48.840]  everybody in a database and declare everyone mentally ill, it's pretty bad.
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:49.840]  That's right.
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.160]  Now the funny part about it is they've been speaking rhetoric out of both sides of their
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:59.920]  mouth on this issue but of acting consistently in the wrong way on this issue.
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:05.440]  In 1999 to 2007 they bemoaned the fact that the government has put veterans in that database
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:06.440]  unfairly.
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:12.280]  Then in 2007 they support an act which was passed into law which exacerbated that and
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:13.280]  made it worse.
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.200]  In fact, they not only supported, they promoted an advanced app.
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:21.440]  Then they went back to the old sore of how terrible this database is, it's had a detrimental
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:23.520]  impact on our veterans.
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.360]  As late as two weeks ago, they supported a piece of legislation which ultimately failed
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:32.280]  in the United States Senate to support them.
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:36.880]  They went to the Supreme Court and sabotaged it with their brief to say that the Second
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:42.040]  Amendment is not absolute and they supported the 68 Gun Control Act, they supported the
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:43.040]  NICS.
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:46.760]  The NRA to a great extent is a loyal opposition.
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:50.920]  It was created by the federal government as I know you know, you know that right, post
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:51.920]  civil war.
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:57.920]  So, yes, we're in deep trouble and that's why the anti-gunners are so arrogant.
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:03.560]  Let me ask you, what do you think of Cuomo saying he may in his state of the state in
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:10.040]  two weeks come out and call for guns to be handed in and the public be given money for
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.040]  them, a gun confiscation?
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:16.240]  Well, I'd be more than glad to answer it but just let me please complete the thing on
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:17.240]  the NRA.
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:19.240]  We're going to go to break, you all get to finish that but okay, go ahead.
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:25.120]  All right, the fact of the matter is now today they call for taking a bad situation, expanding
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.920]  it and putting more groups and more names into it.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.960]  People got to get down on the NRA, get down on them hard and hedge their bets by joining
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:35.580]  the GOA, okay, as a counterbalance.
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:38.000]  Now to New York state and Governor Cuomo.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.200]  Governor Cuomo was on a fishing expedition.
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:44.720]  He's even made it clear and I believe it stated in the New York Times that he's checking the
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:49.520]  pulse of politicians, Republican politicians in our state capital in Albany.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:53.360]  So basically what he's doing is he's trying to test the waters and see if it's safe to
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  go out there.
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.440]  No, no, it says that in the New York Times.
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:57.440]  He said we're going to try for a confiscation.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.440]  Yes, that's what he's definitely looking to do but he's looking to see if there will
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:07.360]  be weakness in what we would call the opposition and there's some suspicion if there really
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  is.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:09.360]  Well, he's also shooting for the moon.
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.600]  He's saying, okay, I didn't get full confiscation, we'll only take half your guns.
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:19.360]  You know, that's like saying, I didn't get full murder, we'll only take half your body.
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:24.320]  It's all or nothing in that proposition, there's no halfway point.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:27.360]  They may play word games and play on psychology.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.640]  They're experts at psychological warfare, obviously, but that's what that would amount
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:32.640]  to.
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.200]  And by calling it a mandatory buyback, that's also a rhetorical play on words.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:38.400]  That's extortion.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:42.480]  When you put a gun or threaten somebody or put it to their head and tell them that they
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:46.080]  must sell their gun or else, that's confiscation.
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:50.280]  That's extortion and we shouldn't be using terms because it softens it and makes them
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:51.280]  look better.
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:53.320]  Oh, it's a mandatory buyback.
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:58.200]  If you don't want to sell something to somebody and he twists your arm behind your back, alright,
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  that's extortion.
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:00.200]  Hi, here I am.
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:06.080]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:09.440]  severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:13.760]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:16.440]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:20.760]  After only three weeks on one world weight, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:21.760]  again.
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:24.000]  I feel energized and strong.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.280]  This is an amazing product.
[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:29.080]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10%
[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:34.880]  of its protein content as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:39.080]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:42.920]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.200]  organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:48.920]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:03.200]  Diving the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:04.920]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:07.200]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:09.640]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:13.920]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:14.920]  is prudent.
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:18.200]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:23.080]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:26.960]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional
[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:28.560]  paper investments.
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:33.120]  LeSig Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:37.680]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:46.640]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold 6,000-year history.

[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:59.320]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:42.200]  Well, the world didn't end today so far, but you know my prediction on record, they'll
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:46.840]  say the Gregorian calendar or something was miscalculated and that the end is really in
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:49.360]  three days or a month or next year.
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:53.880]  They miscalculated the date, it will now be in two years.
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:55.480]  That way, why should you get involved?
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.480]  Why should you be empowered?
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:54:59.680]  The world is going to end anyway.
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:05.320]  On air, talk about how Christians are manipulated with the rapture and people are like, well,
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:07.240]  what are you, not a Christian?
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:10.160]  No, I am a Christian.
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:11.160]  It's not that.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:14.960]  It's that what you're taught is Christianity isn't what the Bible even really says.
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:22.480]  There is a rapture clearly in the Bible after Christ returns and that's what's so frustrating.
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:27.040]  Not regardless, do you think God's going to say he knows you if you don't stand up for
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:31.360]  what's right, if you just cop out and just say, oh, well, I'm going to get teleported
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:33.400]  out of here anyways?
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:38.160]  But look, all that aside, just expand your thought process.
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:51.680]  Know that you don't know everything and that the globalists have tried to seriously limit
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:54.280]  the amount of information you're getting.
[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:59.320]  People are getting so close-minded, so dumbed down, the language is being reduced, so much
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:08.000]  is happening and we live in a world of wonderment and just incredible opportunity and the only
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.040]  reason evil is in charge is because good men and women do nothing.
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:20.200]  And I know you know that, but I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity, this Christmas
[02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:24.280]  holiday that we have right now, time with our families, even if it is a globalist holiday
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:29.520]  now, we can make it into something good to give the gift of truth, whether it's a copy
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:34.240]  of one of my films or a InfoWars Magazine subscription that also supports our broadcast
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:41.360]  or a infowarsnews.com membership, you can get 10 of them for $5.95 a month and then give
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:45.960]  them as gifts with one username and passcode, all your Christmas shopping done right there
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:51.240]  not battling the crazy crowds and all the car wrecks at PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:54.040]  And hopefully, you know, put it in a card and give it to somebody and say, hey, check
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:04.280]  out this documentary, Nightly News, alternative media system and wake them up with all our
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:09.680]  special reports and films and reporters, it really is an amazing sight, PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:16.400]  Again, I meant to check it, but I mean, how many hours are left in this day in any time
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:17.400]  zone?
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:22.440]  Isn't it only like 12 hours or something?
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:25.520]  I mean, how long globally is left in any time zone?
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:30.280]  Because I know the time zone starts out in the Pacific Ocean, so in some areas hasn't
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:34.920]  already gone into the next day.
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:47.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Pacific Samoa in Australia, it's already gone into 2012, the 22nd.
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:51.720]  And I just can't wait for this to be over without some cult blowing themselves up or
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:55.360]  mass shooting or something that the globalists will use to take our liberty.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:00.480]  So obviously, if something happens, we'll come live on infowars.com and the Nightly
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:05.280]  News tonight at 7 o'clock central with the aftermath, but I just can't wait for this
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:09.920]  to be gone and passed and I'll obviously shoot a special report video Saturday.
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:17.880]  And we'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., 4 to 6 p.m. central with the Sunday live show.
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:22.640]  I will be live the day before Christmas Eve, and we have some really special stuff.
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:27.880]  We have some live shows next week, but also some rebroadcast, but also some other stuff
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:30.400]  we've edited together that'll be original.
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:36.560]  It's coming up next week as well, but live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central infowars.com,
[02:58:36.560 --> 02:59:02.920]  and we'll be back next week with some really special stuff.
