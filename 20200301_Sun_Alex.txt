[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:26.840]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones live back in the
[00:26.840 --> 00:34.360]  ATX thank God returning from DC and Maryland for CPAC I am your host on
[00:34.360 --> 00:44.000]  this Sunday March 1st 2020 global transmission well my advice to President
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.800]  Trump is this beware the aides of March and I was thinking that yesterday
[00:52.800 --> 01:00.040]  afternoon when I was looking up at leap year day February 29th and I sat back
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.520]  and I went beware the aides of March and I didn't watch Saturday Night Live
[01:05.520 --> 01:10.800]  last night in fact I went to bed pretty early after going to one of my friends
[01:10.800 --> 01:17.640]  fiftieth birthday parties with my children but as I laid down in bed I
[01:17.640 --> 01:21.960]  thought beware the aides of March and then I got up this morning the videos up
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.360]  on Saturday Night Live and they're making threats about Julius Caesar and
[01:26.360 --> 01:34.000]  the aides of March and how they're coming after President Trump right as the
[01:34.000 --> 01:45.400]  whole impeachment fraud fell apart I kept asking a question over and over
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.880]  again because I follow patterns and I said the globalists are going to launch
[01:49.880 --> 01:56.160]  their new attack within two weeks will it be economic collapse will it be a new
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.640]  war will it be a bio weapon I said is it corona back when it was not being hyped
[02:01.640 --> 02:11.000]  like this I said whatever it is two weeks and just like night follows day and
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.400]  day follows night it's the virus now I want to explain something I know the
[02:17.400 --> 02:20.840]  listeners know this is why you tune in you've seen the track record my North
[02:20.840 --> 02:27.880]  Star is telling the truth and I don't ever hype something up unless I really
[02:27.880 --> 02:33.320]  think it's a great concern and so there are two camps out there and there
[02:33.320 --> 02:40.720]  shouldn't be there's a camp saying that the virus is a total hoax and it's no
[02:40.720 --> 02:47.080]  big deal and is a total fraud and there's a camp saying it's the end of the
[02:47.080 --> 02:53.000]  world Armageddon that's the Communist Chinese that you win and others who are
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  very suspect in Italy's run by socials now all these socialist countries are
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.720]  the ones lining up with martial law plans and there's Trump saying it's not a
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.640]  big deal because he sees the globalists trying to use it but see you got to
[03:07.640 --> 03:14.960]  think 3d40 chess I'm sure the president is if they know it's worse than the
[03:14.960 --> 03:18.760]  president knows they get him to say it's no big deal to save the stock market a
[03:18.760 --> 03:27.080]  laudable goal and then it is worse they can then position it to say it's all
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.360]  his fault and we've been wargaming that for over four weeks and exactly what we
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.040]  have said has come true just just exactly because that's what we do we war
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.720]  game stuff we don't get on high directives on what to say from the
[03:41.720 --> 03:45.160]  globalist or from Trump or anybody else we've taken your calls and you
[03:45.160 --> 03:52.520]  contributed greatly to that massively so tomorrow I'm gonna open the phones up
[03:52.520 --> 03:56.000]  throughout the broadcast we have several guests popping in but this whole week I'm
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.440]  really gonna try to dedicate the callers to get your take on all this but I want
[04:01.440 --> 04:05.400]  to explain this again and David Knight said this really well on a Thursday
[04:05.400 --> 04:08.360]  show because I was up here working in a rebroadcasting was Thursday shows
[04:08.360 --> 04:15.000]  explain this so as Mike Adams that the supply side supply chain crisis and
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.720]  China being total ghost towns for a month and now spreading other countries
[04:20.720 --> 04:27.200]  whether the virus is really dangerous or not the response is on it's happened
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.280]  and they have announced on CNBC that the economy is screwed we're in a
[04:32.280 --> 04:38.640]  recession the globalists are using it to bring down the economy that is a fact
[04:38.640 --> 04:42.720]  and that's why people gut level are concerned clearing off shells around
[04:42.720 --> 04:51.200]  the country is because they got level no it's big it doesn't mean the virus is
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.160]  big but it means something big a big move is taking place and we've been dead
[04:56.160 --> 05:03.800]  on yet again at the end of World War two Adolf Hitler had discredited the
[05:03.800 --> 05:09.480]  eugenics and world population control organizations they openly had meetings
[05:09.480 --> 05:14.160]  and led by Julian Huxley all this Huxley's brother decided to repackage
[05:14.160 --> 05:20.760]  themselves as transhumanist now in the year 2020 to set the precedent that
[05:20.760 --> 05:26.120]  people can be turned into cyborgs that robots can be given rights you name it
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.960]  they are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply
[05:30.960 --> 05:38.080]  misgender someone so the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if
[05:38.080 --> 05:43.880]  you can't even tell what they are this is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control
[05:43.880 --> 05:48.840]  and there's several big articles up on info wars calm that break this down UK
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.640]  teen fine at her house arrest for asking trans police officers gender UK
[05:53.640 --> 05:57.920]  mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1,000 pound
[05:57.920 --> 06:10.040]  fine you are listening to an info wars calm frontline report if you are
[06:10.040 --> 06:15.360]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:15.360 --> 06:28.120]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[06:28.120 --> 06:35.640]  Alex Jones I told you a month ago that you would end up seeing panic buying and
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.920]  grocery store shelves cleaned out I told you more than a month ago you'd end up
[06:39.920 --> 06:47.280]  seeing martial law scenarios and major city shutdowns across the globe and now
[06:47.280 --> 06:55.240]  it's all happening why is it happening because communist China is the globalist
[06:55.240 --> 07:04.880]  beta test for everything the globalist controlled countries engage in and so
[07:04.880 --> 07:11.080]  when I saw Trump endorse what gg ping was doing a month ago I'm not attacking
[07:11.080 --> 07:20.000]  the president I said sir danger danger danger will Robinson because we knew
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.320]  the hype was being used by the authoritarians to crack down so I said
[07:23.320 --> 07:30.840]  then I said I don't know how deadly this virus really is I don't know how
[07:30.840 --> 07:40.200]  communicable it really is but I said this is going to attack the world economy
[07:40.200 --> 07:47.240]  this is an attack on president Trump this is an attack on America and so the
[07:47.240 --> 07:54.240]  the supply chain attack is real whether the virus is deadly or not we know it's
[07:54.240 --> 07:59.560]  deadly but super deadly you can leave up to debate but the response and the
[07:59.560 --> 08:04.720]  hysteria and the way the media unified and the way all these governments were
[08:04.720 --> 08:10.760]  on the world unified except the United States we did it first and I was dead on
[08:10.760 --> 08:14.920]  I'm sorry it's just true scary actually it's why they want us off air saying Mr.
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.280]  President I'm not sure what's going on but this is over a month ago but you're
[08:18.280 --> 08:25.760]  endorsing gg ping and this crackdown something big is happening here and then
[08:25.760 --> 08:32.120]  when the president started to say we're not gonna let flights from China come in
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.520]  anymore from select cities and the UN and China said how dare you racist evil
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.000]  white person I went wait a minute China's shooting people at checkpoints
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.840]  they've got most their cities shut down the UN's endorsed that why are we bad if
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.640]  we control some flights so then I went okay it's for sure this is after our
[08:49.640 --> 08:56.400]  economy this is after President Trump look at the CDC telling him it's no big
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.360]  deal and not a problem he was finally getting it but but I went but it's
[09:01.360 --> 09:07.040]  bigger than that when it becomes a problem then they're gonna say you didn't
[09:07.040 --> 09:12.920]  respond properly to it and ladies and gentlemen three days ago it's like they
[09:12.920 --> 09:17.640]  flipped a light switch every radio show that's national that's establishment
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.800]  newspapers MSNBC CNN ABC all the usual suspects I've got dozens of reports right
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.560]  here you've all seen them President Trump caused this President Trump didn't do
[09:28.560 --> 09:35.400]  enough President Trump's trying to cover it up and so conservatives who know
[09:35.400 --> 09:40.280]  Trump's under attack though I don't believe CNN I don't believe MSNBC it
[09:40.280 --> 09:45.720]  must be a hoax so they start asking us hey what are you doing attacking the
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.840]  president because you're saying it's serious yes I'm saying it's serious
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.960]  because of how the whole media is unified how they use it for martial law in
[09:55.960 --> 10:01.080]  Italy and and China and now all over the world Switzerland and all over
[10:01.080 --> 10:09.920]  clearly this is a big global move people better get ready see we're all sold on
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.400]  it's either totally a hoax or it's most deadly thing since the the black plague
[10:15.400 --> 10:17.680]  or Ebola
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.600]  well wait a minute what about globalists have released it it's man-made so
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.080]  scientists see it and get scared it does kill some people it does spread very
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.240]  easily and so because we see this giant freak out overseas we know something
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.320]  big is coming this is an attack on the global economy you give globalist
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.160]  control of nation-states you give them control the whole world they will then
[10:42.160 --> 10:51.400]  use that power to create a global crisis so they can offer a global solution and
[10:51.400 --> 10:56.000]  that's really what's happening not what the media says it's either a total hoax
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.320]  and nothing's going on and it's all made up or it's the most deadly thing we've
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.240]  ever seen no it comes out of communist China it's man-made that gets confirmed
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.080]  quickly we have the signatures Obama transferred it to China 2015 it shows
[11:12.080 --> 11:15.480]  up in December turns up the chai comms covered it up we reported that first now
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.600]  it's confirmed and then it's used to bring down the global economy and then
[11:19.600 --> 11:23.600]  the global media points at Trump and doesn't just say oh look the economy's
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.160]  down don't elect Trump now which they've all been salivating and hoping for and
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.520]  crossing their fingers for but now it's his fault when he doesn't respond
[11:31.520 --> 11:39.440]  properly when it really tanks and that's why we've been saying the president
[11:39.440 --> 11:45.400]  doesn't need to say day one it's not a problem at all he needs to say worst-case
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.200]  scenario we're gonna be okay here's the mitigating factors so they can't claim
[11:49.200 --> 11:52.480]  that and they can't say that and then we learned the NIH wouldn't send out the
[11:52.480 --> 11:57.560]  kits a month ago and that's now been confirmed they hid this from the
[11:57.560 --> 12:04.120]  president so of course the president's a hundred percent right the Democrats have
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.360]  weaponized this they're trying to use it to take the economy down and blame him
[12:08.360 --> 12:11.760]  absolutely they admit they are I'll play clips in a moment and Rush Limbaugh's
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.360]  totally right the media is so evil to salivate and hope this brings down the
[12:16.360 --> 12:19.800]  economy and the deaths of people can be used I mean this is just disqualify
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.800]  their party from even being a party anymore that they are just the worst
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.680]  opportunists the planet's ever seen they are tone-deaf they have no idea how
[12:28.680 --> 12:33.800]  they're even acting let's see the media is spitting it like oh if you think the
[12:33.800 --> 12:37.240]  media is wrong for saying Trump's wrong you were Rush Limbaugh or vice versa no
[12:37.240 --> 12:43.000]  we're analyzing that we've never seen a U.N. global shutdown like this and an
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.640]  attack on an economy and huge cities locked down and China using it as a way
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.280]  to show America you know if China just shut its factories off that would piss
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.520]  their employees their workers and the stockholders off if China here's the
[12:56.520 --> 12:59.400]  big enchilada right now
[13:00.800 --> 13:06.760]  because it's all coming together as we war game it in every angle if China just
[13:06.760 --> 13:10.320]  shut their economy down they just lost a big trade war with America they've been
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.040]  in a 50-year trade war with us we even know what's happening because the
[13:13.040 --> 13:19.920]  globalist sold us out but if they then release a virus they bought from Obama
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.880]  that they know it's not super lethal but does kill some people and spreads fast
[13:23.880 --> 13:26.840]  will scare the hell out of folks they could push a vaccine later make money
[13:26.840 --> 13:34.720]  off that as well and then out of that they can shut down their factories and
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.720]  order the city shut down order no one to go to work in all their major
[13:37.720 --> 13:42.440]  industrial sites and then that kills the global supply chain they've just
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.160]  checkmated Trump and America and you know that's what they did they did it
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.120]  with the deep state with the U.N. coordinated with the EU who are all on
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.760]  board to create the hysteria and fear bring down the economy worldwide and
[13:56.760 --> 14:02.720]  then say President Trump and America and people that questioned when it's
[14:02.720 --> 14:09.080]  obviously overblown well it's their fault that's why we said get prepared
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.960]  that's why we said get ready because there's going to be runs on the food
[14:12.960 --> 14:15.760]  and there's going to be hysteria and there's gonna be major stock market
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.440]  problems we hope we can defeat this globalist move but we've never seen
[14:19.440 --> 14:24.560]  anything like this and we've been proven totally correct so I'm not gonna sit
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.000]  here while anybody misdirects or distracts from what we said that oh
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.040]  Jones says the virus is super deadly but Limbaugh says it's no problem and so
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.400]  when the stock market starts tanking which it has it's our fault we're saying
[14:40.400 --> 14:44.680]  hey get ready we said get ready because it is man-made in the lab Obama
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.120]  transferred it to China on record mainstream news 2015 was a big debate
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.200]  about it it's now been released and the media doesn't want to debate about how
[14:54.200 --> 15:00.720]  it's man-made and who released it and who stands to gain from it who has the
[15:00.720 --> 15:07.640]  means who bought it who wants to win the trade war who's pissed who can shut
[15:07.640 --> 15:11.000]  their people down and treat them like slaves and prop up their stock market
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  because they're totally rigged while hurting ours China and the UN and the
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.760]  globalists that put them in charge and set them up to rule the new century this
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.520]  is World War four the Cold War was World War three the Pentagon calls it that
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.960]  I agree with that assessment the Defense Intelligence Agency and others this is
[15:27.960 --> 15:33.520]  World War four right now we're living it and now on March 1st it all came into
[15:33.520 --> 15:39.920]  view do I support the president 100% is he looking at a lot of complex
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.880]  calculus absolutely do I stand with him yes but we're gonna walk through the
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.240]  third way here what's really happening not the two fake points were told but
[15:49.240 --> 15:54.480]  the synergy the dialectic the real rock bottom and info wars is that radar and
[15:54.480 --> 16:03.920]  that sonar there can no longer be any doubt this coronavirus is serious on
[16:03.920 --> 16:09.400]  multiple levels it's very communicable it spreads very very fast it is killing a
[16:09.400 --> 16:13.800]  lot of people and the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad
[16:13.800 --> 16:18.280]  it is and the White House is now openly challenging them show our Trump's top
[16:18.280 --> 16:24.760]  scientist and so is senator cotton my friends now is the time to get prepared
[16:24.760 --> 16:29.560]  2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist are trying to create
[16:29.560 --> 16:34.000]  economic collapse race riots we don't know how bad this virus is gonna get
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.120]  here that's why listeners the info wars need to be prepared an info war store

[17:11.080 --> 17:14.520]  my Patriot a month ago I said what can you handle I said I think it's gonna be
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.960]  really big and they said we can handle probably this we're not sure we're
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.040]  investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund I said
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.120]  no I think this is gonna be huge I think you should spend everything you have
[17:22.120 --> 17:25.040]  coming in to secure more food even though the prices are going up for you so
[17:25.040 --> 17:27.240]  those are the types of discussions we have I'm just giving the inside base
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.800]  ball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred
[17:31.800 --> 17:35.960]  times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay infowarstore.com you go
[17:35.960 --> 17:39.800]  right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the orders are so

[20:29.040 --> 20:38.480]  the resistance from the info wars calm studios it's Alex Jones there can no
[20:38.480 --> 20:47.960]  longer be any doubt the coronavirus is the globalist weapon to take out the
[20:47.960 --> 20:52.360]  nation states and president Trump the credit global crisis out of which a
[20:52.360 --> 20:58.560]  global solution a total planetary government will be announced the UN
[20:58.560 --> 21:05.000]  said decades ago they use a global pandemic or a takeover a global problem
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.200]  needs a global solution this is their answer to Balasaro in Brazil and to
[21:12.200 --> 21:15.840]  president Trump here and to the Brexit in the UK what's happening in Europe this
[21:15.840 --> 21:23.960]  is it and so you could see it when the communist Chinese lockdown one two three
[21:23.960 --> 21:30.640]  four five six more than 20 major cities hundreds of towns now it's up to almost
[21:30.640 --> 21:37.280]  a billion people not allowing their factories to operate to create a
[21:37.280 --> 21:44.480]  supply chain shutdown to then devastate the US economy and then China comes back
[21:44.480 --> 21:48.320]  because China knows that by the time we build up our industry again we won't be
[21:48.320 --> 21:54.000]  dependent on them they know that's Trump's plan and so before that happens
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.640]  they are striking back this is economic warfare world war four is what it's
[21:58.640 --> 22:04.920]  called and now it's all confirmed that's why they did it all that's why they
[22:04.920 --> 22:08.440]  created all the fear they knew that we would all watch this see this and go
[22:08.440 --> 22:12.000]  there's no reason a government's gonna do something this big they've had other
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.880]  outbreaks in the flu kills millions a year why because they want you to know
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.320]  something's big and deep down you know it's big because this is 21st century
[22:21.320 --> 22:27.840]  warfare fifth-generational sixth-generational warfare psychological warfare
[22:27.840 --> 22:34.400]  people running around spraying everyone with toxic poison antivirals a huge
[22:34.400 --> 22:39.360]  martial law drill by communist China which is the globalist model of one
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.280]  child policies depopulation everything and we told you the Democrats would
[22:44.280 --> 22:49.520]  then blame it on Trump and now they've done that ladies and gentlemen the
[22:49.520 --> 22:56.040]  first clip is Bill Maher Friday night on HBO saying it would be worth it this is
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.520]  the guy that salivated wants a depression a stock market crash to stop
[22:59.520 --> 23:05.240]  Trump here he is right Josh isn't the Fed cutting rates now just going to make
[23:05.240 --> 23:10.000]  the next economic downturn worse what's your prediction I've been hoping for a
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.680]  recession people hate me for it but it would get rid of Trump so you shouldn't
[23:13.680 --> 23:16.840]  hate me for it I mean recessions are really bad people lose their jobs and I
[23:16.840 --> 23:21.160]  know and we shouldn't wish it's worth it but I I don't I mean a recession is
[23:21.160 --> 23:23.760]  always possible I don't see any particular reason to think that it's
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.840]  likely I think you know aren't we overdue for one just know this by the cycle of
[23:27.840 --> 23:30.720]  economics this is such a misconception people sort of feel like oh you know
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.760]  well about every eight years or something you're supposed to have it
[23:32.760 --> 23:35.720]  recessions don't come because they're due recessions come because there's some
[23:35.720 --> 23:39.560]  sort of overheating something goes wrong in the economy like recessions come
[23:39.560 --> 23:42.120]  because the globalist are manipulating and rigging the markets and everybody
[23:42.120 --> 23:45.480]  knows that it's on record we have unlimited growth potential now there he
[23:45.480 --> 23:49.200]  is celebrating I have like five clips that are even on my list you all saw
[23:49.200 --> 23:54.520]  him MSNBC CNN going this is great we'll finally getting we're gonna play some of
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.200]  them here here he is on the same show Bill Maher when he talks that's a
[23:58.200 --> 24:01.800]  globalist mouthpiece so it's like Satan's puppet his little sit on his
[24:01.800 --> 24:08.840]  lap little one of those things ventriloquist dolls so here he is talking
[24:08.840 --> 24:13.680]  about Trump wants the virus for martial law so here's Trump playing it down not
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.360]  to hurt the stock market because he gets the globalist are trying to hype this
[24:17.360 --> 24:23.240]  up he sees America's enemies hyping it so he he plays it down and then Bill
[24:23.240 --> 24:26.120]  Maher says he wants martial law here it is
[24:26.120 --> 24:31.160]  Axios Paul has Bernie losing to Trump but that closer than all the other
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.320]  Democrats 47 to 15 nationally he beats him in Pennsylvania by 4 look all these
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.320]  pundits so I hear say things like well Bernie will lose 45 states you don't know
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.920]  what you're talking about you never know we never know you're the same people who
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.240]  said Trump wouldn't even get the nomination you don't know what's gonna
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.600]  what we don't know is Bernie needs a revolution to show up he needs people
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.240]  who have never voted before now they are not showing up in those numbers in the
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.400]  primary but we don't know but now since Trump I think it's not gonna leave
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.480]  anyway let's well run Bernie he's not he's not and by the way when the virus
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.720]  gets bad he's gonna declare in martial law what's that oh my god that could
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.520]  happen but I could totally have your point about now they just told you what's
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.520]  really happening they want to create martial law all the globalist countries
[25:20.520 --> 25:25.280]  have basically declared martial law in one or more areas or nationwide he's
[25:25.280 --> 25:28.840]  telling you Trump trying to stop hysteria and martial law is the one
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.880]  wanting martial law so Rush Limbaugh is totally right when he says this virus is
[25:33.880 --> 25:37.360]  a bunch of hype in its current configuration he doesn't get into the
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.160]  fact that it's man-made doesn't get into the fact that Obama sold it to him he
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.040]  knows all that he doesn't want to create fear but the hype over it is a hundred
[25:45.040 --> 25:49.000]  percent real and it looks like the virus is pretty deadly too but I agree not as
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.440]  deadly as a flu maybe more deadly for Asians we're not sure it doesn't matter
[25:54.440 --> 26:00.520]  because the globalists have pushed this as the end of the world to bring down
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.880]  the economy so it doesn't matter that's how I could tell you a month ago get
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.080]  food they're gonna start clearing store shelves and I've got a stack of news
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.040]  mainstream news from Alabama to Texas to New York to like the store shelves are
[26:14.040 --> 26:21.400]  bimpty of essentials because the UN and the whole media is pushing the
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.600]  Psyop people ask me well why are you joining it I'm not I'm saying it's a
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.520]  Psyop wave get ready for it we don't know about the virus but now they're
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.200]  starting to be deaths now it's starting to spread and the way it was denied by
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.440]  the White House before will then create more hysteria when the media starts
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.400]  hyping the fear so I'm trying to figure out how to explain this as simply as
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.480]  possible here's Rush Limbaugh he's absolutely right about the media you
[26:46.480 --> 26:52.120]  just saw some of it salivating over the coronavirus here it is folks this
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.560]  coronavirus thing I want to try to put this in perspective for you it looks
[26:55.560 --> 27:02.880]  like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.640]  down Donald Trump now I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus what
[27:07.640 --> 27:10.560]  you you think I'm wrong about this you think I'm missing it by saying it's
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.160]  well you have dead right on this the coronavirus is is is the common cold
[27:15.160 --> 27:22.440]  folks the drive-by media hype of this thing as a pandemic as the andromeda
[27:22.440 --> 27:27.920]  strain as oh my god if you get it you're dead do you know what the I think the
[27:27.920 --> 27:37.080]  the the survival rate is 98% 98% of people get the coronavirus survive it's
[27:37.080 --> 27:43.480]  a it's a respiratory system virus it probably it is probably is a chai-com
[27:43.480 --> 27:49.520]  laboratory experiment that that is in the process of being weaponized so there
[27:49.520 --> 27:52.320]  he goes and tells you the Senate had a secret hearing last week we're gonna
[27:52.320 --> 27:56.240]  cover it they know what it is okay we'll tell you next hour Rush knows but he's
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.640]  trying to play down 2% dead the flu kills less than one tenth of 1% so this
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.840]  is a big deal but here's the control corporate media salivating over it we
[28:04.840 --> 28:11.840]  told you was coming a month ago here it is you're seeing in the way I kept
[28:11.840 --> 28:14.960]  thinking about here is that clearly this is a potentially huge problem for
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.160]  Donald Trump at the same time though do Democrats actually careful in how they
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.920]  use this sort of health emergency to attack the president well I think
[28:22.920 --> 28:27.720]  they're actually in pretty solid footing to go after the president on this
[28:27.720 --> 28:32.080]  mostly because there aren't heads at the CDC and the National Institutes of
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.320]  Health he's he's got funding there I really think that his lack of response
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.960]  Donald Trump's lack of response to getting in front of this looks very
[28:40.960 --> 28:43.920]  similar to what actually happened in China where you act like it's not a
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.400]  problem and then you respond quite late and then maybe you put a vice president
[28:48.400 --> 28:51.880]  Pence in charge who's not a medical doctor stay there I'm gonna come back with
[28:51.880 --> 28:58.960]  the rest of this folks this is a total setup we're proven right again I don't
[28:58.960 --> 29:05.360]  sell firearms but I promote them constantly now could somebody listen to
[29:05.360 --> 29:09.200]  me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong yeah just like I'm telling people

[33:46.040 --> 33:52.960]  up Delta Force and things like that but I'm not here bragging or tooting my
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.680]  horn when I tell you this I've always organically seen dialectic I've always
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.080]  seen the different factors coming together and what they're going to do
[34:03.080 --> 34:08.400]  they call that third-dimensional fourth-dimensional chess but that's just
[34:08.400 --> 34:12.120]  not seeing things straight on one-dimensional two-dimensional so a
[34:12.120 --> 34:15.520]  lot of times somebody will tell me a joke and I just don't even get it
[34:15.520 --> 34:22.960]  because I'm in a mode of not being into comedy I'll see it very literally that's
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.640]  because I'm taking in all the data but seeing a joke is a third-dimensional
[34:28.640 --> 34:38.040]  event it's why the brain likes it or a fourth-dimensional event or fifth is
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.320]  because it's fun to get something that doesn't make sense on a one-dimensional
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.160]  or two-dimensional level but then makes sense once you get it a riddle but see
[34:48.160 --> 34:56.480]  when I'm on data overload taking it all in little things I don't get big things
[34:56.480 --> 35:04.840]  I do and so I know you all get this and I'm not patronizing you're the audience
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.680]  that backed America's recovery this audience backed and drove the main
[35:09.680 --> 35:16.640]  engine of UKIP and Brexit and everything and Balasaro's son came on I remember
[35:16.640 --> 35:19.080]  when he told me they tried to get me down to Brazil and all that I never
[35:19.080 --> 35:22.160]  really even told the story of that because it sounds like bragging but at a
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.280]  certain point you to come on air and say you know info wars was the main
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.320]  heavy-lift booster that got the nationalist movement worldwide into
[35:31.320 --> 35:42.680]  orbit and I always believed it wouldn't be hard to do all you'd have to do is
[35:42.680 --> 35:48.040]  believe in freedom and bet on it let's see a lot of folks they don't do that so
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.480]  I'm just giving you the report card that we have victory it's like saying a team
[35:54.480 --> 35:57.840]  has won the Super Bowl two or three times and we've still got the same team
[35:57.840 --> 36:03.360]  and we're getting stronger so we've got a good prognosis to win if we just decide
[36:03.360 --> 36:11.760]  we can do it and more more I'm gonna get into the psychology of that but what
[36:11.760 --> 36:16.480]  the globalists are selling is death and his failure so let me get back into the
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.000]  coronavirus I don't say this again to ingratiate myself or to brag it
[36:23.000 --> 36:29.440]  actually scares the hell out of me and makes me think is this a video game I'm
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.440]  playing virtual reality and I'm the hero of it or something because it's just so
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.360]  over-the-top that we keep cracking the code over and over again and others
[36:38.360 --> 36:41.400]  aren't doing it instead of it being a power trip it scares the hell out of me
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.720]  and I say what happens if I get dying a car wreck or something with this great
[36:45.720 --> 36:51.120]  audience and the guests and the and the system we've created of this culture and
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.800]  the society of understanding it's precious to the future of the species so
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.400]  I thank you all for keeping us on the air it's just it's just so precious and
[36:59.400 --> 37:03.440]  and I don't even feel worthy to be here but let me just get back to the main
[37:03.440 --> 37:20.720]  state what I was gonna talk about it's so simple but nobody does it it's so easy
[37:20.720 --> 37:27.360]  but nobody does it when you see China locking down whole cities well some of
[37:27.360 --> 37:31.720]  them 18 million people a city and they locked down almost a billion people
[37:31.720 --> 37:36.840]  knowing it's gonna totally wreck the economy for years and it's gonna attack
[37:36.840 --> 37:40.680]  the world economy and probably bring it down and you see the news saying no
[37:40.680 --> 37:50.440]  problem no big deal you know we're not in Kansas anymore so of course I got on
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.160]  air over a month ago when China was starting to lock down major cities and
[37:54.160 --> 38:04.120]  I said this is either something out of a nightmare science fiction movie or it
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.600]  doesn't matter they're using it like that to attack the world economy people
[38:08.600 --> 38:17.320]  better button up and just like little birdies fly around the sky and fishy
[38:17.320 --> 38:22.240]  swimming the sea we're here over a month later and it's all unfolding and the
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.080]  Democrats are attacking Trump and America just like we predicted they
[38:27.080 --> 38:32.520]  would our first approximation that it's man-made it's been released to destroy
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.680]  the world economy by the chicoms and that they think the media can now gang up
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.560]  on Trump because it's not enough again to just kill the world economy and then
[38:41.560 --> 38:46.960]  just say it's Trump's fault and then he doesn't get reelected you've got to say
[38:46.960 --> 38:53.880]  that America didn't respond properly daring it to hang it on Trump and you
[38:53.880 --> 39:00.520]  can see the scripting and so I'm gonna tell you this is the maximum alert
[39:00.520 --> 39:04.440]  folks I don't know exactly what they're gonna pull next or what's going down but
[39:04.440 --> 39:07.360]  we said it a few weeks ago when they announced the first death hysteria will
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.960]  set in it was announced the morning yesterday talking to Mike Adams on the
[39:10.960 --> 39:14.480]  phone I go I bet Trump is a press conference before seatback happened
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.120]  just like we said and then once they announced the the the spread of it that
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.040]  was not brought in from somebody from outside the country which has now been
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.800]  announced today that oh just wait till what happens Monday morning in the
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.520]  stock market and it happened ladies and gentlemen and so the corporate media has
[39:34.520 --> 39:39.560]  tried politics to scare you they've tried race for to scare you they've tried
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.720]  gender war to scare you it didn't work so now they're gonna give you fear of the
[39:44.720 --> 39:51.480]  invisible and they're gonna do it with a virus that's a known engineered bio
[39:51.480 --> 39:58.360]  weapon how deadly it is we don't know that's been released knowing groups would
[39:58.360 --> 40:04.160]  come out and say it's man-made to create the fear so whether it's super deadly or
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.720]  not it is the assault and that's what Limbaugh said at the end of his take and
[40:09.720 --> 40:12.520]  you know he's talking to Trump and Pence and the Pentagon every day I mean
[40:12.520 --> 40:16.600]  Limbaugh's totally you know hooked up more than probably anybody in media he's
[40:16.600 --> 40:19.960]  like yeah it's a bio weapon got out of their lab but it's not big it only killed
[40:19.960 --> 40:25.920]  two percent of you the flu doesn't even kill one-tenth of one percent folks but
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.480]  see Limbaugh's getting you ready but well you know okay kills two percent of
[40:29.480 --> 40:36.160]  people you know what's two percent out of 350 million people yeah we can handle
[40:36.160 --> 40:44.320]  that it's but but but see the hype now just a few people die and it's oh my god
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.440]  see we're not feeding into that we want to get ahead of the whole thing and
[40:48.440 --> 40:52.840]  we're saying look at the pre-packaging look at the pre-programming look at the
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.840]  unification of governments look at the UN look at the lockdown of China it's
[40:56.840 --> 41:03.640]  this is it folks this is it and I don't think it's a virus but it doesn't matter
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.560]  you better get your guns and your ammunition and your food because most
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.920]  places run out of food in two days with this over-sitted economy half our
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.960]  products are from China and they shut down that puts us into a crisis because
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.280]  we're dependent gg ping doesn't care if they all start a death over there or have
[41:23.280 --> 41:29.080]  problems he's got control but you've already got the lines of people in
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.520]  Alabama and Texas and New York and California buying it all up and they're
[41:34.520 --> 41:45.040]  lapping it up are they bad no they've never seen almost a billion people in
[41:45.040 --> 41:55.120]  China totally locked down so I'll tell you again this is the next phase
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.120]  against Trump and I guarantee you the globalist got together and they said
[42:00.120 --> 42:02.840]  let's try to get him out with impeachment but that doesn't work we're
[42:02.840 --> 42:08.640]  gonna pull this virus hoax and they did it but it doesn't mean that the the
[42:08.640 --> 42:16.560]  crisis it causes isn't real this is totally real the virus clearly kills
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.120]  one or two percent probably more of people especially if you've already
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.000]  had pre-existing conditions that's that's super bad news you don't want but
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.680]  the over hyping and the unification of everything and I keep repeating this
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.680]  shows us this is the big one folks not because of the virus but the corporate
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.360]  globalist media the chai comms they're all behind it it's a Democrats licking
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.440]  their lips openly thinking you're so dumb that they're saying we hope it takes
[42:41.440 --> 42:45.800]  out Trump and the nationalist so I back the president a hundred percent but we
[42:45.800 --> 42:50.880]  charted more than anybody else exactly what was coming down because we are the
[42:50.880 --> 42:56.080]  zeitgeist we are plugged in we're on our knees before God wanting the
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.280]  transmission it's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.640]  preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales not just here but
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.800]  across the world that's good people need to be self-sufficient the average

[44:08.760 --> 44:12.680]  president they're trying to silence free speech they're trying to trigger riots

[46:06.480 --> 46:11.880]  for me it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and I had long
[46:11.880 --> 46:14.560]  discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different
[46:14.560 --> 46:18.040]  individuals at different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.000]  the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.720]  aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the biggest food
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.280]  company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having
[46:30.280 --> 46:34.160]  discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at
[46:34.160 --> 46:37.360]  a certain point just saying we're done because people are gonna take food orders
[46:37.360 --> 46:40.920]  out ten weeks we don't want to sit on your money ten weeks and then just all
[46:40.920 --> 46:44.080]  the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under promise over
[46:44.080 --> 46:47.120]  delivered but technically it's gonna be six to eight weeks and we want you to get
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.520]  a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again we want
[46:50.520 --> 46:53.680]  relationships with you we're not Satanist we're the opposite we don't

[46:57.240 --> 47:00.320]  we're all in this together
[47:01.080 --> 47:06.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.480]  I probably should have said right up front that the UN put it up for the highest
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.040]  level of global pandemic yesterday they found the first you know deaths in the
[47:25.040 --> 47:32.080]  US from the coronavirus first death other countries and they're announcing
[47:32.080 --> 47:36.600]  the first spread of it by people that weren't originally flown to the US under
[47:36.600 --> 47:43.800]  countries and it's all totally concerted from Australia Indonesia the US it's all
[47:43.800 --> 47:51.360]  the globalist it's all scripted it's all synthetic this is a major attack do I
[47:51.360 --> 47:58.920]  know exactly what their next move is I think I know but I'm not authorized by
[47:58.920 --> 48:04.440]  my spirit to release it until it begins to unfold my gut my analysis what we're
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.320]  dead on folks I keep saying that we're dead on we told you it was man-made out
[48:09.320 --> 48:13.960]  of the Wuhan bio weapons lab that's now Senate Intelligence Committee meetings
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.320]  last week that's now Russian limbaugh he talks to president daily they're big
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.160]  buddies and I get why Trump wants to play this down he sees the UN hype he
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.480]  sees the globalist he sees them want to take down our economy he knows China
[48:26.480 --> 48:29.600]  lost the trade war they launched against their own people to lock stuff down have
[48:29.600 --> 48:34.800]  a reset have a communist clamp down it'll show us what they do to our economy
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.800]  they believe is fragile maybe the president's right to play it down we
[48:40.800 --> 48:46.160]  shouldn't get caught up in that our job is the Oracle of Info Wars that means
[48:46.160 --> 48:49.720]  you the callers and the guests all of us the people the real-town square the
[48:49.720 --> 48:54.880]  brain storm these people used to get together in the tribe and like I have
[48:54.880 --> 48:59.280]  hours of days when you know what to do like I just got the answer that's what
[48:59.280 --> 49:03.360]  this is this is unfiltered not globalist academics giving us answers down off
[49:03.360 --> 49:10.280]  mountains but us together sussing and out they don't like this and have you
[49:10.280 --> 49:15.320]  really pulled back this is deathly obvious the chai comms have covered up
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.520]  all sorts of deadly outbreaks my god they've got human animal clones for 20
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.840]  years 20 years ago or more they had cows with human utters that produced baby
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.720]  milk for their stores that's like on TV over there on the news like King Wong
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.720]  King Wong you know and you translate and shows the cows we have high quality
[49:33.720 --> 49:39.800]  human milk from cow you love it I mean I saw like 18 years ago I was like on
[49:39.800 --> 49:45.160]  Chinese news sites like what I tell listeners hey look here they are yeah
[49:45.160 --> 49:52.400]  there it is cows turn out human breast milk was that New York Times that's nine
[49:52.400 --> 50:00.920]  years ago I said you can't make this up scientists are making human monkey
[50:00.920 --> 50:11.280]  hybrids in China the point is in the programming in the packaging in the
[50:11.280 --> 50:17.800]  rollout in the brainwashing you know the operation and as soon as I saw China
[50:17.800 --> 50:23.640]  locked down whole cities knowing it would devastate their economy I said if it
[50:23.640 --> 50:29.520]  was real they'd cover it up you could see the fakeness not that people being
[50:29.520 --> 50:32.920]  wielded the hospitals were fake but the way they did it the cameras and all of
[50:32.920 --> 50:37.480]  it was they were exacerbating it the order had gone out is create global
[50:37.480 --> 50:40.400]  hysteria because they're an authoritarian society they believe you
[50:40.400 --> 50:44.840]  keep control but they know we've got 70 million 80 million people on welfare on
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.920]  on food stamps they know Bernie's promising everything free they know the
[50:48.920 --> 50:53.000]  left's ready to burn down US cities they know that when everybody thinks we're
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.440]  gonna have a lockdown here for cases it will create
[50:58.760 --> 51:10.040]  zero confidence so let let it be known now and let it be a clear 150,000% this
[51:10.040 --> 51:19.680]  is 100% an economic attack on America and it's synthetic and it's fake and
[51:19.680 --> 51:23.280]  it's man-made to scare the hell out of us show that when it came out it was
[51:23.280 --> 51:29.520]  man-made we get really concerned it probably kills 10% of people that are
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.320]  old they're saying or have big pre-existing conditions that's terrible
[51:33.320 --> 51:38.000]  it's killing over 1% of those that are healthy it's a really nasty virus you
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.600]  don't want it but the hysteria around it and the way the unified media pushed it
[51:44.600 --> 51:50.400]  shows you it's the big move and I'm not gonna second guess the president here I
[51:50.400 --> 51:57.160]  respect the president and he's proving himself smarter than me many a time all
[51:57.160 --> 52:01.400]  I know is I'm gonna tell you the truth as a beacon of that and I've got hundreds
[52:01.400 --> 52:07.280]  of articles clips out the wazoo I just keep repeating the same thing China
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.520]  wouldn't shut down all their major cities and do all this if they weren't
[52:11.520 --> 52:16.720]  planning something big whether the virus is as deadly as they say or not the
[52:16.720 --> 52:24.040]  this is the big move ladies and gentlemen and when the Democrats just like
[52:24.040 --> 52:28.520]  we predicted if it was a bio weapon to shut down the Western economy would come
[52:28.520 --> 52:32.360]  out and blame Trump and would say he covered it up when he was advised to do
[52:32.360 --> 52:37.120]  that by the very folks that are covering it up then we know it's the big move and
[52:37.120 --> 52:41.760]  the next attack on Trump and this is it and just like I said five weeks ago
[52:41.760 --> 52:46.480]  Trump I said if you don't stop them and arrest them now sir they may set a new
[52:46.480 --> 52:49.680]  cough or at least a bio weapon I don't have the crew to go find it all you all
[52:49.680 --> 52:59.360]  heard me say it because I've war game this out just like you have so I'm not
[52:59.360 --> 53:03.480]  I'm not even concerned or scared now because this is so real you know how a
[53:03.480 --> 53:06.480]  fight works you go out there the bullies waiting for you you don't want to get in
[53:06.480 --> 53:10.360]  the fight you're kind of but you're not gonna back down and as soon as he takes
[53:10.360 --> 53:14.320]  a swing or even connects you're like you know what let's turn it on beat your
[53:14.320 --> 53:18.640]  ass in the ground you know you a little too far kick the brains out that's what
[53:18.640 --> 53:23.440]  you asked for so I'm now metaphysically have entered the point of no fear or no
[53:23.440 --> 53:27.640]  concern anymore that tells me we're in war mode ladies and gentlemen my spirit
[53:27.640 --> 53:32.560]  is gone they're not giving a damn and that tells me my spiritual radar says
[53:32.560 --> 53:36.400]  this is the big move so we better start debating what the president should do
[53:36.400 --> 53:40.520]  we should stop speculating we know it's man-made by a weapon transferred to
[53:40.520 --> 53:44.560]  Obama to China waiting to be released in the future of need be as a martial law
[53:44.560 --> 53:48.280]  takeover of China to reset the global economy credit global crisis we have a
[53:48.280 --> 53:52.880]  global solution to then attack Western open governments that the left push for
[53:52.880 --> 53:56.600]  claiming openness is a problem now we're gonna have closed societies that run by
[53:56.600 --> 54:02.960]  the UN and that is the permutation analysis of their operation in the ghost
[54:02.960 --> 54:08.600]  cities and all the fear they showed people to get them ready does the virus
[54:08.600 --> 54:17.120]  kill point 10% or 2% or 15% that is it the question now we'll find out this is
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.080]  the attack this is their move this is why they didn't want to song the air
[54:21.080 --> 54:27.520]  during this period but we're still here thanks for your support now I've got the
[54:27.520 --> 54:32.800]  president and I've got his son and I've got all the things they have to say but
[54:32.800 --> 54:37.520]  I want to air this ghostly video and audio for radio listeners that we aired
[54:37.520 --> 54:42.840]  last week of Wuhan at night with the city shut down at that point for over two
[54:42.840 --> 54:47.760]  and a half three weeks with people wailing and crying welded and boarded
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.840]  in with steel to their buildings at night the ghostly sounds of begging and
[54:52.840 --> 54:56.680]  pleading of old people not being taken care of of young people of people that
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.280]  have died you can lock up buildings and have no police you're gonna have a
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.600]  breakdown all meant to scare you and make this real when they pointed at
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.200]  America the Chinese would sit in wave attacks in Vietnam they were helping the
[55:10.200 --> 55:14.120]  Vietnamese and especially in Korea and the Russians were there too but in in
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.840]  Korea they were sitting in these wave attacks of millions they didn't care and
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.400]  so this is the same thing we saw in Korea again where they're using a real
[55:23.400 --> 55:26.440]  lockdown and a real thing and they're probably poisoning them who knows what
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.240]  they're doing but the point is this is real what's happening and this is the
[55:30.240 --> 55:56.680]  big attack on the global economy here's the ghostly video
[55:56.680 --> 56:03.560]  wailing begging starving dying weeks into no food a huge chai comedy
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.200]  population off you know they would ever do that oh really they killed 400
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.080]  million children some of which after they were born most of the girls China is a
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.760]  giant satanic experiment you want to know what a
[56:18.760 --> 56:27.160]  Hieronymus Bosch painting from Middle Ages would look like writ large in reality back
[56:27.160 --> 56:31.440]  that up listen to that and you can hear the chai comms giggling and laughing
[56:31.440 --> 56:37.360]  with the mobile execution fans so they've got a billion 400 million people
[56:37.360 --> 56:40.840]  they've been given the green light do whatever you want to them millions in
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.920]  death camps Christians Buddhist Muslims you name it and now you hear the
[56:46.920 --> 56:51.240]  begging and the bleeding and the starving at night and then we see this
[56:51.240 --> 56:58.200]  and go hey you better get ready they'll go oh wait it's a hoax no the unified
[56:58.200 --> 57:06.040]  propaganda hysteria is the attack it's a scion is the virus super deadly we
[57:06.040 --> 57:09.600]  don't know Mike Adams is coming up with the latest information but this is a
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.800]  trap for President Trump and we're on air literally because of you and and I
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.040]  believe in God's plan so tell everyone you know to tune in now to info wars
[57:18.040 --> 57:22.240]  dot com forward slash show to bandot video the live feeds and share it via

[57:34.680 --> 57:39.400]  is their next move against America this is World War four this is the scion this
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.800]  is why we were born and destined to be here on air tonight on March 1st stay
[57:43.800 --> 57:52.360]  with us we always promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.440]  and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden I mean it's
[57:56.440 --> 57:59.720]  just what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do so high
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.040]  quality swarble food I told my Patriot a month ago I said what can you handle I
[58:04.040 --> 58:06.360]  said I think it's gonna be really big and they said we can handle probably this
[58:06.360 --> 58:09.080]  we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be
[58:09.080 --> 58:11.600]  able to fund I said no I think this is gonna be huge that you should spend
[58:11.600 --> 58:14.400]  everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are
[58:14.400 --> 58:16.840]  going up for you so those the types of discussions we have I'm just giving the
[58:16.840 --> 58:21.600]  insight baseball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a
[58:21.600 --> 58:25.360]  hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay an info or store
[58:25.360 --> 58:28.960]  com you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.160]  orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying I mean this is just insane
[58:33.160 --> 58:37.080]  we're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it
[58:37.080 --> 58:40.800]  continues like this we're looking at having to suspend good cells but
[58:40.800 --> 58:44.440]  everybody gets the order in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so
[58:44.440 --> 58:46.920]  what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on
[58:46.920 --> 58:53.640]  info or store.com there can no longer be any doubt this coronavirus is
[58:53.640 --> 58:58.720]  serious on multiple levels it's very communicable it spreads very very fast
[58:58.720 --> 59:03.240]  it is killing a lot of people and the Chinese Communist government has
[59:03.240 --> 59:07.280]  covered up just how bad it is and the Lighthouse is now openly challenging
[59:07.280 --> 59:13.560]  them show our Trump's top scientist and so is Senator Cotton. My friends now is
[59:13.560 --> 59:19.600]  the time to get prepared 2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.880]  are trying to create economic collapse race riots we don't know how bad this
[59:23.880 --> 59:28.120]  virus is gonna get here that's why listeners to info wars need to be
[59:28.120 --> 59:33.800]  prepared and infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and

[1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:19.000]  all right I have all these other huge stories and I'm just disregarding them
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.960]  all for the coronavirus because I always follow my intellect I always follow
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:32.320]  my gut and this coronavirus is the big the hype around it the unified
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:36.680]  propaganda the globalist response lets you know it's big whether the virus is
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:42.160]  big or not it doesn't matter this is a plan to discredit Trump and to kill the
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:46.000]  global economy this is the chai-kong and globalist strike back and that's now
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:52.560]  confirmed I mean I don't have the staff to go back but you all watched it when
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:56.320]  we were on air the last five weeks saying when it hits here the Democrats
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.640]  are gonna blame Trump and they're gonna say it wasn't a good response while the
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:04.160]  CDC tries to cover up what's happening it's it's two plus two equals four type
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.720]  stuff and I know a lot of listeners are like Alex you were you repeated the last
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:14.960]  hour stuff probably ten times because when we're in this type of mode I just go
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:17.840]  into knowing there's new listeners on radio stations and TV stations every
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:23.320]  few seconds I just want them to get that point and I want the White House to get
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:28.880]  that point so Mike Adams has been again the tip of the spear of this entire
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.760]  thing he's laid out how they're planning to blame Trump for a month so if we and
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:41.800]  now it's that sickening feeling again of being right over and over again but
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:45.760]  that's why they want to stop air again I don't sit up here and go oh look I was
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:49.560]  right again like I'm happy
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:58.200]  everybody else are followers you know who I have on air people that are free
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:03.040]  men and women that are independent and there's a lot of them and I wish more of
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:08.480]  them had big forums because I'm not up here trying to be the big swinging dick
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:14.160]  I want freedom for my children I want warriors and people that'll tell the
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:18.400]  truth and people that have a sense of the universe and a sixth sense to connect
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.600]  to God because I sit here and watch this and it's always clear and we're
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:27.080]  basically always right few times they'd like oh Jones you heard somebody's
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:31.160]  feeling say we're wrong turns out we were right about that but it's not me it's
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:36.000]  discernment that God's given us the good brain God gave us and to be immersed in
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.320]  this most people got to go to work at a school or a DMV or a factory or an auto
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.560]  parts place or wherever and I get it you know what you're doing there and you
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:47.640]  know when a customer calls in is gonna run a scam on you and you know when a
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:53.040]  mom comes in there with three or four kids and just needs a good deal well I
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:03:01.840]  know how the world works and this is all I do and I can tell you that this is
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:08.200]  the big one and my frustration repeat this every segment is that summer and I
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:12.800]  get they're gonna tap me regardless what I say but I will get the straight any
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:21.800]  angle you look at this virus any angle you look at when you watch China lock
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:26.600]  down almost a billion people you know that's gonna kill the global economy
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:30.840]  that right there is just so seismic and just you know Godzilla's in a movie
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:40.680]  tearing up Tokyo this is Godzilla all over the planet and I get Trump is in a
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:46.000]  Godzilla fight here and he just wants to play it down and I understand that but
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.480]  see that's the trap when he plays it down the media is gonna say he covered it
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:57.800]  up there only fear as he plays it up and uses it for control like Xi Jinping has
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:01.720]  done and that's why Bill Mars said I think Trump will try to declare martial
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.600]  law with this because that's what they want to do when Trump doesn't act and
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:11.720]  they're afraid Trump may grab it from them at the last minute and by the way I
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:16.640]  don't want martial law with all the bureaucrats that are under Trump even
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:18.880]  though he didn't try to put bureaucrats in I don't want to turn them all in the
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:23.960]  little demigods I'm just saying this is the world we've entered so do you want
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:29.920]  Nancy Pelosi and the chai comms have martial law or do you want Trump to
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:38.320]  because that's the wheelhouse we've now entered and Trump's fighting to stop the
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:43.640]  martial law but they're saying he wants it because they're scared not a martial
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:52.480]  law but an executive command what would George Washington do Mike Adams straight
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:59.520]  ahead it's really smart to get high quality

[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:21.280]  Alex Jones well if you ever wanted to know what the first world war looked
[1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:27.040]  like you can go back and look at history or the second world war or what the CIA
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:32.240]  and others called the third world war the Cold War but now you get to
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:40.360]  experience the fourth world war it's economic it's psychological the
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:45.720]  communist Chinese were set up in 1949 by the CIA the nationalist Shanghai
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.280]  Shek was thrown out and since it was built up as a corporate communist
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:54.800]  bulwark to take over the planet well the last minute Trump took over and
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.360]  populist got elected and we said no to the trade war China been having for 50
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:04.240]  years and we'd won that war but then a bio weapon sold in 2015 by Obama the
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:07.560]  North Carolina University of China got released and scientists looked at it and
[1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:11.840]  said it's a bio weapon and it killed quite a few people but the virus isn't
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:16.880]  the issue the hype the fear the media saying it's the end of the world we
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:20.760]  predicted a month ago they would blame Trump for this they would say that oh
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:23.680]  because he played it down and didn't want to kill the stock market that he's
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:27.720]  the reason it's here well last hour I played a bunch of clips of them saying
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:32.560]  just that hoping the virus brings down on economy to stop America and Trump but
[1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:37.520]  also saying it's his fault as if we're idiots so Mike Adams of naturalnews.com
[1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:42.120]  researchers scientists owns a major testing facility author has been
[1:07:42.120 --> 1:07:47.120]  chronicling this and we talked the last few days we said there's this
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:56.560]  dichotomy this this this bipolar system where they either say that there's
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:04.440]  nothing going on with the virus and it's a hoax or it's the end of the world no
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:09.720]  the virus is man-made we know that it has killed some people it does spread
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:13.160]  fast it is engineer that's why I gotta be concerned because we don't know it's
[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:16.960]  an unknown quantity there's been a cover-up we know that deep state trying
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:22.720]  to set Trump up that's all confirmed to that isn't the issue the media's
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:28.920]  unification day one five weeks ago the UN's unification saying China's doing
[1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:32.440]  good mowing people down with machine guns at checkpoints but if US tries to
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:37.040]  block planes coming here we're bad let us know we were the target and info wars
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:42.520]  and Mike Adams we raised the alarm in the head of the US biological weapons
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:47.160]  law and treaty he came on and said that and it's all been confirmed limbaugh
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:50.480]  says oh it's man-made but don't worry about it I'm not attacking limbaugh I get
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.360]  he's just saying oh don't don't hype it up it's you know it no no no admit it's
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:01.400]  bad and admit it's hyped up and admit the Democrats openly came out and
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.000]  promoted it would bring down America if we just get on the offense with this it's
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.600]  over but if we're on the defense and listen to globalist agents inside the
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:15.340]  CDC and the National Institutes of Health well then this could be the
[1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:21.240]  garot that chokes America and Trump to death Mike Adams lay it out for us well
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.800]  well thanks for having me on the show Alex first of all when Democrats
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:28.720]  criticize Trump over his handling of this their criticism is completely
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:33.120]  illegitimate because they're coming from a place of falsehoods and a history of
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:37.760]  other hoaxes and they do not have the best interests of America in mind now
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:41.760]  when you or I temporarily criticize President Trump and I have been very
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.200]  critical of his handling it's only to warn him it's only to warn him and to
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:50.040]  hope that he can maybe get better advisors and get better people around
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:55.520]  him but the big story here is that there is I believe and I've said this for
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:00.480]  weeks there is a deliberate effort by the CDC to withhold testing in the United
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:04.000]  States that has happened for weeks a deliberate effort by people in the
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.720]  Homeland Security and the State Department to spread the infection to
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:12.200]  to deliberately spread the infection in America and and by the way by the way you
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:16.840]  said that three three four weeks ago that's all confirmed now yes well right
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:19.960]  because if you put infected people with non-infected people on an airplane and
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:25.440]  fly them back to America as happened from from Japan by a decision of a State
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:30.120]  Department employee no against Trump I mean they've literally been in the UN
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:34.800]  says Trump don't don't like a three weeks ago don't stop flights and then the
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:39.400]  State Department says screw Trump bring them in it's it's deliberate and when
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:44.360]  you have federal employees who are interacting with isolation quarantine
[1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:48.840]  patients at Travis Air Force Base in California and they are given training
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:52.720]  five days after they had the interaction and they are not given
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:56.720]  personal protective equipment IE PPE is what it's called and then you have
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:00.680]  community outbreaks just outside Travis Air Force Base and that woman now
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:05.200]  infecting staff and doctors in two hospitals in California Alex that is
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:10.760]  not an accident it is deliberate it is sabotage and I've been saying that for
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.480]  a month now it's confirmed they're now blaming Trump as you predict that they
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:20.120]  would do well exactly exactly right and and and by the way the argument of
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:23.920]  conservatives who are saying that now anybody who believes the virus is a
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.480]  pandemic or anybody who criticizes Trump is now anti-America or hates Trump or
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:33.640]  is trying to bring Trump down that is a logical fallacy the virus doesn't play
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:39.120]  politics we don't want Trump up China didn't shut down all its major cities and
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.840]  do this on a joke they're doing it as an attack on us with the media we
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:48.280]  predicted within attack as has now happened well exactly and and you
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:52.520]  mentioned Russia I'll bring this up okay rush says is only a 2% mortality rate
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:57.560]  well if you infect half of America which is pretty typical for a flu 2% comes
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:02.800]  out to roughly 3.3 million dead Americans so rush essentially just
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:05.960]  admitted there could be millions of deaths in America clear which is a
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.880]  hundred times larger than the flu and let's be clear we don't want that to
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:13.640]  happen it's terrible the media is gonna hype the living hell out of that after
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.120]  rush and everybody was conned into saying it's not an issue when it's a
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:24.000]  chai-com weapon Obama sold them we have their ass if Trump and Obama if Trump
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.680]  would just go after Obama for this it's over that's right that if Trump would
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:33.360]  talk about the origins of the virus yes fire top people at the CDC expose the
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:37.200]  CDC's withholding of the diagnostic test kits which again I believe is
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:41.400]  deliberate it have a day I'm gonna hold over to the CDC look like this let me
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:44.120]  just say this because you're absolutely right now I'm gonna let you just host
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.920]  next time because I'm gonna rub this make me so man we predicted it we showed it
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:51.280]  we were on target you're absolutely right they held back the kids they're
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:54.720]  setting the president up the deep states already screaming over and over again
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:57.840]  and they would this time they're doing it through a virus working with the
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:02.480]  chai-coms Mike it's so obvious that it's not debatable this is what's
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:07.160]  happening so what do we do well one more important point the Institute for
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:10.840]  Disease Modeling did a study this is up on zero hedge right now I haven't had a
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:15.520]  chance to cover it yet the virus has a known mutation rate by looking at
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:19.360]  mutations in different people you can actually calculate a timeline of how
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:23.560]  long the virus has been spreading in a certain area according to that study
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:29.200]  which was just published this virus has now spread to an estimated 1,500 people
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:33.560]  in Washington state and it has been replicating for six weeks so that's
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:37.920]  that study and it's extremely important understand this people geneticists can
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:42.280]  actually study how long the virus has been around there it is on
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:46.600]  headline scientists discover HIV like mutation yeah it was added to it it's
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:49.840]  engineered which makes coronavirus extremely infectious what again
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:54.680]  explain what that means to people that is so huge well the key point here is
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:59.400]  that by delaying the testing kits the CDC has allowed the virus to replicate by
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:04.000]  a factor of about a thousand so if the test kits were available early on they
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.400]  could have stopped early so they could have stopped it early they would have
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:10.960]  had what they called the intelligence or the surveillance of the disease they
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.240]  would have been able to lock down the very small pockets and prevent those
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:18.320]  from going big now it's already gone big by my estimation Alex there are
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.760]  between five and ten thousand infections in America right now but most of them
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:26.080]  haven't yet been diagnosed the labs have only been given permission to be
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:30.200]  turned on starting tomorrow in most cases and it's going to take two weeks to
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:34.160]  ramp up the public health labs at the state level across the country two
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:38.600]  weeks from now we'll have a total capacity according to Dr. Fauci of about
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:43.720]  ten thousand tests per day nationwide so we're going from zero essentially zero
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:48.560]  to ten thousand per day over the next two weeks how many confirmed cases will
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:53.320]  we see well it's very easy to actually predict that we're going to see tens of
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.440]  cases throughout the coming week and then dozens of cases in the week
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:15:01.320]  following and by the way my notes as soon as Trump doubled down and said it
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:05.440]  doesn't exist it's not a problem that they go oh now we're able to give test
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:09.480]  out that's right credit and he's being set up by the bureaucracy whether the
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:14.200]  virus is super deadly or not now this is about and the media can't help it
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:17.680]  they're sitting like oh Trump screwed he covered it up he said it wasn't a
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:23.480]  problem their pre-programming shows us the setup well that's right and even the
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:27.160]  advice they're giving him like oh have enhanced airport screening well we
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:31.160]  already know that airport screening misses 75 to 80% of infected patients
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:35.640]  because of the asymptomatic incubation period so airport screening not very
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.440]  effective actually there are only two things that work here I know we got to go
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:41.920]  break we'll cover them on the other side then yeah let's talk about this because
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:47.080]  folks there's now no longer any doubt the deep state is behind this it's man-made
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:51.720]  they're making a move on Trump and Trump so far has made the wrong moves maybe he's
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:58.000]  got some 3d chess we'll talk about it straight ahead Alex Jones here with two

[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:19.440]  team at Info Wars and we are all a team ladies and gentlemen so right now
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.880]  humanity's awakening is explosive it's powerful it's incredible but there's
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:28.240]  major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:32.480]  the NWO and stay in the game on Info Wars is to the spirit is your financial
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:36.600]  support we make it really easy at infowarsstore.com but I am blowing
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:41.840]  through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:45.520]  ever have because they volunteered to do it and Owen and the rest of crew will
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:50.240]  fight 18 hours a day seven days a week during a selection year that's so critical
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:55.000]  but they need the financing to put them in the field go to infowarsstore.com and
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.360]  fight for your own future I want to talk about super silver whitening
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:01.600]  toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.960]  half and I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried he's
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:08.640]  like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.680]  there and tell people and oh so here I am telling people super silver whitening
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:18.800]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:23.120]  I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free I think the big
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:26.920]  difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush
[1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:31.120]  my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:35.600]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:40.120]  like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact I brought
[1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:44.680]  I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:49.200]  a day now because I like the way it feels
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:20:05.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:23.280]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:30.080]  listening to Alex Jones all right at bandot video and info wars dot com and
[1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:33.760]  news wars dot com where we're covering all this on radio station TV stations
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:37.400]  across the country and my cat is a really smart guy I really respect him and I
[1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.840]  was interrupting him constantly during the last break because I want to call
[1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:46.320]  myself hysterical but our analysis in brainstorm and the callers and the
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:52.560]  guest and the top lawyer and scientist that wrote the US biological weapons
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.800]  tree that became world law have all said for over a month it's man-made major
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:01.920]  Indian universities other scientific facilities have looked at they go my god
[1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:06.120]  it's man-made well of course we're concerned about that so where'd it come
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:13.800]  from in China now even the Pentagon says it's man-made but what if it's really
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:19.120]  nothing well the media hysteria to attack the stock market is what's real
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:22.560]  and what's happened to start market is real a 15-point loss and what's gonna
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:26.560]  happen tomorrow so Mike I interrupted a lot in this segment you've got the floor
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:29.600]  you bring up a kind of the past points and I know that's important to set the
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:35.440]  table but currently just pulling back from this when the Democrats I played
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:40.400]  this last hour openly say it's Trump's fault it's deadly this will bring down
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:46.640]  the economy hooray there's so many pieces to that that they would say they
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:50.320]  hope it's real and kills a bunch of people they'd hope to hurt the economy
[1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:55.640]  that right there should discredit them but they just move forward so on the
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:22:01.520]  first day of March 2020 there's so much breaking so much happening this is the
[1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:05.040]  big one regardless they're making their move with it we're not even saying the
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:11.360]  virus is super deadly but clearly the media hype that the the EU hype the
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:14.880]  what the chai comms have done they're planning something big with this what
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:19.440]  do you think it is well there's a second trap that they can initiate and all
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:23.160]  this the first trap was to allow the virus to spread deliberately and then
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:27.080]  blame Trump that trap has been sprung and the narrative has already been
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:32.040]  launched the second trap is even bigger they know that there there are going to
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:36.280]  be quarantines of communities and perhaps cities across America and those
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:40.880]  quarantines will most likely be liberal cities where you have the most filth the
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:45.240]  most homelessness and so on and the highest population density it will be
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:49.080]  the Democrats mark my words Alex it'll be the Democrats calling for
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:54.200]  suspending the elections in November because not enough Democrats will be
[1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:58.800]  able to participate because they will be under quarantine if Trump suspends the
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:03.720]  elections then the Democrats or if Trump is able to I mean you might have to have
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.960]  a lot of other people going along with it perhaps a Supreme Court perhaps the
[1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:10.640]  Senate who knows but if he's able to achieve that then the Democrats will
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:15.240]  say oh my gosh he's a dictator now he's just declared himself a dictator and
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.680]  they will use that to launch the the big violent revolution that they've been
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:25.240]  talking about for years so they are going to try to cancel the elections you
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:30.800]  could say as this virus pandemic explodes but they'll try to get Trump to do
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:34.440]  it so they can blame Trump for now being a dictator so that's the second trap
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:40.040]  they're trying to spring the third trap is the preparedness trap so the way to
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:44.840]  counter this virus is for people to get prepared for it with common sense things
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:48.880]  doesn't mean you have to panic but it's not panicking to have a 30-day food
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:52.840]  supply in case you are ordered into a 30-day quarantine right it's just
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:57.400]  common sense so people need to be prepared especially in big cities to
[1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:02.320]  survive in their own apartments or homes for 30 days with no outside supplies
[1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:08.880]  that's common sense that's not a panic but the liberal media will make sure that
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:13.720]  preparedness is seen as something that's bad in fact even some of some Trump
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:17.400]  officials such as the Surgeon General out there screaming that people should
[1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:21.680]  stop buying masks and then others from the CDC and Homeland Security and so on
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:25.720]  screaming about oh don't buy food don't buy anything you shouldn't even have
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:31.680]  cleaning supplies I mean Alex ready.gov even recommends a three-day supply so
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:36.400]  now is a three-day supply evil is it wrong to be prepared and and every other
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:40.680]  country in the world is telling its citizens yes wear a mask have gloves
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:45.840]  have hand sanitizers sanitize surfaces that you touch be ready to isolate in
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:49.040]  your home if that's the situation it's called for and it has in Italy and
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:54.520]  Korea and all over the place that's common sense and then for Trump to state
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:59.040]  that America is the most ready nation in the world when we didn't have any test
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.440]  kits and when the information coming out of Trump advisors is do not prepare
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:07.960]  that's where I find a lot of fault currently with the president and I'm
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:11.840]  hoping he'll correct that so you're right definitely the Democrats are already
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:15.200]  using it I was talking a few days ago you said oh my god they're gonna use this
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:21.160]  now they are today yeah yeah exactly and and by the way the economic impacts
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.560]  that we are going to suffer here as America those are beyond our control so
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:30.480]  even if Trump did everything right and even if we totally contained it in
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.240]  America and had very few outbreaks the economic wave of bankruptcies the
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:40.080]  supply chain Armageddon as it's called that's coming will hit America
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:44.280]  economically in ways that very few people are currently projecting because
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:48.080]  let's pull back from that we're not talking about a virus now the hype
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:53.120]  whether it's fake whatever it is has now devastated the Chinese economy and the
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:56.440]  shock waves are now going out that's in all the financial reports it's confirmed
[1:25:56.440 --> 1:26:00.560]  so explain that to people well let me give you an example I have a family
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:04.840]  member who runs a big auto dealership and I talked to him on the phone a couple
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:10.960]  days ago and he said hey we've got 30 luxury vans made in America that we can't
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.960]  sell because they're under recall from the manufacturer and the recall part is
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:19.280]  a circuit board that controls the automatic transmission and the circuit
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:23.800]  board uses components made in Wuhan China so you have all over the country
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:27.440]  probably I don't know hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory of
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:31.760]  different things aircraft telecom gear vehicles things that are sitting there
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.480]  wasting money can't be sold can't be used because there's one part an entire
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:41.480]  vehicle can come down to one part out of China and that part may be months away
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:45.280]  in fact my family member told me they're trying to now resource it through
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.480]  Mexico so they have to send the the electronic schematics to a Mexican a
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:55.160]  component manufacturer and start from scratch that was in the news two weeks
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:27:01.640]  ago it was like Reuters we pull it up guys you can German auto industry might
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:07.280]  have 50% reduction in sales over Wuhan virus and it was just it was pointing
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:11.560]  just out that very point well and in Korea they've already shut down a
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:17.400]  couple of car manufacturers and there are Samsung smartphone manufacturing is
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:22.000]  of course heavily disrupted at this point so regardless whether it's super
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.160]  bad or not the hysteria over it what China did to create this hysteria is
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.920]  huge it looked like they were trying to hype the hysteria Mike clearly as a
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:36.280]  weapon not just to reset there but to show the US how dependent we are on
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:39.280]  them because if they just shut their economy down to show us their people
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:43.080]  would get pissed they'd be the villain but if it's a virus that does it I think
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:47.120]  this is China striking back whether the virus is super deadly or not I think
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.520]  it's very clear this is China striking back well there may be an element of
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:57.140]  that to the big picture plan but there's no question that China's economy
[1:27:57.140 --> 1:28:01.400]  will be devastated even after they recover because every nation in the
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:06.040]  world is now thinking about sourcing somewhere else and having exactly
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:10.160]  shutting down all your major cities in the number one industrial system in the
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:14.800]  world is a big deal forget how much there's forget the ball he's great
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:19.040]  he's you know he's a he's right looks like hypo the virus doesn't matter the
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:23.160]  response and what the public did about it and the media saying it's the end of
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:28.200]  the world this is economically a hydrogen bomb well well right and there
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:31.560]  are other issues that that he hasn't even addressed such as what happens when
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:34.360]  all the hospital beds get full in America if you've got a hundred million
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:37.800]  people who are sick all at the same time and you've got only 200,000 plus
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:41.160]  hospital beds you can start to do the math and figure out what happens people
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:47.680]  get set at 2% of the US population dying is like 5 million people it's
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:52.020]  three point roughly 3.3 million people dead if that's the number well 2% you
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:55.640]  got yeah we'll talk about when we come back
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.120]  everybody needs food I'm proud we're selling high quality food elections
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:03.240]  globalism the economy the bubble this is something you need on your checklist
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:08.040]  to have done but for me it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:11.760]  and I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:14.800]  different individuals at different levels of this right now the folks run the
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:18.480]  plants to get the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:22.640]  just so people aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:27.240]  biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:30.560]  were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales
[1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:33.840]  next week and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:37.280]  going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:39.800]  weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:43.440]  honest under promise over delivered but technically it's gonna be six to eight
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:46.840]  weeks we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:50.360]  come back again we want relationships with you we're not satanist we're the
[1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:53.840]  opposite we don't screw people over we believe in Jesus Christ and we've been
[1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:57.800]  blessed by you we're all in this together
[1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:04.240]  Al killer in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead Alex hey I just want to say
[1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:07.280]  he's great to be back once again and I've never gotten to do this but I'm
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:10.560]  gonna give you a shout out for your part so that's super blue floor free
[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:14.600]  toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level I use the
[1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:17.720]  one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it
[1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:21.920]  absorbs into your gum it is by far the best product I've ever used in my life
[1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:25.520]  I literally just took turbo course on my way to the gym right now I've had four
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:29.520]  shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that bodies has made me feel better
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:33.000]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.240]  so I just want to get that out of the way support this man everything that he
[1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:39.760]  exposed nobody knew about the he mean growth nobody knew about fd nobody knew
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:44.600]  about build a bird nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001 go look at
[1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:47.440]  up yourself well we try our best sir they definitely want us off the air
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:50.160]  without you we're not here but yeah these are all great products so thank you
[1:30:50.160 --> 1:31:01.560]  sir I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that
[1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:06.240]  is supported by all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just
[1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:09.480]  giving in to sickness care they care of their health they care of their
[1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:13.280]  nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality and I say that from
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:17.480]  personal experience because I know that the products that are being offered here
[1:31:17.480 --> 1:31:21.600]  I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that they have the
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:26.200]  ampm power pack well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:30.480]  have been on a regular customer in that regard I just want to start out by
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.640]  saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond the
[1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:37.440]  theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:41.640]  great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:48.080]  yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to
[1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:51.920]  use for good purpose for our families and for our communities and right now
[1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:56.760]  folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America
[1:31:56.760 --> 1:32:01.680]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of Satan hate infowars
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:07.400]  it's because we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving
[1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:12.600]  up that's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:17.320]  plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie
[1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:22.400]  about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:26.600]  the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:30.840]  what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to
[1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:35.840]  try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:41.240]  are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm
[1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:47.200]  and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:53.040]  fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love God and that's
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:58.120]  all we ever have to know is that God is in charge
[1:32:58.120 --> 1:33:04.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:22.760]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening
[1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:36.680]  to alex jones
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:40.880]  well I've been on air on this Sunday broadcast for an hour and 33 minutes
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:48.800]  and I haven't plugged yet today because at a deep level it feels weird to hand
[1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:52.600]  out life preservers on a singing ship you know you're helping people it's still
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:56.160]  feels like you're being opportunistic most talk show hosts would be plugging
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:04.240]  every segment during a period like this but I'll just tell like it is it's all I
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:09.880]  can do is just tell you what I'm really thinking and what I'm really up to there
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:13.640]  are a lot of storeable foods companies out there that already sold out to the
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:23.920]  government already sold out to major institutions are sponsored hidden and they
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.160]  came to me over a month ago and they said man we're working in double triple
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:32.440]  cells every day how bad you think it's gonna get and I said China and I keep
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:36.240]  repeating this every segment please listen to me I've got so much to cover
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:40.280]  it's not lack of material keep saying the same thing China is the number one real
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:46.560]  economy in the world and it's globalist run they wouldn't have shut that sucker
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.560]  down unless they either had the worst plague ever or they were using it as a
[1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:56.560]  weapon against the West and they're clearly now using it as a weapon and we
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:03.440]  are sickeningly on target I know you all saw it and heard it your regular
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:08.600]  listeners I'm with the crew to go back and get it with Mike Adams and Dr. Francis
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:12.120]  Boyle everybody else laying out and then they're gonna blame Trump and they
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:14.920]  didn't send the kids out and that's gonna be a setup that's gonna hurt the
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:23.160]  stock market then and I'm sitting here watching it slow motion happen and I'm
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:30.720]  not happy we sold a bunch of storeable food because I knew we'd sell out and
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:35.240]  then I had to come on air and tell you that and then there's the sickening
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:39.440]  feeling of knowing there's all these jerks everywhere who we've tried to buy
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:44.640]  from we're sold out and are lying to people and saying seven days for
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:49.960]  delivery I'm not gonna tell you we've got food delivered to you in seven days
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:54.120]  it's six to eight weeks now you put your order in earlier you got it and quite
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:57.840]  frankly since Trump came out so there's no problem food sales have gone way down
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:02.440]  so maybe it's five weeks now we just under promise over deliver and yeah I
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.160]  want to make money to fund this operation stay on air and and get people
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:08.840]  high-quality swareable food that takes care of them and their family but that's
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.000]  not what it's about
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:22.800]  they're gonna try to war game this from every angle but you can see that they
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.840]  wouldn't shut down Italy and China and all these other places and all the other
[1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:31.760]  big announcements unless this was a big concerted effort and I've said this every
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:36.240]  segment I'll say it again it's all unified press releases by every major
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:41.720]  government for the US so part of me is very proud of President Trump and
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:46.080]  whatever intel he's got that I don't have that he is bucking it I hope he's not
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.200]  being trapped maybe you know something I don't know and I'm just being honest
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:53.160]  with you other talks you also tell you definitive BS I don't when I'm
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:59.440]  definitive I tell you I just know this is synthetic this is a big move we've
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.680]  been right about I'm gonna blame Trump and crash the economy and now it's all
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:10.320]  happening and so every moment here on air I'm like kicking myself in the head
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:13.960]  just thinking you better be on target boy you better come up with the end you
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:18.000]  I think we've come up with the answers but you get in the fight moment it's
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:25.920]  like I don't folks I'm just gonna tell you right now they would shut China down
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.560]  like that unless they were playing something they use this is a war this is
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:33.960]  a war I don't know every facet of it we're under attack that's all I could
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:49.440]  say and I'm I don't want to say I'm paralyzed I'm to the point where just the
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:55.000]  microcosm of all the other big food sellers were out a month ago they're
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.120]  telling people they got food when they don't just taking your money I know it
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:04.360]  goes into that when we even take your money we've got to then sit there and
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:10.600]  sit on it until you get delivered and that's a time bomb for so many reasons
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:17.480]  and I just look at the at the evil that's everywhere and it makes me sick
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:21.400]  and I at a certain point when you're a business owner and a broadcaster and
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:25.560]  everything I do you get a view into stuff guys really taught me from every
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:29.240]  level ground up how stuff works and most people don't have this experience and I
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:33.200]  wish you had this experience they try to keep you in the dark so you never get
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:38.000]  these experiences and then the problem is once you have these experiences you're
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:45.320]  like trying to tell people what you know but it's so complex there's no way to
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:51.200]  even do it I just know this when I was trying to figure out over a month ago
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:55.440]  whether this was a big deal or not I called around not just our supplier they
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.720]  said yeah it's all sold out that's never been done before by government's
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:04.400]  institutions so that tells me they know food is gonna be a big premium in the
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:07.520]  future whether the virus is a big threat or not or whether they're gonna
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:11.360]  create a global hysteria that crashes the economy and if you're in a great
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:16.080]  depression food's gonna be worth even more
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:26.280]  so that's what I'm telling you is any angle any slice any view this is the
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:31.320]  biggest attack on America and freedom I've ever seen Mike sorry I'm ran here
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:34.480]  in the segment you're an engineer a scientist you look at every angle this
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:37.880]  we should get into the Providence the virus it's man-made even limbaugh goes
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:42.760]  oh it's man-made but don't worry about it I get him at that level he's at not
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:48.440]  trying to create a crisis but we already swallowed the lure with treble hooks
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:52.560]  how do we get it out of our throat how do we snatch victory from the jaws of
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:57.640]  the feet well look America can survive this but it requires people turning to
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:02.320]  antiviral molecules that exist right now and there are only two sources of where
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:06.080]  to get that number one there are some prescription medications that have
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:09.640]  antiviral effects none of them are yet proven against the coronavirus but
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:13.800]  they're very strong candidates the second place is plants and understand
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:18.680]  plants which is food superfoods herbs even just regular things like garlic and
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:22.880]  ginger and onions plants must synthesize their own antivirals and
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:27.640]  antibiotics otherwise when I'm about to sick I gorge on onions and a bunch of
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:33.640]  red meat and garlic and I never it's a drug well look plants make it they
[1:40:33.640 --> 1:40:36.400]  literally make it so most of these molecules are made out of just carbon
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:40.640]  hydrogen and oxygen those just those three elements make vitamin C for example
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:45.360]  or progesterone or cannabinoids but you know your store for example offers I
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:50.960]  believe a 95% percuminoid extract bodies is amazing and people know they're
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:56.080]  buying it and I you know again I'm always careful not to get you in any
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:00.680]  regulatory trouble but folks pay special attention to that molecule you should
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:04.240]  get some and you should get other molecules there's licorice root has a
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.920]  molecule called glycerin which is a very potent antiviral I'm seeing research
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:14.440]  on what's called fight Germans knew that that's what they're you know things
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:18.960]  like what's that drink I haven't had in years it's the Yeager Meisters almost is
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:22.840]  licorice and they take that when they're sick there we go and and by the way
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:27.280]  licorice root that molecule glycerin also protects your liver from acetaminophen
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:31.880]  damage which is Tylenol so Tylenol causes liver damage all all over the world
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:36.840]  it kills people who combine it with alcohol but but glycerin protects your
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:40.800]  liver so you can protect your liver it has antiviral effects and I don't you
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:48.000]  know drink licorice it just people just figure it out right right well we're
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.800]  surrounded by natural medicine that we're compatible with it's part of our
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:55.800]  natural world tree bark I mean cinnamon comes from tree bark the herbs and
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:59.120]  spices and foods and all these things I demonstrated a couple on your show last
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:03.080]  week some some wood I saw that grows from a spruce tree you know and some
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:08.200]  weird spices out of Indonesia all kinds of things the bottom line is if people
[1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:12.160]  are so stupid that they think the only medicine in the world comes from big
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:16.800]  pharma that stupidity may get them killed what Trump should do in my opinion
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:20.840]  although he'll never do this but what he should do is say hey America everybody
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:26.480]  boost your health take some vitamin D increase your intake of healthy foods
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.920]  stop eating the junk food you know let's talk about let's talk about
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:35.760]  political solutions to get ahead of what they're doing instead of debating
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:40.640]  whether the virus is deadly Trump knows the hysteria of the virus is what's
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.240]  deadly we failed to contain that so how do you deal with that and then let's talk
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:48.920]  about how we personally protect ourselves with Mike Adams why I respect

[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:01.560]  promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them and be
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:05.160]  self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden I mean it's just
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:08.360]  what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we do so high-quality
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:12.720]  swarble food I told my Patriot a month ago I said what can you handle I said
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:14.880]  I think it's gonna be really big and they said we can handle probably this
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:17.600]  we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:20.120]  able to fund I said no I think this is gonna be huge I think you should spend
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:22.920]  everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:25.360]  going up for you so those are the type of discussions we have I'm just giving the
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:30.120]  inside baseball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:33.920]  hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay an info or store
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:37.520]  com you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:41.680]  orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying I mean this is just insane
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:45.600]  we're expecting that to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:49.800]  continues like this we're looking at having to suspend food so everybody gets
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:53.200]  their order in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so what you're
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:55.960]  getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on info
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:47:04.480]  or store.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:14.920 --> 1:47:19.280]  here's the big takeaway as we do the final live segment of this Sunday night
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:27.640]  show they're engineering a global recession or depression out of this
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:35.320]  crisis and I get the president being told up front to play it down try to
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:39.400]  stop it but you can see the whole corporate media the whole system behind
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:42.280]  it and now they're doing it and the Democrats just let me predict it over a
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:48.840]  month ago have come in said it's all the president's fault I believe due to our
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:53.880]  prayer and our political will promoting the truth Trump will survive this but
[1:47:53.880 --> 1:47:59.160]  everybody needs to promote the live feed here we're not just on the sidelines
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:02.920]  they're claiming where the zeitgeist we are you are the zeitgeist so when you
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:09.200]  promote this broadcast it's your very breath your very will exerting itself so
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:14.640]  we'll also post the videos to band on video let's go ahead and play a Fox news
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:18.440]  clip that just aired like three minutes ago I was just during break we got Fox
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  news on the control room and and this is the hysteria they're promoting of the
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:26.360]  collapse of the stock market this week here it is
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:30.200]  coronavirus continues to spark global concern as the outbreak spreads to more
[1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:34.560]  than 60 countries the epidemic rattling the world economy prompting Wall
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:39.600]  Street to surrender nearly five months of gains the major indexes finished the
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.040]  week down sharply but well above session lows it was the market's worst week
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:49.240]  since the 2008 financial crisis Alex Hogan has more from the New York stock
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:55.260]  exchange Alex John analysts here on Wall Street are bracing for likely
[1:48:55.260 --> 1:49:00.000]  another week of economic pain as the coronavirus continues to spread globally
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.680]  the many uncertainties are not only rattling the confidence of investors
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:09.760]  but also sending shockwaves through the markets in China the world's second
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:15.160]  largest economy where the virus began taking a hit factory activity plunging
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.000]  to an all-time low the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.960]  dropping to 35.7 from 50 in January the Middle East is recording its lowest
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:30.720]  oil prices since 2008 oil giants Exxon and Chevron watching shares tumble with
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:35.360]  the price of oil dipping 16% and tech giants Microsoft and Apple together
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:40.920]  losing 300 billion dollars tourism industry seeing a steep decline to with
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:49.600]  American Airlines folks that's enough of that again I don't have the crew to do
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:54.360]  this but you were watching you were listening as listeners you're awesome
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:59.280]  we're banned on YouTube you can take clubs the show and say here's where don't
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.440]  say my name but here's where the news predicted this would happen it wasn't
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:07.760]  hard when China locked down its major cities have they had a real thing they
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:14.160]  had to cover it up or it's so deadly they had to cover it up either way it's
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:19.720]  mathematically the same equation global financial collapse unless we pointed out
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:26.240]  and say it's part of American industry and American military will that we don't
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:31.760]  worry about it and we go out and we eat healthy and we you know exercise and we
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:36.320]  deal with it we don't panic only want to counter fear like this is to admit the
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  threat and counter it you cover it up you've taken the bait and so I again I'm
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:49.000]  no rocket scientist man well but when I see major cities totally locked down by
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.960]  the chai comms it's like it's either the worst plague ever or it's a total
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:57.520]  scion either way man you get the same equation so either way it's the same
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:01.640]  equation Mike Adams of natural news comm do you agree with that and what is
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:05.400]  trouble you do right now to get ahead of this because I love the president maybe
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:09.680]  I'm wrong maybe I'm not as smart as he is we help him elected he admits that I
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:14.400]  think he's behind the eight ball that you took the bait on this well yeah I
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:17.240]  think he took the bait but he's got an opportunity to get out in front of it
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:23.040]  right now and take a leadership role and also have a new call call for made in
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:26.960]  America and and nationalism and let's have that's what you can and said why
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:31.040]  aren't you pointing out it's China and globalism and open borders so when it
[1:51:31.040 --> 1:51:36.600]  hits you don't get blamed this is the best argument ever this this virus is
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:41.200]  the best argument for for protecting borders screening people who come into
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.480]  your country and having redone trees within your own borders this is it the
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:50.800]  argument exactly so who was advising him at this critical point not to take
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:56.840]  victory out of this I don't I don't know I can't figure out why Trump is is not
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:01.200]  hammering these very powerful points that prove Trump was right Trump was
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:05.400]  right all along we need made in America that's really made in America not not
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:08.720]  the fake made in America using parts from China which is what a lot of the
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:13.400]  situation is but I mean semiconductors in America textiles in America and now I
[1:52:13.400 --> 1:52:18.800]  know prices will go higher but what what's the cost of having no supply you
[1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:23.840]  see but that's gonna rather wages anyways well well that's true that's true
[1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:27.920]  but we need another problem Alex and you maybe you've seen this in in your own
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:32.360]  warehouse operations as well but the younger millennials and even younger
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:37.040]  people in America today they do not have a work ethic that you and I grew up
[1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:42.400]  with so there's this laziness it's real it's in the youth of America today they
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:45.280]  don't think they should have to work they say things like I don't work in a
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:49.680]  sneaker factory I buy brand name sneakers you know they're consumers not
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:55.360]  producers and this this is well there's a sluggishness and that's that's well
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:58.360]  known I'm sluggish compared to my grandfather's but you're absolutely
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:03.160]  right people then also just see numbers they go like I even have CPAs they go
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:07.120]  this week's like well there's this money in your bank account I saw the tax bill
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:11.720]  and I go we'll be bankrupt now what you didn't count we got to pay the vendors
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:16.160]  and I go oh you're right sorry half that money was to be paid for refilling
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:20.720]  orders I'm like I was up here yesterday I'm not bitching five hours going that's
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:25.720]  money on the people I won't pay taxes on money it's not mine almost had a damn
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:32.960]  heart attack but I mean it CPAs man it's a breakdown well I'm seeing
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:38.480]  breakdowns in banking and finance I'm seeing banks just utterly fail to do
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:43.600]  their jobs right now that is the extra labor I'm all for liquidity but it
[1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:49.000]  makes people decadent it really does when money is too easy people forget how
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:52.360]  to earn it and and this is happening in America right now so I hope we can
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:56.680]  return to a manufacturing base oh my god I read the CNN article I meant to cover
[1:53:56.680 --> 1:54:00.760]  today it was like why are people socialist in Congress like well they
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:06.280]  rode from Will Walkie to West Virginia and they got veggie pizza and they saw
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:10.000]  the coal dust and thought it was ugly they think how ugly a communist country
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.560]  was it's just delusional they don't know how I'm not bragging you're not either
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:19.120]  but when you actually run stuff you get our stuff works these people have no
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:23.960]  idea they just click on their phone and get Uber eats and then bitch about it
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:28.360]  go I want to be a communist when you're on an iPhone that's a thousand dollars
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:34.560]  made by communist slaves bitching well this pandemic is gonna be the ultimate
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:39.360]  wake-up call global no no I agree they might let me say that once you back on
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:43.600]  the show tomorrow I'm ranting in a few minutes here if it is really deadly and
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  everything walks down you have a Wuhan quarantine what will the average left us
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:53.200]  to you talk about a group of psychotic piranhas well that's the thing there
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:57.520]  will be no enforcement of any quarantine of a liberal city in America because the
[1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:02.360]  people that you would try to isolate will not comply not at all they will go
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:06.360]  nuts that mean they're insane on a normal day in many cases they'll go even
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:11.680]  more insane and and so by the way the Spanish flu spread during World War one
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:17.480]  because masses of people soldiers were sharing rail cars and and and military
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.040]  barracks and so on you put a lot of people in groups like a group marching
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:24.880]  down the street or protesting in a group you're gonna spread this virus like
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:28.760]  crazy so we're actually looking at a convergence of that mouth this plan
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:33.520]  300 years ago was to crowd us together release of release of micro as he
[1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:37.360]  called it well yeah it's gonna be highly effective at spreading in these
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:40.880]  cities especially since there's basically very little public sanitation in
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:45.480]  these cities that the raw feces washes right out into the beaches essentially to
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:49.440]  the ocean and it swept back onto the beaches every beach from Washington State
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:53.160]  all the way down to the southern tip of western California will be coded with
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:59.440]  coronavirus very soon so imagine the summer how it's gonna spread maybe there
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:02.000]  be some suppression during the summer but it's gonna come back with a vengeance
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.840]  in the fall most likely America is not going to escape unscathed there's there's
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:10.400]  no way if it could be contained Alex it would have been contained in Wuhan
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.560]  because they had draconian measures that we won't even attempt in this country
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.080]  thank goodness so it will not be contained in America and but I'm not
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:21.400]  poo pooing what you say my crap's we're right if it's real from their
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:26.400]  perspective you don't contain it even if it's hype they've used it as a weapon
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:30.480]  for globalist takeover and try to crack that's right either way you look at it
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:35.120]  this is this is it this is real and I can't imagine 60 nations cooperating on
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:40.000]  a giant global hoax that first involves local economy I think it's a lot of
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.440]  people and they're scared yeah this is real this this is real it's killing
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:48.200]  people it's it's killing economies it's killing supply chains it's absolutely
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:52.920]  real we are among the last nations probably to be hit hard by it just
