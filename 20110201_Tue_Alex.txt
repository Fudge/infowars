[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.080]  we are fully loaded with information warfare weapons we are over the target the military
[00:30.080 --> 00:37.600]  industrial complex owned by the big criminal offshore banks trying to destroy human free
[00:37.600 --> 00:44.480]  society and on its asses build their world government we are resisting it big time thank
[00:44.480 --> 00:53.880]  you so much for joining us it is Tuesday the first day of February 2011 and we're going
[00:53.880 --> 00:59.120]  to be live here for the next three hours Dr. Sherry Tenpenny pops in later in the next
[00:59.120 --> 01:04.880]  hour with an update on flu vaccines and other vaccines and adverse reaction reports all
[01:04.880 --> 01:11.080]  over the world David Ike to give us his interesting perspective joins us in the third hour on
[01:11.080 --> 01:16.560]  what's happening with the global economy what's going on in the Middle East in Jordan the monarchy
[01:16.560 --> 01:24.600]  has replaced the government in reaction to protest that again is a big ally of the West
[01:24.600 --> 01:28.720]  so there is certainly a real rebellion going on here and I think what's really happening
[01:28.720 --> 01:34.200]  is the West has got its pre-placed people knowing that there's rebellion against all
[01:34.200 --> 01:40.440]  of these dictatorial regimes and so that once the rebellion starts they can then try to
[01:40.440 --> 01:46.400]  channel it into a new puppet meet the new boss same as the old boss similar to the two
[01:46.400 --> 01:53.000]  party system that we have here but I certainly there's real reasons for people to be revolting
[01:53.000 --> 02:03.920]  and that is the economic deprivation that's going on predominantly over dollar devaluation
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.240]  globally driving up food prices on a planetary scale so we're going to be discussing all
[02:10.240 --> 02:17.480]  of that today the latest on what's happening in Egypt we're also going to get into people
[02:17.480 --> 02:24.280]  like the new governor of California says that they must raise taxes or California could
[02:24.280 --> 02:31.040]  go the way of what's happening in Egypt it's actually over taxation it's hurting California
[02:31.040 --> 02:37.520]  no one can deny that and causing people to flee the state like they're fleeing Michigan
[02:37.520 --> 02:43.080]  New York and other big tax and spend areas like Illinois so we're going to be breaking
[02:43.080 --> 02:51.960]  that down today also there's interesting article here out of the San Diego news today and its
[02:51.960 --> 02:59.280]  document shows safety concerns slowed fluoridation and reading this article basically there is
[02:59.280 --> 03:07.640]  a rebellion going on inside the San Diego government this is out of the San Diego Union
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.160]  Tribune their big paper where their own scientists are saying don't put this in the water you
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.880]  know it's toxic you know it's dangerous and so there's been an internal fight inside the
[03:19.880 --> 03:24.920]  city and that's why they're several months late on putting this stuff into the water
[03:24.920 --> 03:30.000]  supply but because of federal funds greasing the skids they're going ahead with that and
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  speaking of health care obviously judge rules against health care law yesterday and cites
[03:35.000 --> 03:44.040]  in his 70 plus page paper in the ruling Obama on CNN and other debates but predominantly
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.080]  a CNN debate where Obama said hey we can't make people get health care you know can we
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.880]  make people buy houses so they're not going to be homeless and the judge went on to say
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.000]  yeah can you make people eat broccoli well that's what this authoritarianism is they
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.600]  can tell you what type of toilet you're going to have if they can tell you what type of
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.000]  light bulb you're going to have sounds reasonable then it's what type of house you can live
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.680]  in how many children you can have how much carbon dioxide you can exhale this is the
[04:12.680 --> 04:20.240]  authoritarian 21st century model of all of this and so that's coming up as well obviously
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.840]  we have this up at info wars dot com it's also up on drugs report chucky schumer came
[04:25.840 --> 04:32.320]  out a couple days ago and said that there are three branches of government the house
[04:32.320 --> 04:38.560]  the senate and the executive or so that's two branches of government he listed the legislative
[04:38.560 --> 04:45.160]  as and bifurcated into two two branches of government along with the executive and ignored
[04:45.160 --> 04:52.200]  the judicial so we're getting into that clip also the environmentalists the fake environmentalists
[04:52.200 --> 04:58.560]  are running around claiming the freezing weather is a response to global warming but don't
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.320]  worry you can pay them taxes diamond gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the patriot
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.200]  movement they're offering a free cd t-shirt and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase

[06:09.840 --> 06:14.260]  a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem
[06:14.260 --> 06:18.400]  to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their

[08:14.240 --> 08:18.400]  welcome again thank you for joining us it is the first day of february twenty eleven
[08:18.400 --> 08:23.200]  on this tuesday edition about the sherry ten penny will be popping in for about fifteen
[08:23.200 --> 08:29.440]  twenty minutes start of the next hour to give us an update on some of the vaccine reactions
[08:29.440 --> 08:35.000]  that are happening in the latest on the globalist attempt to establish forced inoculation all
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.760]  across this country but also worldwide and the rest of the broadcast will be dealing
[08:41.760 --> 08:48.560]  with news and information there is a lot of it first off i want to get into obama and
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.560]  the government health care plan and i want to go back to a video during the debates
[08:54.560 --> 08:59.280]  with hillary where he said look you can't make people buy health insurance just like
[08:59.280 --> 09:06.440]  you can't make people buy a home so they won't be homeless and you can't have penalties
[09:06.440 --> 09:10.760]  on people well he went ahead and of course later went along with all that but the federal
[09:10.760 --> 09:17.480]  judge in this latest ruling cited obama's own statements and the judge went on to say
[09:17.480 --> 09:22.800]  you can't make people eat broccoli i mean if the government can do this they can make
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.240]  you eat broccoli well that's the whole point they are deciding what type of light bulbs
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.400]  we can have what type of toilets they're openly saying they want to decide how many kids we
[09:31.400 --> 09:38.200]  can have this is the nature of a command and control plan society command and controlled
[09:38.200 --> 09:44.280]  society also they have the federation of american scientists and the woman could hardly say
[09:44.280 --> 09:54.120]  it with a straight face on cnn saying that the freezing weather we're seeing as a result
[09:54.120 --> 10:00.520]  of global warming and all of the evil carbon dioxide that we're putting into the atmosphere
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.040]  that's coming up we have chuckie schumer not knowing the three branches of government
[10:06.040 --> 10:10.040]  you know i tend to think he does know the three branches but but they like to practice
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.960]  ignorance out in front of everyone basically washing the public's minds in disinformation
[10:15.960 --> 10:22.360]  it's it's part of the globalist religion to put out disinfo and to keep the general public
[10:22.360 --> 10:28.280]  in the dark so that we just swim in a sea of disinformation so that we're confused and
[10:28.280 --> 10:35.000]  i can't ever rest control of society away from these bloodthirsty control freaks so
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.360]  that is all coming up as well obviously we're going to be getting into the egypt
[10:40.920 --> 10:48.360]  situation and the one the only day but i could be live with us in the last hour of the broadcast
[10:48.360 --> 10:56.840]  today but first i wanted to get into some very good news and this is out of the major newspaper
[10:56.840 --> 11:07.240]  in san diego and the san diego newspaper the san diego union tribune has the headline here
[11:07.240 --> 11:15.160]  documents show safety concerns slowed floridation now the headline should be revolt within the city
[11:16.200 --> 11:21.560]  because as you read deeper into the article uh it says that scientists and people working in
[11:21.560 --> 11:30.200]  the health department were concerned about the fact that epa scientists fda scientists have
[11:30.200 --> 11:35.960]  testified in congress they admit children are getting way too much fluoride that it's in the food
[11:35.960 --> 11:42.440]  that it's in it uses a pesticide on the different crops and that we're bio accumulating it and
[11:42.440 --> 11:48.200]  that it's very very toxic and that the type of fluoride they're putting in the water is toxic
[11:48.200 --> 11:55.400]  but the article kind of spins it that well what's happened here is there were some safety concerns
[11:55.400 --> 12:01.480]  and so this was supposed to happen a few months ago but now now san diego the biggest city in the
[12:01.480 --> 12:07.400]  u.s to not floridae they're moving to put it in san antonio only put fluoride in six seven years
[12:07.400 --> 12:14.200]  ago i mean the people there aren't stupid it's taken the government since the 1950s until now
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.920]  to floridae 71 percent of this country just a few years ago it was 68 percent and they've got close
[12:20.920 --> 12:27.240]  to 70 in england floridae they've got more than half in germany floridae and again it's not because
[12:27.240 --> 12:34.200]  they care about you it reduces fertility it causes brain damage it causes bone cancer this is not
[12:34.200 --> 12:40.120]  debated the government admits this but they hope you don't look into it but think about how we have
[12:40.120 --> 12:45.960]  these facts and all we've got to do is continue to present them at city council present them at
[12:45.960 --> 12:52.120]  county commissioners present them at the state houses and turn the power of the grassroots loose
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.520]  against the big chemical company lobbies who would have to store all this toxic waste but while
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.040]  law they sell it to you as a health benefit and now they don't have to store the toxic waste
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.800]  they can put it directly into your water and what's so deadly about sodium fluoride from the medical
[13:09.800 --> 13:15.720]  doctors we've talked to and the endocrinologist and others is that it's an adjuvant it accelerates
[13:15.720 --> 13:22.600]  in supercharges all the other toxins and chemicals and free radicals and grignard reagents that are
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.320]  already in the water that are added along with the sodium fluoride that's another big hoax you're
[13:27.320 --> 13:34.760]  told this is pharmacological you know pharma grade fluoride sodium fluoride no it's not and you do
[13:34.760 --> 13:43.400]  need just tiny trace amounts of calcium fluoride you need tiny trace amounts of lead and mercury
[13:43.400 --> 13:51.400]  these are way above those tiny tiny trace amounts and it's a key compound that bio accumulates
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.280]  over time in the tissues in the organs and the bones but you can go read this article
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.960]  utility officials at the slowdown highlights how the safety system worked though the documents
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.400]  suggest some city leaders were disturbed by the timing of the deferral uh san diego was
[14:07.400 --> 14:13.160]  three days away from starting fluoridation in december uh 22nd when senior operator and supervisor
[14:13.160 --> 14:19.480]  jim mcvay to the schedule had precluded hands-on training by system operators before the process
[14:19.480 --> 14:27.640]  went live and uh the centers for disease control and prevention recently updated information
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.880]  about the fluoridation of water saying that it actually causes dental fluorosis and should be
[14:33.880 --> 14:42.200]  cut from 1.2 parts per million to 0.7 parts so they're certainly starting to back off on that
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.640]  front so good news there and the people in san diego just continue to put pressure on government
[14:47.640 --> 14:52.600]  and get the facts out you can reverse this they've tried to just laugh at people for 60 years and
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.920]  bring up the medical science it was scientists and doctors that brought it up back in the 50s and
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.880]  said it was dangerous and they've been laughing at us for all these decades but now the mountains of
[15:01.880 --> 15:09.080]  evidence are crushing their lives and so victory is in our hands if we just take it now speaking of
[15:09.080 --> 15:15.240]  health care what it's like to have a government controlled by big banks that own the insurance
[15:15.240 --> 15:22.280]  companies who wrote the health care law to make 30 plus million americans by their overpriced products
[15:22.280 --> 15:30.200]  that's what this was really all about but then they wrap it in a socialist loving veneer so that
[15:30.200 --> 15:37.720]  people believe that uh you who are on the left that they're actually helping someone but the
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.000]  truth is the big banks that own the insurance companies on record wrote the health care plan
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  they wrote it they created it and they pushed it out there and it's got mandates to give you
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.400]  multi-thousand dollar your fines if you don't go out and get it to attach your paycheck and it allows
[15:56.120 --> 16:03.560]  the big insurance companies to control the hmo's to write policy with a computer telling your doctor
[16:03.560 --> 16:11.480]  your dentist what procedure they can do so the bureaucracy diagnosing you in quote cost cutting
[16:11.480 --> 16:17.080]  once they socialize things once they get us dependent on each other then they can have social
[16:17.080 --> 16:22.840]  control they can say what you can eat what you can drink then now they've got to monitor you
[16:22.840 --> 16:27.880]  because you're part of the collective and why your behavior is costing other people money
[16:27.880 --> 16:33.080]  that's one of the big pitfalls of collectivism and then it always pushes this surveillance grid
[16:33.080 --> 16:41.000]  and then they can bring in the one-shot policies then they can bring in the death panels the case
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.840]  for killing granny out of one side of their mouth they say there's none of that going on
[16:44.840 --> 16:52.840]  out of the other side side newsweek time magazine new yorker magazine bill gates ted turner yeah
[16:52.840 --> 16:59.640]  kill granny higher ten teachers they're selling you the collectivist model that if somebody dies
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.400]  you get ahead so it's a cannibalistic worldview i mean i hear liberals mainline liberals all the
[17:05.400 --> 17:12.120]  time on talk radio saying the pie is this big and doesn't get any bigger and so if if you're
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.240]  going to get ahead somebody else has got to lose and why are there are these ultra rich people
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.000]  with this much of the pie why that means it's taking away from your pie as long as wealthy people
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.200]  have free market systems and actually hire people and actually produce products or ideas or services
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.680]  it actually grows the economy that's basic economics and the globalists know that
[17:35.720 --> 17:41.640]  but it is the super robber baron elite who have always waged war against the middle class against
[17:41.640 --> 17:50.280]  the merchant class against the uh shopkeeper class against the cobbler class people you know made
[17:50.280 --> 17:56.840]  shoes and clothes and their own little shops because they can become independently successful
[17:56.840 --> 18:03.560]  and independent of the system and now they don't need a letter of mark and if you look at say bass
[18:03.560 --> 18:11.640]  beer it says the am oldest uh you know official uh copyright in england you actually look at that
[18:11.640 --> 18:18.600]  mark for bass ale and it's a letter from the queen an authorization and sixteen something i don't
[18:18.600 --> 18:24.680]  have one of the bears in front of me uh to be able to brew beer you you had to get a license
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.840]  from the queenine now how powerful does that make the queen that to be able to brew beer
[18:30.840 --> 18:37.160]  you've got to have her authorization to be able to take your ship out of the bay into the english
[18:37.160 --> 18:42.200]  channel to engage in trade you've got to have a license to be able to fix your house you've
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.520]  got to have a license to be able to grow crops you get a license specifically for what you can
[18:48.520 --> 18:55.400]  grow under feudalism oh you're in with the king you're in with the king of federal government
[18:55.400 --> 19:02.200]  you're in with the titular head the figurehead of the banking imperium barack obama oh you're
[19:02.200 --> 19:13.800]  mcdonald's or you're the big uh lobbying groups uh you're the big uh unions oh you get waivers
[19:13.800 --> 19:19.240]  from the health care you don't have to pay for health care for your employees but everybody else

[24:11.880 --> 24:18.040]  the government and then have the government mandated the people basically pay taxes directly to
[24:18.040 --> 24:23.560]  those private interest all over the u.s foreign interest come in buy off the politicians have
[24:23.560 --> 24:30.040]  toll roads put on existing roads and levy taxes directly on the citizenry and that's what the
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.880]  health care act is but the republicans would not attack it from truth they attacked it and
[24:35.880 --> 24:41.800]  claimed it was communism which is bad enough no it was fascism written by the insurance companies
[24:41.800 --> 24:47.800]  owned by the big banks forcing 30 to 34 million depending on what numbers you look at to go out
[24:47.800 --> 24:54.920]  and buy this but then insiders they don't have to purchase it again an unfair trade advantage the
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.440]  essence of tyranny how are we a free society if the government can order us to get health insurance
[25:01.560 --> 25:06.600]  can the government as the federal judge pointed out make us buy a home to end homelessness
[25:07.160 --> 25:12.600]  we're going to play part of the clip from the debate in 2008 with barack obama
[25:12.600 --> 25:19.480]  barry sataro and hillary rotham clinton uh where he basically brought up that very point and that's
[25:19.480 --> 25:28.840]  what the judge roger vinson put in his 70 plus page 78 page ruling uh yesterday and it's very
[25:28.840 --> 25:34.600]  fundamental you know this supposed free society was only free to a certain extent for a little over
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.440]  100 years and since then they've been steadily eroding it we didn't have property taxes until
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.160]  the last 60 years or so and now all over the country they're raising property taxes where people
[25:45.160 --> 25:51.480]  can't even own homes i mean it's becoming insane a small home of a hundred thousand dollars even
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.880]  in rural areas i've seen the numbers you've seen them you've lived it you know they may put a five
[25:55.880 --> 26:01.640]  thousand ten thousand dollar fee on that you're paying rent on your home these are things that
[26:01.640 --> 26:09.480]  unfree nations have always had and we have to recognize that what made this country so wealthy
[26:09.480 --> 26:15.000]  is being dismantled but let's go ahead and play the clip of obama in the debate with hillary
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.760]  and then a year later he starts trying to ram through the health care law which they successfully
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.960]  got through last year which does have the fines if you don't get health care which does force you
[26:25.960 --> 26:31.320]  to get the health care which does everything he said was so bad and the judge has rightly
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.200]  put this in his ruling pointing out the blatant hypocrisy here it is
[26:36.200 --> 26:43.240]  again what did candidate obama say about mandated insurance during the democratic debates
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.000]  and here is that clever senator clinton has a different approach she believes that we have to
[26:49.960 --> 26:55.000]  force people who don't have health insurance to buy it otherwise there will be a lot of people
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.120]  who don't get it i don't see those folks and i think that it is important for us to recognize
[27:00.120 --> 27:06.360]  that if in fact you're going to mandate the purchase of insurance and it's not affordable then
[27:06.360 --> 27:10.200]  there's going to have to be some enforcement mechanism that the government uses and they may
[27:10.200 --> 27:15.400]  charge people who already don't have health care fines or have to take it out of their paychecks
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.240]  and that i don't think is helping those without health insurance that is a genuine difference
[27:20.680 --> 27:29.160]  but now what does he say about the health care law well now the health care law that they passed
[27:29.160 --> 27:37.000]  does have the fines and fees and does persecute people who don't get it now remember hillary
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.320]  at the time even though we had the legislation that she proposed back in the mid nineties
[27:41.880 --> 27:46.600]  even though we had the legislation that the democrats were already promoting that said
[27:47.240 --> 27:54.040]  five thousand dollar fees garnishing of wages she said that it wasn't true hoping that you
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.480]  wouldn't go read the bill well what is now law in this country what are they now preparing to
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.000]  try to implement in the next two years it takes time to phase it in as it's fought through the
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.960]  courts they're trying to put exactly what they said they weren't going to do in to place and obama
[28:11.960 --> 28:18.840]  in the same debate went on again to say and it was a good line it was a singer but now it's being
[28:18.840 --> 28:25.160]  used back against him he said look if i mandated as president everyone buy a house would that end
[28:25.160 --> 28:31.080]  homelessness how do you make someone buy a house who doesn't have the money to buy a house most
[28:31.080 --> 28:35.880]  americans don't have the money to buy a house unless they go to something a rural place where you
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.440]  can you know maybe buy a house for thirty forty thousand dollars that's got the roof falling in
[28:40.440 --> 28:49.480]  on it how do they do this how how do they try to force this and it's it's completely unconstitutional
[28:49.480 --> 28:57.320]  on its face because if they can make you buy health care then the federal government can do
[28:57.320 --> 29:03.320]  anything and speaking of doing anything it isn't up on prisonplanet.com yet but watson called me
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.640]  this morning and it's going to be up on prisonplanet.com very very soon and you better believe we're

[32:17.160 --> 32:23.320]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[32:23.320 --> 32:28.840]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore

[32:52.520 --> 33:09.960]  com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv well i won't
[33:09.960 --> 33:20.120]  back down no i won't back down we're gonna be getting into you can stand the record cold temperatures
[33:20.120 --> 33:26.200]  and record in at least the last four decades the media is reporting snowfall over much of the united
[33:26.200 --> 33:31.720]  states and that huge blanket of snow burying the east coast that's been buried now at least three
[33:31.720 --> 33:38.600]  times in the last two months and incredibly the media is spinning this that it's carbon dioxide
[33:38.600 --> 33:44.440]  that's causing it and that it's humans this is global warming uh supposedly that is coming up
[33:44.440 --> 33:50.840]  also we're going to be getting into this later in the hour tsa invades roads and highways with
[33:50.840 --> 34:00.360]  viper checkpoints tsa invades roads and highways with viper checkpoints absolute complete classical
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.840]  tyranny the seizure of infrastructure but they will not control our southern and northern borders
[34:06.840 --> 34:12.760]  they have uh you know never completed even small parts of the border fence and of course they
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.040]  canceled and never really began constructing it was all show the virtual fence meanwhile henry
[34:18.040 --> 34:24.920]  kissinger this video from bloomberg is up at prison planet dot com kissinger on egypt unrest this
[34:24.920 --> 34:31.080]  this is only the first scene of the first act of a drama that used to be played out so we're
[34:31.080 --> 34:41.640]  going to be uh getting into that as well but uh getting first into chuckie schumer now this is a
[34:41.640 --> 34:48.120]  u.s senator before that a member of the house of representatives this is a guy who is very smart
[34:48.920 --> 34:53.320]  and no doubt knows that the three branches of government as any five-year-old should know
[34:53.320 --> 35:00.200]  are executive legislative and judicial the executive is the president the legislative is the
[35:00.200 --> 35:07.320]  house and senate and of course the judicial is the courts but he says that they've got to get the
[35:07.320 --> 35:12.440]  three branches of government together when he was on scene in a few days ago they've got to get the
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.160]  three branches of government together and what are those three branches the house the senate and
[35:17.160 --> 35:24.280]  the president well that's only two branches he counts the legislative as two uh so incredible
[35:24.280 --> 35:31.160]  uh and he knows what he's doing they just engage in this type of baloney just like like parrots
[35:31.160 --> 35:38.200]  for decades they say we're a democracy in a democracy if 51 of the american people vote
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.440]  to take the other 49 of the people's property and put you in slave camps it happens in a democracy
[35:44.440 --> 35:51.720]  if 51 vote to take your guns it happens in a democracy of 51 vote to merge with china it happens
[35:51.720 --> 36:01.000]  in a democracy if 51 uh vote to put carbon taxes on everyone it happens in a republic a constitutional
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.760]  republic that our country has been the model of worldwide in the last 235 years the model of
[36:06.760 --> 36:13.160]  liberty you have basic liberties to private property the second amendment the right to travel
[36:13.160 --> 36:18.280]  the federal government isn't allowed to take over society it only has three powers and those are
[36:18.280 --> 36:25.000]  limited ninth and tenth amendment and so it's so fundamental when they tell you that we're a democracy
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.680]  is benjamin franklin said two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner if there were two wolves
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.200]  and a sheep and they sat down and said what's going to be for dinner the two wolves would outvote
[36:36.200 --> 36:43.000]  the sheep and they would eat the sheep but in a republic the sheep is protected but now in this
[36:43.000 --> 36:50.760]  quasi fake mob rule the system hypes up the dumb down masses and gets them to feel entitled
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.240]  and to go along with an agenda of free health care remember all the obama supporters oh thank
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.880]  you mr president right after you got elected i won't have to buy health care anymore i won't
[36:59.880 --> 37:04.440]  have to have a house payment i won't have to have a car payment oh thank you mr remember all of them
[37:04.440 --> 37:09.880]  falling down feigning everywhere well we're two years into this nightmare did you get all the
[37:09.880 --> 37:17.240]  free goodies you were looking for again the founding fathers warned of the dangers of the
[37:17.240 --> 37:26.680]  howling mob in once rome fell from being a republic to being run by the caesar he began to give
[37:26.680 --> 37:34.040]  welfare to the mob he began to employ the street gangs he began to hire through successive kings
[37:34.040 --> 37:43.320]  caesars rulers caesars and you know what rome turned into we know where this goes we know
[37:43.320 --> 37:49.160]  you go to egypt if you don't have the government's stamp you don't get to have a business this isn't
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.640]  what a free society looks like and i know i keep repeating that but it's amazing here is chucky
[37:53.640 --> 37:58.760]  schumer telling everybody the three branches of government or the house the senate and the president
[37:58.760 --> 38:06.440]  and there's no way he didn't know what he was doing here it is to get social security checks
[38:06.440 --> 38:13.800]  he can't fund the military but ultimately it risks the credit markets they are getting wary
[38:13.800 --> 38:19.000]  because of the large debt we have which we have to get down but if they feel that people are willing
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.240]  to shut down the government you could risk the credit markets really losing some confidence
[38:25.240 --> 38:33.960]  in the united states treasury and that could create a deeper recession than we had over the last
[38:33.960 --> 38:40.600]  several years god forbid even a depression so i would urge my republican colleagues no matter
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.480]  how strongly they feel you know we have three branches of government we have a house we have a
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.640]  senate we have a president and all three of us are going to have to come together and give some
[38:49.640 --> 38:55.880]  but it is playing with fire to risk the shutting down of the government just as it is playing with
[38:55.880 --> 39:03.320]  fire to risk not paying the debt okay yeah playing with fire this is all part of their disinformation
[39:03.320 --> 39:13.720]  campaign now this next clip is also from cnn and first let me get into this news that's a prelude
[39:13.720 --> 39:23.960]  to what we're about to play this is out of afp senators vow to strip obama climate power well
[39:23.960 --> 39:30.120]  they have to because he's illegitimately through the environmental protection agency implementing
[39:30.120 --> 39:37.480]  the kioto un treaty protocol which is selective only on western europe canada england australia
[39:37.480 --> 39:46.680]  new zealand and the us to slap giant 20 percent taxes to begin with in phase one on all of our
[39:46.680 --> 39:54.520]  power plants coal fired natural gas you name it and more than half our power generated by coal
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.200]  now china's building two to three a week we're only allowed to build two a year under federal
[40:00.200 --> 40:08.120]  permitting now what has obama done he's come into texas a month ago and seized the power plants in a
[40:08.120 --> 40:14.120]  regulatory order demanding that they either reduce output or pay higher taxes no law behind that
[40:14.680 --> 40:22.680]  the president is just doing it just like they're doing so many other things that are unconstitutional
[40:22.680 --> 40:29.000]  and conservative senators vowed to strip president obama of his power to regulate greenhouse gases
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.360]  and a move that would cripple us efforts on climate change is successful gotta love how the news
[40:34.360 --> 40:39.640]  just reports climate change see it was global warming now it's change and they tell school kids
[40:39.640 --> 40:43.880]  when it gets cold it's global warming when it gets hot it's global warming now they've shifted
[40:43.880 --> 40:49.400]  into climate change we always have climate change they've had several many ice ages in the last
[40:49.400 --> 40:56.040]  10 000 years that's confirmed by the ice core samples it's the sun that drives it and moon cycles
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.720]  because the moon controlling the ocean tides and also blocking or not blocking depending on
[41:01.720 --> 41:09.080]  where it is solar winds it's the winds of space and the sun and these energies that ionize the
[41:09.080 --> 41:21.160]  atmosphere that create the aurora borealis but the un back in 2009 about a year and two months ago
[41:21.160 --> 41:28.920]  announced it at the summit in Copenhagen they had a declaration and said the sun has no effect
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.880]  on climate because all these scientific bodies and scientists were bringing in petitions saying
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.320]  it's the sun it's the sun humans have almost no effect it's the sun it's the sun carbon
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.360]  dioxide's a life-giving gas that then plants respirate from and give off oxygen and so they
[41:44.360 --> 41:53.880]  had a confab a conclave and said we find that the sun has no effect on climate change that'd be
[41:53.880 --> 42:00.120]  like the pope 600 years ago saying we find that the earth is the center of the universe and the sun
[42:00.120 --> 42:09.000]  orbits the earth we find the earth is flat we find the moon is made of swiss cheese they actually
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.840]  found that the earth was flat and that the earth was not the uh and the earth was center of the
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.640]  universe they didn't find it was made of swiss cheese but they might as well we find at this
[42:17.640 --> 42:24.440]  conference of cardinals that the earth is flat and anyone who says otherwise will be burned at the
[42:24.440 --> 42:33.480]  stake and the un says we find at this meeting that the sun has no effect on the climate of the earth
[42:33.480 --> 42:40.360]  we said so it's humans fault pay us taxes let us regulate and decide who can have businesses
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.960]  in factories or we'll shut you down the oceans will rise and everyone will die immediately
[42:50.360 --> 42:57.240]  but but continuing here uh blizzard ice storm nasty cold weather aimed at midwest the east
[42:58.040 --> 43:06.440]  they're reporting in the news storm could be one of the worst on record dumping feet of snow
[43:06.440 --> 43:13.640]  uh i was just reading that of all things uh midwestern airports are shut down not just
[43:13.640 --> 43:19.560]  not just eastern airports all of this is going on and what does national news report
[43:20.280 --> 43:24.280]  they have different scientific groups on with no proof no facts and they
[43:24.280 --> 43:29.000]  they can't even say it with a straight face uh if you can't um see this video that you're
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.080]  listening on the radio i've asked curtain demo and paul watson on info wars dot com and prison
[43:33.080 --> 43:39.320]  bonnet dot com to post the video uh that we're about to play but here's the reporter talking
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.880]  about the record cold weather and everything and they cut to the so-called scientist who
[43:44.760 --> 43:48.920]  has to contain herself to not laugh and looks like she's been caught with her hand in the
[43:48.920 --> 43:52.920]  cookie jar i mean it looks like when i come around the corner and my son's acting suspicious
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.480]  and i go what's going on i go what do you got in your pockets you you got up in the cupboard and
[43:57.480 --> 44:04.280]  got extra cookies before dinner and he's like yeah i mean she looks just like my son when i catch him
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.840]  because he's the only one that can climb all all the way at the top of the pantry and get the
[44:08.840 --> 44:14.600]  cookies out where my wife keeps the sweets for treats i mean just absolutely guilty of sin
[44:15.160 --> 44:20.520]  like salvester caught with twitty bird in his mouth with the feathers sticking out and they
[44:20.520 --> 44:27.880]  just tell us oh it's the carbon is driving unnatural weather yes folks if you read the accounts
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.120]  there have been times in the colonies and and and time since then when entire rivers
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.440]  that haven't been frozen since have been frozen there were times where it was so cold in england
[44:39.080 --> 44:45.800]  if you go back 350 400 years ago they called the little ice age where for years the thames river
[44:45.800 --> 44:51.480]  that hasn't been frozen over since would be frozen as hard as a rock and no ships could come in
[44:52.040 --> 45:00.760]  around the clock not just in the winter but you know for an entire year or more frozen frozen solid
[45:00.760 --> 45:08.200]  because there are many cycles and even scientists then with their telescopes found a correlation
[45:08.200 --> 45:13.240]  between cold weather and they're not being sunspots because what are sunspots when the sun heats up
[45:13.240 --> 45:19.960]  and puts off more radiation you see sunspots because those are really giant explosions out into space
[45:19.960 --> 45:26.200]  in some cases tens of thousands of times the size of the earth so you better believe when the sun's
[45:26.200 --> 45:32.840]  exploding and and heating up and shooting off these giant coronal ejections that that's going
[45:32.840 --> 45:40.200]  to affect our weather but the un has said it does not affect it no and if you pay a carbon
[45:40.200 --> 45:48.120]  indulgence to al gore he will wave his magic pixie wand like tinkerbell and and and and and
[45:48.120 --> 45:54.200]  will fix all of the problems because remember under kiyoto china india mexico the list goes on
[45:54.200 --> 46:01.320]  and on over 160 other countries have to make zero cuts zero so where is the industry going to go
[46:01.320 --> 46:06.280]  they're going to go there where there's not all those taxes and what where do the globalist own
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.400]  and and have the sweetheart deals with the third world dictators those third world countries so
[46:11.400 --> 46:16.920]  their businesses the globalist factories get to operate unfettered and anyone else who doesn't
[46:16.920 --> 46:22.040]  have the inside track just like with opama you don't pay him campaign money you don't get the
[46:22.040 --> 46:30.760]  waiver on health care he he he waves the magic al gore uh you know pixie wand and and everything's
[46:30.760 --> 46:38.520]  okay this is classic brazen tyranny where you've got to lick the boot of the government and pay
[46:38.520 --> 46:43.000]  them the indulgences and then you're allowed to operate so let's go ahead and play this amazing
[46:43.000 --> 46:49.960]  clip from cnn where they're telling us this cold weather is a response to to the global warming
[46:49.960 --> 46:57.400]  the climate change the carbon dioxide all this carbon that's what's causing it here it is so
[46:57.400 --> 47:01.640]  why are we getting so much snow we're joining me now from washington dc as climate scientists
[47:01.640 --> 47:06.840]  and as we're old with the union of concerned scientists brenda good morning good morning
[47:06.840 --> 47:11.080]  do people kind of glare at you these days or what's that like you know if we take a look at these
[47:11.080 --> 47:16.680]  snow totals so far we've got a graphic here so far this winter new york city has gotten 56.1
[47:16.680 --> 47:24.120]  inches um we usually get about 22 look at boston's gotten 60.3 inches their average is almost 42
[47:24.120 --> 47:32.120]  philly already seeing almost 38 inches their average is closer to 20 what is going on okay what
[47:32.120 --> 47:38.920]  what's really going on is that we are overloading the atmosphere with extra carbon which is trapping
[47:38.920 --> 47:44.920]  extra heat because we burn lots of coal and oil and so what this is doing is turbo charging
[47:44.920 --> 47:50.680]  weather patterns so what we see is that in the spring and the summer in places where it rains
[47:50.680 --> 47:57.400]  we are recording much heavier rainfall and in the summer in the winter time we are also recording
[47:57.400 --> 48:03.560]  much heavier snow storms in other words climate change is creating a new normal of weather extremes
[48:03.560 --> 48:10.920]  and we have to plan for this and and prepare our snow removal budgets for such a okay so it goes on
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.400]  from there and i got that confused i saw a similar cnn clip where they're saying the same thing that
[48:15.400 --> 48:22.120]  was msnbc and you look at her almost laughing the entire time so the so the reporter comes in like
[48:22.120 --> 48:28.440]  boy you global warming alarmist from the concerned you know scientist group uh you know you is just
[48:28.440 --> 48:35.640]  discrediting you and she's like no ha ha it's uh the the carbon is causing more extreme weather
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.720]  and when they have tornadoes they get on the local news and say climate change we've always had
[48:41.720 --> 48:47.720]  tornadoes there's always extreme climate going on in the thousands of microclimates
[48:47.720 --> 48:54.680]  around the world there have been so many cases it's on record of of of blizzard after blizzard
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.760]  after blizzard after blizzard after blizzard so you've got to love this spin they go from three
[49:00.760 --> 49:05.960]  years ago saying we're not going to have snow anymore you saw the headlines snowless winners
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.880]  we'll never see another white christmas in the us global warming al gore said seven years ago
[49:11.880 --> 49:17.960]  that within seven years and now that time is up that we would see the sea levels rise and
[49:17.960 --> 49:24.760]  gobble up new york and san diego and san francisco and now he said again last year again within
[49:24.760 --> 49:32.040]  seven years it would happen again and and no one calls them on it so now they've shifted remember
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.560]  early last year we got a internal memo the new york times reported on it from the white house
[49:37.560 --> 49:43.160]  saying nobody's buying global warming anymore we got to call it climate change and that's the new
[49:43.160 --> 49:48.600]  term and so whatever it is they can claim that if it gets hotter it's global warming you know if
[49:48.600 --> 49:53.320]  it gets hotter some summer or if it gets colder in the summer or colder in the winter or hotter in
[49:53.320 --> 50:00.280]  the winter no matter what the weather is they are going to save you and we've got to get ready with
[50:00.280 --> 50:06.600]  our budgets you know so that we can dig out of the new ice age caused by the global warming
[50:06.600 --> 50:12.200]  and remember the day after tomorrow that came out about a decade ago they kind of hedged their bets
[50:12.200 --> 50:19.400]  with that movie where the global warming causes a global freeze so they're really hedging their
[50:19.400 --> 50:24.200]  bets since you go back to the 70s john p holder and and others in the un said that we were going
[50:24.200 --> 50:29.480]  to have an ice age by 1990 it was going to be devastating because of carbon dioxide and then
[50:29.480 --> 50:35.480]  that didn't happen so by the late 80s they said no no no now it's global warming and then they said
[50:35.480 --> 50:38.840]  well people are going to wake up to that they said well we'll just go ahead and hedge our bets
[50:38.840 --> 50:47.800]  and say no matter what happens humans did it okay i want to get into the situation with the tsa
[50:48.600 --> 50:56.600]  invades roads and highways with viper checkpoints and that report by paul joseph watson is up on

[53:02.200 --> 53:07.240]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[53:07.240 --> 53:12.200]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[53:12.200 --> 53:17.480]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[53:17.480 --> 53:22.920]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[53:22.920 --> 53:28.600]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.720]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.280]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[53:38.280 --> 53:42.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[53:42.840 --> 53:49.960]  offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[53:49.960 --> 53:55.880]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[53:55.880 --> 54:05.880]  or call 1-H77-327-0365
[54:17.080 --> 54:19.880]  so much going on so much going on
[54:19.880 --> 54:27.000]  so many things going on in the world show
[54:29.640 --> 54:35.320]  if this show acclimates you to the new world order then it's helping the globalist but i
[54:35.320 --> 54:40.680]  believe and i know that people can consciously from an unemotional view realize what's happening
[54:40.680 --> 54:45.400]  and stand up against it but if we talk about government plans to push in plantable microchips
[54:45.400 --> 54:51.480]  on the elderly on prisoners for years and then the media starts actually pushing it in a way it
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.920]  almost just conditions people to accept it even though we don't like it it becomes a foregone
[54:56.920 --> 55:03.560]  conclusion and it's the same thing with the tsa i remember as i've said 150 times probably governor
[55:03.560 --> 55:10.440]  ridge on c span in 2002 before homeland security even got a cabinet position and congressional
[55:10.440 --> 55:15.800]  funding saying you're gonna have a federal id card to work we're gonna have federal security
[55:15.800 --> 55:20.840]  guards on every street corner we're gonna have checkpoints you're gonna have an internal passport
[55:20.840 --> 55:26.760]  to travel and i remember them talking about that now they admit with the real id a few years ago
[55:26.760 --> 55:31.240]  they tried to threaten the states instead of you don't implement a federally issued and controlled
[55:31.240 --> 55:37.560]  id card to the state level we are going to not let you international parks or get on airplanes
[55:37.560 --> 55:44.760]  so it's the seizure of commerce and travel the right to be mobile that's a bedrock keystone or
[55:44.760 --> 55:51.240]  cornerstone to any oppressive system to any despotism i mean it's one of the things they've
[55:51.240 --> 55:58.360]  got to have and so now we see tsa psa saying the tsa can't always be there but we'll try
[55:58.360 --> 56:06.040]  like at uh football games and it shows tsa at uh a buccaneers football game and it shows them at
[56:06.040 --> 56:12.520]  hotels and it shows the tsa at malls searching people and they're at train stations and bus
[56:12.520 --> 56:19.400]  stations and so they're phasing this in and it's a violation of the tenth amendment uh it's a
[56:19.400 --> 56:24.680]  violation of the state's rights it's a violation of your fourth amendment and watson has another
[56:24.680 --> 56:30.360]  article of you know cops running around in ski mask warrantlessly in alabama on a highway just
[56:30.360 --> 56:38.040]  pulling people off into a parking lot and searching them uh i mean that's it doesn't take a rocket
[56:38.040 --> 56:44.040]  scientist to know that that's the sign of a banana republic third world despotic system and now
[56:44.040 --> 56:50.040]  watson has this article uh where the tsa is announcing and again media isn't reporting on this
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.280]  we're getting this from tsa announcements we're getting this from trucking companies and getting
[56:54.280 --> 57:00.680]  their drivers ready for it uh where they have mobile x-ray trucks they're using the army we
[57:00.680 --> 57:05.800]  have a link to a fox news report on that from last year and they just in the middle of the country

[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.800]  africa as the globalists take credit for what's happening i'm not even sure if that's true they
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:53.720]  may just be trying to maneuver their people into the power vacuum as the people rebel against those
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:01.080]  western installed and backed authoritarian oppressive states but if you just joined us i was
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:09.000]  getting into paul joseph watson's article that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.080]  it deals with the tsa with their open press releases and their announcements and by the way
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:23.080]  this is already going on tsa invades roads and highways with viper checkpoints they've announced
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.800]  the internal checkpoint program to be expanded up until now commercial trucks and other vehicles
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.440]  only were subject to warrantless searches and radiation scans at special lead designated
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.080]  state-owned inspection stations traditionally set up at rest stops next to highways these
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.480]  internal checkpoints run by homeland security you notice now they're putting up highway barriers
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.360]  even in rural areas um these internal checkpoints run by homeland security the department of
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.480]  transportation the tsa involved trucks being scanned with backscatter x-ray devices in the
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.200]  name of safety and the poor fools out there running them are getting radiated and they also have the
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.400]  truck drivers drive under them these inspection stations are now being expanded to normal roads
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.680]  and highways unleashing an army of tsa agents who will be given a free hand to litter america
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.640]  with internal checkpoints and a chilling throwback to soviet-style levels of control over the
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.600]  population but the mexican trucks will be exempt inspectors from the transportation
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.320]  security administration tsa are likely to be more involved in roadside inspections of commercial
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:29.160]  vehicles according to tsa officials reports the industry website bolttransporter.com quote
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:36.040]  viper teams can be extremely effective you know serving as a visible presence that is a random
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:42.440]  and unpredictable says william errington with the tsa viper teams are an essential part of
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:48.120]  protecting highway transportation vehicles and other critical infrastructure see that's how
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.560]  they hire your preachers to spy on you your doctors your lawyers your neighbors it's all under
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.080]  infrastructure protection all the globalist industrialize the infrastructure the report
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:04.920]  also notes that viper team members may or not be in uniform oh now if we did a whole another
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:13.960]  headline tsa to have secret police or plain clothes agents i mean this is the spy network
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.520]  the report also notes that viper team members may or may not be in uniform stoking fears about
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.240]  the use of secret police mounting checkpoints which will be more befitting of a soviet union
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.200]  of former east germany as we've documented airport security style checkpoints and inspection
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.160]  procedures are already in place at bus terminals train stations and are rapidly expanding to the
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:40.040]  streets of america and now they have to see something say something uh program uh where they
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:47.160]  are uh running around uh i mean i mean this is so hard for me to deal with this is so hard
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.240]  for me to even be able to comprehend that it's happening even though i've done the research
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.440]  on this information even though i constantly have studied how other oppressive systems are
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:06.040]  brought in and the article goes on this is such an important story we have got to get this out
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:12.600]  to our legislatures especially i mean this is a federal illegal globalist seizure of the entire

[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:09.880]  20 minutes we've got a big announcement that just is launching today i'm told and that is a group of
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:18.120]  doctors and health practitioners mds phd's indies coming together with a public document just like
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.640]  the scientists and toxicologists have done that with the sodium fluoride exposing how dangerous
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:29.160]  it is and uh one of the leaders in this movement is dr sherry tenpenny the health rangers involved
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:36.600]  as well mike adams uh she of course is a respected uh uh medical doctor and is one of the country's
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.320]  most knowledgeable and outspoken physicians regarding the use of vaccines on health as a
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.560]  member of the prestigious national speakers association dr tenpenny is an outspoken advocate
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.280]  of free choice in health care including the right to refuse vaccination she's a graduate of
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.080]  university at teledo teledo ohio she received her medical training at curtsville college
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.080]  in osteopathic medicine in curtsville missouri dr tenpenny is board certified in emergency medicine
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:10.040]  and of course is also an author dr tenpenny dot com is the site but i wanted to go over
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:17.320]  um this big move forming this organization of doctors who are the ones that actually have
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.600]  the facts on what big pharma is doing but first there's a lot of reports vaccines being recalled
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:29.320]  for pig viruses that can cause hiv type uh uh illnesses in the pigs very closely associated
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.840]  to human autoimmune disorders and cancers uh we're seeing reports of tenfold increases in
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.360]  seizures in england so the government took one of the flu vaccines off the market i mean uh we
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:46.040]  saw record low numbers of people in o nine and now last year taking the flu shot uh we even
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.600]  saw the british medical journal come out admit that that was basically all the hoax uh wolf king
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.840]  woodard the head of the e u commission at the time was on this show saying that the whole h1n1
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.680]  situation was a fraud vindicating and confirming dr sherry tenpenny dr blaylock and countless other
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.600]  doctors and scientists that have been talking about this so i wanted to go over the fact that
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.560]  they are trying to push worldwide for forced inoculation and they're intimidating people
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:15.080]  and they're places of work and other things and uh but but the battle is joined people are really
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.120]  starting to wake up to this and dr sherry tenpenny joins us with this big new announcement doc thanks
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.600]  for coming on with us thank you for having alex good afternoon good to have you here let's get
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.520]  into some of the latest developments dealing with vaccines and the hundreds they're trying to get
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.920]  approved and some of the adverse reactions then let's get into this big new announcement uh with
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:40.120]  the vaccine uh council dot org a special report the backdrop of what you said about how many
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.520]  vaccines are coming down the pike there was a business wire news announcement that came out
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:50.040]  about two weeks ago out of pennsylvania that said that there were 330 vaccines currently
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.720]  in development there were 95 of them currently standing by waiting for approval now we know
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:01.640]  from the politics and from the uh the government rules in this country that most of those vaccines
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:07.320]  are going to end up in the pediatric vaccination schedule in order for the for the companies to
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:13.480]  have liability protection to keep from getting sued so we've got another not only do we already
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.360]  have 40 doses of 16 different vaccines that kids get by the time that they're in kindergarten
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.720]  we've got dozens more coming down the line probably mostly being targeted at adolescence
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.200]  because that is the big push inside the vaccine industry is to get the teens vaccinated and of
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.440]  course for those that don't know once they can have a governor or somebody mandated the media
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.720]  then runs the hoax and says you must take it but once it's mandated by government then it gets
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.760]  liability protection like the garter cell if it kills you well that's too bad because they've
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:51.160]  got liability protection that's correct that's correct incredible and i just following the news
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.640]  i see reports of deaths and convulsions and all sorts of autoimmune responses are just pouring
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.040]  out everywhere and even the australian government is being honest about it saying yeah these vaccines
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:08.360]  are killing people yes and as far as we know right now that as of about the first of january 2011
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:15.320]  that there are at least 87 confirmed deaths from the garter cell vaccine and so we have confirmed
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.640]  deaths that we're taking teenagers who were perfectly healthy they were scholars and athletes
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.040]  and musicians and we give them this garter cell vaccine and then shortly after that they either
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:30.360]  have seizure disorders autoimmune disorders or they die and yet the government now not only do they
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.640]  not call that off the market now what they're doing is doubling their market share by recommending the
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:42.120]  garter cell vaccine for little boys so what we've done with this document alex says this uh the
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:48.200]  international medical council on vaccination which is vaccination council dot org put together a group
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.320]  well i started this document with dr susanne humphries we started it about a year ago and we
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.720]  wanted to make just some close notes some very salient points that parents and activists could
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.200]  use to make the point that vaccines are not safe they're not effective they don't protect you and
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.600]  yes they're harmful and then from there what we said was i wonder how many other doctors would agree
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:13.720]  with us and when we release this doc this document there are 70 positions md's do's a few chiropractors
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:19.160]  some rn some phd's but the 70 people people that you've never heard of people that are not mainstream
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.320]  like you and i are or dr blaylock and have said come forward to say yes we agree in principle
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:31.080]  with this document that that we want to stop vaccination and we think it's a 200 year mistake
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.160]  so one of our goals with releasing this and with the help of mike adams through natural news that
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.040]  through your show and some others and some other radio programs today is that we're wanting to
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:47.000]  collect a million a million signatures of people that in principle can get behind this
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.120]  if you're an md a do a health care worker that practices in a conventional situation
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:59.720]  even like a respiratory therapist or an x-ray tech a nurse a pharmacist the third category is if
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.280]  you're a health care worker that doesn't practice in a conventional setting or if you are just a
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.240]  concerned citizen a non-health care worker that you believe in principles with these documents
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.120]  that vaccines can cause problems we're asking you to get on board so we can have those signatures
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.320]  and go to the state legislators and ensure that they get left with legislation passed to ensure
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:25.320]  you're right to say no so bottom line a year of deep research doctors and prestigious scientists
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:32.360]  all over the world shining onto this tacking you know this letter you know to the door of the corrupt
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:39.000]  big pharma trying to take over medicine the unbelievable carnage caused by them and this
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:47.640]  is a huge offensive in defense of medical choice and against this medical tyranny very very exciting
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.560]  and i'm glad you're announcing this and launching in here today vaccine counsel.org and this is
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.760]  something you need to get into your health departments into your public schools into decision
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:05.240]  makers so they understand that a large body of prestigious medical doctors and others are on record
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:11.640]  and and and really chronicling with with with the scientific data the scourge that has become
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.640]  big pharma's revolution of pushing vaccines on us we go do this now with bill gates you know
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:25.160]  launching genetically engineered mosquitoes that forcibly inoculate us when the mosquito
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:30.680]  sucks our blood the government's trying to engineer it into food go ahead there's other
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.480]  really cool thing about this document alex and i know through the internet that you that that this
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.520]  will go everywhere because this document is not only being released in english it's being released
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:48.360]  in greek spanish kibru french turkish dutch russian and icelandic even and turkish we're
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:54.200]  waiting for doctor documents to come back from norway chinese and japan and so we've got dog
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.040]  we've got physicians and practitioners all over the world that are signing on to this and saying
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:06.200]  we support the fact that vaccination is causing more harm than good and it must be stopped
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.560]  now let's quantify the information folks will find at vaccine council dot org
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:18.200]  and what you're hoping people will do with this information what i really want people to do is
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.440]  to go out and read the document quite frankly alex there's most of the things that are in there
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.560]  unless you're completely new to the vaccine industry and are just now sticking your toe in
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.520]  the water to find out what all of this nonsense is about most of this information are things that
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.440]  you can find readily elsewhere we just pulled it all together and put it in one concise document
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.640]  and i believe that what the government is doing when they did with stars with bird flu with swine
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.800]  flu what they've actually done to dr wakefield in their sense of punitive symbolism of what
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.600]  they are doing what they have done to him they are taking the american public and the canadiens
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:59.240]  and all these other people who maybe never even thought to question vaccines and are pulling
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.360]  their head up out of the sand to go and wow maybe i'd look into this and the vast majority of people
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.240]  who do serious research and looking into the problems associated with vaccines say wow i'm not
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:15.320]  doing that anymore i stop so the harder they push the more that they're finding that the grassroots
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:21.000]  revolution is starting against this whole set of ways that we're making our children the sickest
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.560]  children in the world well we could talk for hours about this we'll definitely have you

[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:34.160]  Tenpenny is our guest and if you look at all the statistics the numbers the
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.240]  globalist hoax of vaccines is caving in but they're rushing forward trying to
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.040]  force us back under their control dr. Sherry Tenpenny of those points I ran
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.560]  over with this big launch today that you have put out the vaccination council
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.200]  org very exciting information of those points that that this sheet documents
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.000]  and links to larger reports on that everybody should read what is most
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.360]  important I think what the most important thing is Alex is the fact that
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.880]  number one you cannot unvaccinate so you make illnesses come and go like the
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.760]  flu pertussis whatever illnesses come and go but if you vaccinate and you
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.080]  have it every have a reaction you cannot unvaccinate and health doesn't come
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.960]  through a needle we know that illnesses come and go health does not come through
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.080]  a needle and you can vaccinate and you can still get the disease and each shot
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.440]  it's really like Russian roulette you never know when you're going to get the
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.880]  bullet to your head and if pro-vaccine folks claim that reactions are one in a
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.080]  million they're referring to the most serious reactions they never mentioned
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.280]  the millions of reactions that cause problems that that do not result into
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.040]  death so I believe that there's thousands that have never vaccinated that I
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.880]  think it's a rare parent who wishes that they would and I think that the all
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.800]  the information in here is so concise and that there are so many links and if
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.440]  people want to go directly to the document if they go to dr. Tenpenny
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.560]  dot com on the home page there's a link to the document there's a link to where
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.360]  you can sign up for your support of the document and I think that we can get a
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.640]  lot a lot of traction out of this Alex to get a huge number of health care
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.280]  workers to come out of the closet and stand up to say I don't want to be
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.360]  vaccinated in order to get a job I want a lot of parents to come forth and say I
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.960]  don't want my kids vaccinated in order to go to a very expensive college
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.360]  education we've got to be able to ensure that people have the right to say
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.880]  no well I totally agree and of course our IQs are dropping we when you talk
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.320]  about us having one of the most unhealthy populations in the world no one
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.720]  can deny it you've got bare pharmaceutical caught for 10 years
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.920]  shipping out factor 8 knowing it had HIV and hepatitis I mean it's time for
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.880]  these groups to be held accountable to stop getting away with it absolutely an
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.640]  accountability is the thing I mean they are so protected by the government
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.000]  everybody from the top down the pharmaceutical industries are protected
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.080]  doctors the nurses at the public health department everybody is protected what
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.080]  other industry out there is like that none well remember the two reports out of
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.800]  Canada prestigious groups found that there was a doubling of your chances
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.720]  of getting a regular flu a lowering of the overall immune system if you had the
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.720]  H1N1 shot I know that's that's a dovetail into why vaccinated children
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.560]  have far worse health outcomes than unvaccinated children and then you link
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.800]  to all the numbers and facts encapsulate that that key point for folks it's
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.120]  really important to understand that the vaccines they do really lower lower your
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.560]  immune system and make you more susceptible like you just said that the
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:39.160]  reports came out that if you got the H1N1 vaccine it increased your risk of
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.840]  having that having the flu and if we're so good for us and if all these other
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.640]  vaccines were so good for us why is it that the government has to pass laws in
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.360]  order to require us to have them I mean if it was so good for us and it would
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.160]  make us so healthy we there wouldn't even be this controversy but the
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.960]  government is not willing to put money on the line to do a vaccinated children
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.360]  versus unvaccinated children study to look at the health group of that and
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.880]  there's actually an organization in Europe that is actually doing an online
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.240]  poll of unvaccinated children they've got 3,800 case reports so far in their
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.840]  database and they're crunching the numbers and show and asking very simple
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.680]  questions like if your child is unvaccinated unvaccinated by the age
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.080]  of five how many doses of antibiotics have they been on how many how many times
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.480]  have they been to the hospital are they under any chronic long-term medications
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.960]  things that are very quantifiable that we can demonstrate that the health of
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.680]  unvaccinated children is much superior to the health of those children who are
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.480]  fully vaccinated well it's also important this is mirrored at natural

[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.640]  out to everybody at info wars dot com from dr. Sherry 10 penny I cannot stress
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:14.320]  enough that this is a devastating report documenting big pharma buying off media
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.160]  and government knowing it's hurting people getting liability protection so
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.440]  they can hurt people and they're moved to try to force vaccination not just
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.560]  here in the u.s. but worldwide all the proof is there and it's up to you and
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:33.680]  you've done a great job to carry the ball to get this information out to
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.760]  everyone and to expose the globalist and their medical eugenical tyranny that
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.560]  they're carrying out okay obviously Jordan's monarchy has replaced government
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.720]  and reaction to protest curtain demos got the report on that also the AP
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.200]  reporting Jordan King fires cabinet amid protest yeah it's an appointed
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.120]  government by the monarchy and their monarchy runs things and their people
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.560]  are angry and the West knows that there's major rebellions doing so they're
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:10.320]  trying and in Egypt and other places to maneuver their people into place we're
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.800]  seeing cryptic statements by George Soros by the usual suspects I like
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.560]  Kissinger you know bragging about how this is a play and that this is only the
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.480]  first first scene in the first act the whole world is a stage each of us
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.520]  players upon it as William Shakespeare wrote CFR's galb says Egyptian
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.000]  protesters cannot be trusted at the Muslim brotherhoods involved well it
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.160]  turns out they're being funded by our own governments continuing here Mubarak
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:43.120]  may flee to Israel not Saudi Arabia the press is reporting corporate US media's
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.360]  woeful sanitized Egypt coverage amounts to censorship another report by Steve
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.880]  Watson massive crowds across Egypt demand Mubarak Alster still up in the
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.680]  air what's going to happen with him he's been reshuffling his cabinet as if
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.720]  that's a change Iran says Egypt events Herald Islamic Middle East they like
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.120]  what's happening continuing Muslim brotherhood says prepare Egyptians for
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.000]  war with Israel and then they're admittedly run by Western and British
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.480]  intelligence again they they want this to be unstable they want to bring in a
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.320]  crisis in the Middle East great story from Eric Blair at info wars.com the
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:27.440]  Pharaoh will fall oil will climb and Wall Street will win and he breaks down
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:32.680]  why they stand to gain from that and then we have all these disgusting articles
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.160]  like out of the London independent Muhammad Elberide the man who would be
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:41.880]  president exclusive interview Robert Fisk meets Muhammad Elberide Egypt's
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:47.360]  savior in waiting this is the open globalist new world order person and
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.680]  they're just openly admitting that they're running him and trying to put
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:55.000]  him in and then the less triggered these these protests it isn't saying there
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.160]  aren't legitimate reasons to protest the point is the globalist have created this
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.840]  dictator prompting him up for 30 years now they're trying to give him a new
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:08.720]  fresh face just incredible that that's going on but right now let's go to your
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.040]  phone calls then we got David Ike coming up at about 25 minutes and we also have
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.120]  got a bunch of other important news we're going to be breaking down on the
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.120]  economic front right now Anna Marie in New York you're on the year Alex hey
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.880]  welcome hey Alex how are you glad to finally talk to you to talk to you what's
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.440]  on your mind I got two comments I wanted to make first of all I wanted to let you
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.520]  know that I am a Christian I've been watching and listening to you for several
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.760]  years now I am a hardcore info warrior gal and I finally I've woken up to the
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.560]  tyranny and I thank you for that my comment is that I turned my calendar
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:52.440]  this morning to the new month of February 1st 2011 and on my calendar it
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.960]  says National Freedom Day and I kind of thought that was a little bit of a joke
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.280]  because we have no freedoms left we have nothing but tyranny left in this
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.200]  country and I'm just wondering what's it gonna say on next year's calendar is
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.960]  it gonna be National Communist Day and then maybe the following year and what
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.920]  they do is they never called tyranny tyranny they call it new freedom that's
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.600]  what they called six years ago the government's move to try to medicate
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.760]  half of American school children that's in the new freedom initiative it's a new
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.440]  freedom to be a mind-numbed zombie but we still have a lot of freedoms left
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.240]  because they live in us and we're exercising them but there's no doubt the
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:34.920]  system the ruling political class is trying to overturn every bedrock canon
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:40.400]  of a free society that's absolutely true and I feel the same way and I'm just so
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.760]  shocked every day that what goes on that sometimes I feel completely helpless
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.560]  that you know what can I do I mean I've I've spread the word I've done so much
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.440]  but yet I feel at some level that it's not working that where we're kind of
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.520]  falling but that's a lie that's a lie from seeing himself and Anna you got to
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.520]  look at the growth curve they've been sent this tyranny up for a long time
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.560]  taken over society becoming wealthy from it and and and and now we're turning it
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.640]  around but it takes time but the resistance is mounting the system is
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.000]  panicking at many levels even some of their internal documents that aren't
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.560]  secret but but aren't widely published you know Brzezinski and others admit
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.960]  that the system is basically riding a tiger but but good to hear from you
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.360]  great points Anna Marie let's go ahead and talk to David in Ohio David
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:32.680]  welcome yeah hi Alex hey today good uh hey really I'm really amazed at your
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.240]  boldness and your courage and and everything you do I just want to make
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.640]  a few statements on the on the knocker nation that I mean he goes back to the
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:49.240]  twine flu of the Hong Kong flu in 1977 and then as me and you probably had that
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:54.360]  I think it was 17 in one shot that left a little bump on our arm you know
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.800]  they're you're some of the smallpox but I think that was just one thing but they
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.800]  are creating all these new vaccines with two three four five six different
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:06.120]  things in it just overwhelming the immune system and and they admit in every
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.080]  major study that vaccines lower your overall immune system just like
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:17.640]  antibiotics do and then they're filled with dead fetal tissue cancer viruses I
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.320]  mean it's it's it's incredible what they're pumping into us and that's why
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.800]  they go to the government and get liability protection I mean would you
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.080]  buy a car that had liability protection imagine if there was a car company that
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.800]  was allowed to make cars that could have exploding gas tanks and brakes that
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:42.560]  don't work I mean it's it's crazy exactly but back in our day when we had
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.760]  those shots that bumped up on our arms everyone now had those which they
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:55.640]  could given a shot has back problems that generate degeneration back well
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.920]  there actually are quite a few studies that show that it causes autoimmune
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.560]  responses in the joints and that's one of the contributing factors along with
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.720]  sodium fluoride for the epidemic of early onset or or or new types of
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:15.680]  arthritis appreciate the call David let's talk to Jonathan in Kansas Jonathan
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:23.040]  you're on the air yes Alex did you know that the Spokane MLK parade that bomb
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:30.600]  that was planted had an anti blood clotting agent in it no I didn't know
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.880]  that I remember hearing about a supposed bomb and usually those are
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.280]  government provocateurs or government doing it but they had a bunch of bomb
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.760]  scares a few weeks ago but I can pull up an article and it had an anti blood
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.880]  clotting agent well you can actually pull up the video it's on YouTube it's
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  it was a it was like a local news thing it's called look up on YouTube called
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:03.000]  bomb planted at Spokane MLK parade had anti blood clotting chemical agent and
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.800]  that basically my I what came to my mind was we had Frederick Whitehurst he
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.840]  talked about how the anti blood clotting agents is you know that some they
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:21.280]  have at the crime labs there may be and maybe some like the police provocateur
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.800]  that something like that what is that chemical supposedly explosive I mean I
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.720]  don't know the chemistry of it but I haven't seen that report but we'll
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.920]  check it out when I was talking about the factor 8 anti blood clotting agent
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.440]  that's where they take giant amounts of blood and centrifuge it and then take the
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.800]  platelets out and then repackage it and then inject the platelets into
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.040]  hemophiliacs and others that have similar blood disorders and they
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:54.080]  knowingly knew that every ampoule of it for more than a decade had HIV and
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.800]  different types of hepatitis in it and then it was a death sentence for those
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:01.560]  that took it so that's the type of anti blood clotting agent that I was talking
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:08.480]  about is a biological one not a not a chemical one but expanding on that
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.440]  Whitehurst was talking mainly about blood preservatives that they put in
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.240]  blood samples we're talking about OJ Simpson whether you love him or hating
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.280]  the police did take blood samples from him and then go planet because it was
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.760]  confirmed that that very preservative was in the blood that that the LAPD used
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.160]  that they had taken blood samples from him of course Whitehurst talked about
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.440]  crime labs all over the country and the FBI crime lab just framing people in
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.000]  mass I appreciate your call that's what's so dangerous about DNA testing they
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.400]  can just say that they got a positive or a negative they it's such a culture of
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.960]  lying I have another news report here that Paul Watson put together and it
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.680]  links to the you know actual videos of the testimonies schemasquaring thug
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:59.040]  assist police at checkpoint in Houston County and it shows a checkpoint on a
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.440]  highway and I appreciate your call Jonathan it shows a checkpoint on a
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.480]  highway where the police just pull your cars into a church parking lot and I've
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.240]  seen checkpoints like this myself I've been directed into them in Texas and
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.480]  there's lawsuits in the court say they can't do it but the feds come in and
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:19.640]  give them grants and the cops still do it and it's this cop running around with
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:25.480]  other police says state police with no badge with a mask on in fact I can show
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.120]  folks a shot of that if we're watching on prisonplanet.tv and then you scroll
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:35.160]  down they have the testimony of folks and in one case they bumped the back of a
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:38.640]  guy's car as he was pulling in so then they flipped out and charged him with
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.760]  trying to flee police even though he stopped and then they tried to say that
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:48.240]  he had drugs in his car and only after one good officer wouldn't go along with
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.200]  it did they not framing I mean let's go back to just a couple years ago the
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.320]  Dallas Police Department this was on the news framed thousands they would pull
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.240]  over a nice car randomly throw a bag of chalk in the back or real cocaine and
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.960]  then take your car then they would get a warrant for your house throw a bag of
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:11.560]  chalk at your house and take it and then cops would get a percentage of it see
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.600]  under state law in all 50 states the feds got a federal law passed then got
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.240]  states to adopt it police don't get basically any of the money if they sees
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.200]  it at the state level but then the feds pass another law that if they give the
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:29.640]  money to the feds or the cars or homes of the feds then they can give up to 80
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.880]  percent back to the local police so that also incentivizes federalizing police
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.960]  and when you realize that the Dallas crime lab the Tulia Texas crime lab the
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.840]  San Antonio crime lab just where I live the San Francisco crime lab last year
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.200]  that's what we had Frederick Widers back on every major crime lab they just frame
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.840]  people in mass I mean it is normal and how many squad car videos have you seen
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.000]  where the cops catch themselves where they'll pull out drugs and then plan it
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:05.960]  on somebody now is that saying all cops are doing this no but just in my
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.840]  experience in high school and I was somebody that liked to drink beer when
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.720]  I could get it I did not like marijuana you know I've tried marijuana off and on
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.920]  every time I try it I don't like it you know my thing is coffee cigarettes and
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.680]  alcohol and I've you know off and on quit all of those it's a real battle but
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.400]  but the issue is I was a clean guy and I saw the police coming to parties
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.560]  delivering drugs and then I would be pulled over an hour later and they
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.280]  dig around in the bottom of the truck when I'd be riding around with friends
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.680]  they'd find a six pack of beer and start put this in handcuffs and I shot my
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:49.320]  mouth off to him and you know said said you know you guys are dealing drugs how
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:55.240]  dare you you know take us to jail and as a juvenile was taken a couple times for
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:02.320]  beer I mean I know you you're a drug dealer and they would just turn red and
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.600]  just go mmm you're lucky somebody didn't hang you in your cell they might as
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:09.760]  lawyer called him and said they are threatening that he'll be found hung in
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.440]  a cell if you don't leave Rockwell Texas and we move because of that and
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.280]  thank God I love Austin compared to Dallas but I mean I have experienced this
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.680]  I experienced during that whole time of this happening being called down to the
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.600]  office by the school cop closing the door in the principal's office nobody in
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.080]  the room him slamming me down on the table it put me in handcuffs slamming me
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.760]  down and telling me that I was gonna go to prison that I was gonna be raped and
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:40.120]  get AIDS and that I better shut my mouth about cop drug dealing and then
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:46.280]  John McWhorter the right around that time the sheriff got caught you know in
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.520]  drug dealing and other police got caught and my dad had a little session out at
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.120]  the airport at the time and and he knew the old World War two vet that ran in
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.560]  that old vet you know who my dad took flying lessons from learn how to fly
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.680]  from watching my dad learn how to fly first when he lived out in East Texas
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.760]  from a World War two vet when he was like 14 but then he went back because
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:06.600]  everything hadn't been flying for a decade or whatever you got to go back and
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.400]  get the point is you know where my dad learned to fly again and he learned to
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.760]  fly helicopters I don't know why I'm telling that story but the point is out
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.440]  there at the airport the word was you don't talk about it but the cops are
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.760]  flying stuff in here now that's separate from them being actually busted so it's
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:27.680]  on record that I'd be at a party drinking beer and be up on the balcony and
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.520]  there'd be a cop in his uniform in his private truck and the cheerleader go
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.160]  down and get in the car and buy ecstasy marijuana cocaine you name it from him
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:43.000]  and they come back in the party and go crazy people like you want some of this
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.680]  I'm like no way no way do you know don't get me near that stuff because I got one
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.080]  time actually twice they said come on do some cocaine and I do and I do it and
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.400]  feel like a car wreck you ever had a bad car wreck or seen a car wreck there's
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.960]  people chopped up and hurt you're like totally awake but freaked out and feel
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.920]  dirty you know that's what cocaine felt like to me but for some people they
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.000]  obviously like it but I don't know why I'm getting off in this whole story the
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:15.080]  issue here is we must decriminalize drugs now imagine you're riding down the
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:20.000]  road there's a sign there's a checkpoint the cops are directing cars randomly into
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.320]  a parking lot and then they just start tearing your car apart and they're
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:33.640]  wearing black mask and then they plant drugs on you and I experienced this they
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  never planted drugs on me they told me they were gonna plant drugs on me or
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.360]  that they were gonna plant quote stolen stereo equipment and I said the cop I
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.080]  said you know I don't do drugs you guys know full well who I am I said you know
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.640]  I don't steal things and he they said I don't care you're gonna be raped and get
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:54.480]  AIDS you little you know bleeper and he had me over the desk slamming my head
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.320]  into the desk and leaning on me and telling me this stuff this is what
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:06.880]  runs America why do you think they make the drugs illegal so they get huge profits
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.400]  why did the mafia lobby and use a lot of foolish squares to help get it pushed
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.720]  through in the churches to make alcohol illegal because when they made
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.560]  something illegal that half the population was into a beer wasn't a
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:28.360]  nickel anymore in 1925 a beer was a dollar look up the numbers you know you
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:33.120]  could buy a bottle of gin for maybe 50 cents now a bottle of gin might be five
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:38.520]  dollars do the math they want it illegal so they can control it and make
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:42.920]  money off of it and they don't want people talking about this but in my
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:49.080]  experience growing up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area this is what I
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.960]  experienced and I wasn't even in the drug culture I just saw this at parties
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:01.040]  and things the cops are so arrogant they delivered rugs in police uniforms hi
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.560]  this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non

[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.840]  folks given their names out on air until I know who they really are and just your
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.680]  tone sounded like it was going in the wrong direction so thank you Scott in
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.600]  Texas Scott you're on the air go ahead hi Alex listen I've listened to you talk
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.240]  with Webster Carpley and Gerald Salenty and yesterday with Max Kaiser
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.320]  about basically the destiny of the dollar it seems to me that Webster
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:51.400]  Carpley has a little more faith in the longevity because of something to do with
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:58.240]  the way treasuries are traded yes nation to nation I don't know that I heard
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.200]  everything Max had to say could you kind of elaborate he thinks he seems to
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.560]  think that we're gonna collapse quicker than Webster what's your take on a
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:11.040]  lot you know I I try to have a wide spectrum of experts who I respect on
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:15.280]  who've been accurate the past there's some difference of opinion but the road
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:19.040]  we're going down is a mathematical certainty of insolvency and the end of
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.920]  the dollar and the globalist have announced they want this new global
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:25.920]  cashless currency that all of our currencies will be basically valued in
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.560]  and so they're bypassing right to the global digital currency you'll still
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:33.880]  have your regional currency it'll just be pegged to that does that answer your
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:38.200]  question that's for help but I mean we got more to say stay there if not we'll

[01:59:51.680 --> 02:00:00.680]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:25.640]  Alex Jones I have believed from the very beginning these are real grassroots
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:29.720]  uprisings all over the Middle East North Africa but when the globalists came out
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.240]  and bragged that they were behind Elbarity and others and are trying to
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.600]  take credit for it clearly they knew that these rebellions were coming so they
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:40.560]  triggered it to make sure their people got in so I think everybody who's been
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.120]  looking at this from different perspectives has been right just from
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:48.040]  different perspectives Tarpley you know has been saying that he believes that it
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:54.200]  may fail but it looks like he's wrong the drudge report right now did just
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:58.840]  have a red link that Al Arabia TV Network says it is reported that Egypt's
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.560]  Mubarak will not run for president again more details and now drudge has up the
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:09.960]  Reuters article Mubarak to give speech on Tuesday on Al Arabia TV now that
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.560]  could be a trick to get the protesters to go away to lose their momentum and
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:17.920]  then we've seen politicians claim they're not gonna run again you know
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.880]  for Senate or House when they get caught in bathrooms you know having sex
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.040]  or whatever and then later they say they're now not going to quit that
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:32.080]  could be a trick Egypt's president Hossi Mubarak will give a speech on Tuesday
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.920]  and that's supposedly today after at least one million people rallied across
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.440]  the country clamoring for him to step down Al Arabia television said there was
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.480]  no official confirmation the channel also says that Vice President Omar
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.000]  Suleiman but of course they already have been announcing on Al Jazeera and
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.360]  others so this could be a self-fulfilling prophecy situation that he had
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:01.840]  fled to London England and then to Tel Aviv Israel and it turned out that
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.040]  wasn't true so this could be a hoax but we'll find out soon but it could be a
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:11.800]  way to energize the protesters right as they are ebbing to believe that they
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.160]  won so I don't know what the truth is here about this but we'll continue to
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:20.720]  track that but reportedly he's set to give a speech soon the next 24 hours or
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.400]  so saying that he's gonna step down in September and is gonna get the country
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:29.960]  ready for transition into elections now the West wouldn't like that because then
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:34.360]  Elberide couldn't be shuttled in in the middle of this revolt over everyone's
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:40.000]  heads Larry in Louisiana then Ron Luke Richard Robert and others go ahead Larry
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.520]  yeah Alex I gotta take you back to an interview about six years ago he did
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:49.120]  with the owner of a company I think in California he was a TCO of a credit card
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:55.560]  size speaker that was a spin-off of a military weapon and could beam audio
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.280]  directly into your head I know that was 11 years ago with the CEO they won't
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.000]  let him do it in the US they do it in Japan where it beams audio directly to
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.360]  the brain out of coke machines yeah that was the MSNBC out of the wave machine
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.760]  but now the best next big sale was it was discovered that audio in a classroom
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.000]  children's classroom the ones in the front of the class couldn't hear as good
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.720]  as the ones in the back of the class so they were putting it into the public
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:27.080]  school classrooms you're kidding that was a mainstream news article that was a
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:31.320]  mainstream news article and shortly after that article I believe you heard
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:37.440]  that a fifth grade class got up and rioted all at once and they didn't know
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.840]  why well I know that with the Pokemon TV show they had tens of thousands of
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:46.440]  kids have convulsions it was confirmed that the flickering rate was doing it
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.440]  I mean this is what they can do with the television with audio with these
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.600]  systems and now Chicago announces they want to put fake bird tweets out to make
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.160]  everyone be calm the government wants to put lithium in the water to make us
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.320]  calm I mean we're living in the 21st century and we are living under more
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:10.400]  and more mind control I saw gotta be 13 years ago a Baltimore Sun article where
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:15.600]  DARPA said yes we're testing towers that put out magnetic wavelengths that calm
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:21.000]  you and during emergencies and civil unrest I mean so this is all out in the
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.160]  open but you it's kind of like spider goats I'd talk about spider goats 15
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:30.120]  years ago CBS News you name it part spider part goat creating body armor and
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.520]  people would laugh at me even though it's admitted because they just aren't
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.560]  ready to deal with it that's interesting Larry I should look into those
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.160]  articles why don't you email them to us at show tips at info wars.com okay can
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.200]  you tell me the name of the chief CEO or the name of the product can you remember
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.760]  it no I do remember it was an MSNBC article my wife was my producer at the
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:54.200]  time and she just called him up and got him on and there's articles about the
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.320]  advertising that targets the middle ear and transmits sound directly your
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.120]  brain all right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:07.560]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:11.600]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.520]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:19.520]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:24.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:28.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:32.480]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.920]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.880]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:41.320]  planet dot com now many have dubbed it Ike is the most controversial speaker on
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.720]  the planet much of what he's talked about in the last 20 years is
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:48.840]  unfortunately come true he deals with this false programmed matrix reality of
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:53.520]  disinformation were fed and his latest book is human race get off your knees
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:11:00.160]  the lion sleeps no more David Ike dot com and David serious times coming
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.840]  rebellion worldwide but the globalist strangely admit that they're behind it
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:09.760]  they know the rebellion was already coming so they're trying to trigger it so
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.080]  a kind of like red a dare would blow up an oil well once it was already on fire
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:18.320]  to extinguish the flames of revolution well what does David Ike think is
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:25.120]  happening well I think what we're seeing Alex is a classic reformation or
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:28.960]  confirmation of something that anyone that wants to understand what's going on
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:34.600]  in the world must keep at the front of their mind and that is no situation he's
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:38.280]  ever black and white it's always if you're looking for the the real truth
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:43.760]  it's a shade of gray and that's what we're looking at here we have
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:53.600]  understandably a I believe a genuine uprising from angry poverty stricken
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  oppressed and suppressed people but when people are in that situation where as we
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.720]  talked about before freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.720]  when you reach that point where you've got nothing to lose if you take certain
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:12.960]  action then suddenly you lose your fear because what have I got to lose I'm in
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.520]  this situation anyway now because of the massive economic collapse and
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.600]  catastrophe around the world people in their parts of the world not just the
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.640]  Middle East are feeling that and they're heading closer and closer to that line
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:36.520]  that says I've got nothing to lose let's go now of course the mind manipulators
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.880]  that's what it is in the end a mind game a psychological game they knew that this
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:47.480]  was coming and they have got to try to manage it for their own ends so here we
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:56.560]  have Alex a genuine reaction to this 30 years of suppression and violence and
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:05.200]  tyranny by this US and no doubt British to the two go together tyranny and
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.800]  dictator Mubarak who was serve their interests and serve the interests of
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.760]  Israel against the interests of the Palestinians and that is a genuine
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:21.160]  reaction no doubt but you can see that when you've got a powder keg like that
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:28.720]  of resentment and oppression that will not take it anymore then it's very easy
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:34.240]  to trigger that and then manipulate it and that's why when the revolution truly
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:41.480]  comes to America and Britain as it will then we involved in any of that need to
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:46.040]  learn the lessons and become streetwise about the way this thing works
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:53.400]  because how many times when you look at these so-called people's revolutions not
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.800]  least in the former Soviet Union of Georgia of Ukraine of the Czech Republic
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:05.160]  of Pakistan and so on these color revolutions as they call them again
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:11.640]  and again it's been shown quite clearly but Rothschild connected people like
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.840]  George Soros and a big new presence here being behind them not these sources
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:22.560]  network of foundations they're not there for philanthropy they are there to
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.640]  manipulate so-called on-the-surface people's revolutions that are putting
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:35.680]  their people in power and you cannot ever judge the true nature of a revolution
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:42.040]  its motivation and its background until we see what is replaced the regime the
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:49.320]  revolution has removed and when you look at Georgia and Ukraine and all
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:55.000]  these places where these Soros networks have been involved in the manipulation
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.720]  and not only that the training of people in in people's non-cooperation and
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.440]  protest techniques the people that have gone into place have been
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:12.040]  invariably people who are frontmen for the very the globalist and the Soros
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:17.040]  networks classic Georgia Mikhail Sargashvili scholarship to the US
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:23.160]  Columbia Law School George Washington University New York law firm turns up and
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:27.560]  becomes president of Georgia after the so-called Rose Revolution manipulated by
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:33.640]  the Soros foundations we have this extraordinarily ludicrous situation now
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:40.400]  in the Ukraine where I'm speaking next week where a guy called Victor Yanukovic
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:49.120]  was removed after what was claimed to be rigged elections in I think was 2004
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:55.440]  the so-called Orange Revolution that very man is now president of the country
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:00.840]  so that revolution of course changed nothing with with hindsight and when
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:07.880]  you look at the situation now in Egypt who turns up and not lived in the
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:13.160]  country for most of his out of Mohammed L. Barrity the head of the U.N.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:19.120]  and who is this man he's been on the board of the International Crisis Group
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:24.920]  which claims on its website to be an independent non-profit non-governmental
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:28.800]  organization committed to preventing and solving deadly conflict when it's
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:34.120]  actually there to manipulate regime change in the very way that I'm talking
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.320]  they now admit that they send him in the week before they admittedly triggered
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.040]  it they're bragging about it while publicly saying that they support
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.920]  Mubarak because they know Western support for Mubarak will enrage the
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:51.000]  populace even more but then publicly at the same level admit that they're doing
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.080]  it and and so this is what I wanted to ask you David I want you to continue do
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.840]  you agree with my analysis here because I knew this a decade ago because I saw
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:01.600]  them bragging about it but now they've come out and wired magazine you name it
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:08.000]  and admitted Google is NSA software for keyword it they just get you to search
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.040]  the database to put your own information on it so they literally know what
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:17.600]  you're thinking and doing and Google says 93 to 99 percent of the time they
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  know where you're gonna eat what you're gonna surf what you're gonna do more
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.720]  than you even know and they're able to predict the future it's a it's a
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:30.480]  scientific crystal ball to a certain extent by tracking mass movements of
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.800]  people and they knew that there was rebellion against all their dictators
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:41.040]  forming and so they're going to trigger it early to then bring their people back
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.840]  in and that's basically what's happened but we'll put up on screen those articles
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:49.680]  about Google it was now claiming they're getting companies where they can do
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.440]  this that's what they've been set up to do all along that's why the globalist
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:59.240]  are so arrogant is because they literally do nothing but study humanity and how we
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.920]  operate yeah well the international crisis group board members chairman
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.840]  George Soros, Mohamed Elberardi, Wesley Clark say no more you have a
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:14.120]  Solana the NATO secretary-general as was so Big New Brzezinski is one of their
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:20.120]  senior advisors Richard Armatage for goodness sake and Prince Turkey Al-Faisal
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:25.760]  who is a member of the Saudi Arabia royal family who of course loved democracy
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:29.920]  and freedom which this international crisis group supposed to represent so
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:36.880]  you look at that and it's quite clear that Elberardi is their man now also the
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:41.800]  Daily Telegraph in Britain has been running stories and articles about the
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:47.520]  fact that some of the people that were that triggered this popular uprising
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:51.960]  which in its entirety that's what it is from the people's point of view
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:58.920]  were actually connected to the American Embassy in Cairo and came to America and
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.760]  and and all the rest of it so you can see how it's being manipulated and the
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:08.320]  thing is that people like Brzezinski in his books they are telling you what's
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:14.680]  gonna happen disguised as prophecy if you like Kissinger came out on Bloomberg
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:19.560]  last night and said this is only the first scene in the first act of a play
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:24.600]  that's exactly what I was coming to that quote this is the only this is only
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.480]  the first scene of the first act of the drama that is played out that is telling
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:33.440]  you what's coming and you see I've been writing for years about the fact that
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:39.720]  these Arab oil states and these Arab dictatorships and all dictatorships were
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:44.680]  being played like a violin it was only a matter of time and again you come to the
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:51.920]  states of great dictators and royal tyrannies in Yemen Algeria Libya Jordan

[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:11.680]  the broadcast giving us his take on what's happening to the world economy
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:15.840]  and what's happening in Egypt but I could not concur the piercing
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.720]  understanding of David Ike more on this issue that's why I admire him so much as
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:24.400]  research is always show up today and in piercing is the word and that's
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.720]  exactly what's happening instead of even black or white or gray it's more of a
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:34.000]  prism of spectrums and the globalist are riding this tiger of rebellion against
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.080]  their own tyranny and like judo using the resistance of the population against
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:43.800]  them and throwing it back at him and so we by understanding this though we can
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:48.000]  defeat them and I want to talk more about their predictive systems future
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.320]  predicting systems and how David thinks we counter that but David continuing you
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:57.400]  got cut off by the break we're running through the dictatorships that are in
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.880]  the Middle East North Africa and where this is going yeah I mean we're talking
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:06.280]  about Yemen Algeria Libya Jordan Syria Morocco Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:13.280]  Oman Kuwait all these are so-called royal dictatorships and tyrannous
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:17.600]  imposing upon the people so should they go absolutely they should go but we back
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.960]  to we back to and as soon as possible but we back to shades of gray the
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:27.600]  question is not just should they go it's what is the agenda for making them go at
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:32.760]  this time and you know but there's a number of things that come from this if
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:40.280]  they as Kissinger has indicated here they plan to create a falling dominoes
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:46.520]  across the Middle East first of all that creates massive upheaval it creates
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:53.800]  what chaos what is their technique order out of chaos now on one level this could
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:58.680]  be very dangerous for places like Israel but it could also be incredibly
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:04.240]  beneficial to those that run if Israel and very very beneficial to those behind
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:10.560]  this global agenda because they want the Middle Eastern countries in a state of
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  subordination and chaos will create that the other thing is that where does the
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.200]  most of the world's oil come from it comes from the Middle East you start
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:26.320]  whacking domino upheavals across the Middle East and the old countries not
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:30.360]  least the big ones Saudi Arabia and what are you going to have Alex you're
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:36.160]  going to have an enormous oil crisis which is going to of course knock on to
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.360]  crises and financial crises and an industrial crisis and living crisis
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:47.200]  throughout global society which is precisely what they want massive massive
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.920]  problems and upheavals and chaos through which they can offer the solutions of
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.720]  their centralized global fascist or well-earned dictatorship so so it's
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:05.760]  clear to me that this genuine reaction to this disgraceful outrageous evil
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:12.120]  attack on human society is being managed to bring about the next stage of the
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.960]  attack on human society expanding on that we know in the last year of the
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:22.280]  IMF and World Bank have ordered all of these third world countries not just the
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:28.640]  Middle East North Africa to cut through austerity the bread ration which around
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:34.160]  half the population of Egypt is on making two dollars or less a day and so
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.720]  they economically through globalism pull the levers punch the buttons then they
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.640]  send in their man on a white horse who the London Independent calls the savior
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:50.320]  this al-baraday so so it's completely transparent to those that study this and
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.280]  know it and the globalist are even admitting it but but on a larger front
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:28:00.200]  the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan they just reshuffled the government towards
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.000]  them in Saudi Arabia everywhere the Saudis and others are freaking out
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.520]  realizing the deal they made with the globalist is a deal with the devil and
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:13.520]  they want the strategy of tension the clash of civilizations they want to get
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:16.920]  radical Muslims like they got rid of Saddam and put Muslim radical Muslims
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:22.280]  in an Iraq this is the strategy to then build them up as the enemy and to blame
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.400]  them for the exploding oil prices that were already being triggered via dollar
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:32.240]  devaluation yeah that's that's that's it and the Muslim Brotherhood you know
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:38.600]  this is again keep coming back to this today shades of gray becoming streetwise
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:44.520]  and just because something has a name on the door and appears to stand for
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:50.040]  something does not mean that at its core it does I mean crikey you look at the
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:57.520]  classic Orwellian use of names for organizations to give the impression
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:01.120]  that it's the opposite of what it really is I mean for goodness sake we're
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:07.480]  talking here about George Soros's Open Society Institute which is the last
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:12.360]  thing the Open Society Institute actually wants so when you look at things
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:16.160]  like Muslim Brotherhoods and look at almost any organization that has
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.200]  democracy in it and you're looking at organization that wants to take democracy
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.600]  away and just because it's called the Muslim Brotherhood does not mean that
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:30.120]  at its core it has even the best interest of Muslims at heart you know I
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:36.200]  was talking to people who've been involved professionally in politics and
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.520]  intelligence and all the rest of it David stay there long segment coming up
[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:44.840]  that was a short segment will continue there with the Muslim Brotherhood and
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.320]  and now if we're in the first scene in the first act of the play what the full play
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:57.400]  is we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:30:05.560]  network a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness

[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:09.920]  June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:13.760]  perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:17.480]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the
[02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:21.800]  news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition

[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:05.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:10.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:14.240]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:18.720]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:23.520]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:27.880]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:33.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:37.400]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:40.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:46.160]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:51.840]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:03.160]  to suppress human potential the human mind and knowledge because the people
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:08.320]  perish for lack of knowledge the people are destroyed for lack of knowledge as
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:14.360]  the good book tells us. David Ike as we went to break you were starting to get
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:19.600]  into the first scene in the first act for the New World Order the global
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:26.040]  destabilization program people rioting and protesting in Greece in Ireland at
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:31.520]  the Davos Switzerland meeting last week they called for 100 trillion in
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:35.320]  additional taxpayer money to the private banks and open announcement of world
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:40.160]  government all of that smoke screened by what's happening now David Ike please
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:44.440]  continue. Yeah I was just finishing off a point Alex about the fact that just
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.240]  because something's called something doesn't mean that's what it represents
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.120]  and that's what it stands for including the Muslim Brotherhood there's a lot of
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:56.600]  organizations in the Arab world that actually are fronts for Israel and the
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:01.200]  United States. Andreas von Bülow I think you've talked to him yourself over the
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:06.520]  years former German minister and an expert in intelligence especially
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.280]  German intelligence in that whole area. Andres von Bülow. Yeah I talked to him on
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:16.400]  the phone for a long time years ago not long after 9-11 and he was saying he
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:20.840]  knew for a fact that Abu Nadal of course the infamous Arab terrorist was
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.200]  actually an asset of Mossad that's how it works. Yeah he was the former head of
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:30.080]  British of German intelligence and the former German defense minister he
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.680]  talked about the white supremacist are run by the globalist the radical
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:39.040]  Muslims are run by them the radical black groups the radical Hispanic groups
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.480]  all of these groups are there so the government can play the part of the
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.000]  saviour. Yeah and of course we know the classic stands out like the proverbial
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.760]  he's bin Laden some of bin Laden we know that he was a frontman for the
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:58.640]  same group so when we see these names that appear to represent Muslims or
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:02.080]  appear to represent this or that or the other we have to just again
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.600]  streetwise shades of gray just take a step back and let's see if they really do
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:12.800]  that and again we come back to the classic line really by their
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:16.520]  action shall they be judged that's what we need to do not by what they say but
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:20.360]  what what they do another interesting thing Alex you know is that there is
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:26.000]  this this whole deal about what's known as Greater Israel which is the area that
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:31.600]  the Israel extremists claim is theirs that the real Israel and it's interesting
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:35.480]  when you look at the map of it it includes of course Israel Palestine that
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:41.560]  we see now but it also includes a great chunk of of Egypt going across to Cairo
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:47.080]  includes Jordan includes Lebanon includes Syria includes Iraq includes a great
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:51.760]  chunk of Saudi Arabia now what we're looking at here as you look at that map
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:56.680]  all the countries or many of the countries that are actually now in
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:01.160]  possible possible line for this domino effect that Kissinger was indicating
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:07.640]  with his with his quote and there is an agenda playing out here and when we look
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.280]  at what's happening in Europe what's happening in Britain beginning to what's
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:15.600]  happening in America my goodness me we want more not just people on the streets
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:20.640]  to show the numbers but also non-cooperation with the system so the
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:25.480]  system cannot cooperate cannot operate what because it needs us to do that we
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:32.520]  must be learning lessons here Alex all the time that for instance the power of
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:38.320]  mass non-cooperation went then in Egypt they say curfews people in very large
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:42.800]  numbers refused to do with that and suddenly where's the power of the
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:49.240]  state understanding and starting to get as much as we can prepared for the fact
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:54.920]  as we've seen in Egypt that when the real revolution unfolds against the regime
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.880]  one of the first things to go is not not only truth but actually the internet and
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:04.600]  mobile phone network so people can't communicate and another thing we need to
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:12.320]  keep in our minds is no ideology when we really trigger this true human
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:17.160]  revolution against these these tyrannies or collective tyrannies different
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:23.320]  faces or masks on the same face around the world no ideology equal freedom for
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.080]  everybody no matter what their color creed religion view anything freedom
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:32.360]  must be our focus not ideology and religious belief and all that stuff we
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:37.400]  can argue about that or chat and debate about that let's keep our focus on what
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:42.240]  affects us all and that's our basic freedoms being taken away and so many
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:46.000]  people they talk about wanting freedom Alex but they don't want freedom to a
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.080]  large extent they want to replace the tyranny they don't like with it with a
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.320]  tyranny they do i.e. their belief system these are the things that have to go and
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:39:02.480]  we all must constantly keep our focus on who is what is the motivation of the
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.160]  protest and the uprising who's going to be and what kind of society is going to
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.640]  be in power when it's over who are these people coming in well we actually know
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:16.640]  we know on our side and claiming to be behind it you know we need to really get
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.200]  streetwise and learn from what's happening around the world so we don't
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  get caught well I agree with you now we know that Muhammad El Baradi is a big
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:31.280]  UN globalist former head of the atomic energy agency US trained we know that he
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:36.280]  is for the inoculations he is for the Planned Parenthood type stuff he is a
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.680]  globalist we know the Muslim Brotherhood admittedly set up by British
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:44.120]  intelligence is now menacing Saudi Arabia and others who were not fans of but
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:49.360]  the point is the globalist want to have more radical regimes come in so that then
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.200]  Israel and others have an excuse to expand their land in the name of a
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:59.720]  security buffer zone they're now moving out of the era of strong men and and
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.360]  moving towards the strategy of of tension what do you from your research
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:10.960]  see as the next dominoes to fall well any of them could be really the answer to
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:14.400]  that is who's next on the on the list because it could be it could be any of
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:21.920]  them but the the the thing also about Israel Alex is if this uprising so
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:27.880]  called crisis that as it's being portrayed a crisis for tyranny on one
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:35.800]  level it continues to unfold then it's going to be also an excuse for massive
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:42.000]  military support to quote protect Israel and of course Israel's got a one of the
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.760]  biggest armadies in the world from this sliver of land in the north of the
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:54.560]  Arabian Peninsula because of three billion dollars a year in aid from the
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:59.040]  United States to Israel and of course anything could happen what if this
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.960]  really gets out of hand in the sense that America could deploy forces to
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:10.360]  protect Israel as well as an excuse because you know one of the key things
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:14.680]  Alex and this is I think very relevant not necessarily will happen tomorrow but
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:20.560]  but in this domino falling situation that we're now facing one of the things
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:26.120]  that's come up again and again and again and again is that the third world war
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:31.480]  the third global conflict the one that is to create along with all the other
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:34.760]  things we're seeing like finances and all the rest that's what Albert Pike
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:38.080]  called for like Albert Pike you know it is in his letter exactly the three
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:44.320]  world wars and again this also relates to what term to what he said in terms of
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:50.800]  the third world war the common theme is that that will be triggered in some way
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:58.360]  out of Israel and the Arab country and by the way in 1878 he laid out World War
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:02.320]  One who would be between World War Two and then finally World War Three they
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:05.520]  would then destroy all the world religions out of the war and say we
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:08.920]  must have this new global one-world government religion I want you to get
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:12.160]  to that but since you've mentioned it so much and I've mentioned it here's
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.800]  Henry Kissinger on Bloomberg saying this is only the first scene of the first
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.080]  act of a drama that is to be played out here is Henry Kissinger top globalist
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:43.920]  strategist openly bragging and this act you seeing lasting for several months
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:52.040]  years perhaps and it will be my this depends now on I think we should stay
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:57.480]  out of that dispute because we don't want to look it's if we are imposing a
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:02.880]  government but we shouldn't be so mesmerized by the short term tactics
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:08.520]  the real problem will be what is the ultimate orientation of Egypt because
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:13.200]  it is in many respects the key to the region all right so they're going after
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:16.080]  the key to the region and they've been doing this double-speak everywhere
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:22.320]  we're for Mubarak but we actually that is the globalist financed the ongoing
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:26.520]  attempt to overthrow him because they know that that will help Mubarak if
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:30.360]  they say they're funding the outsider it will hurt him if they support him and
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:33.720]  I've read all over the news where they're openly bragging so they'll put out
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:37.840]  their general press releases for the profane general public but then buried
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.640]  in there talking to each other they're bragging about what they're doing
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:47.520]  yeah they've got a song sheet and this is not projected days in advance weeks
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:51.960]  months or even years in advance is projected decades in advance he says
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.800]  25 years in advance yeah and and maybe maybe maybe more I mean you know the
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:01.920]  basic theme of what's happening was was outlined before the turn of the 20th
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.280]  century in terms of the themes of it all and you know the I've quoted people in
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.240]  my books who've spoken over the years like in the late 60s and stuff like that
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:16.360]  inside as you said this is what how the world's gonna gonna be and it's all
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.240]  unfolded as they said it would unfold because it is a blueprint and now we're
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:28.480]  seeing a real major major card being played here which is designed to trigger
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:34.880]  off-hoot consequences in all directions because this is the tinderbox this is
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:40.280]  the the the explosive point where they want to the next whole stage to explode
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:45.320]  out of are you hurting he he said it's the key and then by running
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:48.440]  destabilization ops and all the other countries that aren't just allies of the
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:52.920]  globalist they can create the crisis to offer the military and economic solution
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:56.760]  but David how frustrating is it for you and for myself but I want to get your
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:01.040]  view on this to have the blueprint to have the CFR trilateral Commission
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.560]  Bilderberg group much of what they do public admitting they would create a
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:10.280]  global currency crisis they would end the dollar bring in the band car SDR you
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:15.000]  know a hundred trillion all now happening but the yuppies have been put in
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.920]  their little comfort box and condition that none of this existed for decades
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:23.720]  knowing that we have the documents they preconditioned it didn't exist so now
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:28.320]  that it even exists and has emerged people have gone some of them into a
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:35.440]  catatonic state of denying it exists even as it's announced well this is a
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:43.920]  major human trait in the programmed manipulated human mind which simply does
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:51.480]  not want to face what it doesn't want to believe is true so when you are faced
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:56.760]  with something you have a choice you can literally face it and deal with it and
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:01.280]  we could sort this if we did this in large enough numbers or you can try to
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:09.680]  kid yourself that it doesn't exist and therefore it's okay you know people say
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:15.480]  in situations where it's obvious that horrific things are going to be done in
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:20.640]  the very near future and they're still saying oh no they'd never do that no you
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:24.240]  want to persuade yourself they'd never do that so you don't have to get your
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:29.200]  backside unglued from the sofa and do things you'd rather not have to do and
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:35.280]  this is why we're at this point Alex and it's like how much more confirmation do
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:41.040]  people want how much more blatant does it have to be does it have to be the knock
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.480]  on the door does it have to be being taken away after the knock on the door
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:51.640]  I mean when are you gonna draw a line here but you know on another level it
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.040]  is great encouraging things happening because the number of people who are
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:02.520]  starting to yes it are increasing all the time two things are happening David
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:08.000]  just a quick point they need to get streetwise and I keep coming back to
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.840]  this because they must and streetwise means get informed because there are
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:16.480]  people who are protesting like the Egyptians are protesting against
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:21.160]  Mubarak like the students in London who are protesting against outrageous
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:25.480]  fees to put them in debt to the banks for the rest of their lives just to get
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:30.520]  educated same in other parts of the world there are people on the streets
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:36.840]  because of the economic austerity programs in Greece and other places but
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:42.440]  people what those people need to understand is all those different
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:47.640]  subjects all those different aspects all those different events and situations
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:53.840]  that they are protesting about masks on the same face yes need to take that
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:48:00.000]  step across the line and realize that it's all connected yes the print in the
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:05.640]  end every different thing they're protesting about all roads lead to the
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:11.080]  same cabal and it's the cabal we must focus on and the global agenda for the
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:18.480]  cabal so that we we challenge and expose and understand the picture rather than
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:23.800]  getting caught in the just the pieces so we see the forest instead of getting
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:27.800]  caught in the twigs this is so important no no I totally agree with you
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:32.920]  because the progenitor of all of this debt slavery of this neofatalistic system
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:37.280]  is the new world order controllers it is their social engineering model and for
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:41.320]  the new world order global government is just the beginning as we say in the
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.360]  film in game their stated plan is a global police state to then carry out
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:51.600]  the forced sterilization of the entire population except for a tiny group of
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:57.800]  globalist this is full spectrum dominance and if people just get angry at
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:03.720]  the atmosphere created by the by the engineers their anger their focus will
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:09.240]  be used and shunted and directed into empowering new world order agendas instead
[02:49:09.240 --> 02:49:13.640]  of bringing it down that's why what you just said is the absolute paramount
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:18.600]  heart of everything and the genesis of true human liberty if we're gonna have
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:24.680]  it yeah who benefits who benefits who benefits we gotta keep asking that who
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.840]  benefits from this situation who benefits from me reacting to this
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:36.280]  situation like this and this is why why I say we have to get ourselves informed
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:40.880]  not just about what size shoes the president of so-and-so takes not that
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:44.280]  just that kind of information much of which we don't really need to know
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:52.920]  anyway informed about how the psychological system works the techniques of
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:59.600]  mass-minded emotional manipulation and where this a cabal want to take the
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.960]  world when we understand the basic techniques of mind and psychological
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:08.680]  manipulation and the goals that are designed to be it's like getting your
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:14.000]  site immediately becomes so much more difficult to damn exactly when you're
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.040]  not aware of these systems of control it's like you're blind and deaf as soon
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:21.720]  as you understand their tricks it isn't as powerful anymore and it actually
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:25.400]  becomes irritating not something that puts you into a trance but something
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:31.120]  their attacks actually help us learn to be smarter faster to understand it but
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:37.440]  but going to break here here's the Associated Press the IMF says or AFP IMF
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:42.920]  says to help Egypt others in trouble oh they're gonna help them with more 20 30
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:47.120]  percent interest rate loans they're gonna bring the Egyptians more under debt
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:52.240]  they're gonna jack up their taxes in even more so there is part of your agenda
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:55.840]  with the physical takeover through the economic bondage we got two more
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:51:02.680]  segments with David I coming up powerful information David I go David J. Smith

[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:16.720]  sins could it be that God has ceased hearing prayers for America because of

[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.800]  you're gracious to join us but I wanted to do something here that the producers
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:04.200]  showed me earlier and that's tweet psych that's the website and if you type
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.440]  in somebody's tweet account they're monitoring the tweets library Congress is
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:15.080]  saving all of them and they know the psychological profile of your users you
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:19.760]  type in the real Alex Jones for tweet and you scroll down and most of it is
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:28.760]  media social you know future people only know your future trends learning positive
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:36.000]  conceptual basically philosophy the census see it's all about primordial
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:39.680]  about what that's what people are into they're into primordial the core of
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.520]  humanity destiny enlightenment awakening that's who comes to my tweet and
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:47.240]  they're tracking them and who they are and it's much more detailed with the
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:51.080]  cable boxes tracking you the the Google tracking you right down your
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:55.680]  individual profile now you go to something like two and a half men or Joe
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:01.160]  Rogan and you know these are nice guys smart shows whatever I like Joe he's
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:06.120]  into awakening but still the point is what is it it's sex it's it's it's it's
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:12.640]  lower senses things will scroll down and show that sex vast majority but then
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:15.240]  they're also into primordial and things like that so you see some of the same
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:20.040]  interest media and if you type in something like two and a half men it
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.200]  will you know show you what they're into this is just one example of how they've
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:27.680]  gotten us tied into this the internet is a double-edged sword they thought they
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:31.920]  would use it as a worldwide wiretap DARPA did instead we're using it against
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:35.560]  them but we have to understand they're now bragging that they can predict mass
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:40.480]  movements almost a hundred percent of the time how do you deal with something
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:44.880]  like that with these super technologies the globalist have David Ike
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:52.760]  thing about the internet is that it's given us so many tools to communicate
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:56.720]  information that these people overwhelmingly do not want communicated
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:01.240]  without the internet people would not at this point be anything like as
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:07.200]  informed about what's going on as they are therefore given that the internet
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:15.000]  was was introduced through military technology etc for that to be given to
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.040]  the people if you like to use for the benefit of awakening and awareness there
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:29.000]  must be something absolutely colossal and fundamental in it for them on the
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.920]  other side for that to have been done and you know I think what we need to do
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:38.520]  is start to look at about them the reality and and and from an internet
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:45.240]  point of view the internet is actually a collective human mind or an extension
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:51.800]  of it because we put our thoughts our dreams our art everything in one one
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:58:01.160]  one area yeah anything that you focus on with mind becomes an extension of mind
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:06.640]  and therefore the collective human mind has an extension now called the
[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:13.240]  World Wide Web the internet and therefore if you are skilled in understanding
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:19.720]  how to read this information and goodness knows the advancement of the
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:24.040]  computer technology they must have out we can organically do what their
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:28.440]  supercomputers can do individually they're trying to mimic the human mind by
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:35.560]  scanning the web you can do is read the human mind by what the human mind is
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:41.960]  putting on to the web an extension yes stay there stay there stay there power

[03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:11.680]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:18.960]  GCN radio network we're gonna continue rolling deeper into the hour with David
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:22.240]  and I got a bunch of callers on hold and I want to go through them and ask who
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:25.480]  wants to talk to David specifically or address a question on these general
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:29.240]  topics I know they've been holding but I don't want to keep it focused on what
[03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:33.160]  we're getting into here but the field is why we're talking to David Ike David
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:38.000]  Ike comm Alex Jones of info wars dot com and prison planet dot TV there is a
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:41.760]  huge awakening and we're gonna come back and get more into the police state
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:45.120]  grid the physical control grid and take some phone calls in the next long
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:50.880]  segment but David it's so powerful what we were just talking about in the last
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.880]  segment quantify it but for those that may not understand the web is almost like
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:01:01.680]  a mirror of what people are really thinking so the globalists can see our
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.400]  soul they can see who we really are just like a thousand questions psychological
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:09.600]  tests can show you something well these are millions of choices we
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:14.280]  individually make watching digital TV the tracks is on Twitter Facebook you know
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:20.080]  Google they admit they can now pretty cool predict mass movement futures 93
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:23.120]  percent of the time individuals that's what they're telling us they have but
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:28.480]  you're right I using the web and seeing things I can simply go to
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:31.520]  shot cast and tell what people are more interested in watching the numbers go up
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:35.440]  there's simple things like that but it's much deeper and the globalists know
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:40.760]  that's why I've got Rolling Stone New York Magazine Newsweek all these people
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:45.160]  calling me because they're saying we see your numbers my radio show info wars
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:51.480]  calm bigger than MSNBC a tiny operation they see what all of us are doing is
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:55.040]  huge and powerful they know the awakenings there and they don't know how
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:58.200]  to deal with it that's why Obama's calling for the internet kill switch
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:03.320]  that's why worldwide Australia England they are actually scared David Ike
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:10.880]  well the when anyone in the public arena a scientist or whatever comes out and says
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:17.760]  we're working on this technology which he is from now could do this say in terms
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:24.000]  of computers they're talking about building quantum computers the advancement
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:29.640]  and potential for which to process information is just staggering it makes
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:33.440]  the best computers today look like the village idiot when they're saying it's
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:38.760]  coming they might genuinely genuinely be telling the truth from their point of
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:42.320]  view because they're not aware of what's going on outside of their sphere of
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:49.280]  knowledge in the secret projects etc but things like quantum computers that
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.720]  we're going to have in the future these guys have got them now I mean that if we
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:58.920]  could see the computing technology information processing technology that
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:05.040]  they have we would be staggered at how far ahead of the public arena it is and
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:09.560]  what we're doing all the time with the internet and it's important we use it
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:15.320]  massively important we have to use these things to our advantage and mitigate as
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:21.120]  much as we can the things that are a disadvantage but they are receiving
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:26.880]  second-by-second all over the world the through many and various sources which
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:34.800]  these computers can process and and put into ordered models it outcomes and where
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:40.720]  it's going people's views people's minds are being and the state of their minds
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:46.480]  are being it no ten years ago the Pentagon admitted they have a map of 3D of
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:50.800]  the entire world already and they admit with smart dust and all these meters and
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:56.280]  tracking they're making the real world searchable like Google yeah I mean the
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:03:59.600]  technology they're dealing with is fantastic but you know we must keep
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:03.960]  coming coming back to this I suggest and that is for all their technology and
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:08.760]  for all their know-how for all the knowledge they have that they keep from
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:13.160]  the people in general we have the numbers we have billions compared with a
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:18.040]  relative handful at the core of this that are behind it all and and the idea
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:25.640]  is to keep us in a constant state of divide and rule fear and confusion and
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:33.320]  chaos and bewilderment and so that we do not unite and meet this together because
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:39.280]  that one of the things that come out of these people's revolutions although of
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:42.960]  course sometimes the military are called off but even then the military can only
[03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:49.320]  go so far and that is the power of vast numbers of people saying enough there
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:53.960]  comes a point where the numbers are so great that there's nothing the system
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:05:01.640]  can do about it and we must keep that in mind we'll be right back
[03:05:01.640 --> 03:05:06.200]  where of all the military surplus stores gone don't worry you don't need one

[03:08:14.800 --> 03:08:18.400]  while david was talking i've been into a jalapeno i love him and then
[03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:22.960]  got a little bit of it down in my lawn boy i tell you that'll wake you up
[03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:26.880]  i drink it five cups of coffee it's our final segment with david i do want to
[03:08:26.880 --> 03:08:30.800]  get to a few phone calls with him but if you just joined as david iak author
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:34.400]  researcher was getting into the awakening and
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:38.640]  one of my biggest frustrations but at the same time it's exciting because i
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:42.000]  know how close we are to shifting you know the tide against
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:45.920]  tyranny i believe it's already changed but the momentum is now
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:50.160]  accelerating towards awakening and resistance
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:54.720]  to the globalist system that is so horrible that is
[03:08:54.720 --> 03:08:59.840]  so destructive towards humanity and david you talked a lot about compartmentalization
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:04.240]  how when you were covering bilberberg group and they're down at the bottom of
[03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:08.480]  the hill was police officers who had children who were nice guys you talk to
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:12.880]  them and here they were guarding these world leaders who
[03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:16.560]  were destroying their future putting poisons in their water and vaccines
[03:09:16.560 --> 03:09:19.920]  openly writing books about how they're doing it
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:24.640]  but it's so horrific that that cop either can't or won't look at the evidence
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:27.920]  because they feel like they're part of the power structure but as soon as we can
[03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:33.040]  explain to the military to bureaucrats to the police to ourselves
[03:09:33.040 --> 03:09:35.920]  you know if you want to look at the who caused the problem folks look in the
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:39.520]  mirror it's our inaction or our buying into their propaganda that
[03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:44.560]  that has allowed this but we are under attack by these globalists 99.9
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:49.040]  percent of us 99.9 percent of us have a stake in defeating
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:54.400]  the new world or control grid and so it shouldn't even be a debate
[03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:58.880]  i shouldn't have to be here pleading people to wake up and get involved it's
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:03.440]  common sense no brainer once you understand the true agenda can you
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:08.240]  greatly speak to compartmentalization and the real choice we've got
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:15.200]  yes because the the numbers at the core of this are so small compared with the
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:19.520]  global population that to control the global population
[03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:25.120]  the the inner core has to recruit from the target population to keep the
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:29.520]  target population in line it has to fill its uniforms and its dark suit
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:34.240]  administrators positions with the target population
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:39.920]  and through compartmentalization through only letting people know as much as
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:43.280]  they need to know to make their contribution to the to the to the
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:46.720]  whole package without knowing what the whole package is
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:50.960]  it means that people with children and grandchildren
[03:10:50.960 --> 03:10:56.480]  are going to work all over the world day after day after day all their lives
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:11:01.680]  helping to build a prison for themselves and for their children grandchildren
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:06.000]  and families and that situation in um in switzerland it was was just a
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:09.440]  classic i was staying with some people in um
[03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:13.200]  southern switzerland near the italian border and around robin came around
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:16.720]  saying the bill the burg group meeting this year is it's at so-and-so
[03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:20.000]  and it was on top of a mountain about two hours drive
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:25.120]  north into switzerland and i went um the day before two days before and i saw
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:30.000]  the people going round and it was about the three very flash hotels
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:34.240]  um at the palace and the grand a couple of them were called and
[03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:38.240]  they were putting the fences up and all the people in the in the jackets
[03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:43.280]  arranged arranging everything and then i went back on the last day
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:48.880]  now instead of going up to the to the hotels i was stopped literally a few
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:51.680]  minutes after i turned off the main highway
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:55.040]  right at the bottom of the mountain i wasn't even allowed near it and there
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:58.080]  was this these swiss policemen in orange jackets
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:02.320]  and i asked them what was going on and they generally didn't know they said
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:05.280]  well there's an important meeting going on we don't know anything about it we
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:08.400]  just been told that um no one can go up through this road
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:11.600]  any further than here and they said oh i think it's ending this afternoon and
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:15.600]  you'll be able to go up tomorrow or something and these people were in
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:18.880]  effect guarding people they had no idea about
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:22.960]  they had no idea what their agenda was horrendous for their own families
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:26.320]  and this is how it works and we come back again
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:30.320]  alex to what i was talking about earlier it's not just those
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:34.560]  um protesting about various injustices that need to get
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:38.960]  uh informed about how the whole thing works and how it's all connected
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:42.400]  so do the people in dark suits and uniforms have to understand
[03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:46.560]  that they are cogs in a machine which is there to
[03:12:46.560 --> 03:12:51.280]  uh entrap uh their children and grandchildren indeed in the timescale
[03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:54.000]  we're looking at if we allow it to happen even themselves
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:58.400]  in a an Orwellian global tyranny that would make
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:03.440]  you know George Orwell kind of uh wins and and not only that just look at
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:08.000]  Nazi Germany or communist uh russia soviet union
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.160]  and then add some and then some and that's what the you're looking at look at
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.120]  china one of the blueprints for the global society
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:19.120]  tyranny they want singapore then look your children in the eye look yourself
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:22.640]  in the eye and say what am i doing absolutely
[03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:26.800]  leading to this people need to get conscious and make decisions and get out
[03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:30.000]  of denial because it's all out in the open now
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:33.600]  they just got people to commit to denial and so people don't want to feel like
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:36.960]  they were conned and so people are now buying into torture
[03:13:36.960 --> 03:13:41.520]  secret arrest checkpoints and one of the other big mind control
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:46.080]  systems is role playing oh it's just civil libertarians that don't like
[03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.200]  illegal checkpoints or warrantless blood draws
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:53.360]  oh it's just activists that don't like these wars oh it's just
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:56.960]  well i'm not an activist well i'm not a people
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:00.400]  need to see themselves in the role of getting informed
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:04.480]  and then as they grow informing others because this is a life and death situation
[03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:08.320]  here's my last point that we're going to jam in a few phone calls from folks
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:11.600]  have been patiently holding ron jack richard and uh john will just have time
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:15.840]  to get uh to those but tsa invades roads highways with
[03:14:15.840 --> 03:14:20.320]  viper checkpoints they've got 9 000 locations with telescreens going up
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:23.520]  in shopping malls walmart saying watch your neighbors
[03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:28.240]  they're approaching every professional i know my dad
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:32.480]  doctors he knows saying you'll spy on your neighbors for us for homeland
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:36.000]  security they are rolling out something by every
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:39.600]  historical yardstick that is super tyranny
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:43.760]  and some people are waking up others are waking up and getting scared and
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:47.440]  others are just saying this is freedom warrantless wiretapping
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:51.440]  drones uh the government taking veterans death
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:55.360]  benefits i mean it's just we're already living in incredible
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:59.680]  looting and stealing that's going on and and they want us to not trust each
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.600]  other and spy on each other instead of looking up the mountain at the globalist
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:07.520]  they're the ones we should be watching exactly and and you know it's what we
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:12.480]  were talking about that just now i call it labeling um it they label people
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.080]  so that you're all uh if you like tired with the same brush this is what this
[03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:20.400]  southern poverty uh law center was trying to do and then the adl do when
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:24.960]  they talk about you you believe this oh you you you're a far right extremist
[03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:30.880]  um and uh of course what we're looking at again with the spy on your neighbor is
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:34.960]  just what we were talking about a few minutes ago there are too few of them
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:39.920]  to uh control and uh keep surveillance on the population so
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:44.000]  they have to get the target population to keep surveillance on each other this
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:47.440]  is how it's working divide and rule on a massive the beast is trying to
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:51.280]  replicate itself and build the army it needs that's why we've got to build our
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:55.040]  army of awakening now so people recognize it that's it and the other
[03:15:55.040 --> 03:15:59.520]  thing you mentioned a very relevant point is embarrassment hey you know
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:03.840]  people if you believe the world was a certain way and now you're starting to
[03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:07.360]  realize it was nothing like that nothing to be embarrassed about
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:11.760]  from cradle to where you are now you have been bombarded through your
[03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:15.840]  education system through the media day after day minute by minute
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:19.760]  with a certain view uh an information source that tells you
[03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:23.760]  certain things are true about yourself the world and how it works uh and
[03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:27.440]  therefore don't be embarrassed about the fact that you bought it because almost
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:32.480]  anyone would buy it instead of that celebrate celebrate the fact yes you
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:36.720]  have broken out of it and let's move on instead of
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:40.000]  no it can't be like that because i must have been wrong earlier in my life
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:43.760]  we're all wrong earlier in our life until we uh start to understand what's
[03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:47.280]  going on so get used to it and get on with it
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:50.880]  absolutely i liken it to a neighbor who you asked to water your plants and you
[03:16:50.880 --> 03:16:54.320]  come back and your jewelry's all stolen and then you go well it couldn't have
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:16:56.240]  been them that did it and you haven't watched your
[03:16:56.240 --> 03:16:59.680]  house again and now your tv gets stolen and your computer
[03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:02.640]  pretty soon you stop having that neighbor watch your stuff
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:06.160]  we've just been trained to accept government mega corporations raping and
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:09.040]  robbing us wake up get off your knees get out of
[03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:11.920]  your trance ron in new york you're on the air with
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:14.320]  david ike we're going through to 30 after and we're going to let him go in
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:17.040]  about 10 minutes he's been gracious go ahead ron
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:20.080]  good afternoon gentlemen my call today and i'd like to get
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:24.400]  both of your opinion is on this deals with um the mayor of new york city
[03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:28.640]  latest foray into intruding into arizona with uh
[03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:32.160]  basically hired contract agents for those that don't know they're going to gun
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:35.680]  shows doing private sales telling people oh my gosh
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:38.720]  we bought guns without a background knowing that people don't know that
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:41.840]  it's legal to sell a gun to your neighbor and what is bloomberg getting
[03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:45.360]  ready to run for president doing suing gun manufacturers
[03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:49.120]  going to arizona and try i meant to get to that i'm glad you brought it up ron
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:53.920]  running around trying to take our guns uh please continue ron but david why do
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:58.320]  they want our guns so bad well um again
[03:17:58.320 --> 03:18:01.680]  it seems to be a theme today um shades of gray
[03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:06.880]  and being street wise personally i don't own guns i don't want to own a gun
[03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:10.640]  and all the rest of it and i don't want to resist uh with guns i want to resist
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:15.440]  with nonviolent mass non-cooperation to stop the system working
[03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:19.600]  however um on another level they know that there's lots of people that are
[03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:23.120]  quite uh okay with with using guns to resist and of
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:27.520]  course if you want to take over from a
[03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:33.360]  a take over a country of people then if they're not armed from your point of
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:38.160]  view that is much more uh you know applicable or
[03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:41.600]  something you want rather than um an armed
[03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:44.320]  let me let me throw this because we're almost out of time i want ron to be able
[03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:46.640]  to finish but the point the point i'm making here
[03:18:46.640 --> 03:18:50.720]  um alex it's an important one what i'm saying is
[03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:54.480]  just because people in america you may not
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:58.800]  believe in guns you may not want people to have guns and there are many people
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:01.600]  that believe that and it's a legitimate view just as having them is a
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:06.080]  legitimate view please just see the shades of gray
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:10.160]  don't ask don't get caught in the debate of guns or no guns
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:13.200]  get caught in the understanding or the question
[03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:17.040]  why do they want to take the guns from the population now
[03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:22.160]  what's the agenda for that who benefits from that from their point of view
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:26.240]  because they want us to get into this gun no gun debate
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:29.840]  because that takes us over here we need to focus
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:33.600]  whether we believe in guns or whether we don't or why they want to do it now and
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:37.040]  it's because they will find that easier from their
[03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:41.440]  point of view to in their mind to take over an unarmed
[03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:44.480]  population rather than an armed one david i want to be able to have ron
[03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:48.000]  counter backing up some other calls but let me just myself state this clearly
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  to use a star wars analogy obi one kenobi's not running around with his
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:55.920]  lightsaber killing innocent people he uses it in defense
[03:19:55.920 --> 03:20:00.480]  and the issue is it's a major checkmate that if things get so desperate
[03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:03.920]  and they're taking people to put them on trucks to fema camps
[03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:07.360]  that if the germans would have had guns and resisted that wouldn't have happened
[03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:11.120]  the same thing with linen or Stalin and so i'm nonviolent
[03:20:11.120 --> 03:20:14.720]  offensively but nobody's taking my kids to a fema camp
[03:20:14.720 --> 03:20:17.920]  period and they can't stand it and they know it
[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:21.920]  and people need more guns it's the answer against this tyranny
[03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:26.240]  the counterbalance of power against this paramilitary globalist force
[03:20:26.240 --> 03:20:30.640]  massively in an arms race against the people uh ron in new york uh your
[03:20:30.640 --> 03:20:34.320]  comment on that okay uh my larger point was actually
[03:20:34.320 --> 03:20:38.560]  going to be about the uh the the spinning and manipulations of the
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:42.560]  media i've noticed one thing from all the tapes i've seen where they you know
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:45.040]  have these these videotapes supposedly
[03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:49.360]  of what took place in arizona these sales and what i have noticed
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:52.960]  is that you do not see a sale come to fruition meaning
[03:20:52.960 --> 03:20:56.720]  the guy makes a statement about i can't pass a background check
[03:20:56.720 --> 03:21:01.040]  but you don't actually see somebody transacting giving him a firearm and he
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:04.880]  gives them cash now i've seen this been reported for two days now and i find
[03:21:04.880 --> 03:21:08.640]  that unusual and i begin to wonder whether they even was a transaction
[03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:11.920]  we're just being manipulated no ron it's i mean it's a great point
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:15.200]  i mean there is so much lying going on i appreciate your call any other
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:19.200]  comments on that david uh well i worked in the media for a long time
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:23.680]  the bbc and newspapers and radio in uh britain
[03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:31.440]  and uh if anyone uh saw the inside of a mainstream newsroom in whatever form it
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  is paper television radio uh they would never
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:41.520]  believe a word they uh read or heard in the in the in the media again because
[03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:45.200]  a you don't have to be intelligent there are some intelligent journalists you
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:48.080]  don't have to be it's often a bad career move
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:52.240]  and you certainly do not have to be informed some of the most
[03:21:52.240 --> 03:21:56.080]  uninformed people i've ever met have been
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:59.920]  professional journalists and professional politicians and there's also
[03:21:59.920 --> 03:22:05.360]  this um leased line of resistance if you are a proper journalist and you
[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:11.040]  uh are interested in the truth then you are going to constantly
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:15.360]  be in conflict with those running your media organization
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:20.080]  who don't want you to cross that line so there comes a point where
[03:22:20.080 --> 03:22:25.120]  to uh advance the career to keep the job to keep the check coming in at the end
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:27.760]  of the month you stay within those lines and what
[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:33.440]  does that mean you say um what is within uh the acceptable
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:40.800]  realm and ratio of of of the the norms and if the norm is guns a bad gun shows
[03:22:40.800 --> 03:22:45.520]  bad and that's how you report it absolutely and if you play ball then
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:49.200]  you ascend in that mainstream media system but now people are aware of it
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:52.720]  so it's falling apart so the globalists are coming in trying to restrict the
[03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:56.400]  alternative media and the fight is on uh let's talk to jack in
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:22:59.040]  Illinois jack you're on the air with david i
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:04.000]  hi gentlemen i just have one quick uh hi david uh one comment and one quick
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:06.800]  question i think it's important that people
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:10.400]  stay positive because like attracts like and also
[03:23:10.400 --> 03:23:15.440]  fearless because at the end of the day the light is going to prevail and
[03:23:15.440 --> 03:23:20.320]  everyone needs to have that reassurance and then my question for you david is
[03:23:20.320 --> 03:23:23.440]  i'm a fan of yours i've seen many of your videos
[03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:28.320]  could you please explain to alex's listeners your concept of combing the
[03:23:28.320 --> 03:23:33.920]  mirror uh combing the mirror yeah um first of all jack i absolutely agree
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:39.040]  with you about staying positive um i um i talk about the things that are
[03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:43.120]  happening and some of the things we need to do to stop them happening but
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:49.920]  my um my view of the outcome is very very positive i think
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:54.560]  it well it's positive to admit the bad so then you can recognize the bad from
[03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:57.840]  the good yeah this this this control system is coming down my
[03:23:57.840 --> 03:24:00.480]  question is how bad is it going to get before
[03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:03.840]  that that that comes and that's a that's the question we need we need to answer
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:07.280]  ourselves how much are we going to stand on the sidelines and let this this go on
[03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:10.480]  unchallenged because uh before it comes down
[03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:13.920]  it's going to be more extreme that it needs to be if we if we if we resist it
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:17.520]  or stop cooperating with it now in terms of combing the mirror well you know in
[03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:24.080]  the time we've got jack um uh difficult but in simple terms um we
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:28.480]  are projecting all the time our inner state of being
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:34.160]  um in in in many ways um um alex in the same principle as the way we have the
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:38.000]  internet as a projection of our own uh collective mind
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:41.680]  and therefore if you look at it this way um
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:45.440]  the world that we experience is like a movie screen
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:48.880]  the inner self is like the projector at the back of
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:56.080]  uh the uh theater and we can stand uh and shout and cast at the screen in the
[03:24:56.080 --> 03:25:00.000]  theater for as long as we like it ain't gonna change
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:04.880]  it's hit the screen it's a done deal we have to go back to the projector and
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:08.080]  change the real and all the time we're being
[03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:12.880]  encouraged to look outside of ourselves for answers when the answers are actually
[03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:17.280]  within us because the world is a collective
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:22.000]  expression of the current state all that's play does cave that's play does
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:26.160]  cave if they don't yeah if they don't stop that if we don't change that then
[03:25:26.160 --> 03:25:31.280]  nothing can change for instance inner self i have no power
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:34.640]  outer expression a few people run the world
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:39.680]  um inner self um i do not have the courage to stand up for what i believe
[03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:43.600]  in uh outer expression a few people run the world
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:46.800]  when we change the world must change because the power
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:51.360]  yes being used to control them yes is the power we give away
[03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:56.400]  every minute of every day beautifully said that the power dynamics shifts
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:25:59.920]  dramatically and it's all over absolutely i'm gonna jam in a few quick
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:03.360]  questions a few final uh calls from richard and john and we're out of time
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:07.680]  david this has been amazing but just in my 16 years fighting the globalist
[03:26:07.680 --> 03:26:10.880]  incredible success because i know history and believe in the destiny of
[03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:13.520]  liberty you've had incredible success there are
[03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:17.760]  other people more intelligent who have greater potential than you and i do
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:21.920]  they need to realize they have that potential and step up to the plate
[03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:24.880]  richard in canada you're on the air with david i go ahead
[03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:27.600]  greetings gentlemen it's a pleasure to speak with you both you both had a
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:31.520]  profound impact on my life uh i have a quick question like you
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:35.280]  how is she doing an amazing job of exposing the globalists in uh
[03:26:35.280 --> 03:26:38.320]  in the united states and do you do an amazing job exposing them
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:41.840]  in the uk i find there's nobody here in canada doing nearly as good of a job
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:46.640]  i was just looking i'm gonna ask if you guys could maybe impart on me a few
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:50.640]  tips on how to do your amazing research like uh yeah i mean really it's just
[03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:54.640]  studying how the world works and knowing history and then clicking
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:26:59.440]  with the info uh and and and just being that leader in your area picking the
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:02.720]  issues you're going to stand up for whether it's you know having local
[03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:06.240]  media or or the right to keep their arms or sovereignty
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:09.040]  or exposing your prime minister calling for world government
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:13.200]  david what's your view well the richard there's a blueprint
[03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:17.760]  uh there's a blueprint uh that you find in every single country and canada is
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:21.280]  no different uh in fact is one of the more extreme examples
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:25.360]  you know with my research over the years watch the country that's next door to
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:29.440]  the country what the the focus is on you know one of the great illuminati
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:33.040]  centers on the planet is is austria which is
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:35.920]  next door to the country that is focused on germany
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:39.360]  and so much stuff goes on in canada not least in
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:43.280]  ontario um that that that crosses the border
[03:27:43.280 --> 03:27:47.760]  into america is in in various ways so canada is a very very important
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:52.720]  place uh in this whole global arena not least because with the greatest respect
[03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:56.800]  people are looking at the united states primarily and not to canada
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:00.160]  and and if you that that's that's just what you want if you want to put some
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:03.840]  of your institutions and networks um in in a place where they're going to be
[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:07.760]  less seen but in terms of the blueprint if you can just
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:11.520]  uh get you out i'm sure you you you have you get your head around
[03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:16.800]  um where the they want to take the world and the methods they use to take us
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:20.240]  there um and that in effect that knowledge is like
[03:28:20.240 --> 03:28:23.440]  when you're doing a jigsaw puzzle it's like that point where you put all the
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:26.640]  straight pieces together and you've got the frame and then from that
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:31.200]  point on the country canada or anywhere you can start putting the
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:34.560]  detail in within that frame and see how it plays out in you
[03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:38.160]  david we're we're out of time richard i appreciate your call i'm sorry
[03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:41.680]  well we'll try to jam john in with a quick final comment here but
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:45.440]  it's very simple there's a continuity of agenda you find out there's global
[03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:48.160]  boards that are setting the standardized programs
[03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:51.680]  that's where you're going to find the information uh excellent points david
[03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:55.120]  quick question or comment john in illinois go ahead
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:28:58.800]  truly uh an honor to be speaking with uh such great minds uh
[03:28:58.800 --> 03:29:02.880]  now uh david uh in this egyptian uprising and then uh the more recent
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:07.040]  example in tunisia uh do you feel that this is part of the
[03:29:07.040 --> 03:29:11.200]  problem reaction solution slash order out of chaos we got to get his answer
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:15.600]  john he must have missed him earlier he said yes uh david final comments
[03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:20.240]  yes but shades of gray uh the people are overwhelmingly
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:26.000]  absolutely a genuinely reacting and uprising to grotesque injustice
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:29.520]  but we have to be sweet wise to make sure that that
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:32.960]  reaction that understandable response is not
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:37.920]  harnessed and handled so the outcome becomes what the people responsible for
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:42.560]  it when you you get behind the scenes uh responsible for the injustice i mean
[03:29:42.560 --> 03:29:46.400]  don't come out with their men in power again we're out of time
[03:29:46.400 --> 03:29:50.560]  david ike incredible job retransmission starts now in full
