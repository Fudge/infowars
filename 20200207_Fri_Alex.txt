[00:00.000 --> 00:21.880]  We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. We then went through the
[00:21.880 --> 00:27.640]  Mueller report, and they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came
[00:27.640 --> 00:33.480]  back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost
[00:33.480 --> 00:40.920]  all their money. Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday
[00:40.920 --> 00:51.240]  transmission, and we have a very special guest joining us, but I'm going to go to
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.280]  rebroadcast for a little while. We got some information I got to work on, and then I'm
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.360]  going to come back with all this breaking news and information today. Okay. And I have
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.080]  Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of the Bioweapons Act, says coronavirus is biological warfare
[01:06.080 --> 01:14.640]  weapon, and he's got in-depth intel that's breaking that no one else has, and this type
[01:14.640 --> 01:21.320]  of person has a lot of big contacts at the United Nations and worldwide. He was also
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.080]  Slavov and Milazovic's lawyer. Let me just give you an idea of the people he's connected
[01:26.080 --> 01:33.720]  to, and he's taking off teaching as a law professor today to give us exclusive information.
[01:33.720 --> 01:40.840]  He sent us a whole bunch of notes and intel that we're going to be going over here, but
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.080]  I'm going to just go to break here for a moment. I'm going to restart the transmission. After
[01:46.080 --> 01:53.480]  we come back from break, we're going to play this report. Clip one, Wuhan coronavirus
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.600]  kills doctors who warned of outbreak. Here it is.
[01:58.600 --> 02:03.640]  Days. Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one. The 34-year-old
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.640]  ophthalmologist diagnosed Saturday with the Wuhan coronavirus, dying less than a week
[02:08.640 --> 02:14.600]  later in the same hospital in which he worked. But if action had been taken when he and others
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.800]  started sounding alarms, the severity of the outbreak might have been understood sooner.
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.680]  Struggling to communicate, Li spoke with CNN briefly by phone on January 31. You could
[02:25.680 --> 02:34.040]  hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background.
[02:34.040 --> 02:38.360]  It was back in late December when Li first warned friends on WeChat about a SARS-like
[02:38.360 --> 02:43.520]  disease going around. Li sent a group message saying that a test result from a patient quarantined
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.360]  at the hospital where he worked showed a patient had a coronavirus. But hours after
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.040]  hitting send, Wuhan city health officials tracked Li down, questioning where he got
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.320]  the information. Within days, they closed the suspected source of the virus, this seafood
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.120]  market, and they announced the outbreak. But instead of being praised, Li got a call from
[03:03.120 --> 03:09.120]  Wuhan city police. With Li coughing too much and breathing too poorly to speak by phone,
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.000]  Li asked Li by text, how did you feel when this happened? I felt a little afraid, afraid
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.120]  I would be detained, afraid my family would worry, Li responded. He agreed to sign this
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.720]  document, admitting to spreading rumors online and severely disrupting social order. It reads,
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.520]  we want you to cooperate with the police and listen to our reminder and stop the illegal
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.360]  act. Can you do that? Li answered, yes I can.
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.120]  In the weeks that followed, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission maintained that there was
[03:37.120 --> 03:42.880]  no obvious evidence for human to human transmission, no infection of healthcare workers, and that
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.400]  the outbreak was, in their words, preventable and controllable. And with that, the people
[03:47.400 --> 03:53.840]  of Wuhan continued about their normal lives. Then came a sudden jump in infections. China's
[03:53.840 --> 03:58.440]  central government took over, scrambling to contain a spreading virus with a rising death
[03:58.440 --> 04:03.400]  toll. Chinese state media first reported that Li was one of several whistleblowers silenced
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.920]  by police. And that's we, Lin Lang, who's dead. Now there's massive demonstrations all
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.640]  over China, all over Hong Kong, and all over Taiwan, because the government tried to cover
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.520]  it up. And we know it's the same global policy worldwide. This thing is spreading to millions.
[04:17.520 --> 04:23.160]  I'm predicting it's killed thousands and thousands. It is a bio weapon. We have all the evidence
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.720]  and there's a big cover up going on. And so people better get ready and they better get
[04:27.720 --> 04:33.720]  serious. Now here's the bad news. It affects Asians mainly, and there's a lot of Asians
[04:33.720 --> 04:41.040]  who feel sorry for those folks. The good news is that most other groups of people do not
[04:41.040 --> 04:48.040]  even have the receptors for this. And so it is a race specific bio weapon. Now why the
[04:48.040 --> 04:52.280]  hell would the Chinese release a bio weapon on themselves? Well, they've actually talked
[04:52.280 --> 04:58.120]  about doing it before. They had a one child policy and killed 50 million plus girls.
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.400]  Well, it's here, the year 2020. World government's out in the open. We've got the predicted mass
[05:03.400 --> 05:08.240]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer. And we've got massive, huge
[05:08.240 --> 05:13.920]  censorship taking place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote
[05:13.920 --> 05:20.080]  America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[05:20.080 --> 05:24.840]  Wow. Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.040]  pedophile leader real. But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.640]  saying no. But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never
[05:33.640 --> 05:39.000]  been in Kansas. We have never been in some small, little place that didn't matter. Everything
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.800]  we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[05:43.800 --> 05:46.160]  gone through and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible town to
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.640]  be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember
[05:50.640 --> 05:56.800]  your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of MP4.com is critical.
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.440]  So please take action.
[05:58.440 --> 06:04.640]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen tearing up her copy of president's state of the union address
[06:04.640 --> 06:12.720]  last night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of the president's state of the
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.140]  union speech. But he will not be acquitted. The impeachment trial of president Donald
[06:16.140 --> 06:20.800]  John Trump is officially over. The Senate, as anticipated, did vote to acquit President
[06:20.800 --> 06:24.920]  Trump on both articles of impeachment against him. That's not how a democracy works. That's
[06:24.920 --> 06:47.280]  not how it works. That's not how any of this works. Bullsh**t.
[06:47.280 --> 06:54.140]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the info wars.com studios. It's
[06:54.140 --> 07:02.980]  Alex Jones. And here we are already Friday, February 7th, 2020. What is that year roll
[07:02.980 --> 07:10.340]  off the tongue? We're only 200 to 60, 69 days out from the historic election. Now I have
[07:10.340 --> 07:14.700]  all of this ultra massive news in front of me. I want listeners and viewers to know we're
[07:14.700 --> 07:18.540]  going to have open phones throughout the next four hours that I'm hosting. They have a very
[07:18.540 --> 07:25.580]  special guest joining us, who was the creator of the bio weapons act that the US got passed
[07:25.580 --> 07:32.700]  in the world law by the UN. And he's been a lawyer to major world leaders. He knows
[07:32.700 --> 07:37.260]  everybody at the highest levels of the World Health Organization, and he says they know
[07:37.260 --> 07:42.380]  this is a bio weapon and they're covering up with the Indian top technical scientific
[07:42.380 --> 07:51.020]  institute to inclusively found. This virus is as phony as a $3 bill. It's got the insertion
[07:51.020 --> 07:58.460]  points. It's got the markers. It's got the injection remnant points that yeah, folks,
[07:58.460 --> 08:04.380]  they've got needles so small. They've got injection systems so small, they can they
[08:04.380 --> 08:11.020]  can inject in and gene edit into viruses now. I'll just breed them and try to create them.
[08:11.020 --> 08:18.780]  They can actually edit them, but it leaves fingerprints. Plus, it's from different virus
[08:18.780 --> 08:26.780]  families. It's ridiculous. How obvious this is. He's got major breaking news enough for
[08:26.780 --> 08:31.340]  him to even take off teaching class today at the law school there in Chicago. He sent
[08:31.340 --> 08:35.580]  me a bunch of keynotes that I'm not going to get to till he joins us in the third hour.
[08:35.580 --> 08:40.860]  This is exclusive stuff from the professor and I'm just going to leave it at that and believe me,
[08:40.860 --> 08:44.300]  sticking his neck out there coming on this show with what he's about to break down.
[08:45.660 --> 08:52.380]  Now, let me say this. I've war game this a lot and we know that there is a major cover
[08:52.380 --> 08:57.980]  up going on worldwide. How bad coronavirus is and we know that they're hiding the real
[08:57.980 --> 09:01.420]  numbers have infected and the real numbers of those that are very ill and those that have
[09:01.420 --> 09:07.100]  died. And now you see the exploding numbers on cruise ships and coming off airplanes and the
[09:07.100 --> 09:11.340]  exploding numbers in hospitals around the world and they're trying to sweep the deaths under the
[09:11.340 --> 09:16.940]  rug to not create a major panic. But if health services get overwhelmed, they won't be able
[09:16.940 --> 09:22.620]  to hide it. They think that'll create a panic. China tried to hide it. China tried to cover it up.
[09:22.620 --> 09:32.540]  It didn't work. And so now they've lost confidence and their whole system is falling apart.
[09:32.540 --> 09:38.860]  They've got giant vehicles driving around spring, antiviral toxins into the air. It is a three-ring
[09:38.860 --> 09:44.140]  circus. Now, is this a cover for the fact that the Chinese economy was imploding? They lost their
[09:44.140 --> 09:50.700]  trade war with the U.S. They had major civil uprisings? Well, let's look at the different pieces.
[09:50.700 --> 09:59.100]  This coronavirus is conclusively from the SARS family. The communist Chinese have been caught four
[09:59.100 --> 10:04.540]  times releasing it out of their labs. Doesn't sound like accidents to me. China has said their
[10:04.540 --> 10:12.460]  biggest problem is too big a population. It's estimated that 50 million girls and millions
[10:12.460 --> 10:17.900]  of boys as well, but mainly girls were killed after they're born when families have them secretly
[10:17.900 --> 10:23.020]  at home in rural areas. I was going from memory, so I had them look up the number. Even from Wikipedia,
[10:23.740 --> 10:32.540]  it says 400 million births, mainly girls, since 1970 were terminated. Unknown tens of millions
[10:32.540 --> 10:39.100]  were killed as babies. So, you know, you hear these type of numbers from me and people go,
[10:39.100 --> 10:45.100]  that's an exaggeration, Alex. They didn't kill 50 million girls. I'm sorry. The Chinese estimate
[10:45.100 --> 10:55.740]  400 million. You hear stuff on this show and it sounds fake because it just reality's too crazy.
[10:56.540 --> 11:01.820]  I gotta tell people, China has mobile execution vans in every city where they don't even give
[11:01.820 --> 11:05.980]  you a trial. They just drive you around in a van so there's no building. Nobody hears your screams.
[11:05.980 --> 11:09.500]  Nobody's lined up knowing where they're going. It looks like an ambulance and then they drive up,
[11:09.500 --> 11:15.580]  butcher you on the tarmac, load the organs on and fly it out. I learned about that from human
[11:15.580 --> 11:21.740]  rights activists 25 years ago. It broke in the news five years later. In fact, I forget his name.
[11:21.740 --> 11:27.580]  Who's that famous human rights activist that got the China open to U.S. adoptions? He worked
[11:27.580 --> 11:33.340]  with the CIA and we've had him. He lives in Canada. He's really smart. I think, what is his name? And
[11:33.340 --> 11:36.700]  I can't remember it. Guys, get him back on immediately. If one of you can remember who I'm
[11:36.700 --> 11:41.020]  talking about, callers will call in and tell us. There it is, China's high-tech death vans
[11:41.020 --> 11:47.420]  where criminals are executed in there. Organs are sold back on the black market. So we can talk
[11:47.420 --> 11:51.820]  about how bad is it going to get here and I've got children and I've got family and I've lost family
[11:51.820 --> 11:56.220]  to respiratory illnesses. We all have, at least most of us have. You're lucky if you haven't.
[11:56.220 --> 12:00.460]  You're blessed. We can talk about how bad is it, but to understand that,
[12:00.460 --> 12:07.260]  that's Stephen Moser. Let's get him on immediately. There you go. Stephen Moser, China pushes,
[12:07.260 --> 12:12.060]  stop for Stephen Moser, pushes race-based narcissistic nationalism. Absolutely. Please
[12:12.060 --> 12:18.300]  print that for me. But if you're tuning in and saying, what's Jones doing right now?
[12:18.300 --> 12:22.860]  He's saying interesting things. He's all over the map. I am brainstorming right now on air.
[12:22.860 --> 12:33.340]  Because what happens is I get set and have my line of thought and then it's my fault.
[12:33.340 --> 12:37.740]  I get easily distracted. It happens at the very start of the show and then I've got to reset.
[12:38.380 --> 12:41.100]  So let me just do that as best I can here right now.
[12:43.180 --> 12:48.300]  We can talk all day about how bad is it going to be? What are they covering up? Why the giant
[12:48.300 --> 12:51.980]  response? But the media is saying it's no big deal at the same time. Why the unified global
[12:51.980 --> 12:57.740]  response? Which you've never seen before. At least I haven't. Correct me if I'm wrong with a case
[12:57.740 --> 13:03.340]  example. But to understand that and what's going to happen, you need to know the origin
[13:04.060 --> 13:08.940]  and you need to know what's behind it. And then when you know that, it gets even more frightening.
[13:10.060 --> 13:16.060]  And so we're going to be walking through it all today. I can tell you that. But it's serious
[13:16.060 --> 13:22.940]  and they're covering up what's really going on. And it's just incredible to me that it's so obviously
[13:22.940 --> 13:31.580]  a bio weapon and that it's so obviously race specific on record for Chinese men. I mean,
[13:31.580 --> 13:37.740]  it's so specific. The Chinese genome is so close. Only other group maybe is closely related for a
[13:37.740 --> 13:43.740]  large population is Koreans. And so they're just tailor made for a race specific bio weapon.
[13:43.740 --> 13:49.020]  Because you don't want to use one, a race specific bio weapon that say kills a mongrel,
[13:49.020 --> 13:52.060]  which we think it was a bad term. It's a good term, you know, for genetically being able to
[13:52.060 --> 13:58.620]  fend off against things or by those that pure breeds diseases easier. And so look at British
[13:58.620 --> 14:02.700]  royalty and people that are very sickly. They're very mentally ill. I'm not knocking Chinese folks
[14:02.700 --> 14:06.220]  to their real smart and got some great attributes. But on average, there's problems with being in
[14:06.220 --> 14:12.060]  bread. And just as a genome, the Chinese are very similar. So they're perfect to hit with a bio weapon
[14:12.060 --> 14:18.140]  because you can kill them off and not hurt your own people. They're asking for it.
[14:19.580 --> 14:23.900]  The average white person is actually made up of a whole bunch of different diverse groups,
[14:23.900 --> 14:27.820]  very hard to kill white people with bio weapons, because whites wouldn't think of themselves
[14:27.820 --> 14:31.980]  as mongrels. We're like the ultimate mongrel. In fact, the English language is the ultimate
[14:31.980 --> 14:35.820]  mongrel language is everything about it is. And the thing about a mongrel is it just takes
[14:35.820 --> 14:39.260]  everything over. He will take a piece of that will take a piece of this or whatever. But but I'm
[14:39.260 --> 14:45.660]  digressing. This is perfectly made for Chinese and it doesn't just do that. If you were morally
[14:45.660 --> 14:50.700]  going to hit a group that was attacking you, you would only hit them with something that goes
[14:50.700 --> 14:57.900]  after military aged men. And that's they're admitting it's young men. Predominantly, this is
[14:57.900 --> 15:06.220]  wiping out so specifically targeted, so specifically made. Now, do you think that just fell out of the
[15:06.220 --> 15:11.020]  sky? No. And the scientists look at it. The Indian top scientists, everybody else is looking at
[15:11.020 --> 15:14.860]  saying the same thing. They get their funding pulled if they say it. That's why the US and China
[15:14.860 --> 15:20.300]  and others who have the genome, the RNA sequence of the virus will not send it out.
[15:22.380 --> 15:26.780]  People are like, why won't you send it out? We can identify because when you get it, you go my god.
[15:28.620 --> 15:36.140]  An oak tree is organic. A 57 Chevy's man made. This is a 57 Chevy. It's made. Now, the big question
[15:36.140 --> 15:41.420]  is, did the United States launch this against China as a reaction in the war? Because China's
[15:41.420 --> 15:45.980]  been secretly attacking us and pulling a bunch of stuff. Or was it something else? I think I have
[15:45.980 --> 15:53.500]  the answer on the other side info wars.com tomorrow's news today. But all the experts I've talked to
[15:53.500 --> 16:00.940]  know this is a man made by a weapon. I'm here with Scott. You see him founder of OMG tax. Tell
[16:00.940 --> 16:06.060]  us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS. My team
[16:06.060 --> 16:11.420]  of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments sometimes in the
[16:11.420 --> 16:15.660]  same day. We even have reduced the total debt. Some of our clients were required to pay for what
[16:15.660 --> 16:21.340]  is known as an offer in compromise. Can you give us an example of somebody you help? Oh, can I ever?
[16:21.340 --> 16:29.100]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through
[16:29.100 --> 16:33.660]  the representation known as non collectible status with the government. If you owe the IRS
[16:33.660 --> 16:38.220]  more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less,

[18:00.380 --> 18:04.620]  tuning in to Owen Troyer. I love all the other shows we do here. But I'll be honest with you,
[18:05.340 --> 18:11.500]  we run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think
[18:11.500 --> 18:15.820]  you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're
[18:15.820 --> 18:20.140]  barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract. I don't want

[18:25.740 --> 18:30.460]  ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money. But we've

[19:25.100 --> 19:30.700]  I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[19:30.700 --> 19:35.180]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful
[19:35.180 --> 19:42.140]  that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago. It started taking true iodine, atomic
[19:42.140 --> 19:48.940]  iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at Infowarsstore.com. And I'm telling you

[19:55.740 --> 20:06.940]  lose unless you don't take action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:06.940 --> 20:25.260]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[20:25.260 --> 20:34.380]  What we know.
[20:39.900 --> 20:40.620]  What we know.
[20:40.620 --> 20:55.260]  What we know. Is that this bio attack is race specific, targeting specifically Chinese
[20:56.380 --> 21:02.620]  military age males. And then almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying
[21:02.620 --> 21:11.100]  are males. That's hidden in the literature. The medical reports and then you get the scan
[21:11.100 --> 21:18.540]  by the major Indian scientific gene splicing university and it's conclusive.
[21:20.300 --> 21:22.540]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah,
[21:22.540 --> 21:32.620]  it's even got the insertion gene that you see with RNA and gene editing where it was injected.
[21:33.900 --> 21:39.260]  And I'll use the analogy. It's like when you add breast implants, there's going to be scars.
[21:42.380 --> 21:49.340]  There's signatures right there. And then it just gets more insane from that point. So
[21:49.340 --> 21:56.220]  I'm not going to give the US government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the deep state on
[21:57.100 --> 22:02.540]  the American team in pissed at enough fentanyl being shipped in every couple months to kill the
[22:02.540 --> 22:08.540]  entire world population. You're like, that's what shipped into the US. Yes, enough to kill the whole
[22:08.540 --> 22:12.700]  world. That means a lot of us not even getting delivered to the drug addicts. There's just so
[22:12.700 --> 22:18.540]  much of it that one shipment they caught coming in from Mexico would kill 10.6 billion people.
[22:18.540 --> 22:22.780]  That was our estimate. Other newspapers said 11 billion after we broke that.
[22:24.700 --> 22:28.780]  That was one shipment that would kill 11 million people if they all took an overdose dose.
[22:30.140 --> 22:34.460]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out asleep during the day of sleep at night.
[22:34.460 --> 22:39.820]  They're not asleep. They're passed out on fentanyl. So is this how the United States says,
[22:40.780 --> 22:45.420]  we told you to stop that here. Here's a race specific weapon that kills military age men.
[22:45.420 --> 22:50.940]  You want to kill teenagers, boys, girls, white people, black people, Hispanics, Asians, old
[22:50.940 --> 22:58.940]  young will just hit you with a race specific bio weapon. And I've told you that's the wars of the
[22:58.940 --> 23:06.220]  future. I don't think Trump would do that. He'd hammer him economically, try to overthrow the
[23:06.220 --> 23:14.300]  Chai Kham government. I don't think Trump would do that. And Francis Boyle doesn't think that either.
[23:14.300 --> 23:17.740]  In fact, he thinks Trump's being played with a certain level. He's joining us in the third hour
[23:17.740 --> 23:20.940]  believing you don't want to miss this breaking information. It's so critical to everybody's
[23:20.940 --> 23:27.900]  future. No, it's different. If I hadn't been someone of a student of the communist Chinese,
[23:27.900 --> 23:33.740]  since I was three, four, five years old, my grandfather, my mom's dad was big into geopolitics
[23:33.740 --> 23:37.820]  and my dad was big into it, would sit there at the kitchen table when he'd visit Dallas,
[23:37.820 --> 23:42.460]  or we'd visit Austin. We lived in Dallas, my mom's parents in Austin, and they'd just have
[23:42.460 --> 23:48.300]  five hour discussions, you know, there with he'd have a highlighter, my grandfather would talk
[23:48.300 --> 23:53.260]  about ICBMs and Merv technology and what how the traders were given to the Russians and the Chai
[23:53.260 --> 23:58.300]  comms and you know, Bernard von Braun blueprints and you know, they're talking about all this crazy
[23:58.300 --> 24:04.540]  stuff. And how the Chai comms would be the future enemy, but the corrupt, you know,
[24:05.580 --> 24:07.980]  planetarius or whatever my grandfather was calling them.
[24:07.980 --> 24:14.780]  Wouldn't call them globalists, we're allying with them and selling us out because it was part of the
[24:15.580 --> 24:19.180]  plan of Satan from the end of the world and all this stuff. I mean, you're four years old,
[24:19.180 --> 24:22.860]  you're like, you know, you're six years old, you're eight years old, you're listening to this stuff.
[24:23.420 --> 24:27.420]  And your mom's like, at least a little eccentric, but my dad didn't think he was eccentric. My dad
[24:27.420 --> 24:32.780]  was a smart guy. And then my mom's brother wasn't eccentric. He was involved in black ops all in
[24:32.780 --> 24:37.420]  the world and led a lot of stuff. And he believed that all this, you know, my list of my grandfather,
[24:37.420 --> 24:43.980]  and so I grew up hearing all this stuff and how I remember being like seven years old and they
[24:43.980 --> 24:49.980]  visited us on Christmas. And I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[24:51.020 --> 24:55.500]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after Mount I'd says he wants us to newcom because they want
[24:55.500 --> 24:58.860]  to get rid of their population. They're the only group in the world that wants to get rid of them.
[24:58.860 --> 25:03.260]  That's why they fit into this world government scheme to reduce the population. And I'm telling
[25:03.260 --> 25:10.940]  you, they'll release a race specific weapon and blame it on us. That's the plan. And all, and I've
[25:10.940 --> 25:16.140]  told these stories before on air years ago, but you know about a visionary man, my mom's dad was
[25:16.140 --> 25:24.060]  smart, way too smart for his time. And I mean, bouncing off the wall smart and eccentric's the
[25:24.060 --> 25:29.980]  name of it. But you pull back from this and you think about what's going on in China, they need
[25:29.980 --> 25:33.980]  an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies, the way to unify the population or control,
[25:35.660 --> 25:39.820]  a way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump suddenly done that's wrong.
[25:41.260 --> 25:45.580]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their own military admin. It's called a balance.
[25:46.780 --> 25:51.420]  That's what the chai comms talk about. One child policy. This is even from Wikipedia.
[25:51.420 --> 25:53.900]  I don't just believe Wikipedia links through all the government sources.
[25:53.900 --> 26:00.620]  According to Chinese government, 400 million birds have been prevented and tens of millions
[26:00.620 --> 26:08.460]  have been killed after they're born. Zoom in on that place. So 400 million people, mainly girls,
[26:09.900 --> 26:14.140]  maybe we just put the article on screen for folks. We'll stop in the Wikipedia, one child policy,
[26:14.140 --> 26:29.180]  we'll pull it up for folks, but 400 million right there. There it is. So if they'll kill 400 million
[26:29.180 --> 26:35.420]  people, mainly girls, will they release a race specific bio weapon only targeting military
[26:35.420 --> 26:41.580]  aged men? Yes, because they've done the demographics and they've got an internal problem because there's
[26:41.580 --> 26:50.620]  hundreds of millions of more men than women and they can't find women. So see, first they took
[26:50.620 --> 26:56.540]  the girls away from you, then they let you get up to 30 years old or whatever, let you extinguish
[26:56.540 --> 27:06.540]  some of your energy and now they're just going to kill you. The numbers all vary. But that's
[27:06.540 --> 27:13.980]  what's going on and Gigi Ping is the culprit. Gigi Ping, if you were going to put your money on a bet,
[27:14.860 --> 27:20.700]  all the evidence points towards that because they're the ones
[27:24.460 --> 27:28.460]  that are always talking about how they need to depopulate and why they join the globalist.
[27:28.460 --> 27:32.540]  Now David Rockefeller said they're the model of the world. We want what China does to become
[27:32.540 --> 27:38.220]  the world model because they work with us and they understand. They're godless, the leadership is,
[27:38.220 --> 27:42.540]  they oppress their people, they kill Christians, they put Muslims in death camps who've done nothing
[27:43.100 --> 27:49.340]  and they're just completely anti-god out of control. I'll never forget that Christmas.
[27:50.060 --> 27:53.500]  I tear open the stuff and it's that globe, that globe still somewhere around here,
[27:54.140 --> 27:57.820]  torn up with holes punched in and stuff. My friends would come over with pencils and everything.
[27:57.820 --> 28:02.540]  My grandfather talked about the globe and showing me stuff on it. And it's that type of interest
[28:02.540 --> 28:06.860]  that they don't want the average person to have. So they just think Netflix is the world or comic
[28:06.860 --> 28:11.100]  books are the world or these comic book movies the world one has nothing to do with the reality.
[28:11.100 --> 28:15.820]  And so the evidence mounts, this is a race specific bio weapon. Well, we know it's that.
[28:15.820 --> 28:20.700]  The evidence mounts that the Chikoms launches against themselves to save face about their
[28:20.700 --> 28:26.700]  economic collapse, their lost war with the U.S. and as a way to clamp down and control their
[28:26.700 --> 28:32.780]  population and to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. While pushing out a weapon that still
[28:32.780 --> 28:38.300]  won't kill, your five times weren't likely to get this if you're a Chinese man. And then it goes
[28:38.300 --> 28:45.340]  to Asians closely related to Chinese out. But, you know, if you are black or say northern European
[28:45.340 --> 28:49.500]  or whatever, you don't have much of a chance. Bad news is if you're Hispanic, you have some
[28:49.500 --> 28:53.420]  background tens of thousands of years ago in a Chinese bloodline that came across the
[28:53.420 --> 29:00.460]  Bering Strait of you believe in that background. Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder

[33:10.860 --> 33:29.340]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:29.340 --> 33:40.700]  Well, things just got real. It's confirmed by former top U.N. experts, former top U.S. experts,
[33:40.700 --> 33:47.980]  prestigious Indian universities and so many others that the coronavirus is a man made bioweapon
[33:48.780 --> 33:53.180]  and it's spreading like wildfire and it's killing a lot of people and the chai comms tried to cover
[33:53.180 --> 34:02.220]  it up and it failed and the reports flooding out of China is piles of dead bodies. I mean,
[34:02.220 --> 34:08.620]  I've got the headlines that I hear cremation vans running 24 seven as China orders door to door
[34:08.620 --> 34:13.580]  mass roundups of infected citizens to be placed in quarantine camps. That's close quotes.
[34:15.580 --> 34:18.380]  This is now being admitted. We're going to be going over all of that.
[34:18.380 --> 34:25.020]  China orders Wuhan to round up all suspected coronavirus patients in quarantine camps.
[34:26.860 --> 34:32.140]  Notice something here. This is natural news and info wars February 6th
[34:33.660 --> 34:39.900]  and the notice it's daily mail the 7th and now AP as well today.
[34:41.180 --> 34:47.100]  Every article you see a natural news.com they just deserve the credit literally is confirmed
[34:47.100 --> 34:53.500]  within a day to seven days exactly as Mike says because Mike's an engineer and his wife's from
[34:53.500 --> 34:58.540]  Taiwan and he's got businesses over there folks and they they're reading the real stuff over there
[35:00.220 --> 35:04.140]  and so we're again we're not making any of this up and I don't just go with Mike.
[35:04.140 --> 35:07.580]  I've got Francis Boyle and I've got countless others coming on.
[35:09.660 --> 35:13.500]  In fact, hell here's some video of them loading more dead bodies and notice in that one video
[35:13.500 --> 35:18.780]  and there's we've I've seen a dozen of these in the last day at least. There's a bunch of
[35:19.980 --> 35:24.140]  looks like body bags already. There's some dead bodies already in there. Those bags look full.
[35:24.940 --> 35:29.340]  See they're stepping over some of them to load more in. So there's all these videos of vans.
[35:29.340 --> 35:33.820]  They're not picking one dead body up and taking it in. When the van doors open up there's
[35:34.460 --> 35:39.020]  multiple body bags or at least and then a dead body getting loaded in. They're going around
[35:39.020 --> 35:46.700]  picking up a lot of dead people and these videos just pour in dozens a day. So just the human
[35:46.700 --> 35:54.700]  intelligence on the ground and the observational things that are going on is this is serious
[35:54.700 --> 36:00.140]  but I'll tell you this again and here's footage from last week with just you know the piles of
[36:00.140 --> 36:05.420]  body bags in the vehicles and piles of dead bodies inside the hospital and of course they arrested
[36:05.420 --> 36:11.900]  this citizen who did this and this famous he's famous because he was a Chinese doctor who said
[36:11.900 --> 36:17.260]  a month ago this is really dangerous. It's killing a lot of people Lee Wenling
[36:18.940 --> 36:24.380]  they arrested him and then he died of the coronavirus after they released him.
[36:26.540 --> 36:27.420]  He was treating it.
[36:27.420 --> 36:34.700]  I mean look there's just there's just trash bins everywhere if you're a radio
[36:34.700 --> 36:41.180]  listener you can't see this full of body bags and these people go in the hospitals the doctors
[36:41.180 --> 36:45.020]  are like and who can blame them after like weeks of working to the death like there's
[36:45.020 --> 36:48.620]  dead people everywhere we've got a crisis we need help they're all pissed the government's
[36:48.620 --> 36:52.380]  been covering it up. So now their biggest problem is the doctors the police are by
[36:52.380 --> 36:56.460]  are just getting pissed saying you know what there's a huge cover up here we need help
[36:56.460 --> 37:01.580]  this is out of control you can't lock down Wuhan and expect us to keep it contained you better get
[37:01.580 --> 37:06.300]  people in here now or this is going to blow sky high and the chai comms just thought they could
[37:06.300 --> 37:11.420]  leave the emergency workers in place and have them work themselves to death which they're doing
[37:11.420 --> 37:18.380]  but now they're dying and that's the thing about this stuff ladies and gentlemen is that it kills
[37:18.380 --> 37:23.660]  you really really fast and again I can go over all the medical stuff and all the genetic history
[37:23.660 --> 37:30.060]  about all the articles and documents and cross references and the scans of it and the P shuttle
[37:30.060 --> 37:37.340]  gene in fact print me all that again but we know it's manufactured we know it hits five times more
[37:37.340 --> 37:47.100]  likely Chinese genome of males now if that being that looks like something the US would launch
[37:47.100 --> 37:50.940]  if you're going to be military and you're being hit with fentanyl and millions of died here and
[37:50.940 --> 37:56.620]  China won't stop it will you hit military age men and it messes up their economy and but
[37:56.620 --> 38:01.740]  we're not going to operate like that Trump can't even make a phone call to the Ukraine saying yeah
[38:01.740 --> 38:05.980]  or get a phone call great fight corruption which is US law if we give them money they've got to
[38:05.980 --> 38:11.820]  agree to that Trump is completely paralyzed other than promoting America and being able to get some
[38:11.820 --> 38:17.500]  good policies in he can't do covert operations and Trump would never sit there morally and do this
[38:17.500 --> 38:24.060]  much less have them have that over his head no way did some rogue agency do it I don't believe
[38:24.060 --> 38:28.460]  so do we have stuff on the shelf like this you better damn well believe it that's why the chai
[38:28.460 --> 38:35.340]  comms stole it out of that Canadian lamp because the United States always does its dirtiest deeds
[38:35.340 --> 38:39.740]  in England and Canada to this plausible deniability mind control operations were run out of the very
[38:39.740 --> 38:44.860]  same city that this coronavirus was weaponized in a few years ago the chai comms got caught
[38:44.860 --> 38:51.660]  stealing it that's mainstream news even admits that and so they're sitting on top this and I
[38:51.660 --> 38:56.780]  believe gg ping facing politically being overthrown because he's losing the political and economic
[38:56.780 --> 39:01.580]  war he's lost face did this to crack down have control and shut down his political enemies
[39:03.260 --> 39:07.900]  we'll walk through all the facets of it the medical background the peace shuttle gene
[39:08.700 --> 39:11.740]  what the experts are saying but we're going to take your calls throughout the next
[39:11.740 --> 39:16.620]  three and a half hours that we have left for three hours and 21 minutes
[39:18.220 --> 39:23.260]  a toll-free number to join us to give us your take on this specifically and on Trump in a
[39:23.260 --> 39:27.500]  state of the union in a speech yesterday and where you see the Dems striking back next and what you
[39:27.500 --> 39:31.660]  like to see the president do and the democrats trying to steal Iowa and now saying the Russians
[39:31.660 --> 39:36.860]  did it or four chanted it with no evidence I mean where's your homework oh the Russians ate it
[39:36.860 --> 39:47.100]  just give me a break 877-789-2539 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 and let's do first time callers again
[39:47.660 --> 39:52.380]  like we took about 40 calls yesterday we went to every call it took the whole show but we did it
[39:52.380 --> 40:01.020]  I want to hear from you 877-789-2539 877-789 alex we're gonna break I'm gonna tell you what I'm
[40:01.020 --> 40:05.740]  personally doing to fortify my immune system and it's right here it's called immune gargle
[40:05.740 --> 40:12.220]  15 parts per million silver but it's not regular silver they can make it a lot higher parts per
[40:12.220 --> 40:17.180]  million for the same price this is what's judged the best and safest it's immune gargle this is
[40:17.180 --> 40:22.140]  what the Pentagon as we showed you in the documents I had secretly found in their test text saying
[40:22.140 --> 40:27.100]  him that this is able to knock out the SARS family I'm not even saying it's gonna do that I'm just
[40:27.100 --> 40:32.380]  saying it's nano silver it's high quality and it's ingestible not just seen gargle and spit it out
[40:32.380 --> 40:39.180]  swallow some of it it's what I do and I love it it's sold out I told you yesterday was gonna sell
[40:39.180 --> 40:46.460]  out before the show ended it was sold out the 16 ounces of highest in nano colloidal silver you're
[40:46.460 --> 40:53.980]  gonna find anywhere it's gone sold out as I told you the one ounces are set to sell out at current
[40:53.980 --> 41:01.500]  sales rates by Sunday I'm keeping them at the price they are what is it 40% off to the spray bottle
[41:01.500 --> 41:05.260]  take it with you can refill it with the other bottles spread on your hands there's a coating on
[41:05.260 --> 41:10.860]  the outside in the mouth it's perfect what we do have and I explained this yesterday
[41:12.380 --> 41:16.940]  people three to one we're buying the other bottles three ounces people weren't buying it well
[41:16.940 --> 41:21.820]  suddenly everybody's buying it up it's a really great deal it's still discounted as well and I'm
[41:21.820 --> 41:26.380]  going to keep it at that discount price at least through the weekend and the current sales rates
[41:26.380 --> 41:30.380]  it'll sell out by next week a lot of people say hey if you have funding problems just go ahead and
[41:30.380 --> 41:36.860]  jack the price up I just can't do it in fact I love the crew but they know the real finances
[41:36.860 --> 41:43.020]  temperatures I caught him raising prices on the 16 ounce or I said I said I would do they said
[41:43.020 --> 41:47.340]  listen man I know the bills are on here we need to finally make some money and operate so you're
[41:47.340 --> 41:51.740]  begging for money on air I said okay fine it was plus it was already sold out tell me raise
[41:51.740 --> 41:55.260]  the price it already sold out so don't worry about I would look at the numbers that told me
[41:55.260 --> 41:59.420]  you're not raising the price on this till it sells out the three ounce or that's just what I
[41:59.420 --> 42:04.460]  metaphysically want to do I'm not going to raise prices during a crisis is this a silver bullet
[42:04.460 --> 42:07.980]  well it is called nano silver in the Pentagon labs there's a reason they call silver bullets
[42:07.980 --> 42:12.620]  silver bullets they really care well where where was the point is everybody knew silver's good
[42:13.420 --> 42:19.660]  silver's good you put coins on people's eyes when they die on the river you know sticks for
[42:19.660 --> 42:26.060]  choron or whatever but the real reason is people knew that it was associated the wagon trains going
[42:26.060 --> 42:30.300]  west it was hot they didn't know how to keep milk they throw silver dollars in the milk it
[42:30.300 --> 42:35.900]  would last two three times longer we know silver is antiviral antimicrobial and it's good for you
[42:35.900 --> 42:40.300]  in small dosages now do you want to take the super silver wound gel that's super strong of the same
[42:40.300 --> 42:45.660]  patented stuff inside you not unless you want to die no it's topical and that's it and it's the most
[42:45.660 --> 42:51.980]  powerful over the counter in the country infowarstore.com hardcore products the best you're going to find
[42:51.980 --> 42:56.780]  this like tomorrow's news today stay with us
[43:22.300 --> 43:30.700]  race war mashings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America anyone once
[43:30.700 --> 43:37.580]  we stage these attacks that there's not blaming on trump we'll also be targeted by cobra in the
[43:37.580 --> 43:47.260]  future you see when you expose our false flags and fake media i will carry out attacks and then
[43:47.260 --> 43:53.980]  blame you like we've done with alex joe's blaming him for mass shootings we committed
[43:57.580 --> 44:03.740]  it's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by homeland security
[44:03.740 --> 44:10.220]  to take out sars which is the same family as the corona virus we have it in our super silver
[44:10.220 --> 44:16.620]  toothpaste we have it in our super blue toothpaste we have it in the immune gargle products and of
[44:16.620 --> 44:22.620]  course it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold nationally we just private label it from
[44:22.620 --> 44:28.780]  the people that produce a banana tech company out of colorado and we have a stockpile of it
[44:28.780 --> 44:35.740]  but we've already sold half of the stockpile of it and i'm still offering the products at 42 50
[44:35.740 --> 44:42.540]  percent off at infowarstore.com until they sell out which most of these products are set to sell

[45:05.020 --> 45:13.260]  wars has delivered in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades because of god because of the

[45:19.180 --> 45:25.020]  gentlemen so right now humanity's awakening is explosive it's powerful it's incredible but there
[45:25.020 --> 45:30.540]  is major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight the nwo and stay

[46:20.300 --> 46:25.580]  again so i wouldn't crash tonight we wanted this virus to be peering out we wanted to just be hide
[46:25.580 --> 46:31.100]  looks like it is really really bad and is man-made and so that's why we're seeing the huge freak

[46:53.820 --> 46:56.860]  just keeping it at that sales price infowarstore.com
[46:56.860 --> 47:22.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:22.860 --> 47:30.300]  plays by intuition the digit counts as small that death number black is show plays a meme
[47:35.660 --> 47:42.060]  so senator cotton over a week ago said this is a bio weapon out of wuhan
[47:43.820 --> 47:48.220]  that's his opinion but obviously he's been given a lot of intel that we don't have but we have a
[47:48.220 --> 47:57.260]  lot of intel as well and the question is not is it man-made it is man-made the question isn't is
[47:57.260 --> 48:03.260]  it race specific it is race specific towards chinese men five times more likely than anybody else to
[48:03.260 --> 48:13.740]  die from it if you're a chinese young man that's confirmed mainline science well the question is
[48:13.740 --> 48:19.740]  who launched the weapon then or you go to somebody's house or the police you get a call that you know
[48:19.740 --> 48:23.100]  the lights have been on for three days the neighbor's house the door's open the neighbor says it's
[48:23.100 --> 48:28.860]  especially she's going there somebody's dead on the floor seven bullet holes on them you go see is
[48:28.860 --> 48:33.820]  the safe broken into that somebody takes stuff it's a robbery is it a crime of passion is it the
[48:33.820 --> 48:41.980]  ex-husband the ex-wife is it a hitman you know somebody's shocked them up but see the media
[48:41.980 --> 48:54.300]  doesn't want to have a discussion about that they just want to say oh it's a virus out of some
[48:55.820 --> 49:02.620]  exotic food market oh it's bat soup it's this lady's fault that goes viral and it's fun who grows
[49:02.620 --> 49:10.140]  they're so dumb eating bats doesn't splice the hiv delivery system into a virus isn't even the same
[49:10.140 --> 49:19.740]  family it'd be like if i had a dolphin fin welded on to my back you go dude you're not a dolphin
[49:19.740 --> 49:26.220]  like the south park episode when i could chop my wee wee off i wouldn't be a girl
[49:27.980 --> 49:31.980]  and see that's why there's this war on logic and what you can identify something because they want
[49:31.980 --> 49:36.380]  people so brainwashed that anything can be anything in the future so they can release things it doesn't
[49:36.380 --> 49:40.780]  matter what scientists say just oh no it's all natural don't worry about it so no one gets the
[49:40.780 --> 49:45.980]  blame of where it came from but this is to me i can't think about anything else trump's huge the
[49:45.980 --> 49:50.700]  economy's huge the the globalist operations what they're doing how much trouble they're in the
[49:50.700 --> 49:55.740]  democrats trying to steal it from bernie sanders again is amazing and trying to blame the russians
[49:56.380 --> 50:00.140]  and for chan we've got all those clips i mean that's entertaining as hell
[50:00.140 --> 50:08.060]  it's still serious but it's entertaining compared to deadly viruses
[50:10.780 --> 50:16.540]  so the good news is if you're not chinese you're not in as much trouble because the chinese genome
[50:16.540 --> 50:22.700]  is so close that even a other asian groups aren't as badly effective but i looked it up if you're uh
[50:25.020 --> 50:29.260]  any other group you don't have that big a problem it's still can kill you in any any
[50:29.260 --> 50:33.020]  the moment you can do that but this thing is mutating who the hell knows what else is going
[50:33.020 --> 50:39.580]  to do so it's serious for everybody but i can't sit up here and just be like everything's fine
[50:40.540 --> 50:47.180]  who knows maybe they're overreacting but here's the big problem why is trump defending gg ping
[50:47.180 --> 50:50.300]  and saying he's doing a great job and going along with the united nations
[50:52.860 --> 50:58.620]  when they're going oh gg ping's doing a fabulous job checkpoint shooting women in the head let's
[50:58.620 --> 51:03.340]  let's roll that footage if we can we can find it a few days ago woman's shot trying to get past
[51:03.340 --> 51:08.540]  checkpoint in wuhan they just shoot her right in the head i mean there's all this footage
[51:08.540 --> 51:14.300]  and the un's like oh locking up whole apartment buildings putting people in death camps oh good
[51:14.300 --> 51:20.860]  job containing it but then we finally say no more flies from china last week and the same un officials
[51:20.860 --> 51:31.260]  say that we're being xenophobic in fact i covered this few days ago i actually had the articles
[51:31.260 --> 51:36.940]  quoting the same people i should pull those articles again where uh un health organization
[51:36.940 --> 51:41.020]  praises china's response head of the un praises it and then and then pull up the articles uh
[51:41.580 --> 51:47.580]  un condemns us uh trump calling for blocking flights i want to show people not just remind them
[51:47.580 --> 51:52.780]  i want to show them the very same officials like shoot people in the head lock them up in their
[51:52.780 --> 52:00.780]  houses death camps cremation vans but don't you stop a flight from china you evil racist americans
[52:00.780 --> 52:04.940]  because that's the globalist narrative and they think there's been a death of logic
[52:04.940 --> 52:09.740]  where everybody else can lock their border down but we can't what the hell because they can't join
[52:09.740 --> 52:18.940]  trump in saying we deserve a border and that's normal like a front door on your house if the
[52:18.940 --> 52:25.340]  corona virus is no big deal why is china engaged draconian crackdown measures yeah that's that's
[52:25.340 --> 52:33.820]  the answer we know what's going on we know what's happening so i intend to take victor's call from
[52:33.820 --> 52:38.860]  europe says us release bio weapon in china you're welcome to your opinion please convince me i mean
[52:38.860 --> 52:45.500]  i think the us is the second suspect if i had a suspect list i'd say gg ping to maintain control
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.740]  to save face and they know they've got tens of millions more men than they have women because
[52:49.740 --> 52:54.540]  they targeted little girls for their extermination in the womb and even after and this is all part
[52:54.540 --> 52:59.020]  of a social engineering operation and china has the will to do it china killed over a hundred million
[52:59.020 --> 53:04.940]  other people before uh and so i would look at gg ping as the prime suspect and then i would look at
[53:04.940 --> 53:10.060]  a rogue us agency that's gotten too excited about what trump's doing and wanted to really show china
[53:10.060 --> 53:14.620]  the boss says we know that this stuff's on the shelf i would say the us is the second suspect
[53:14.620 --> 53:19.020]  she had a third party that wants a geopolitical global collapse to bring down all nation states
[53:19.020 --> 53:24.620]  that could be in play i mean it's all up to your interpretation right now we're not sure
[53:24.620 --> 53:29.020]  we just know what's man made we know it's race specific we know it's just phony is a three-dollar
[53:29.020 --> 53:37.740]  bill and again guys bring me my whole giant two folders of coronavirus news because i want to
[53:37.740 --> 53:43.500]  pull all the i want to print all the p-shuttle gene stuff and the zero hedge with the indian
[53:43.500 --> 53:48.140]  university scan of the virus and then i and the university paper on that all the stuff i had
[53:48.140 --> 53:53.740]  before i went on my aborted three four-day vacation that was a working vacation um
[53:53.740 --> 54:01.100]  um didn't matter how beautiful the caribbean was and my wife and the youngest daughter out playing
[54:01.100 --> 54:05.260]  outside i just i was inside the whole time i watched like you came here and you're working
[54:05.260 --> 54:08.380]  14 hours a day and i said yeah we're getting on airplane we're going back to you like i understand
[54:10.140 --> 54:15.260]  but that's how serious all of this is when this all got totally confirmed i'm like there's no way
[54:15.260 --> 54:22.460]  i'm sitting here in the caribbean while all of this is going on so we will start the next hour
[54:22.460 --> 54:27.340]  i will go directly to your calls and then we'll continue with your calls when professor boils
[54:27.340 --> 54:33.260]  on and then right into the fourth hour uh as well uh but that is all coming up here today
[54:33.260 --> 54:38.940]  we're going to walk through every aspect of it and i noticed that i told collars you can talk
[54:38.940 --> 54:42.780]  about trump you can talk about the economy the globalist you can talk about the open borders
[54:42.780 --> 54:48.060]  you can talk about the attack on the second whatever but i said or coronavirus that's what
[54:48.060 --> 54:58.700]  i want calls on and i noticed that almost all the calls in fact every caller is about coronavirus
[54:58.700 --> 55:07.820]  because our listeners have got their ear to the ground that's why they listen to this transmission
[55:10.380 --> 55:14.780]  and everybody knows that this is the big enchilada whatever's behind it it's synthetic
[55:14.780 --> 55:19.660]  whatever's behind it it's man may whatever's behind it there's a larger plan here and we better
[55:20.220 --> 55:25.900]  figure it out here together because this has globalists written all over it because when i
[55:25.900 --> 55:32.780]  say gg ping that is the globalist main strongman who told the devos forum three years ago he would
[55:32.780 --> 55:38.700]  defeat trump with yulker of the e u and the un wants our borders open and our flights open
[55:38.700 --> 55:44.300]  but they don't want anybody else's and so
[55:46.860 --> 55:49.740]  is this going to be the cover for some of their virus they release against us
[55:50.380 --> 55:56.700]  i don't know but all my little spider senses tell me this is the big enchilada and by the way
[55:56.700 --> 56:02.060]  we're going to break we'll go back with your calls but remember the globalists are doing
[56:02.060 --> 56:06.860]  everything they can to shut down this broadcast so when you word of mouth via email text message
[56:06.860 --> 56:09.900]  which are harder for them to censor though they're starting there as well think about how evil that
[56:09.900 --> 56:15.820]  is or word of mouth spread the word about info wars dot com info wars dot com ford slash show
[56:15.820 --> 56:22.780]  news wars dot com ford slash show band dot video and the live feeds there that's how people find
[56:22.780 --> 56:27.420]  this info that are so desperate for it so your word of mouth is key to winning the war please
[56:27.420 --> 56:32.380]  take action and separately we know why institutional buyers and corporations starting three weeks ago
[56:32.380 --> 56:38.220]  were buying up all the food they can get and that's because they know this is man made they know
[56:38.220 --> 56:47.900]  it's race specific they know this may mean war economic collapse you name it they know
[56:47.900 --> 56:51.740]  everybody's having respiratory issues i've never seen so many hell i told you i've been sick and
[56:51.740 --> 56:58.060]  almost three and a half four five years whatever i can remember it's over four years and i got

[1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:51.100]  dr lee win leong went from treating patients to becoming one the 34-year-old ophthalmologist
[1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:57.100]  diagnosed saturday with the wuhan coronavirus dying less than a week later in the same hospital in
[1:01:57.100 --> 1:02:03.420]  which he worked but if action had been taken when he and others started sounding alarms the severity
[1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:09.340]  of the outbreak might have been understood sooner struggling to communicate lee spoke with cnn
[1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:14.940]  briefly by phone on january 31st you could hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background
[1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:25.500]  it was back in late december when lee first warned friends on wechat about a SARS-like disease
[1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:30.380]  going around lee sent a group message saying that a test result from a patient quarantined at the
[1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:35.980]  hospital where he worked showed a patient had a coronavirus but hours after hitting send
[1:02:35.980 --> 1:02:41.340]  wuhan city health officials tracked lee down questioning where he got the information within
[1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:46.460]  days they closed the suspected source of the virus this seafood market and they announced the
[1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:52.860]  outbreak but instead of being praised lee got a call from wuhan city police with lee coughing
[1:02:52.860 --> 1:02:57.980]  too much and breathing too poorly to speak by phone we asked lee by text how did you feel when
[1:02:57.980 --> 1:03:02.940]  this happened i felt a little afraid afraid i would be detained afraid my family would worry
[1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:09.820]  lee responded he agreed to sign this document admitting to spreading rumors online and severely
[1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:14.700]  disrupting social order it reads we want you to cooperate with the police and listen to our
[1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:20.940]  reminder and stop the illegal act can you do that lee answered yes i can in the weeks that followed
[1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:25.740]  the wuhan municipal health commission maintained that there was no obvious evidence for human to
[1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:31.180]  human transmission no infection of healthcare workers and that the outbreak was in their words
[1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:36.380]  preventable and controllable and with that the people of wuhan continued about their normal lives
[1:03:37.340 --> 1:03:42.940]  then came a sudden jump in infections china's central government took over scrambling to contain
[1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:48.300]  a spreading virus with a rising death toll chinese state media first reported that lee was one of
[1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:54.700]  several whistleblowers silenced by police calls for lee and the others to be vindicated grew online
[1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:59.820]  china's supreme court even weighed in adding quote it might have been a fortunate thing if the
[1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:05.740]  public had listened to this rumor at the time but for many including lee and his parents it was too
[1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:11.900]  late they all contracted the coronavirus lee's condition declined rapidly but before his death
[1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:18.140]  friday he witnessed the support of thousands online who considered him a hero late thursday night
[1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:24.140]  chinese state media first reported lee's death the responses online reflected a profound grief and
[1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:29.900]  a deep anger the two topics trended on chinese social media were wuhan government owes dr lee

[1:06:55.180 --> 1:07:00.300]  now major universities and others are saying it's manufactured we've got a special guest who wrote the

[1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:41.980]  um we got a lot of phone lines here i'm gonna go to victor in europe first he says the u.s released
[1:07:41.980 --> 1:07:46.940]  a bio weapon on china and let's be clear this is a bio weapon it is man-made that's confirmed
[1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:54.860]  it is very specific why is there such a crazy response who would want this to happen who would
[1:07:54.860 --> 1:08:03.180]  be behind it what do you think victor hi uh first of all if you just look at logically it would be
[1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:10.620]  why would the chinese make release a bio warfare weapon that would affect their own species
[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:17.020]  doesn't make sense but if you look at what's been going on in the world and how china has
[1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:24.540]  come up so dramatically and they're the biggest competitor to the united states and uh the only
[1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:32.700]  vulnerability other than space weapons would be to release bio warfare so but i want to go through
[1:08:32.700 --> 1:08:37.660]  a couple of things one is i've been sprayed externally and internally and i can tell you
[1:08:38.540 --> 1:08:45.900]  some of the effects i had a farm in virginia and one day i'm driving up the driveway in my
[1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:51.980]  dump truck and all of a sudden i see this white crop duster plane coming right at me
[1:08:52.780 --> 1:09:00.300]  and then a bit of sudden banks to the left and i was shocked and i could see every little detail
[1:09:00.300 --> 1:09:06.140]  the upper wing was slightly forward the lower wing all white black stripes on the wings going
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:12.540]  in the direction of the plane underneath it had this long gray tube and then it went over my log
[1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:18.780]  cabin and sprayed this gray cloud over my log cabin and then went back in the opposite direction
[1:09:19.980 --> 1:09:24.700]  and i was in complete shock and i called up the sheriff's department they came out they were
[1:09:24.700 --> 1:09:29.820]  were deputy was interested in finding out what was going on he went to the next county to see
[1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:36.300]  if what might have happened and but then i called them back up later and they said well you know
[1:09:36.300 --> 1:09:42.300]  then they started to give me a bunch of bs and they said well it must have been a plane from the
[1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:48.780]  forest fires in the western part of virginia which was a hundred miles away and that they
[1:09:48.780 --> 1:09:55.580]  decided to spray my home and i'm like why would they do that and then then the guy finally admitted
[1:09:55.580 --> 1:10:03.820]  to me well it's a problem for northern virginia which to me meant cia and when this plane sprayed
[1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:11.100]  my property it made me realize why i had all this all these scabs over my arms and you know when i
[1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:15.980]  would work on my fear let me just stop because you're not paranoid i remember confirming with
[1:10:15.980 --> 1:10:23.020]  locals who even took photos and this we got to find it somewhere there's so much stuff's happened
[1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:30.380]  here this is like a 1997 people call me i say come to the radio office they came and the woman had her
[1:10:31.900 --> 1:10:36.460]  box cameras she said it's on here and i went and got it was in magazines they got picked up i think
[1:10:36.460 --> 1:10:43.100]  like soldier of fortune or one of those and it was a attack helicopter but we looked there was no one
[1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:48.140]  in it it was a drone and they're out there in the morning cutting wood and stuff and it flies
[1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:53.660]  they're on a hill it flies over them and sprays a school they didn't get that part they just got
[1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:57.820]  a photo of the helicopter and that was being reported everywhere and you talked about it you
[1:10:57.820 --> 1:11:02.300]  were conspiracy theorist but later i got reached out to you by the military actually saying yeah
[1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:05.820]  these are covert operations we were ordered to do but just know it's not the military it's the
[1:11:05.820 --> 1:11:11.740]  clintons and then i learned well here's an example did you hear about all over the u.s colorada texas
[1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:17.740]  new jersey drones in grids at night flying over houses you heard about that the last few months right
[1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:23.900]  a little bit well now it's all coming together i got a call from the trusted source they said
[1:11:24.860 --> 1:11:30.940]  they're testing airborne inoculations so maybe trump knows it's a bio weapon and again and he
[1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:36.460]  maybe he's being lied to about the origin and they've got drones out spraying us with airborne
[1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:41.660]  inoculations so we don't get sick from it that's how crazy this gets when they've got robot
[1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:47.500]  armies now not just amazon preparing these giant hundred story buildings that are going to have
[1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:52.140]  levels it just drones fly in and out of all day it's taking humans out of the equation folks
[1:11:52.700 --> 1:11:57.340]  and these drones you think oh they're delivering me food i like them pizza or medicine but they
[1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:02.380]  get ordered they get a little you know a handgun they come kill you you know i mean that's where
[1:12:02.380 --> 1:12:08.460]  this is going is this is the robot takeover doesn't look human directed and the chai coms whatever they
[1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:12.060]  are they're definitely dialed into the off-world stuff and i just want to and i don't want to get
[1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:16.460]  weird here folks i'm just telling you what my gut level tells me is this is something really weird
[1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:21.260]  going on it's it the globalists say they want to post human world so i believe you they've had
[1:12:22.460 --> 1:12:27.420]  so many declassified documents where the it's never even the pentagon i don't defend the pentagon
[1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:34.220]  it's always the department of energy or it's always some other subgroup sprays the town with some
[1:12:34.220 --> 1:12:38.780]  biological weapon and then they have doctors ready who are really military to test and see
[1:12:38.780 --> 1:12:43.500]  what happens so you saying you got covertly sprayed especially in northern virginia my god
[1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:48.700]  that's a huge testing ground i am not denying that happened to you uh and and you know who the
[1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:53.740]  hell knows what they were doing or what they were up to human experimentation by the criminal group
[1:12:53.740 --> 1:12:59.100]  in bed in our government's massive their excuses well how do we counter the russians and the chinese
[1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:04.700]  if we don't know that's how they take that calculated loss like they convinced the seventh day adventists
[1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:08.940]  who are great people on average i think they're great people they convinced tens of thousands
[1:13:08.940 --> 1:13:14.220]  of seventh day adventists this isn't declassified to be part of lethal experiments on themselves
[1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:22.780]  to be christlike okay so so you know who knows what they're really up to who really but i can tell
[1:13:22.780 --> 1:13:27.340]  you then a lot of the seventh day adventists get told oh you're nonviolent you don't go to war
[1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:32.620]  so we just test biologicals on you for jesus but some of those guys get convinced actually jesus
[1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:36.460]  said by a sword you're not in the seventh day adventists you're in the sword of the lord now
[1:13:36.460 --> 1:13:39.500]  i'm not talking about a white supremacist group they tell them you're in the sword of the lord
[1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:44.060]  now and this is the part when christ pulls the sword christ says dual action and now you're
[1:13:44.060 --> 1:13:50.300]  going to be a killer well somebody who's willing to die is certainly not afraid to kill okay so
[1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:58.460]  so you're the really sophisticated stuff now and uh and as i can tell you i'm okay my family's
[1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:02.060]  not in the seventh day adventists but i can just say and some of the groups and some of the stuff
[1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:06.140]  they saw they were hooked into the highest levels of it and i mean let's just say richard nixon was
[1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:10.940]  on the phone with him every day so there's a lot of crazy stuff going on and i'm just gonna leave
[1:14:10.940 --> 1:14:16.700]  it at that but but yeah um but i think to say that trump would launch this let me counter you with
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:24.380]  this brother one child policy you say why would china target its own genome or its own subspecies
[1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:29.820]  well they said that they killed 400 million girls and tens of millions after they were born
[1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:36.940]  zoom in on that and that's the chinese government admitting all of that so do you understand that
[1:14:36.940 --> 1:14:42.860]  they can inflict the wound on themselves to then get out of the fact they're losing the trade war
[1:14:42.860 --> 1:14:46.940]  and get out of the fact that gg ping is so embarrassed and use that as a way to crack down
[1:14:46.940 --> 1:14:52.300]  as a police state measure does that make sense to you it's not the most likely scenario the most
[1:14:52.300 --> 1:15:00.060]  my hypothesis in in-game 13 years old is that china and other globalists would launch bio attacks
[1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:05.260]  on themselves as a way to set the precedent for political and social and medical crackdown
[1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:09.020]  i don't like i'm just saying this today why are you saying it's the less possible scenario
[1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:16.860]  let me let me go on and tell you more about myself and what happened to me and first off and i'll go
[1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:25.180]  into how iodine saves me on my skin what happened is after this is spring i tried alcohol it didn't
[1:15:25.180 --> 1:15:30.300]  do anything then i tried peroxide it didn't do anything so then i got some beta dying solution
[1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:36.860]  which is iodine and i put that on my skin and that got rid of about 95 percent of it and so then
[1:15:36.860 --> 1:15:43.100]  after that i figured it was probably weaponized michael plasma so based on the research by dr
[1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:49.900]  garth nicholson i took dr cycling and the dr cycling got rid of the remainder and dr cycling is
[1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:57.180]  amazing now if you look at the united states and its efforts and there maybe not today maybe not

[1:19:46.300 --> 1:19:51.740]  involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of
[1:19:51.740 --> 1:20:09.500]  m4 store dot com is critical so please take action you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:11.180 --> 1:20:14.940]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:20:17.420 --> 1:20:20.780]  look i want to have this debate so i'm glad that victor called in but i gotta be
[1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:23.820]  fair to the other colleges haven't finished up we'll never get to everybody but
[1:20:25.340 --> 1:20:29.100]  he's saying that he thinks the united states are criminal elements of it launch this attack
[1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:36.460]  is gg ping gg ping's on record sterilizing and murdering hundreds of millions of zone people 400
[1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:41.980]  million they say mainly girls so to say they're now gonna hit males with a bio weapon that lets
[1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:48.380]  them take control when they explain in their own one-child policy how they're doing it that's a major
[1:20:48.380 --> 1:20:55.100]  major piece of evidence that the communist central committee the polyp bureau in china talks about
[1:20:55.100 --> 1:21:01.740]  their population being their main threat to chai kong global hegemony and the cfr and the
[1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:06.140]  rockefellers promised them the chinese century if they would agree to this and they do agree they
[1:21:06.140 --> 1:21:11.660]  they believe in that plan i'm talking global policy i'm not saying you didn't get sprayed you know i
[1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:18.220]  remember 15 16 years ago because i've been on coast to coast a.m with george noring and it was
[1:21:18.220 --> 1:21:27.340]  4 a.m and i went out in the backyard to smoke a cigar after i got off at 4 a.m and drink a beer
[1:21:28.780 --> 1:21:32.140]  before i try to go to sleep for like two hours and go in and get ready to do my own show
[1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:37.260]  and i'm drinking a beer at like 4 a.m it's low clouds and a sesta flies over i know a sesta might
[1:21:37.260 --> 1:21:42.540]  have had one and it's got spray tanks spraying stuff and i watch this stuff and it smells like
[1:21:42.540 --> 1:21:48.300]  pesticide and i go on air i look online can't find it i bet you about it and about a week later i
[1:21:48.300 --> 1:21:54.220]  gonna call from the state of texas and they go yeah we heard about this here's a guy you can call
[1:21:54.220 --> 1:21:58.780]  and he goes yes sir and they sent me a press release they emailed it to me i covered it on air
[1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:07.740]  they were spraying for some chinese moth same deal again that burrows into trees and eats them and
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:12.540]  now who knows if that was even what they were spraying for but yes there's a lot of spraying
[1:22:12.540 --> 1:22:17.820]  and a lot of weird and now because later it came out there was this giant statewide spraying for
[1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:23.820]  this there was a beetle from like indonesia and there was a moth and they were eating the trees and
[1:22:23.820 --> 1:22:29.260]  and invasive everybody knows that goes on so i'm not saying somebody didn't fly over and spray
[1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:34.220]  i mean hell i remember the sunshine project 20 years ago got a marine corps document they
[1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:39.660]  accidentally declassified of the marine corps has drone helicopters ready around the country
[1:22:40.380 --> 1:22:45.340]  with opiate gases to knock out populations during civil unrest but they find about a
[1:22:45.340 --> 1:22:51.100]  nine percent death rate in simulations because people run cars fires happen you know i mean
[1:22:51.100 --> 1:22:56.940]  you fly over and spray people with super basically it was fentanyl that's why MIT developed it the
[1:22:56.940 --> 1:23:01.660]  marine corps has fentanyl loaded helicopters that was just this document i'm sure others have it
[1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:08.380]  there's a spotted lantern fliler yeah i said a moth that was it that was it good job girl now you
[1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:14.940]  found that that's in another state but there's a lot of stuff going on and most agencies are told
[1:23:14.940 --> 1:23:20.060]  oh it's for this but really it's for that so i'm not disagreeing with you all i'm saying is
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:26.300]  is the chai comms are the only group that openly adopted the eugenics model the malthusian model
[1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:29.980]  because they believe they have too many people and that's what's holding them back from global
[1:23:29.980 --> 1:23:35.580]  domination they don't just see humans as cheap like surf lords do they see them as garbage to
[1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:41.420]  be taken out and dumped they see them as a minus you're not just a zero you're a minus to the chai
[1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:46.860]  comms according to any communist system you're a zero but the chai com world you're a minus
[1:23:46.860 --> 1:23:53.260]  does that make sense can i make two points okay you never respond to me you never respond to
[1:23:53.260 --> 1:23:58.300]  they say they want to reduce their population and then you just go that you don't respond to that
[1:23:59.580 --> 1:24:04.780]  can i can i make mention a few things too sure there's another possibility that it could be
[1:24:05.820 --> 1:24:11.820]  a lot of people talk about china versus us but there is behind the scenes an international group
[1:24:11.820 --> 1:24:19.980]  that goes cross borders that this could be part of now and and if you and i'll make i'll make a
[1:24:19.980 --> 1:24:27.900]  point on your side okay golf war syndrome i have a friend who's a military contractor for cia and he
[1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:35.260]  told me to my faith that it was in the vaccine that so he asked herself why would the united states
[1:24:35.260 --> 1:24:43.500]  give its own troops this golf war syndrome this weaponized michael plasma so you know i this is
[1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:50.620]  arguing on your side okay and they eventually they wanted to spread it worldwide now i had um
[1:24:51.260 --> 1:24:56.300]  well that's right you use your own it was homosexual men in new york and 79 with hiv that's
[1:24:56.300 --> 1:25:02.860]  declassified u.s military personnel are perfect to vector it worldwide as well yeah whatever the
[1:25:02.860 --> 1:25:10.860]  whatever the bio weapon is by the way if you remember back in the 2009 the avian flu um there
[1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:18.940]  was a woman in ukraine who saw a plane spraying that area and right afterwards everybody got
[1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:24.220]  sick sir there is no doubt there's corporate private and governmental testing i appreciate your
[1:25:24.220 --> 1:25:28.460]  call i just i love these calls but it's so frustrating i just spent a segment and a half of
[1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:37.820]  one guy great caller we gotta take more calls uh let's go ahead and take a call from maria in
[1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:43.340]  washington state maria thanks for calling go ahead hi alex i love you so much i love olyn
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:50.460]  shroyer i love will johnson i just wanted to ask you um have you ever heard alex of a lie so big
[1:25:50.460 --> 1:25:55.900]  people believe it when you have media schools magazine that's joseph gerbils we're gonna tell
[1:25:55.900 --> 1:26:00.780]  a lie tell one so big that it's unbelievable that someone would tell someone that big and we know
[1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:05.820]  about the fake news media events we know about the fake vaccine agenda we know about the fake
[1:26:05.820 --> 1:26:13.740]  hurricanes the crisis actors the massive noses of people in 9 11 staged news and uh the coronavirus
[1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:19.180]  is like a common cold that they test you with the electronic device and anybody that's not
[1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:24.860]  scientific anybody can have a fever for whatever reason and um olyn shroyer was talking about how
[1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:32.220]  the on twitter at the wuhan hospital uh it has a hole in the ground by the doors and um they
[1:26:32.220 --> 1:26:35.980]  could poison people with the medicine they could blame it on corona they could put poison in the
[1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:40.300]  water oh gg pink could clearly use this a lot of people are saying that because they're mainly
[1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:45.740]  going after christians it looks like this is a cover yes and all we see about the corral we can't
[1:26:45.740 --> 1:26:50.780]  see it it's just cartoons and how can you believe anything they say and what if they're just genociding
[1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:55.180]  the people and a soft kill this is how you would do it you wouldn't come out and kill people i'm just
[1:26:55.180 --> 1:27:01.180]  saying gut level i don't think president trump would do this morally but b he can't even call up
[1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:06.540]  and say don't be corrupt under law to somebody he's not launching bio weapon attacks but the
[1:27:06.540 --> 1:27:11.420]  chai coms have done this type of stuff they're people that's all i'm saying at the beginning you
[1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:16.220]  said this this was as phony as a three dollar bill you called it ridiculous and trudged you
[1:27:16.220 --> 1:27:22.060]  forward virus hoax in a headline and um i'm thinking this is a cue for other countries to
[1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:28.700]  pick up this dark project and uh it could be psychological you know when you've got everything
[1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:33.340]  bombarding you well i tell you this when it's a real bio attack they don't usually tell you but
[1:27:33.980 --> 1:27:38.060]  almost everybody i know has had really bad respiratory problems and then they could take
[1:27:38.060 --> 1:27:42.700]  other stuff that's going on and then make this the cover for it you're certainly right a lot of
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:46.620]  times they'll say it's one thing but it's really another but i don't think they're faking the thousands
[1:27:46.620 --> 1:27:52.140]  of videos of the body bags and the people being killed in the streets and people falling down and
[1:27:52.140 --> 1:27:57.100]  all this this could be a chinese communist test for social control and they've got people out
[1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:03.180]  scripting it you're absolutely right we have seen the left hired astroturf actual firms that are
[1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:09.900]  online that hire thousands for events like charlottesville we pointed out and they sue us for saying it
[1:28:09.900 --> 1:28:14.940]  when they advertise and hired not people to get the woman killed that part was a stage but they
[1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:21.180]  have the clash most the white supremacists were hired to play the part and again nothing against
[1:28:21.180 --> 1:28:26.540]  gay people but you know guys that are 35 never got an acting job was a bunch of little potbellied

[1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:48.460]  i may disagree with you but we'll take a lot of calls this segment but what we know is this
[1:33:48.460 --> 1:33:53.020]  coronavirus is man-made how deadly is it well that's up for grabs but it looks a lot worse than
[1:33:53.020 --> 1:33:57.180]  what they've been saying the response has been much bigger and now we know cruise ships are
[1:33:57.180 --> 1:34:01.980]  showing up and people have already gotten in there's no containing it but it is race specific so
[1:34:02.620 --> 1:34:07.100]  that's just incredible then there's all this other amazing news and info wars.com
[1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:14.060]  dnc accused of sharing the wealth redistributing bernie votes other candidates well can bernie
[1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:19.180]  sanders even complain about that it's fair to redistribute what other people have gained
[1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:26.060]  huh shows us that communism is of course what's next giving the presidential medal of freedom to
[1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:34.700]  david duke that's right evil rush lembaugh who's just a mainline conservative he's a bad guy
[1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.940]  but china that kills 400 million little girls they're good guys
[1:34:40.220 --> 1:34:45.100]  because only white people can be bad they're using our own western openness against us
[1:34:45.100 --> 1:34:49.420]  teaching us how we're bad teaching us to hate ourselves and then saying once new people get here
[1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:54.940]  they've got to be brainwashed by the globalist to hate america or we're racist for not stopping them
[1:34:54.940 --> 1:35:02.700]  from destroying us unbelievable psychological warfare okay so let's go ahead and go to your phone
[1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:09.900]  calls we've got bob and zeke and mark and jerry and caron and elliot and natalie and jessey and dj
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:17.100]  and so many others who's been holding the longest that'd be dj and georgia again on the wuhan
[1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:23.100]  coronavirus in hong kong go ahead and give us your take all right alex it's such an honor to speak
[1:35:23.100 --> 1:35:28.140]  to you back at you i participated in your folks on contest a long time ago i did that lego beatnik
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:33.180]  version i don't know if you ever got to see it i did i loved it awesome man that's i was hoping
[1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:38.220]  you get a kick out of it but i just wanted to say um this wuhan corona coronavirus is starting to look
[1:35:38.220 --> 1:35:42.220]  like a possible cover-up to round up or just get rid of political dissidents who may have been
[1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:48.220]  sympathetic to like the hong kong protesters i think it's a real thing but you know engineered
[1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:52.140]  for that purpose so they can have a convenient opportunity to purge all dissidents right in
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:36:00.220]  front of the world and have the world endorse it right yeah i don't like trump endorsing what gg
[1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:06.860]  ping has done while the un criticizes us for blocking flights so kill people shoot them in the head
[1:36:06.860 --> 1:36:12.220]  if they try to leave quarantine and wuhan but they should be allowed to fly here from china what
[1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:19.660]  how does the uan get away with that i know man there's so many conflicting stories but you know
[1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:24.300]  china covering it up but also enacting such draconian measures it i don't know i'm getting that kind
[1:36:24.300 --> 1:36:29.180]  of vibe like it's a cover-up and an excuse to get i don't know i think with the hong kong protesters
[1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:35.820]  you see a possible um uprising and a hunger for freedom that might have spread to china and
[1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:43.820]  they can clamp all that down with this coronavirus release i think that's why gg ping's behind it
[1:36:43.820 --> 1:36:48.220]  like why would he release a race specific bioweapon himself well they say their policies to reduce
[1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:52.700]  their population they already killed 400 million girls well it's time for some boys to die i kept
[1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:57.820]  asking the earlier caller that like don't you understand they've stated why they do it it
[1:36:57.820 --> 1:37:03.100]  changes the subject for them losing the trade war it makes gg ping and china the victim that makes
[1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:07.900]  them heroes for controlling it and the whole world jumps on and says you've done a great job
[1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:12.860]  exactly so i look at this footage of people walking around with
[1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:19.340]  what looks like assault rifles going around and people up good lord thank you great points dj
[1:37:22.780 --> 1:37:27.660]  let's go ahead dr caron in california thanks for calling she says china genetic code engineering
[1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:32.780]  coronavirus give us your take please caron hi have you heard of hamlin's razor
[1:37:34.780 --> 1:37:42.380]  outcomes earlier with that it says never attribute to malice what can easily be attributed to
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:51.020]  stupidity and my my uh thing is it may be genetically engineered but maybe it was an
[1:37:51.020 --> 1:37:57.100]  accident you remember um about half a year ago or about a year ago there was a geneticist uh
[1:37:57.100 --> 1:38:04.620]  genetic engineer in china that was trying to genetically engineer um children babies uh to
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:10.780]  be resistant to the hiv yeah that's right they were they weren't trying to they were gene editing
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:19.420]  correct so for what happens when a common coronavirus enters the bodies of these children
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:28.380]  and mutates it's possible that this was simply an accident it would be race specific it would
[1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:35.260]  explain the race specific aspect it would explain the hiv connection and the chinese ethnic connection
[1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:39.980]  yeah i just don't think you have enough gene edited chi-coms maybe it says a few hundred maximum
[1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:46.620]  not even that to then well what i'm saying is that it may simply be an accident a mutation
[1:38:46.620 --> 1:38:52.860]  that because you said the they did a genomic uh sequencing of this and that they discovered that
[1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:57.740]  there was a connection with with aids that would explain oh it could be mutating they could just
[1:38:57.740 --> 1:39:02.060]  be shedding it off of them because if you're gonna make them immune to it and they've cut hiv into
[1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:08.140]  these kids they're just offgassing it yes and what what we don't know what happens because well
[1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:13.340]  yeah that's why you don't just randomly change the gene and then go well like like they did this
[1:39:13.340 --> 1:39:18.060]  50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago it keeps happening they'll change the potato or corn
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:22.780]  and it works in that first generation but then it gets worse and worse so monsanto goes well we'll
[1:39:22.780 --> 1:39:27.420]  just not have it be able to replicate you've got to buy it from us each time that way now they've
[1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:32.540]  killed the whole life process but you get into the whole uh beyond frankenstein situation great
[1:39:32.540 --> 1:39:38.220]  point who the hell knows exactly china is doing so many experiments human animal clones cows that
[1:39:38.220 --> 1:39:43.980]  produce human milk 20 years ago that we know of the spider goats who the hell knows
[1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:53.420]  exactly it's it's very scary but it can happen it can be an explanation for what's going on there
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:40:00.140]  got china is a giant mad scientist globalist playground thank you so much for the call amazing
[1:40:00.140 --> 1:40:06.860]  points these are amazing points natalie in california the coronavirus thanks for joining us
[1:40:06.860 --> 1:40:14.860]  hi alex it's exciting to talk to you um yeah so i live in south orange county and about 20 minutes
[1:40:14.860 --> 1:40:21.500]  from one of the california patients that were tested positive for the coronavirus and um my son
[1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:28.460]  who's 12 he was saying that he and and other kids went to school with masks so i feel like in the
[1:40:28.460 --> 1:40:34.780]  community there is a lot of fear but there's nothing on the news with for one updates on the
[1:40:34.780 --> 1:40:41.020]  patient and two like there's there's just nothing there's no panic or stress and from the footage
[1:40:41.020 --> 1:40:48.380]  that's coming from china i feel like there should be more i don't understand yeah and you just see
[1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:54.540]  the footage of them dragging people out of their houses into quarantine it's it's uh i mean what
[1:40:54.540 --> 1:40:59.580]  we're seeing is the image of a breakdown of society so i get gg ping wanted to get control
[1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:03.820]  but it just shows how they don't have control because this stuff's coming out and this is killing
[1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:09.340]  the chai calm century this is killing globalism which adds a thing of k maybe it's the west
[1:41:09.340 --> 1:41:14.860]  revenge but maybe it's the incompetence of communism i mean look at russia i mean russians are smart
[1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:19.500]  but once they were under communism reactors blowing up all sorts of
[1:41:20.220 --> 1:41:25.820]  anthrax being released bio weapons constantly and it was just because everybody's a yes man
[1:41:25.820 --> 1:41:31.020]  not that they're dumb you put out negative information you get in trouble you report
[1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:36.140]  everything's fine you get promoted and it just creates a disaster that's why authoritarianism
[1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:42.220]  doesn't work the us has had its own problems but it saw the british only were promoting people that
[1:41:42.220 --> 1:41:47.420]  were lords or royal the us was about we'll kick your ass and promote people that actually have
[1:41:47.420 --> 1:41:52.460]  what it takes and we did that and we were the been the dominant force now we're getting away from
[1:41:52.460 --> 1:41:58.940]  that we're falling apart but i think you fit the knoll in the head yeah also um i wanted to plug
[1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:04.300]  some of your products my son he's seven and he loves the immune gargle we got the little spray
[1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:09.340]  bottle and every morning he asks him that he wants to spray it himself it's his favorite product
[1:42:10.060 --> 1:42:16.620]  i do the fish oils for the kids the lung cleanse is one of my favorite iodine is is amazing so thank
[1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:22.700]  you so much for the products oh and the xanax i used to take xanax and the happy's is the greatest
[1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:28.540]  replacement for that i was in such a fog and i don't have that with the happy so thank you well
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:34.780]  thank you and i appreciate your call um i haven't talked enough about happy's because it's just an
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:38.780]  herbal product with a bunch of known concentrated herbs that have been in all these studies double
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:43.500]  blind stuff proven to be way better than these hardcore drugs folks are taking and it's it's
[1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:48.220]  really a sleeper product it barely even sells but we keep it on the shelves people that do get it
[1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:53.740]  has a like a 99 percent review rate i just haven't properly promoted the product but happy's is incredible
[1:42:53.740 --> 1:43:01.420]  the demand for food has not let up we are selling record amounts of it everybody else
[1:43:01.420 --> 1:43:07.340]  has basically already sold out or they have giant wait list our suppliers have it in-house

[1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:53.180]  documentary i just wanted to touch on the impeachment acquittal why are we focusing on the president i
[1:50:53.180 --> 1:51:00.060]  mean joe biden admitted publicly and doing the same exact thing that they're trying to say
[1:51:00.060 --> 1:51:07.660]  that the trump did and and we all know that really it's congress and the deep state and the cia
[1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:13.740]  that are really running the show i say we impeach all of it just hit the reset button you know
[1:51:16.620 --> 1:51:20.780]  i totally agree with you what do you think the dems are going to pull next now that they'd been
[1:51:20.780 --> 1:51:28.140]  and routed again you know it's hard to say i mean everybody's rooting for
[1:51:28.700 --> 1:51:33.500]  Pelosi now that she pulled her little petty stunt ripping up the state of the union
[1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:38.060]  addressed and everybody's acting like oh yeah she's so anti-trump i mean she just went along
[1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:43.500]  a couple weeks ago and signed off on his military spending bill i'm telling you it's all a show man
[1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:50.220]  i mean they don't really care about any of this they're all swamp beasts we just need a giant bottle
[1:51:50.220 --> 1:51:53.740]  of like drayno or something to flush your ball out
[1:51:57.020 --> 1:51:59.340]  well i think that's where it's going bob i appreciate your call
[1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:05.420]  moving to the calls fast here now today jerry in chicago illinois thanks for calling
[1:52:06.540 --> 1:52:14.940]  yes um i'll be quick i know that the you're busy right now china is a disaster on many levels
[1:52:14.940 --> 1:52:20.620]  uh one that people aren't talking about is you have a province 54 million people under
[1:52:21.180 --> 1:52:26.140]  marshal law uh the rest of the country under sudo marshal law nobody everybody in the country
[1:52:26.140 --> 1:52:32.220]  knows something's going on nobody's going out um whole cities in china are just those towns
[1:52:32.780 --> 1:52:38.060]  and that's affecting many sectors of their economy that they're backlogged on many orders that are
[1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:47.900]  not just not being delivered and uh you have the chinese bank bailing out its own stock market for
[1:52:47.900 --> 1:52:53.260]  the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars you have wall street funneling clandestinely
[1:52:53.260 --> 1:53:00.140]  trillion dollars of liquidity into the stock market so you're looking at this being a huge
[1:53:00.140 --> 1:53:09.500]  powder keg in a sparse factory the the economy of china will affect the economy every other
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:15.260]  country so it's like a kind of like a domino effect so you look at that situation and you think
[1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:19.180]  that this could be like a black swan on another level
[1:53:22.140 --> 1:53:26.060]  an attempt to bring down the global economy because china has become to a great extent
[1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:32.940]  the engine of all the consumerism yep that's exactly right and right now people need to
[1:53:32.940 --> 1:53:40.220]  understand that the the same you know antics that are going on over there will be put in
[1:53:40.220 --> 1:53:45.900]  other parts of the world once things break down and you know it's really time for them to prepare
[1:53:45.900 --> 1:53:53.260]  you know and you have a lot of very good products i've purchased many of them and know that you have
[1:53:53.260 --> 1:54:02.380]  a 360 win mentality which is you know something that i i admire about you you know you give an honest
[1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:09.980]  price for for an honest product and the chai comms give you a product i'm not trying to be mean but
[1:54:09.980 --> 1:54:14.460]  the joke is a chinese toy breaks by the time it's out of the box i mean they never last more than a
[1:54:14.460 --> 1:54:20.300]  few hours and you buy some old american toy or old even japanese toy or old like german toys or
[1:54:20.300 --> 1:54:25.020]  whatever they just never break you buy some from china it's like they know we're using them
[1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:30.940]  they're using us and it's and it's like an iphone it's like a thousand dollars now
[1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:37.900]  they said there's like fifty dollars in it maybe and even gg ping of years ago told tim cook hey
[1:54:37.900 --> 1:54:45.180]  could you pay a little more so that our workers you know can have a house to live in and tim cook
[1:54:45.180 --> 1:54:49.900]  just laughed at him and said we're back in your party he's on record he said i'll back any censorship
[1:54:49.900 --> 1:54:55.900]  of oppression you want you just do what i say i mean tim cook is more evil than gg ping gg ping
[1:54:55.900 --> 1:55:03.980]  tried to get money for chinese but again it's okay because tim cooks gay right well you know uh
[1:55:04.540 --> 1:55:11.420]  one thing i i would like to say is um seeing as how you do have uh a lot of product to help on many
[1:55:11.420 --> 1:55:17.740]  different levels uh it would be nice if you had a a product that would help people stay solvent
[1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:24.620]  in case situations arise and um i actually think i have a product like that that you could use
[1:55:24.620 --> 1:55:29.820]  and it's one of those 360 wins where you would help them and they would help you i never promote
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:33.740]  financial products because none of them are perfect it's not like an even exchange i can't
[1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:37.660]  prove it'll be good down the road but other than like gold or silver that goes up and down i mean
[1:55:37.660 --> 1:55:44.380]  what's the financial product well that that's uh that's what it is it's uh a precious metals but
[1:55:44.380 --> 1:55:50.860]  in in in very very small form uh so we're talking about you know tiny little amounts
[1:55:50.860 --> 1:55:59.020]  so that people can get started i think that's smart so so what is it uh like uh it's it's in the
[1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:06.060]  gram form right so you're just buying a gram or two up to the person how they want to purchase it
[1:56:06.060 --> 1:56:11.260]  and this way they can get started on on no i agree just with the i think like trading cards
[1:56:11.260 --> 1:56:15.260]  concerning metals and and rare earth minerals would be a great way to people understanding
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:19.420]  how it's the real currency the planet the globalists get that all and i appreciate your call
[1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:25.100]  let me explain this you hear about jeff bezos worth 150 billion folks he's not worked that
[1:56:25.100 --> 1:56:30.620]  that's all inflated crazy stock if you try to spend it his company would go down in one day
[1:56:30.620 --> 1:56:37.180]  so people go my god two percent of all the money it's all fiat now it doesn't mean anything
[1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:41.180]  if it's not an economy or people to spend it in it's worthless the globalists are trying to convince
[1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:45.020]  themselves robots will take over and they'll because they got everything through fraud the
[1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:50.620]  robots will keep control and all be left alone not gonna work that way it's a human economy
[1:56:50.620 --> 1:56:56.060]  or it's nothing and in your attempt to take us down and take control you will do one thing and
[1:56:56.060 --> 1:57:03.500]  that's die so i'm trying to build a human economy i built i've bet on it i believe in it and you see
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:08.060]  it beginning to succeed thank you so much i appreciate your call more calls coming up

[1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:12.620]  he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but
[1:58:12.620 --> 1:58:17.260]  trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's for
[1:58:17.260 --> 1:58:23.580]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[1:58:23.580 --> 1:58:29.980]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in
[1:58:29.980 --> 1:58:34.300]  a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[1:58:34.300 --> 1:58:40.140]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize

[2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:51.500]  chairs were supposed to use to call in results to the iowa democratic party but explicitly
[2:00:51.500 --> 2:00:56.380]  encouraging one another to call and call and call again specifically to clog up the lines
[2:00:56.380 --> 2:01:02.860]  specifically to mess with the democrats ability to carry out the caucus quote f them up keep
[2:01:02.860 --> 2:01:06.940]  clogging the lines keep clogging the lines the results are not being reported because the lines
[2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:13.500]  are clogged keep clogging the lines now it is clear that that is not the only thing that went
[2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:17.500]  wrong with the tabulation of the iowa caucus results on monday but that it turns out is one
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:22.060]  of the things that went wrong and it is the kind of thing we have seen before
[2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:30.300]  the next democratic nominating contest in 2020 is tuesday in new hampshire new hampshire state
[2:01:30.300 --> 2:01:34.860]  officials today held a press conference to assure everybody in the state and around the country
[2:01:34.860 --> 2:01:39.740]  that what happened in iowa isn't going to happen there that they have every confidence that absolutely
[2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:45.900]  nothing will go wrong with the primary in new hampshire on tuesday one reporter asked explicitly
[2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:52.140]  whether the 2002 phone jamming scandal from new hampshire might be a worrying past precedent
[2:01:52.140 --> 2:01:56.780]  for that state given what just appears to have happened in iowa new hampshire's republican
[2:01:56.780 --> 2:02:01.500]  governor responded to that question by dismissing the matter entirely saying that issue from nearly
[2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:06.940]  20 years ago just doesn't apply today it should be noted that the new hampshire governor right
[2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:12.700]  now is a man named chris sununu who is the younger brother of former senator john sununu
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:17.260]  who is the guy who benefited from the illegal phone jamming scheme for which people went to
[2:02:17.260 --> 2:02:25.900]  prison in new hampshire in that election 18 years ago so i mean once again weather
[2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:32.940]  once again by the way info wars wrote a story about that
[2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:40.140]  chan is an anonymous bathroom wall that you can write things on you can write truth you can write
[2:02:40.140 --> 2:02:46.620]  lies you can write nonsense but that was written after the democrats stole it from bernie sanders
[2:02:46.620 --> 2:02:53.100]  again when he clearly won the majority and they even admit that so she says it's for chan
[2:02:55.740 --> 2:03:02.540]  when for chan wrote that after people go auto criticize for chan like we're mental patients
[2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:07.900]  don't criticize the walls of roam where anybody can write something it's like anonymous oh it better
[2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:12.860]  not mess with anonymous anonymous as anybody wants to wear a guy fox mask do i have to bow down to it
[2:03:12.860 --> 2:03:20.460]  because it's q the anonymous or it's it's it's guy fox the anonymous or no you trust people that
[2:03:20.460 --> 2:03:25.340]  have been around a long time that are there on record with integrity trying to figure the truth
[2:03:25.340 --> 2:03:29.580]  out it doesn't mean they're perfect doesn't mean i'm right all the time but we're right 97 percent
[2:03:29.580 --> 2:03:33.500]  98 percent of the time somebody else who's been right a lot of stocker frances boil creator the
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:37.820]  us bio weapons act he joins us coming up and then we have the fourth hour i'll continue with
[2:03:37.820 --> 2:03:41.980]  these calls everybody holding or we can call you back or we can hang everybody up if you want to go
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:46.460]  and we'll talk to you next uh hour um but for the next 55 minutes when you're going to break
[2:03:46.460 --> 2:03:50.860]  about frances boils here and he's done a lot of work he sent us a lot of notes to go over we've got
[2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:56.140]  literal scans of the virus from major universities we've got everything and this is one of the
[2:03:56.140 --> 2:04:01.100]  leading experts in the world not just on the medical side the genome and then the RNA side
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:07.420]  but also on the geopolitical and the UN sources and he said look the UN knows this is a bio weapon
[2:04:08.140 --> 2:04:13.340]  we know the whole coronavirus situation has had it written all over so there's a lot to look at here
[2:04:14.220 --> 2:04:19.260]  all i know is this is big and i agree with him he sent me some notes saying
[2:04:19.260 --> 2:04:27.740]  Trump is publicly congratulating gg ping that is not a good move yet shooting people at checkpoints
[2:04:28.780 --> 2:04:35.580]  locking down whole cities trump does have an authoritarian strike and i like an american
[2:04:35.580 --> 2:04:41.180]  that takes the country back from globalists but that's not authoritarian i like a strong person
[2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:48.220]  in the constitution not a strong man so uh we'll we'll look at why trump is praising gg ping while
[2:04:48.220 --> 2:04:56.140]  gg ping bitches to the un that we don't want to fly from china well it's here the year 2020
[2:04:56.140 --> 2:05:00.620]  world government's out in the open we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for
[2:05:00.620 --> 2:05:06.300]  global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated
[2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:13.420]  by big tech and banks against people that promote america and guns and freedom and jesus and the
[2:05:13.420 --> 2:05:19.500]  family and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new world order is real
[2:05:19.500 --> 2:05:24.540]  satanism is real the pedophile leader real but we're real as well and we love god and we're standing
[2:05:24.540 --> 2:05:29.740]  up and saying no but i just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been
[2:05:29.740 --> 2:05:35.500]  in Kansas we have never been in some small village place that didn't matter everything we do every
[2:05:35.500 --> 2:05:40.380]  decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything
[2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:43.820]  we're going to go through so it's an incredible town to be alive i'm going to thank you all for
[2:05:43.820 --> 2:05:49.340]  being aware and being involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and
[2:05:49.340 --> 2:05:53.420]  financial support of m4 store.com is critical so please take action
[2:05:53.420 --> 2:06:09.340]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:09.340 --> 2:06:27.100]  the best thing i can do is just let professor dr frances say boil take over at least for
[2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:32.300]  the next two segments and host because i know a lot but enough to get in trouble not enough to get
[2:06:32.300 --> 2:06:38.460]  us out of trouble but he's a leading american uh expert international law he's represented world
[2:06:38.460 --> 2:06:43.020]  leaders at the hag i'm not going to go over at all he's responsible for the biological weapons
[2:06:43.020 --> 2:06:48.460]  anti-terrorism act of 89 that was adopted by the un american implementing legislation in the 72
[2:06:48.460 --> 2:06:52.060]  biological weapons convention he's serving the board of directors of ambice international
[2:06:52.060 --> 2:06:55.740]  i'm just going to stop there because we don't have time to go over at all he's a birch and
[2:06:55.740 --> 2:07:01.500]  rustle peace lecturer professor he went to the special phd only one person gets a year at harvard
[2:07:01.500 --> 2:07:05.660]  the kiss of your god he was groomed for them turned against him and i'm just going to stop
[2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:10.380]  there he holds the doctor of law magnum cum laude at phd and political scientists from harvard
[2:07:10.380 --> 2:07:16.140]  university and his latest book is poems against the empire and he joins us now for a truly
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:22.140]  real politic look to use a kissinger look but just a human look at what's happening
[2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:27.500]  and instead of me trying to ask my questions i think it's undoubted it's it's manufactured it's
[2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:36.060]  been messed with who would launch it what's going on why is trump praising g uh because g is obviously
[2:07:36.060 --> 2:07:40.540]  using this as a major crackdown so i respect your view so much dr boil that instead of me asking
[2:07:40.540 --> 2:07:45.580]  questions just tell us what you really think's going on and then just roll through what you know
[2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:49.100]  and what your sources are telling us i've seen the first interview you gave a few days ago that went
[2:07:49.100 --> 2:07:54.700]  viral we appreciate you joining oan again and now us here sorrows out of town i flew back early uh
[2:07:54.700 --> 2:08:01.580]  about trump's response because i'm not just here to bash trump but it's true watching him sing gg
[2:08:01.580 --> 2:08:09.580]  ping's praises while the un praises gg ping but then says we're bad for blocking flights that is
[2:08:09.580 --> 2:08:16.220]  truly oxymoronical and just insults logic so what's first and foremost in your expert mind and
[2:08:16.220 --> 2:08:22.460]  thanks for joining us well alex thank you very much for having me on my best year viewing audience
[2:08:22.460 --> 2:08:28.540]  again and of course if you have questions you can feel free to hop in because i i know you have
[2:08:28.540 --> 2:08:35.740]  good sources of your own i did want to uh correct the record i never turned against the uh power
[2:08:35.740 --> 2:08:40.460]  elite i was pretty much a mole for the peace movement there at harvard oh no no i mean you've
[2:08:40.460 --> 2:08:43.980]  been on many times that's right you were there they thought you'd go with them and then but you
[2:08:43.980 --> 2:08:49.260]  never actually worked for him you're right and i i never intended to i always intended to oppose
[2:08:49.260 --> 2:08:53.500]  the uh global only by the way when i had the kissinger group try to hire me the head of the
[2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:58.300]  kissinger group in front of a crew member shea you're just going to join us this is dumb i was
[2:08:58.300 --> 2:09:02.060]  never with them they just thought i would immediately serve them i think that's what you're saying
[2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:10.540]  that's correct but to get back to uh uh this uh will hand uh coronavirus it's it's quite serious
[2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:18.380]  as you know because the uh work i did uh calling for and drafting the uh uh you
[2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:23.740]  have implemented legislation for the biological weapons convention uh which is known as the
[2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:32.540]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989 it was uh passed unanimously by both houses of
[2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:39.660]  the united states congress and signed into law by president george h bush senior i was even
[2:09:39.660 --> 2:09:46.620]  invited to the uh signing ceremony at the wedding house at the white house but it was canceled uh
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:52.060]  because uh gorbachev was coming to town and of course world peace was i guess more important than
[2:09:52.060 --> 2:10:01.420]  the uh signing ceremony an event by legislation was specifically designed to deal with uh the abuse
[2:10:01.420 --> 2:10:09.980]  of dna genetic engineering uh as uh to research manufacture and develop um biological weapons
[2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:19.180]  so since that uh uh work starting in the early 1980s i have routinely watched the outbreaks of
[2:10:20.300 --> 2:10:26.700]  infectious diseases against uh animals and human beings around the world to see if there was a
[2:10:27.980 --> 2:10:35.420]  biological warfare agent at work and so i did pay attention uh to what was going on there in uh
[2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:45.340]  wuhan and based on uh all the sources uh i could find at that time and uh confirmed since then uh
[2:10:45.900 --> 2:10:56.540]  this appears to be an extremely dangerous biological warfare uh agent that leaked out of that uh
[2:10:56.540 --> 2:11:05.900]  wuhan bsl4 biosafety level four uh facility in wuhan itself the uh notion that this came from
[2:11:05.900 --> 2:11:15.500]  some fish market as a total uh canard uh that uh is was the leading uh bsl4 facility uh in china
[2:11:15.500 --> 2:11:22.220]  and i want to make it clear outside i'm not here to bash china the chinese people or their
[2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:26.700]  communist government under international law they can have whatever government they want over there
[2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:35.180]  but this is a matter of uh of world public health and uh that uh bsl4 facility we have bs large
[2:11:35.180 --> 2:11:41.500]  numbers of bsl4 facilities here in the united states uh now in the western developed uh capitalist
[2:11:41.500 --> 2:11:51.100]  world these bsl4 facilities have i have no legitimate scientific or uh uh medical purpose at all
[2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:59.900]  they have one purpose and that is to research develop test use stockpile offensive biological
[2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:08.060]  uh weapons purely offensive purely offensive although they try to justify it by saying oh
[2:12:08.060 --> 2:12:17.420]  we're developing vaccines well that might be true alex but the way this is done is they first dna
[2:12:17.420 --> 2:12:26.300]  genetically engineered the offensive agent to kill people and then uh they reverse engineer the
[2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:33.820]  technology to develop the vaccine because you do not have uh an effective biological weapon
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:41.340]  you don't have a cure without the disease that is correct you you can't use uh uh the the offensive
[2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:48.460]  agent unless you can inoculate your own people with the vaccine so that is what has been going on at
[2:12:48.460 --> 2:12:53.020]  that Wuhan uh and that's what my pentagon sources told me a week and a half ago they believe it's a
[2:12:53.020 --> 2:12:58.620]  leak weapon they were planning for us or others developing a vaccine for themselves but somehow
[2:12:58.620 --> 2:13:04.220]  they thought it was edited so it would be continued or however it works and then it somehow mutated
[2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:09.260]  or it didn't work the live vaccine failed they don't know they just believe it was an offensive
[2:13:09.260 --> 2:13:13.340]  weapon they were developing a vaccine for that somehow got out is that that sound accurate
[2:13:14.460 --> 2:13:20.060]  that's correct they were doing both and that's that's how all these hideous bsl4 labs work here
[2:13:20.060 --> 2:13:26.780]  in the united states and indeed president trump should shut down every bsl4 facility here in the
[2:13:26.780 --> 2:13:34.460]  united states and bsl3 before this happens to me but my assessment alex is that uh then whatever
[2:13:34.460 --> 2:13:42.300]  they were working on leaked out um and uh it probably the first reported human case of this was
[2:13:42.300 --> 2:13:49.420]  december 1 so it seems to me it probably there was an accident incident there maybe uh mid uh
[2:13:49.420 --> 2:13:56.380]  november and the chinese government has been lying about it and covering it up uh ever since uh you
[2:13:56.380 --> 2:14:03.980]  saw uh the who uh director there tedros over there uh meeting with a president g shaking his hands
[2:14:03.980 --> 2:14:10.700]  smiling the cameras yucking it up and saying what a great job he's doing well you know tedros knows
[2:14:10.700 --> 2:14:18.140]  better this is a uh wh o specially designated research lab to engage in the development research
[2:14:18.140 --> 2:14:25.180]  development testing of biological warfare so you can't believe anything the uh who is telling you
[2:14:25.180 --> 2:14:33.260]  here they're up to their eyeballs uh in this type of stuff now as for the uh um the agent we are
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:40.060]  dealing with as far as i can tell it's it's what would be called a chimera that is the dna
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:44.620]  genetically engineered several elements uh together and by the way and that's that's greek
[2:14:44.620 --> 2:14:50.940]  for chimera that means is across species that is correct and by the way this uh uh bsl4 and
[2:14:50.940 --> 2:15:00.620]  woohan has leaked before at least twice before it has leaked sars and uh uh sars is just a dna
[2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:08.380]  genetically engineered uh biological warfare weapon starting with uh corona virus and then
[2:15:08.380 --> 2:15:15.100]  making it lethal and it's leaked twice before uh from uh this uh uh lab we're going to break
[2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:20.460]  you're gonna have to formally come back amazing uh biological weapons and a legal expert here
[2:15:20.460 --> 2:15:25.820]  dr francis boil joins us right now and just remember major indian lab comes out says it's had
[2:15:25.820 --> 2:15:31.340]  the hiv delivery system welded on to it they don't deny that they just were moving under pressure
[2:15:31.340 --> 2:15:35.820]  and now the u.s government and others won't send out the rna sequencing of this so people can
[2:15:35.820 --> 2:15:41.100]  tell how to test it because when they get that they look at it and even low-level labs can go oh
[2:15:41.100 --> 2:15:46.380]  my god this is funny the three dollar bill will get dr boil's take on that if that's accurate that's
[2:15:46.380 --> 2:15:54.460]  what others are saying straight ahead stay with us please spread the live links attention gcn

[2:16:22.140 --> 2:16:26.540]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system
[2:16:26.540 --> 2:16:31.500]  at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's

[2:17:48.300 --> 2:17:56.780]  survival tool feel the thrill only at sling bow dot com alex jones here reporting from the road
[2:17:56.780 --> 2:18:03.340]  on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus it has now infected
[2:18:03.340 --> 2:18:08.780]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people it has now spread across the entire planet and of
[2:18:08.780 --> 2:18:14.220]  course we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made and engineered recovering it live all
[2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:19.260]  with our team at info wars dot com for its last show and ban dot video on top of that we have
[2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:26.380]  the patented nano silver that congress a n m and homeland security have certified is able to take
[2:18:26.380 --> 2:18:32.940]  out the corona family viruses the sars that's what it comes out of we have that at 40 percent off
[2:18:32.940 --> 2:18:38.460]  despite the fact it's selling out in three different sizes at info wars store dot com
[2:18:38.460 --> 2:18:44.220]  that's what i'm using what my family's using as a frontline defense nothing's perfect except you
[2:18:44.220 --> 2:18:48.220]  know prayer and god's intervention and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as it looks but
[2:18:48.220 --> 2:18:54.140]  definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly a bizarre virus
[2:18:54.140 --> 2:18:58.460]  i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for
[2:18:58.460 --> 2:19:03.260]  maybe the last week and a half and i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever
[2:19:03.260 --> 2:19:06.380]  tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up
[2:19:06.380 --> 2:19:12.380]  there and tell people and so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by
[2:19:12.380 --> 2:19:17.420]  far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different
[2:19:17.420 --> 2:19:22.940]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral
[2:19:22.940 --> 2:19:28.540]  calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't
[2:19:28.540 --> 2:19:34.540]  even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[2:19:34.540 --> 2:19:41.020]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four
[2:19:41.020 --> 2:19:55.100]  times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[2:19:55.100 --> 2:20:11.180]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:35.180]  is
[2:20:38.300 --> 2:20:43.180]  and if you get her name well you might not make it back
[2:20:45.820 --> 2:20:47.180]  but i don't know if looks can kill
[2:20:47.180 --> 2:20:57.740]  and they hysteria we've seen by action telling us to be calm the general public
[2:20:57.740 --> 2:21:02.620]  is the perfect storm telling me this is very serious and over the years when they say sars is
[2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:07.500]  out of this or that we have dr frances bowline he says well it might be an engineered lab and
[2:21:07.500 --> 2:21:11.820]  who's the evidence of this but it's not that big a deal he's saying very serious that's what my gut
[2:21:11.820 --> 2:21:17.420]  level tells me and i've talked a lot of their smart folks uh in special operations and also
[2:21:17.420 --> 2:21:23.340]  that are patriots of the cia and they say just what he just said but then we were afraid to even come
[2:21:23.340 --> 2:21:27.100]  on air and say all that because we don't want to speculate because these people were speculating
[2:21:27.900 --> 2:21:31.980]  that they think china was developing this for deployment against the united states
[2:21:31.980 --> 2:21:36.460]  and then it got out and you asked the question well then why the hell would it be race specific
[2:21:36.460 --> 2:21:41.100]  uh why would it have you'd be so obvious it was race specific and that's because it was for
[2:21:41.100 --> 2:21:47.100]  a vaccine but again you've got to make the weapon before you make the vaccine i don't i
[2:21:47.100 --> 2:21:51.820]  agree with you i don't think the chai comms released this on purpose you're the expert on
[2:21:51.820 --> 2:21:57.180]  bio weapons how do you create a race specific bio weapon but not have a signature of who did it
[2:21:57.180 --> 2:22:00.620]  or do you release it on your own people and know it's going to mutate a certain way i mean
[2:22:01.340 --> 2:22:05.580]  this does look like a train wreck how would you release a race specific bio weapon we
[2:22:05.580 --> 2:22:09.660]  know dick chaney's obsessed with that and cover it up because some are going to say and i've raised
[2:22:09.660 --> 2:22:16.220]  that point dr boil that we've been in a fentanyl war with the chai comms a lot of big stuff going on
[2:22:16.220 --> 2:22:21.500]  is this a tit for tat i just don't see trump and others doing this but maybe some third party group
[2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:25.740]  to bring down the global economy i mean war gaming this why do you come to the conclusion
[2:22:25.740 --> 2:22:30.380]  it was a bio weapon a secret vaccine that leaks because that's what all the other smart people
[2:22:30.380 --> 2:22:38.620]  are telling me off record well let me continue with my analysis of this agent it's been dna
[2:22:38.620 --> 2:22:47.820]  genetically engineered uh it it was uh they took corona virus and they weaponized it with sars which
[2:22:47.820 --> 2:22:54.380]  leaked out twice in a row uh this time they turbocharged the sars they already had which was
[2:22:54.380 --> 2:23:01.420]  a biological warfare agent by mating it with the flu virus which is one of the reasons why
[2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:07.900]  it's so uh infectious uh that type of work has been done before up with the uh university of
[2:23:07.900 --> 2:23:16.940]  wisconsin this uh dr mangala uh uh uh karelka he's done it so it's out there in the literature how
[2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:23.820]  to do it and then third as you uh correctly pointed out uh the third element is uh the genetic
[2:23:23.820 --> 2:23:30.940]  material for hiv i read that study uh when it came out it was convincing to me including the
[2:23:30.940 --> 2:23:36.860]  pictures obviously i believe the chinese government put pressure on the indian government to take it
[2:23:36.860 --> 2:23:46.220]  down so it was taken down and then uh finally it does have a gain of function uh properties uh
[2:23:46.220 --> 2:23:52.620]  that there's been a lot of research going on on that development testing by us bio warfare
[2:23:52.620 --> 2:23:59.740]  facilities indeed uh the obama administration put a pause on it it was so dangerous uh but then the
[2:23:59.740 --> 2:24:04.780]  pause was uh listed uh and so for what about the reports it was stolen out of the research
[2:24:04.780 --> 2:24:11.980]  lab in canada by the chakoms yes well let me finish then uh and we'll get back to that point but
[2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:20.620]  let me uh finish the point so gain of function sars has a radius for the droplets of three feet
[2:24:20.620 --> 2:24:29.100]  this has a radius of at least six feet so it travels through the air um it has a lethality
[2:24:29.100 --> 2:24:35.980]  rate of about 15 percent an infectivity rate of about 83 percent those are figures from lancet
[2:24:36.940 --> 2:24:43.260]  it has an incubation period of at least 14 days and it is asymptomatic which means that
[2:24:43.260 --> 2:24:52.860]  uh people could be spreading the coronavirus and show no symptoms at all so yes it is extremely
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:25:00.860]  dangerous we're not exactly sure how dangerous it is as to your point on uh uh ethnic specific
[2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:07.020]  biological weapons yes uh we've tried to develop them here in the united states under the influence
[2:25:07.020 --> 2:25:14.780]  of the neocons who believe in these things that's in the uh pnac report they work for reagan they
[2:25:14.780 --> 2:25:22.780]  then have worked again for uh uh push junior uh regretfully they seem to have uh come back into
[2:25:22.780 --> 2:25:29.260]  power under uh president trump but maybe he'll fire them like he did uh bolton we've discussed that
[2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:37.180]  before uh the israelis uh have worked on it uh the south africans under the apartheid regime
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:45.660]  however today's new york times just reported the first black african uh uh studying over
[2:25:45.660 --> 2:25:51.580]  there to have come down with the coronavirus so it very well at this point i was considering
[2:25:52.540 --> 2:25:57.740]  race specific and with the chinese and then blacks are so different than that would not
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:03.340]  that would kind of preclude that i i think that is my conclusion alex that's correct so i don't
[2:26:03.340 --> 2:26:11.740]  think this this is that but it's clear uh this thing blew back on the uh chinese just as uh
[2:26:12.300 --> 2:26:20.940]  the uh uh uh the these all these hideous biological warfare uh agents that we're working on our own
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:26.940]  bsl uh for facilities disease we problem they think came from that new york offshore lab the
[2:26:26.940 --> 2:26:32.300]  deer swan across plumb island and the russians the kamchatka release of anthrax remember that
[2:26:33.340 --> 2:26:40.300]  yes the lime was the lime disease clearly came out of the uh bio warfare lab uh at plumb island
[2:26:40.300 --> 2:26:47.420]  likewise uh west nile disease clearly came out of the uh bio warfare uh lab at plumb island
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:52.140]  so like you tried to author the thing it got it got picked up as law why don't everybody
[2:26:52.140 --> 2:26:56.700]  just agree to stop this like you said they're creating super bio weapons for threats that
[2:26:56.700 --> 2:27:03.660]  don't exist creating the very weapon that creates the threat you're exactly right that's what i tried
[2:27:03.660 --> 2:27:10.940]  to do with my uh biological weapons anti-terrorism act by making this punishable by life imprisonment
[2:27:10.940 --> 2:27:15.340]  i don't believe in the death penalty they wanted to put that in there and i said no i don't want
[2:27:15.340 --> 2:27:24.380]  the uh death penalty in my legislation i thought i would send a message uh to all life scientists
[2:27:24.380 --> 2:27:31.820]  here in america not to do this indeed i gave uh interviews to many of the science magazines pointing
[2:27:31.820 --> 2:27:38.540]  out that uh they face life in prison uh if they did this but alex the last time i crunched the
[2:27:38.540 --> 2:27:48.540]  numbers was 2015 we had 13 000 so-called life scientists here in the united states involved
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:54.700]  in the research development and testing of biological warfare agents stay there stay there i
[2:27:54.700 --> 2:28:02.220]  want to ask why but for me it's because it's the money it's that simple out no i agree but who's
[2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:06.220]  behind it these people that want to play god it's like the air force says they have theoretically
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:11.260]  created any matter 15 years ago in a press conference 16 years ago if you want that's
[2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:15.820]  evil to me is to create something that can kill everybody for no reason instead you work with
[2:28:15.820 --> 2:28:19.980]  people and say we're not doing this i don't understand why we can't come together and not
[2:28:19.980 --> 2:28:25.020]  have this atlantis moment where we blow ourselves up let's talk about that you know playdough said
[2:28:25.020 --> 2:28:29.660]  that atlantis existed those out the atlantic ocean blew up and they had free energy and flying ships
[2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:34.460]  i don't know that was real we've got basically free energy now and flying ships and i don't know
[2:28:34.460 --> 2:28:39.820]  why as we approach godlike power we don't have godlike minds or why we're gonna blow ourselves
[2:28:39.820 --> 2:28:44.300]  up again but if atlantis wasn't real it was our psychic understanding it was about to be
[2:28:44.300 --> 2:28:50.300]  because we're building the atlantis moment when we blow ourselves to timbuktu for no damn reason
[2:28:50.300 --> 2:28:56.140]  because a bunch of people are on a power trip attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've
[2:28:56.140 --> 2:29:01.180]  ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to

[2:29:15.420 --> 2:29:19.900]  history flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding
[2:29:19.900 --> 2:29:24.380]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back
[2:29:24.380 --> 2:29:29.100]  to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you

[2:30:22.780 --> 2:30:28.380]  about iodine because it's the good halogen fluoride the bad halogen and people told me about it for
[2:30:28.380 --> 2:30:34.300]  years and i didn't listen and i'm so thankful that finally i listened to dr grip like eight years
[2:30:34.300 --> 2:30:42.860]  ago i started taking true iodine atomic iodine we've got it back in stock x2 40 off right now
[2:30:42.860 --> 2:30:49.740]  at infowarstore.com and i'm telling you folks get it it's amazing discover the benefits and it funds

[2:30:57.020 --> 2:31:02.780]  only patented nano silver that's been found by homeland security to take out SARS which is the
[2:31:02.780 --> 2:31:10.060]  same family as the corona virus we have it in our super silver toothpaste we have it in our super
[2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:15.740]  blue toothpaste we have it in the immune gargle products and of course it's in the super silver
[2:31:15.740 --> 2:31:21.100]  wound gel that is sold nationally we just private label it from the people that produce with the
[2:31:21.100 --> 2:31:27.740]  nano tech company out of colorado and we have a stockpile of it but we've already sold half of
[2:31:27.740 --> 2:31:34.860]  the stockpile of it and i'm still offering the products at 40 to 50 percent off and info war
[2:31:34.860 --> 2:31:40.700]  store.com until they sell out which most of these products are set to sell out within days or
[2:31:40.700 --> 2:31:46.060]  then about another week so go to infowarstore.com to get your immune gargle to get the toothpaste
[2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:50.460]  and to get the super silver wound gel but the immune gargle is what is so important because
[2:31:50.460 --> 2:31:57.100]  you gargle with it and can also drink it infowarstore.com infowarstore.com we have a new product
[2:31:57.100 --> 2:32:01.500]  and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're
[2:32:01.500 --> 2:32:05.980]  selling them i want to thank the listeners for getting it but this really is a game changing
[2:32:05.980 --> 2:32:12.060]  toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine
[2:32:12.060 --> 2:32:17.820]  and fluoride free the adult or the children's these are both excellent toothpaste concentrates
[2:32:17.820 --> 2:32:22.780]  that don't have fillers people love it this is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above
[2:32:22.780 --> 2:32:30.140]  c coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth then it has the patented
[2:32:30.140 --> 2:32:34.780]  silver salt silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis this is all
[2:32:34.780 --> 2:32:39.660]  proven you can make claims with this but i had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good
[2:32:40.220 --> 2:32:45.500]  for knocking out the bacteria the viruses uh and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that
[2:32:45.500 --> 2:32:51.740]  doesn't strip away the enamel so we're really proud of it it funds the operation infowarstore.com
[2:32:51.740 --> 2:32:53.580]  that's why we're still on air thanks to you
[2:32:53.580 --> 2:33:13.260]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:25.820]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:32.860]  sooner or later gotta cut you down sooner or later gotta well i appreciate the colors holding
[2:33:32.860 --> 2:33:36.300]  especially all the colors most of you want to talk about coronavirus so dr boil is
[2:33:36.300 --> 2:33:40.460]  agreed to take your calls next hour that's in about 30 minutes if you'll stay on hold we'll
[2:33:40.460 --> 2:33:44.620]  get to all of you we really appreciate you and you bring up a lot of novel original questions
[2:33:44.620 --> 2:33:49.420]  that are important for us to try to answer as best we can we're all just trying to suss this out
[2:33:49.420 --> 2:33:53.900]  none of us have the answer but dr bulls as close as you're going to get to the answer on that
[2:33:55.660 --> 2:34:03.180]  i almost feel opportunistic when i'm positioned with the very nano silver the pentagon
[2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:08.780]  and homeland security has said has been proven to take out sars but you know what i've been selling
[2:34:08.780 --> 2:34:13.100]  it for years because i go out and find out whatever the best product is show people the shot please
[2:34:14.220 --> 2:34:19.660]  so that's what this comes down to i sold out of this yesterday as i told you but still kept
[2:34:19.660 --> 2:34:25.740]  at discounted the 16 ounce bottles we're selling out of the one ounce bottles very very quickly
[2:34:26.700 --> 2:34:32.540]  as well a little spray bottle this will sell out within a week the three ounce bottles
[2:34:32.540 --> 2:34:37.260]  and it's just high quality and is it a silver bullet no but they call it a silver bullet in
[2:34:37.260 --> 2:34:44.620]  lore because silver is just a metal based antibiotic type system and again it's not perfect
[2:34:44.620 --> 2:34:49.580]  consult your physician it's something that i normally just gargle with a couple times a week
[2:34:50.300 --> 2:34:55.420]  but you can actually this is approved to drink that's why it's at 15 parts but it's nano but just
[2:34:55.420 --> 2:35:00.940]  remember any antibiotic whether it's you know the classic antibiotics or whether it's metals
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:09.020]  based has its downside as well my dad was basically on desk doorstep six years ago my uncle his uncle
[2:35:09.020 --> 2:35:13.980]  and my cousin had all died live at the same ranch from the same bad pneumonia i came in when the
[2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:17.420]  doctors couldn't help my daddy but on three different antibiotics i could tell he was going
[2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:21.100]  the same way and i just basically assaulted him and poured three bottles of colloidal silver
[2:35:21.100 --> 2:35:25.260]  dining well this is even better than that by the way my dad pissed green for a week sure it wasn't
[2:35:25.260 --> 2:35:29.580]  good for his liver and kidneys but he came back and lived okay am i saying that did that i just
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:34.460]  didn't put it in in god's hands i took action because god helps those that help themselves
[2:35:34.460 --> 2:35:39.100]  that's what i'm getting at here is we're selling out of this silver we're keeping it discounted
[2:35:39.100 --> 2:35:43.500]  we're sold out of the colloidal silver that hadn't come back in yet it was already sold out before
[2:35:43.500 --> 2:35:47.020]  this crisis began we have the great storeable foods in case you've got a shelter in place
[2:35:47.020 --> 2:35:51.500]  but i have that just because you should be self-sufficient and ready all the other big suppliers
[2:35:51.500 --> 2:35:56.540]  we know have already sold out they're still taking your orders our supplier has the food they've got
[2:35:56.540 --> 2:36:01.580]  a package it and they called me two days ago and said you got to tell listeners it's now 10 to 14
[2:36:01.580 --> 2:36:06.460]  and i said is it really 10 to 14 they said yeah in a few days it'll start being 10 days and then
[2:36:06.460 --> 2:36:10.140]  you know we've got the food but it's just it's increasing institutional buyers are trying to
[2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:15.420]  buy it up and that's what scares them i had talks two weeks ago with the owner and the founder and
[2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:20.140]  the CEO and all that and they're just like do you think we should keep buying more food or
[2:36:20.140 --> 2:36:23.260]  should we just sell out what do you think we should do because it's hard to buy food when it goes up
[2:36:23.260 --> 2:36:27.500]  at price and i said i believe you should put everything you have to buy more food i believe
[2:36:27.500 --> 2:36:31.100]  this is probably real i don't want to tell my audience that let's wait and see but they'll
[2:36:31.100 --> 2:36:36.300]  have food they eat anyways and sure enough unfortunately you see this is a serious so
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:41.260]  it's good to be prepared in four store dot com it funds our independent maverick operation
[2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:45.980]  it's horrible food it's high quality and we have the best nano silver you're going to find out there
[2:36:45.980 --> 2:36:50.060]  i mean the super silver wound gel is the same nano but it's super strong you can't ingest this
[2:36:50.060 --> 2:36:54.860]  this is private labeled in stores they have this in hospitals these are great patriots and here's
[2:36:54.860 --> 2:36:58.860]  the company right here they want their nameset i've been with them like six seven years but
[2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:05.260]  it's uh american biotech labs out of colorada here's all the pentagon documents department of the army
[2:37:05.260 --> 2:37:10.300]  headquarters army homeland security a and m talking about how amazing it is is it a silver bullet no
[2:37:11.180 --> 2:37:15.980]  but it's just one more defense and it funds the m4 all right you've got the floor i know it's an ad
[2:37:15.980 --> 2:37:22.060]  and i broke again uh we till the end of the hour just just go with it what you all these notes you
[2:37:22.060 --> 2:37:27.580]  sent me here about you you already alluded to it u.s groups have already engineered the exact same
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:33.660]  thing billa melinda gates having something similar through a subgroup patented um uh what what you
[2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:38.860]  think trump's doing wrong here please just just you we got six minutes in this segment 10 the next
[2:37:38.860 --> 2:37:45.020]  you've got the floor take over right well as i said first it's a question of money i i crunched the
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:55.340]  numbers and after 9 11 2001 not counting anything before that up until 2015 the united states government
[2:37:55.340 --> 2:38:04.700]  has wasted over 100 billion dollars on research development and testing biological warfare agents
[2:38:04.700 --> 2:38:13.180]  so that's what has induced these uh 13 000 death scientists to feed at the trough as as i call them
[2:38:13.180 --> 2:38:19.980]  they're dr mangler types and again i haven't had a chance to uh you know recrunch all the numbers
[2:38:19.980 --> 2:38:26.540]  but it's about five billion per year since then maybe a sum total of 120 billion dollars now
[2:38:26.540 --> 2:38:35.980]  to put that into perspective as of uh 2015 in constant dollars we had spent uh retrospectively
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:43.260]  40 billion dollars on the manhattan project to develop and use the atom bomb so that's really
[2:38:43.260 --> 2:38:51.100]  what is going on here uh we have uh an offensive bio warfare industry here in in the united states
[2:38:51.100 --> 2:38:58.940]  that goes back uh at least to reagan i haven't gotten the figures for that so it's greed and the
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:05.900]  fact is we do not train our scientists in ethics uh they have no ethics at all you know they have
[2:39:05.900 --> 2:39:12.140]  these life scientists have all the ethics of dr mangler as far as i'm concerned now we get to
[2:39:12.140 --> 2:39:18.620]  president trump and now here i understand you know people have different attitudes about
[2:39:18.620 --> 2:39:25.580]  president trump i've always been a political uh independent years ago when i decided to do this
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:33.100]  work i i realized the only way i could be effective is not affiliated with any political no i totally
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:39.980]  agree but let trump have it if you want to we respect you right but uh i i i and so i've
[2:39:39.980 --> 2:39:45.580]  always been a political independent well for that reason i i did not vote for president trump and i
[2:39:45.580 --> 2:39:51.740]  did not vote for mrs clinton i picked a third party candidate which is usually what i do what i
[2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:59.500]  think happened here uh in this call by uh president trump with uh president g of china where
[2:40:00.300 --> 2:40:07.900]  president trump uh you know gave his endorsement to uh president g and i've already expressed my
[2:40:07.900 --> 2:40:14.700]  opinion you know g is lying through his teeth and has always been from the outset i'm personally
[2:40:14.700 --> 2:40:23.260]  not blaming president trump i think he has uh the swamp creature scientists advising him on this
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:31.180]  and i suspect these people are up to their eyeballs in this dirty biological warfare work
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:37.420]  for example the center for uh disease control they're the center for disease proliferation
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:44.860]  uh i won't go through the long history here but as you know back under the uh reagan administration
[2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:50.620]  cdc and american-type culture collection which is supposed to be a scientific outfit
[2:40:51.340 --> 2:41:01.420]  ship sent 40 different shipments of weapons specific biological agents to sonam hussein
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:07.500]  in iraq in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these things and use them against
[2:41:08.060 --> 2:41:14.700]  on record not debated and a bunch of mustard gas and the satellites how to use it and all
[2:41:14.700 --> 2:41:19.580]  that's documented in my book here bio warfare and terrorism you can read it with citation
[2:41:20.220 --> 2:41:27.660]  unfortunately what happened when the war uh ended uh uh the us army was sent in there to
[2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:34.940]  clean up the mess uh and they demolished the biological and chemical weapons uh facilities
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:41.260]  there and there was blowback and they were appointed by our own biological weapons and that's a
[2:41:41.260 --> 2:41:48.220]  contributing factor to the um gofor syndrome that we know has killed at least let me ask you this
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:53.980]  was it sedam launching some of the weapons or just blowing up the bunkers i know there's no
[2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:59.980]  evidence he launched biological weapons it appears it was blowing up the blunt bunker the
[2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:06.540]  bunkers and that blew back on our own troops uh we have go for syndrome and 11 000 are dead
[2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:11.660]  over 100 000 yeah it's not no weapons expert but everybody knows from the old days of plague you
[2:42:11.660 --> 2:42:18.620]  burn biologicals you don't blow them up right they they blew them up but to get back to president
[2:42:18.620 --> 2:42:24.700]  trump he's got advisors around there from uh national institutes of health well that's a joke
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:33.420]  and a fraud they have been funding these bsl for uh facilities this gain of function uh work
[2:42:33.420 --> 2:42:40.620]  that is only uh useful for uh biological warfare uh purposes offensive all right then let's ask you
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:44.460]  when we come back how bad you think it'll get if you're saying it's so serious and what do you expect
[2:42:44.460 --> 2:42:51.580]  to have happen next dr frances boil top bio weapons experts straight ahead

[2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:29.420]  so just because gz ping is using all of this to crack down on people doesn't mean he did it to do
[2:47:29.420 --> 2:47:34.700]  that and the smart monies all that this was a bio weapon accidentally released make no mistake
[2:47:34.700 --> 2:47:39.420]  the hysterical response you've seen with them saying be calm is a sign you should be concerned
[2:47:39.420 --> 2:47:44.700]  normally when it's some drill they hype up something that's basically harmless or close to it except
[2:47:44.700 --> 2:47:51.260]  for really rundown people to get power and control but there's real fear you know here's gz ping's
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:55.420]  all on top of it he's not been on tv in weeks because they understand there's that image of him
[2:47:55.420 --> 2:48:03.660]  associated with failure dr francis boil who authored the u.s bio weapons act became in
[2:48:03.660 --> 2:48:09.580]  mainstay of the big world treaty on it he's represented world leaders at the hag you name
[2:48:09.580 --> 2:48:13.900]  and i'm gonna go over his whole bio but he's prestigious and he's a very credible guy doesn't
[2:48:13.900 --> 2:48:16.940]  mean you agree with everything he says i don't agree with anything i say sometimes i hear it later
[2:48:16.940 --> 2:48:22.460]  and say well i should have said this way but let's just say he is a competent person who has
[2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:27.580]  integrity and who really is his own person in this universe that's all there is i am my own person
[2:48:27.580 --> 2:48:32.780]  my own captain sometimes i go god i did a terrible job there i just wrecked the ship but i'm the one
[2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:37.580]  running the show everybody knows that you can feel it you can see it um and i just wonder who is
[2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:43.260]  running the ship here because again i see and i could pull these quotes up the un world health
[2:48:43.260 --> 2:48:49.980]  organization head and others saying great job gz ping incredible job you know shooting people at
[2:48:49.980 --> 2:48:54.700]  checkpoints and locking down cities and grabbing people and mass graves and burning bodies and
[2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:59.020]  then telling us much slower numbers and then we don't let flights in finally after everybody else
[2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:05.740]  like this is very xenophobic to un says and you should let us in how do they expect any down to
[2:49:05.740 --> 2:49:10.860]  not just a nurse not a doctor not a professor but the general public to go wait a minute
[2:49:12.220 --> 2:49:14.940]  you're going to kill people at checkpoints but it's no big deal
[2:49:14.940 --> 2:49:23.020]  that's like into the world type stuff and then you're going to tell us we've got to keep the flights
[2:49:23.020 --> 2:49:30.220]  open and just have people fly here what's the what's the answer what's the key to that oxymoronical
[2:49:30.220 --> 2:49:37.340]  statement that's coming out what's behind that dr boil well i wanted a alex let me repeat or finish
[2:49:37.340 --> 2:49:43.420]  my comment there about president trump so his science advisors that he has are up to their
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:51.020]  early biological warfare work and so they have not given him in my opinion proper advice as to
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:58.380]  what is going on here otherwise i don't believe he would have called we would have spoken with
[2:49:58.380 --> 2:50:07.260]  president g and uh commended him and given him his uh imprimatur so uh in my opinion president
[2:50:07.260 --> 2:50:14.620]  trump needs to fire each and every one of these swamp creature uh scientists that he has uh advising
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:23.900]  him and bring in some uh outside independent experts who have never accepted one dime of dirty
[2:50:23.900 --> 2:50:31.100]  biological warfare work from any agency of the united states government and whose institutions
[2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:38.300]  have never accepted one dime because if their institutions have they will be spinning things
[2:50:38.300 --> 2:50:46.620]  in favor of uh maintaining this bsl3 bsl4 facilities to give you an example this is a
[2:50:46.620 --> 2:50:55.100]  st jude hospital founded by uh dany thomas they have their own bsl4 biological warfare
[2:50:55.100 --> 2:51:02.380]  uh laboratory that's not life giving exactly developing bio weapons is not and again is this
[2:51:02.380 --> 2:51:07.180]  the 12th monkey depopulation is a cult at work because as you know 20 years ago they released
[2:51:07.180 --> 2:51:12.780]  the mouth pox system so anybody can make it and people said why are you doing that why are they
[2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:21.900]  giving out promethean fire to destroy humanity like their lollipops i've been fighting against
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:30.620]  this in the since the early uh 1980s alex what can i say that's why i called for and drafted
[2:51:30.620 --> 2:51:36.460]  it and helped get lobby through congress my no i know i know i'm asking the mindset of these people
[2:51:36.460 --> 2:51:42.220]  because you said oh these average so-called life scientists are mingolas exactly i mean i remember
[2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:46.940]  when eric peonka came out when i made in game and he said we want to reduce the world population by
[2:51:46.940 --> 2:51:51.580]  90 percent arab or nabola the texas academy of science is getting a standing ovation we showed all
[2:51:51.580 --> 2:51:56.780]  that on air and then i had his research scientists that had graduated decades before threatening me
[2:51:56.780 --> 2:52:02.220]  and they were in the news saying peonka is too liberal all humans must die and i looked up the
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:06.940]  one woman and she works in a level four bio weapons lab she's saying i want to kill everybody
[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:14.220]  like the guy from 12th monkeys and she works in a bio weapons lab this is insane well alex as you
[2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:22.620]  know this is the eugenics movement that started here in america and that was picked up by hitler
[2:52:22.620 --> 2:52:31.100]  and the nazis and applied to the to the jews and to the roma and others so it's it's the same
[2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:37.260]  mentality you are perfectly correct and alex that's what we're dealing with so the world's
[2:52:37.260 --> 2:52:42.300]  being teed up where everybody's got bio weapons and everybody's got vaccines for them so there's
[2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:47.740]  plausible deniability it sounds like to me how do you cover up where it came from well under the
[2:52:47.740 --> 2:52:53.180]  name of vaccine you hand it out everywhere because the vaccine is basically identical
[2:52:53.180 --> 2:52:59.180]  to the pathogen itself that's how you escape accountability is you hand it out everywhere
[2:53:00.380 --> 2:53:07.980]  that's correct and most of these vaccines alex actually have live agents in them that's what
[2:53:07.980 --> 2:53:15.420]  the dual use is all about for for example these so-called the the west african ebola
[2:53:17.260 --> 2:53:23.100]  disaster over there that came out of the u.s. government lab there at kenema and that was
[2:53:23.100 --> 2:53:31.020]  being run by fort detrick and the broad institute at harvard and mit and it appears they were
[2:53:31.020 --> 2:53:39.020]  testing out an ebola vaccine and giving people live ebola so uh yeah that's that's exactly uh
[2:53:39.020 --> 2:53:48.300]  what is going on here alex it's it's pretty much a nazi eugenic uh mentality uh by these agencies
[2:53:48.300 --> 2:53:55.020]  of the united states government by these uh 13 000 or more uh life scientists i call them
[2:53:55.020 --> 2:54:01.180]  death scientists and it's all a question of money you know everyone can be bought off and none of
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:08.140]  these uh scientists have been given uh basic training uh in ethics in science and they're
[2:54:08.140 --> 2:54:12.540]  all compartmentalized they don't know uh they just have a silly uh compartmentalized attitude
[2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:17.100]  speaking of compartmentalization who would you say is the kingpin for my research i know this is
[2:54:17.100 --> 2:54:22.380]  dangerous but you're you do this i see bill gates and his dad they had a planned parenthood and
[2:54:22.380 --> 2:54:27.900]  cold springs harbour and the eugenics as at the center of the web given all that power put in by
[2:54:27.900 --> 2:54:32.620]  ibm that pledged its whole wealth you know after hitler failed to the eugenics project that's on
[2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:38.060]  record i see bill gates as the spider right at the center of the web the chief science officer
[2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:45.900]  of this operation the emperor palpatine well i wouldn't say uh he's uh the emperor i i think the real
[2:54:45.900 --> 2:54:53.660]  problem predated uh gates going back to the reagan administration under the influence the neocon
[2:54:53.660 --> 2:55:02.220]  denry kissinger you well um state of parlor random 200 well probably what do you which
[2:55:02.220 --> 2:55:09.420]  flow oh yeah well of course uh the uh depopulation the kissinger member uh memorandum which i have
[2:55:09.420 --> 2:55:16.860]  read that uh depopulation should be uh uh an objective of uh u.s. national security policy
[2:55:16.860 --> 2:55:23.660]  and as i told you i i went through the uh exact same phd program at harvard that produced kissinger
[2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:29.020]  before me deliberately just to see how these people think it worked and they even gave me uh
[2:55:29.020 --> 2:55:36.940]  kissinger's old office for one year when i was an associate at uh harvard's uh uh uh center no
[2:55:36.940 --> 2:55:43.500]  no you did a great job infiltrating mortars so prime approximation here how bad is this going to get
[2:55:43.500 --> 2:55:48.860]  i agree with you it's really serious uh if the if the public health services break down they can't
[2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:53.500]  cover it up then it creates more hysteria i think that's happening in china from your sources at the
[2:55:53.500 --> 2:56:01.500]  u.m from your own research how bad is this well alex uh you had this uh so-called uh tabletop
[2:56:01.500 --> 2:56:09.100]  uh computer game at uh johns hopkins bill gates again 65 million dead that's correct and and johns
[2:56:09.100 --> 2:56:16.060]  hopkins is a well-known center for the neocons who fully support uh biological weapons and even
[2:56:16.060 --> 2:56:23.660]  ethnic specific biological weapons you can read that in their uh p-neck uh report that tabletop
[2:56:23.660 --> 2:56:32.060]  exercise which is really a war game uh resulted in 65 million deaths uh that's the only figure i
[2:56:32.060 --> 2:56:39.740]  have seen that seems to be credible uh as to where this uh could believe where this could lead i
[2:56:39.740 --> 2:56:46.300]  mean we could be dealing something here as bad as the the spanish flu virus i i lost a grandmother
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:53.100]  a century ago to the spanish flu virus so that uh alex i guess is a worst case scenario i i'm not
[2:56:53.100 --> 2:57:00.460]  here to scare anyone or get anyone to uh panic i'm just trying to give you the best analysis
[2:57:00.460 --> 2:57:04.860]  well i agree my gut well you've been on for 15 or 20 years with us you've always been accurate
[2:57:04.860 --> 2:57:10.540]  and you tell the truth that's what you go with i when things are so dangerous i suddenly feel
[2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:15.820]  empowered not because i like it because it's so real i'm in fight mode and i feel that right now
[2:57:16.780 --> 2:57:21.020]  like what i'd like i just cannot impress upon people that are boiled i think these are very serious
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:26.220]  times you agree right alex that's why i've come on your show that you've always given me uh uh
[2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:32.300]  despite whatever people criticize you you've always given me a fair uh interview and let me
[2:57:32.300 --> 2:57:36.940]  say what i want to say no that's why they demonize this because we're an open forum for real people
[2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:40.780]  speaking of that phone calls are coming up hour four straight ahead statements
[2:57:43.100 --> 2:57:48.620]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[2:57:48.620 --> 2:57:56.380]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[2:57:56.380 --> 2:58:02.060]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they
[2:58:02.060 --> 2:58:08.860]  persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[2:58:08.860 --> 2:58:13.580]  the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because
[2:58:13.580 --> 2:58:19.580]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the
[2:58:19.580 --> 2:58:26.300]  innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheep dogs
[2:58:26.300 --> 2:58:33.740]  to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the
[2:58:33.740 --> 2:58:40.860]  fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know
[2:58:40.860 --> 2:58:48.780]  is that god is in charge it was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my
[2:58:48.780 --> 2:58:54.460]  office in the morning and said son you've got to see this the company that holds the patents on the
[2:58:54.460 --> 2:58:58.700]  nano silver that's in our toothpaste that's in our immune gargle and it's in some of the other great
[2:58:58.700 --> 2:59:06.140]  products like the super silver wound shell had reports from back in 2007 with the pentagon working
[2:59:06.140 --> 2:59:11.980]  with ann m a homeland security with the director of homeland security certifying an unrestricted
[2:59:11.980 --> 2:59:17.900]  document confidential documents was noted as that this had been proven in their secret test to be
[2:59:17.900 --> 2:59:23.980]  knocking out sars well ladies and gentlemen regardless now they authorized us to talk about
[2:59:23.980 --> 2:59:29.020]  this i talked about it on the show last week just hiding in plain view this is a product that we had
[2:59:29.020 --> 2:59:34.220]  stockpile and that we're still selling at 40 percent off or more with the combos so you can get it in
[2:59:34.220 --> 2:59:38.620]  your hands it's something that's good for everyday use regardless and it funds the operation so
[2:59:38.620 --> 2:59:42.940]  info or store.com for your immune gargle and other products that contain this key nano silver
[2:59:42.940 --> 3:00:02.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:02.300 --> 3:00:13.500]  all right we've got dr francis boil with us for the rest of the hour appreciate him carving
[3:00:13.500 --> 3:00:17.980]  out time as a professor of law up in illinois go over this he is the creator of the us
[3:00:17.980 --> 3:00:24.380]  bio weapons act and many other big world systems and he knows the insiders and he knows who the
[3:00:24.380 --> 3:00:29.100]  players are and he's sticking his neck out there because he's not sticking his neck out
[3:00:29.100 --> 3:00:37.740]  it's self-preservation to stand up against the soulless madness of the technocrats and the eugenicist
[3:00:37.740 --> 3:00:43.580]  and the depopulationist who are just claiming they wanted world government to stop the proliferation
[3:00:43.580 --> 3:00:49.340]  of dangerous technology but then they use it to distribute it so that when it gets released
[3:00:49.340 --> 3:00:56.860]  they can easily deny that they were involved and that's what i see that's what he sees and that's
[3:00:56.860 --> 3:01:01.500]  what really concerns me is we need to let the globalists know they're going to be held accountable
[3:01:01.500 --> 3:01:04.140]  we're going to go to break in a few minutes come back and take phone calls for folks who've
[3:01:04.140 --> 3:01:08.300]  been patiently holding and they are lucky to talk to you i know you're not a bracket ocean
[3:01:08.300 --> 3:01:11.980]  skype you're a busy person i'm lucky to talk to you and we're lucky to be here on the air
[3:01:11.980 --> 3:01:16.460]  but just in closing on the time we have just alone before your calls what else do you want to
[3:01:16.460 --> 3:01:24.620]  quantify for listeners and viewers about what's happening right now well the main message i have
[3:01:24.620 --> 3:01:34.540]  for your viewing audience is that you must get through to president trump fire all of his so
[3:01:34.540 --> 3:01:43.180]  called swamp creature science advisors and convince president trump to bring in outside
[3:01:43.180 --> 3:01:51.580]  independent experts to give him proper advice as to how to protect the public health of the
[3:01:51.580 --> 3:01:58.540]  american people because all these uh scientists and institutions and everything else have not
[3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:06.620]  back starting since uh 9 11 2001 with that anthrax attack they came out of a u.s uh government
[3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:14.780]  biological warfare lab they have been researching developing uh testing and stockpiling every type
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:24.060]  of hideous biological weapon you can imagine and indeed there is still a stockpile of that
[3:02:24.620 --> 3:02:32.460]  super weapons grade anthrax the america marathrax that was inflicted on the american people
[3:02:33.020 --> 3:02:41.180]  and congress uh in october of 2001 so that is what we are facing and truck president trump
[3:02:41.180 --> 3:02:50.220]  must immediately order the total shutdown not review but shutdown of all bsl4 and bsl3 labs
[3:02:51.100 --> 3:02:58.940]  here in the united states all this gain of function research has to stop and again explain
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:05.180]  gain of function they have to make the weapon to have the cure which is which then everybody else
[3:03:05.180 --> 3:03:10.460]  has to do it which causes an arms race and bio weapons which is the definition of just satanic
[3:03:10.460 --> 3:03:17.020]  evil right and the gain of function means that they take a biological weapon that they already
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:24.860]  have and i believe that's what we're dealing here uh with the wuhan uh for facility sars was
[3:03:24.860 --> 3:03:31.340]  already a biological weapon that had leaked out of that facility it was weaponized coronavirus
[3:03:31.340 --> 3:03:37.740]  and they take that weapon they already have and they then use dna genetic engineering
[3:03:37.740 --> 3:03:45.580]  and now synthetic biology to make it uh more lethal and more infectious indeed the entire
[3:03:45.580 --> 3:03:53.020]  synthetic uh biology industry and all these synthetic biologists was set up by the pentagon
[3:03:53.020 --> 3:03:59.980]  and darpa the defense uh advanced research program they're the ones who funded this
[3:03:59.980 --> 3:04:08.620]  for biological weapons purposes and the proof of that is that when the uh first conference of these
[3:04:08.620 --> 3:04:16.220]  synthetic biologists met and they produced a report which i read they called for the repeal
[3:04:16.220 --> 3:04:24.300]  of my biological weapons anti-terrorism act that provided uh life in prison for doing this type of
[3:04:24.300 --> 3:04:31.580]  dirty bio warfare work because they fully intended to do it all right stay there i want to talk about
[3:04:31.580 --> 3:04:35.420]  where you think this is going how bad it's going to get because you you didn't dodge that you wanted
[3:04:35.420 --> 3:04:39.100]  to finish your last point last segment i want to hit that and go to college with a french spoil
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:43.180]  with the leading experts we could have on blessed to have him and then i'm not a guy that treats my
[3:04:43.180 --> 3:04:49.820]  mouth hope about physical stuff but any biological weapon hurts my family i'm going to hold bureaucrats
[3:04:49.820 --> 3:04:57.500]  and life sciences accountable it is i the leader of cobra here for a message to president trump
[3:04:57.500 --> 3:05:04.300]  the american people and alex jones of info wars our operations with our partners the
[3:05:04.300 --> 3:05:12.700]  communist chinese have bought control of your media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken
[3:05:12.700 --> 3:05:20.380]  and that's why cobra is launching operations to trigger race war mass shootings and bombings
[3:05:20.380 --> 3:05:27.660]  which will be blamed on those loyal to america anyone once we stage these attacks that there's
[3:05:27.660 --> 3:05:37.180]  not blaming on trump will also be targeted by cobra in the future you see when you expose our
[3:05:37.180 --> 3:05:45.100]  false flags and fake media i will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with alex
[3:05:45.100 --> 3:06:13.260]  jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed ha ha ha ha all right french spoils our guests
[3:06:13.260 --> 3:06:17.900]  he leaves us about two segments we're fixing phone calls for him right now but he authored
[3:06:19.740 --> 3:06:24.300]  the us bio weapons act got adopted by the un he wanted live in prison for people that develop
[3:06:24.300 --> 3:06:30.540]  this type of stuff all i'm saying is you go up and shoot my family member in the head i'm gonna go
[3:06:30.540 --> 3:06:34.620]  to the courts you're gonna get justice you do it in some sophisticated bio weapon we're not even
[3:06:34.620 --> 3:06:39.020]  so deal with that so i'm just telling all the life scientists that make comments on facebook about
[3:06:39.020 --> 3:06:44.380]  there's too many people and our big leftists that are all into this stuff right now and they're
[3:06:44.380 --> 3:06:50.460]  neo malfusions this stuff comes out it hurts my family it's not a threat it's not acting tough
[3:06:50.460 --> 3:06:55.980]  i'm gonna just hold you responsible and this is this is not me acting tough as a man i've just
[3:06:55.980 --> 3:07:02.300]  got to be honest it's time you know globalist that i'm done with your crap and the listeners
[3:07:02.300 --> 3:07:06.300]  need to be done as well and nobody ever says this stuff because they'll do a false flag against
[3:07:06.300 --> 3:07:10.940]  themselves they won't do that here and then go oh they they attacked us because we did the weapon
[3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:15.820]  they need to know that we understand this is a covert weapon it's a eugenics based system it's
[3:07:15.820 --> 3:07:21.340]  the same group that created the nazis as a beta test the same group that ran ibm they're behind
[3:07:21.340 --> 3:07:28.940]  this and they need to know we know their number and they better not pull any more of this crap
[3:07:28.940 --> 3:07:34.220]  and this is defensive because we know what this is we know it's manufactured it's out of control
[3:07:34.220 --> 3:07:38.060]  and all these labs have it it's leaked out of u.s labs it's leaked out of russian labs it's
[3:07:38.060 --> 3:07:44.620]  wreaked up and it's just insane can you comment just to the moral authority or what we do to get
[3:07:44.620 --> 3:07:50.940]  them to stop when common sense and laws that you've helped pass won't do it what do we do
[3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:55.660]  when they won't follow the law and play games what do we do when they create
[3:07:55.660 --> 3:08:06.060]  promethean biological hydrogen bombs and and are running around distributing them well um
[3:08:06.060 --> 3:08:12.300]  alex as i said i they tried very hard to get the death penalty into my uh biological weapons
[3:08:12.300 --> 3:08:18.140]  anti-terrorism act and i resisted because i i don't support the uh death penalty so it's
[3:08:18.140 --> 3:08:25.900]  life in prison but you know basically under these circumstances uh i just submit everyone
[3:08:25.900 --> 3:08:32.700]  has to do what his or her conscience tells them to do i i can't give you you know moral guidance
[3:08:32.700 --> 3:08:38.620]  or religious guidance i'm a law professor no lawyer so uh you know people have to decide
[3:08:38.620 --> 3:08:45.260]  this for themselves but before we uh take questions and i'm happy to take some questions i know your
[3:08:45.260 --> 3:08:50.860]  uh viewers there have been quite patient listening to me for the last uh hour here uh i can't stay
[3:08:50.860 --> 3:08:57.900]  forever but i i do want to make it clear that um uh i have never worked the united states
[3:08:57.900 --> 3:09:03.660]  government as a matter of principle uh because of my opposition to the vietnam war going back to
[3:09:03.660 --> 3:09:13.020]  when i was about 16 i have never had a security clearance i have no access to any secret information
[3:09:13.020 --> 3:09:21.820]  or anything like that i'm just going through what uh i have seen in the public record and uh
[3:09:21.820 --> 3:09:29.500]  you know studying i even studied biological warfare at uh harvard with uh matt meselson uh
[3:09:29.500 --> 3:09:35.500]  harvard biologist and he was the one who convinced his colleague kissinger and the two of them convinced
[3:09:35.500 --> 3:09:41.420]  uh nixon to ratify the uh biological weapons convention unfortunately at that point at that
[3:09:41.420 --> 3:09:49.100]  at that point the pentagon and the cia took all their uh uh biological warfare work uh underground
[3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:58.060]  so i want to tell your viewers i don't have answers to all your questions uh that that's not my job
[3:09:58.060 --> 3:10:04.140]  here uh it's it's there's so many people like the president it's all compartmental i don't know
[3:10:04.140 --> 3:10:11.020]  classified stuff's the biggest propaganda out there right i believe that uh president trump's call
[3:10:11.020 --> 3:10:18.380]  and endorsement to president g just indicates to me they the scientists and advisers he uh they have
[3:10:18.380 --> 3:10:24.060]  behind him are just feeling uh feeding him a lot of bull twaddle that is right there's an international
[3:10:24.060 --> 3:10:32.780]  mad scientist eugenics conspiracy that's what unifies the evil well it seems as i've said before uh
[3:10:32.780 --> 3:10:37.420]  this is China's the test project let's go to a few calls they've been holding for you uh let's go
[3:10:37.420 --> 3:10:44.060]  ahead and talk to um question for guests ed in utah how did china lab scientists know uh go ahead
[3:10:44.060 --> 3:10:48.940]  at your question ed yeah how did uh hey thanks a lot gentlemen for all you're doing we're really
[3:10:48.940 --> 3:10:57.660]  blessed to have you guys um how did the uh lab uh china doctor there know that this was the corona
[3:10:57.660 --> 3:11:07.260]  virus um in other words the naming of the virus itself well that you know corona virus is a common
[3:11:07.260 --> 3:11:14.460]  virus for uh colds and all sorts of things like that too well colds and whatever even dogs get
[3:11:14.460 --> 3:11:23.980]  corona virus so it does appear that uh at this bsl for lab uh they took a corona virus and they
[3:11:23.980 --> 3:11:31.980]  dna genetically engineered it into a biological weapon known as sars so sars itself is already a
[3:11:31.980 --> 3:11:40.300]  uh a biological warfare weapon and then they super duper did uh super charged it again with
[3:11:40.300 --> 3:11:49.580]  dna genetic engineering maybe synthetic biology to add into sars uh hiv as alex correctly pointed
[3:11:49.580 --> 3:11:56.620]  out that uh indian study and the uh flu virus and then they gave it these uh gain of uh function
[3:11:56.620 --> 3:12:04.460]  activities so we're we're dealing here uh uh ed with some type of uh super duper uh biological
[3:12:04.460 --> 3:12:11.020]  weapon that we have never encountered uh before between you and me i'm not i'm not trying to
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:15.340]  scare yet i'm just giving you my best assessment of all right and we gotta jump thanks for the call
[3:12:15.340 --> 3:12:19.980]  we gotta move quick i should add natural news dot com is broken this is up on info wars dot com
[3:12:19.980 --> 3:12:26.780]  breaking shina to quarantine city of shenzhen in the province causing mad rush to hong kong is
[3:12:26.780 --> 3:12:31.500]  infected citizens flee he's got businesses there mike adams is confirmed this is an explosive
[3:12:31.500 --> 3:12:37.260]  it's up on natural news dot com news wars dot com right now that is huge breaking news right there
[3:12:37.260 --> 3:12:44.540]  dr boil that that's pretty frightening let me respond to that you see this was reported immediately
[3:12:44.540 --> 3:12:53.660]  to president g all right and he understands exactly how dangerous this is okay and that is
[3:12:53.660 --> 3:13:04.220]  why he is taking the draconian measures that he has taken and is taking now to to try to uh contain
[3:13:04.220 --> 3:13:11.740]  it if this can be done uh otherwise they wouldn't be doing all this indeed g knows uh full well
[3:13:11.740 --> 3:13:19.740]  that this threatens his uh regime and indeed the uh communist government uh over there uh in china
[3:13:19.740 --> 3:13:24.700]  so doc i'm not disagreeing with you so now you're kind of saying that how is trump wrong give us
[3:13:24.700 --> 3:13:31.980]  the new lines in praising g i believe president trump was misadvised that under no circumstances
[3:13:31.980 --> 3:13:37.260]  he's not being advised that it's a bio weapon that's your problem that's correct i don't believe he
[3:13:37.260 --> 3:13:45.580]  has been uh uh advised that it's a bio weapon or that that this is um a turbo charged bio weapon i
[3:13:45.580 --> 3:13:51.580]  just don't believe he he understands that i the scientific advisors he has around them you know
[3:13:51.580 --> 3:13:56.380]  these are uh very well said i agree with your statement uh jordan in oregon jordan you're on
[3:13:56.380 --> 3:14:02.940]  the air with dr francis boil go ahead thanks for taking my call this is the question for dr boil
[3:14:02.940 --> 3:14:10.460]  and alex there's two prime suspects here the u.s and china china is the deep state we've got 13 000
[3:14:10.460 --> 3:14:16.780]  u.s scientists developing a bio weapon spending 120 billion dollars it's got the u.s fingerprints
[3:14:16.780 --> 3:14:21.660]  all over it i think they're gonna come out with a whistleblower when the death toll is high enough
[3:14:21.660 --> 3:14:27.580]  and there's enough chaos and then the media is gonna turn on trump and america and blame this on
[3:14:27.580 --> 3:14:35.500]  trump and it'll let gg paying safe space it could this be could this be a false flag claiming a mad
[3:14:35.500 --> 3:14:42.220]  12th monkey scientist in the u.s did this because they're angry at china i did consider that uh
[3:14:42.220 --> 3:14:50.140]  alternative uh alex and i'm glad you uh mentioned that and while i was waiting these uh alternatives
[3:14:50.140 --> 3:14:56.940]  i did not give interviews uh it was only when i came to the conclusion based on the long history
[3:14:56.940 --> 3:15:05.100]  of this psl four lab uh that it that it leaked out of there but that being said if this is some type
[3:15:05.100 --> 3:15:14.860]  of uh covert attack on china i suspect uh president g knows that full well and he will
[3:15:14.860 --> 3:15:22.860]  retaliate in kind upon whoever uh might be the culprit here and i'm not saying who may or may
[3:15:22.860 --> 3:15:29.980]  not be the culprit uh we have the capability canada has the capability japan has the capability
[3:15:29.980 --> 3:15:36.540]  france has the capability britain has the capability israel has the capability but i'm not
[3:15:36.540 --> 3:15:44.460]  right now my conclusion it was a leak uh i'll continue to uh evaluate your vaccine development
[3:15:44.460 --> 3:15:48.620]  link makes perfect sense they're creating something they know is being developed in canada against them
[3:15:48.620 --> 3:15:53.740]  to defend themselves it leaks out most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent

[3:20:45.740 --> 3:20:50.620]  the end of the hour the no one's chore in the war room takes over but we're talking about real
[3:20:50.620 --> 3:20:56.620]  world stuff and what about this dr bull before we go to a few calls the media up front
[3:20:56.620 --> 3:21:01.900]  a month ago saying there will be no discussion about this virus when it wasn't even the news
[3:21:01.900 --> 3:21:05.420]  there'll be no questioning official statements that was like what jiji ping was saying a month
[3:21:05.420 --> 3:21:10.780]  ago in china and then anybody even covering what local chinese news was saying or hong kong news
[3:21:10.780 --> 3:21:16.940]  would be shut down like info wars or natural news but now it's been proven accurate and that we're
[3:21:16.940 --> 3:21:21.740]  leading the news days or weeks ahead that's when i really thought hey this looks pretty serious but
[3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:27.180]  what about the lock step corporate media in america that doesn't create confidence if they're not
[3:21:27.180 --> 3:21:30.940]  honest about what's happening i think that's what you're getting at is trumps like it's
[3:21:30.940 --> 3:21:35.420]  under control zizi doing a great job no it's not under control things is what you're saying
[3:21:36.700 --> 3:21:45.980]  that's correct alex and to give you a primary case and point is me after the anthrax attacks in
[3:21:45.980 --> 3:21:57.180]  october 2001 i gave three interviews saying this undoubtedly originated out of a united states
[3:21:57.180 --> 3:22:06.780]  government warfare laboratory working on anthrax i gave that interview first to fox news in boston
[3:22:06.780 --> 3:22:14.620]  as i was entering the harvard divinity school to chair a working group on biological warfare
[3:22:14.620 --> 3:22:21.340]  there for the council for responsible genetics which i've worked with since the early 1980s
[3:22:21.340 --> 3:22:28.220]  basically the top five scientists at harvard and mit then when i got back to my office i gave an
[3:22:28.220 --> 3:22:36.780]  interview to a radio station in washington dc then i gave an interview on this saying the same
[3:22:36.780 --> 3:22:46.140]  thing to the bbc the whole world heard me and then the order was given never to interview me again
[3:22:46.140 --> 3:22:53.260]  in other any mainstream news media source here in the united states or in europe i kid you not and
[3:22:53.260 --> 3:23:00.460]  no one in the mainstream news media has ever interviewed me again on uh uh biological warfare
[3:23:00.460 --> 3:23:08.380]  programs for any reason even though i wrote the statute on the books so you're absolutely correct
[3:23:08.380 --> 3:23:15.180]  i've been blackballed and blacklisted out of the mainstream news media since uh early november
[3:23:15.180 --> 3:23:21.580]  uh 2001 so short and there's a major backlash this chinese doctor that first reported was
[3:23:21.580 --> 3:23:27.020]  deadly a month ago he died of it he's now a hero i mean the state never is able to cover this up
[3:23:27.020 --> 3:23:31.580]  especially the digital age i don't think that they're going to be able to censor everybody
[3:23:31.580 --> 3:23:37.820]  when everybody understands what's happening i don't know i have been successfully silenced
[3:23:38.380 --> 3:23:45.820]  since november of 2001 uh undoubtedly agencies in the united states government have just
[3:23:45.820 --> 3:23:51.420]  ordered the uh mainstream news uh u.s news media operation mockingbird they've confirmed that but
[3:23:51.420 --> 3:23:56.220]  that's old corporate media you're all over the place in independent media so i just think
[3:23:56.220 --> 3:24:00.460]  in that paradigm you've been silenced but that's why they're dying is they don't have real people
[3:24:01.820 --> 3:24:08.060]  well you're correct about that uh but i you know all i do i i deal with the media all the time
[3:24:08.060 --> 3:24:14.060]  they know exactly who i am uh and they won't talk to me the mainstream news city that gets out to
[3:24:14.060 --> 3:24:19.980]  no tens of millions of people they're simply not going to let me go on and say what i just
[3:24:19.980 --> 3:24:24.540]  told you today well said all right shonnie new jersey on the air with dr boyle go ahead
[3:24:24.540 --> 3:24:30.540]  hey how's it going today alex dr boyle i'm worried about our children i'll be frank with
[3:24:30.540 --> 3:24:35.580]  you go ahead i i totally understand where you're coming from brother well this is real quick um
[3:24:35.580 --> 3:24:42.060]  when you pulled up the map of the bio weapons labs it struck me because i heard that uh ping
[3:24:42.620 --> 3:24:49.660]  ran off to an island compound and if you hold the map up and see how deserted the west coast is of
[3:24:49.660 --> 3:24:57.100]  these bio labs now this is just a scenario what couldn't the elites be planning to head out there
[3:24:57.100 --> 3:25:03.580]  and then whatever population is left over after the apocalypse like use them as work as like
[3:25:03.580 --> 3:25:09.500]  laborers to try to rebuild their society you know bio weapons spread via airplanes and everything
[3:25:09.500 --> 3:25:13.980]  else uh um speculation is great to think things through but i think it's just because where the
[3:25:13.980 --> 3:25:18.940]  universities are they want to put them on fault lines so that they're in more stable areas geographically
[3:25:18.940 --> 3:25:24.060]  let's ask an expert dr boyle why do you think the level four bio weapons labs are where they are
[3:25:25.820 --> 3:25:32.140]  research development testing of offensive biological weapons and in areas where
[3:25:33.100 --> 3:25:40.220]  they have easy access if necessary to human beings look at look at the anthrax the united
[3:25:40.220 --> 3:25:48.380]  states government is fully prepared to wage anthrax warfare all over the world if that story
[3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:57.660]  broke in usa today there were massive shipments of anthrax weapons grade anthrax out of dugway
[3:25:57.660 --> 3:26:05.580]  uh proving ground where they stole store this stuff to us bio warfare labs all over the country and
[3:26:05.580 --> 3:26:11.500]  tell them why they love anthrax it's miniaturized it lives thousands of years and they've got silos
[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:17.740]  full of it enough to kill the whole planet and and uh the pentagon said well this is a mistake
[3:26:17.740 --> 3:26:22.220]  well you know i dealt with the pentagon they don't make mistakes like this not with weapons
[3:26:22.220 --> 3:26:29.820]  grade anthrax they were stockpiling all these bsl three and bsl four labs around the united states
[3:26:29.820 --> 3:26:35.020]  with weapons grade anthrax to be used that's the only reason no you're right on big stuff like
[3:26:35.020 --> 3:26:39.980]  that there's 20 levels of neurotic checking why do you think with dick chaney those cruise missiles
[3:26:39.980 --> 3:26:44.940]  came up missing 15 years ago that's always a big question they said that was an accident
[3:26:44.940 --> 3:26:49.260]  people called it out they killed the crew and the people that witnessed it and what the hell
[3:26:49.260 --> 3:26:57.900]  was happening with those cruise missiles well i believe that uh after 9 11 uh 2001 uh they invoked
[3:26:57.900 --> 3:27:06.060]  their uh secret government alternative government uh program cod continuity of government c o g
[3:27:06.060 --> 3:27:14.460]  that you're right that was under chaining and so basically we had two chains of military command
[3:27:14.460 --> 3:27:22.620]  here in the united states one under president bush uh junior and the second under chaining
[3:27:22.620 --> 3:27:29.340]  so i believe that's what he's saying chaney's the president because he was right so i believe that
[3:27:29.340 --> 3:27:35.820]  connect the two chains of command can account for all these uh incidents and that's why one group of
[3:27:35.820 --> 3:27:40.220]  military police caught and found the nicks when they were about to be flown out so the question
[3:27:40.220 --> 3:27:46.380]  is where were they going right well uh you know chaining the neocons i guess we're gonna use them
[3:27:46.380 --> 3:27:53.340]  you know there were was it b 52 bobbers were sent uh there were nukes sent to uh taiwan and things of
[3:27:53.340 --> 3:27:57.900]  that nature so i believe everybody blames the government the government's just like humanity

[3:33:49.340 --> 3:33:55.820]  they blow themselves up is that real are we reaching that atlantic in a moment and then

[3:34:02.780 --> 3:34:10.140]  well alex uh what happened there in uh wuhan and i feel terrible for the uh chinese government
[3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:14.700]  people they they live under a communist government so there's very little they can really do
[3:34:15.260 --> 3:34:21.660]  this is a wake up call for those of us here in the united states of america that is supposed
[3:34:21.660 --> 3:34:29.900]  to be a democracy with a constitution and uh the rule of law and we need to come to grips with this
[3:34:29.900 --> 3:34:37.820]  immediately we need to convince president trump to fire his team of swamp creature uh uh scientists
[3:34:37.820 --> 3:34:43.820]  who are out to the eyeballs and biological warfare work and bring in outside independent
[3:34:43.820 --> 3:34:50.220]  experts who have never accepted one penny of dirty biological warfare work from anyone
[3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:56.860]  and whose institutions have never accepted one penny of dirty biological warfare work
[3:34:56.860 --> 3:35:05.980]  from anyone and then plot a strategy to contain this and bring this under control before it gets
[3:35:05.980 --> 3:35:14.060]  completely out of control and try to you know protect the american people are our uh public
[3:35:14.060 --> 3:35:21.180]  health you know we've wasted a hundred and twenty billion dollars on uh biological warfare that
[3:35:21.180 --> 3:35:27.180]  money should have been spent uh improving the uh public health in america medical treatment of the
[3:35:27.180 --> 3:35:37.740]  uh american people and not on this uh uh bio warfare uh work and every bsl3 every bsl4 facility
[3:35:37.740 --> 3:35:46.060]  here in the united states should be shut down immediately before we have uh an accident like
[3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:51.980]  what happened in in wuhan you know we we have to be very careful here you know there but for the
[3:35:51.980 --> 3:35:58.780]  grace of god go i when we're looking at what's happening in wuhan here i don't want to see it
[3:35:58.780 --> 3:36:07.900]  here happen to my american people and that is why i've spent the last hour and 40 minutes uh with
[3:36:07.900 --> 3:36:15.740]  you on this program to try to get the the message out here to our american people to understand you
[3:36:15.740 --> 3:36:19.580]  think it's very very serious and you're an academic this mark god is keep telling you
[3:36:19.580 --> 3:36:24.540]  everybody needs to have their work promoted in the system uh the last book you were plugging as
[3:36:24.540 --> 3:36:32.380]  we went to break well it was just uh by a warfare and terrorism you can get that at amazon and then

[3:36:57.820 --> 3:37:03.660]  the mainstream news media uh will not report anything i have to say so you're not going to
[3:37:04.380 --> 3:37:06.940]  find it in any mainstream news media sources
[3:37:06.940 --> 3:37:12.940]  powerful information please join us again we really appreciate you dr boil
[3:37:13.820 --> 3:37:21.980]  well again uh thank you for uh had me on alex and for taking the time to no bring this message to
[3:37:21.980 --> 3:37:30.300]  our american people i think we still have time to to contain this and save our people uh and we can
[3:37:30.300 --> 3:37:35.020]  i've given you the best advice i can under the circumstances thank you we'll talk again soon
[3:37:35.020 --> 3:37:41.100]  be safe thank you up there in chicago okay uh i want to finish up with five or six calls alain
[3:37:41.100 --> 3:37:47.580]  mark kevin and shara and the warram's coming up with oh and shroy are all fresh uh with the information
[3:37:47.580 --> 3:37:58.060]  he's got but you heard him he's going off stacks of university reports and admissions and and he
[3:37:58.060 --> 3:38:03.980]  sent me all these links to us government admissions of souping up the coronavirus and all of these
[3:38:03.980 --> 3:38:10.780]  groups involved this is just insane and they all do it the name of safety like we all have guns in
[3:38:10.780 --> 3:38:15.260]  our houses the name of safety but they're not locked up right or somebody bad gets and they
[3:38:15.260 --> 3:38:21.100]  can cause a problem but that's okay just a few people get killed that's part of being free
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:26.060]  bad stuff happens and overall the good outweighs the bad that we're free and empowered and it's good
[3:38:27.420 --> 3:38:31.260]  but would you have any matter weapons in your house that could blow the whole solar system up
[3:38:31.260 --> 3:38:35.500]  just to make sure a robber couldn't do something no you don't have any matter weapons in all your
[3:38:35.500 --> 3:38:41.420]  houses in fact no government and no group should make it and that's the difference between good and
[3:38:41.420 --> 3:38:48.700]  evil god's god so god wouldn't create an any matter weapon that would just blow up a bunch of innocent
[3:38:48.700 --> 3:38:52.540]  creatures for no reason just because god could it's called restraint
[3:38:52.540 --> 3:39:00.300]  like you could go crap in the public pool as an exercise of power you're called a mental patient
[3:39:01.980 --> 3:39:08.540]  very few people crap in the pool unless they're babies and this is baby like behavior and this
[3:39:08.540 --> 3:39:13.740]  crapping in the pool will blow the whole planet up and so that's where I come down to is there is a
[3:39:13.740 --> 3:39:19.260]  arms race in chemical weapons biological weapons conventional weapons psychological weapons
[3:39:19.260 --> 3:39:27.020]  uh the drugging of the public the electromagnetic manipulation it's just let's do it because if
[3:39:27.020 --> 3:39:33.500]  we don't somebody else will and we'll test it and see what it does and if it's bad we won't use it
[3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:37.500]  but we'll be able to recognize it and then they go with whatever the worst path is because
[3:39:38.140 --> 3:39:42.540]  by the time you figure out you figured it out somebody else has well now we've got to use it
[3:39:42.540 --> 3:39:48.860]  because they've got it and it's just it's the end of humanity folks we're babies on this planet
[3:39:49.660 --> 3:39:53.580]  developing incredible technologies that have been developed countless times before
[3:39:53.580 --> 3:39:59.260]  and god's been through this and we're acting like idiots we've been given a blueprint it's called the
[3:39:59.260 --> 3:40:05.580]  bible it warns of all this happening in great detail and says do not do this but it says you're
[3:40:05.580 --> 3:40:09.340]  going to do it and then this is going to happen and this is how you get out of it
[3:40:09.340 --> 3:40:18.540]  it's spiritually calling on sos but god wants you to see it all come to pass and make your
[3:40:18.540 --> 3:40:23.980]  free will choice before that happens that's pretty heavy isn't it you'll say who are you
[3:40:24.860 --> 3:40:28.780]  you will do this to us to give us free will but you wouldn't put up with it
[3:40:32.060 --> 3:40:37.580]  no the creator of the universe actually pulled back from us it's like it's not fiction written
[3:40:37.580 --> 3:40:45.340]  by some Hebrews it's direct divine knowledge folks no god would say no i'll actually do it
[3:40:45.340 --> 3:40:49.660]  i'll come down there i'll show you how it's done i'll walk a mile in your shoes right now
[3:40:49.660 --> 3:40:55.580]  may do it i'll do it right now in fact i won't just physically take the torture and all of it
[3:40:56.140 --> 3:41:04.300]  i will take all of the sent on so that i metaphysically then can forgive you and take you on
[3:41:04.300 --> 3:41:10.460]  because that's how the universe works it's energetic and god's got to be that sacrificial
[3:41:10.460 --> 3:41:15.820]  land that goes between the two to then because you can't have new free will creatures given that
[3:41:15.820 --> 3:41:19.820]  much power who aren't going to mess up and do evil stuff but they've just got to make the
[3:41:19.820 --> 3:41:23.980]  spiritual decision to go with god and then god will cheat the rest of the way to take us over
[3:41:24.540 --> 3:41:29.260]  and you know at this level god's going to take folks over there are still turning it's god
[3:41:29.260 --> 3:41:33.260]  i'm telling you i don't want to get into stuff but i've seen the next levels okay and they're
[3:41:33.260 --> 3:41:38.940]  indescribable and this isn't this isn't just like the simplification people here and all this
[3:41:39.660 --> 3:41:43.820]  but there's a lot of rebellion going on against the nature of the universe
[3:41:45.180 --> 3:41:50.620]  and unlimited life unlimited creation and most of the time people blow themselves up
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:57.900]  but out of that process god gets the elect the remnant that's why it's called the remnant you
[3:41:57.900 --> 3:42:03.260]  think it's always just a remnant of those that love god it's done over and over and over and over
[3:42:03.260 --> 3:42:09.580]  and over and over and over again because you're not going to be given power unless you can handle it
[3:42:11.340 --> 3:42:14.700]  i remember my life every time i made the right decision didn't sell out
[3:42:16.780 --> 3:42:22.780]  didn't get intimidated didn't back down had doors closed like clicking a switch
[3:42:22.780 --> 3:42:29.020]  boom all of a sudden all these doors open and my discernment increased which makes me humble
[3:42:29.020 --> 3:42:33.340]  and so i've i've learned like wow it's not the globalist in control they're trying to create
[3:42:33.340 --> 3:42:37.340]  omnipresent computers they hope can mimic this because they know it's there they're all doing
[3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:42.540]  their wicked stuff because they realize it's in every every step they make doesn't make them stronger
[3:42:42.540 --> 3:42:48.300]  makes them weaker so they get more violent more deceptive more satanic your calls will come right
[3:42:48.300 --> 3:42:54.540]  back in four minutes stay with us well it's here the year 2020 world government's out in the open
[3:42:54.540 --> 3:42:59.020]  we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and
[3:42:59.020 --> 3:43:05.420]  we've got massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated by big tech and banks against
[3:43:05.420 --> 3:43:11.980]  people that promote america and guns and freedom and jesus and the family and the protection of
[3:43:11.980 --> 3:43:18.140]  the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new world order's real satanism's real the pedophile
[3:43:18.140 --> 3:43:23.020]  leader real but we're real as well and we love god and we're standing up and saying no but i just
[3:43:23.020 --> 3:43:27.980]  want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas we have never
[3:43:27.980 --> 3:43:33.900]  been in some smallville place that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs
[3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:37.740]  the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go
[3:43:37.740 --> 3:43:41.580]  through so it's an incredible town to be alive i'm gonna thank you all for being aware and being
[3:43:41.580 --> 3:43:46.940]  involved but just remember your action now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of

[3:44:36.700 --> 3:44:42.060]  well my family's using as a frontline defense nothing's perfect except you know prayer and god's
[3:44:42.060 --> 3:44:46.460]  intervention and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as it looks but definitely we know why
[3:44:46.460 --> 3:44:53.020]  governments are panicking right now because this is certainly a bizarre virus i've got to really

[3:45:12.380 --> 3:45:18.380]  liberty is amazing as well you're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against
[3:45:18.380 --> 3:45:22.700]  that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against
[3:45:22.700 --> 3:45:28.780]  communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize
[3:45:28.780 --> 3:45:35.180]  that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[3:45:35.180 --> 3:45:40.140]  war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:45:40.140 --> 3:45:45.980]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:45:45.980 --> 3:45:51.260]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:45:52.380 --> 3:45:57.180]  we're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods i would have storable foods because 2020 is
[3:45:57.180 --> 3:46:01.820]  a very dangerous year the bubble is so huge and could pop i hope it doesn't it's incredibly dangerous
[3:46:01.820 --> 3:46:05.740]  and a little cause well you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops so
[3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:09.500]  i've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality it's insurance you
[3:46:09.500 --> 3:46:14.300]  can eat it lasts 25 years we go out and find the very best companies that the very best quality at
[3:46:14.300 --> 3:46:19.180]  the very lowest price and that's my patriot supply and then so that i have my own private label of
[3:46:19.180 --> 3:46:24.620]  their full spectrum of food we private label it as info wars select and they are saying that they've
[3:46:24.620 --> 3:46:29.340]  never sold this much food they're still able within seven to ten days to ship it to you if you get
[3:46:29.340 --> 3:46:34.620]  your orders in on their small orders their big orders seven to ten days it will be shipped out to
[3:46:34.620 --> 3:46:40.140]  you give you get your order in now but just as sure as the sun came up it's all selling out right
[3:46:40.140 --> 3:46:44.940]  now so get your orders in for high quality storable foods right now for all the reasons out there
[3:46:44.940 --> 3:46:51.260]  and it's insurance you can eat and it funds the info war a total 360 win infowarstore.com
[3:46:51.260 --> 3:46:57.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:02.380 --> 3:47:05.900]  how speaker nancy felosi was seen tearing up her copy of president
[3:47:10.620 --> 3:47:16.460]  speaker nancy felosi ripping up her copy of the president state of the union speech but he
[3:47:16.460 --> 3:47:20.780]  will not be acquitted the impeachment trial of president donald john trump is officially over
[3:47:20.780 --> 3:47:25.100]  the senate as anticipated did vote to acquit president trump on both articles of impeachment
[3:47:25.100 --> 3:47:31.340]  against him that's not how a democracy works that's not how it works that's not how any of this works
[3:47:31.340 --> 3:47:43.020]  both don't act so surprised globalist you didn't think you could silence the american people did
[3:47:43.020 --> 3:47:50.220]  you join bandart video and i will complete your training together we can overthrow the emperor
[3:47:50.220 --> 3:47:53.500]  and restore the republic
[3:47:57.020 --> 3:48:06.540]  you know i'm not into cuss words because i've got a big vocabulary but democrats cuss all over
[3:48:06.540 --> 3:48:14.620]  broadcast tv and radio they never get in trouble but if we let one caller slip through with any of
[3:48:14.620 --> 3:48:19.660]  the band seven words or whatever they call stations they try to get complaints they never get the
[3:48:19.660 --> 3:48:26.940]  fines but that shows their mentality so trump saying bs is noting this is history
[3:48:28.700 --> 3:48:32.380]  and notice none of the stations we have because i've been airing it you know with him saying
[3:48:32.380 --> 3:48:38.780]  the actual bravo seara have gotten mad at us because it it's not about the bs it's about leadership
[3:48:41.340 --> 3:48:47.900]  because the president says bs well now it's okay to see bs teaching boys they're really girls
[3:48:47.900 --> 3:48:54.380]  teaching girls that they're boys teaching people families are bad teaching people that's what is
[3:48:54.380 --> 3:49:01.340]  obscene i've got a lot of family a lot of great people and i love southern baptist but they'll
[3:49:01.340 --> 3:49:08.380]  tell you a cuss word is worse than aborting a baby i mean they won't say that but they get more
[3:49:08.380 --> 3:49:12.700]  upset about a cuss word or drinking some wine than they will about aborting a baby
[3:49:12.700 --> 3:49:19.980]  it's a lot of family or southern baptist and it's a holiness they have about and i like trump
[3:49:19.980 --> 3:49:25.820]  he's actually backing abortion down starting to shut it down but he doesn't get up there and tell
[3:49:25.820 --> 3:49:31.660]  you how much he loves jesus see because the truth is in the action and that's what i like
[3:49:33.500 --> 3:49:35.980]  you know the truth is the bible doesn't say using
[3:49:35.980 --> 3:49:45.100]  old english before the norman took over almost a thousand years ago for the vikings took over
[3:49:45.100 --> 3:49:54.460]  england they came in and they banned the entire language of the saxon but it was only the cuss words
[3:49:55.420 --> 3:50:03.500]  that continued on the classic things people would say like bullshit they found two thousand
[3:50:03.500 --> 3:50:09.900]  year old plaques that say something is bs and what they would the anglo-saxon would call something
[3:50:10.860 --> 3:50:21.020]  for whatever weird reason they had bs and of course that was just the word there were hundreds
[3:50:21.020 --> 3:50:27.340]  of words banned and trumps basically metaphysically saying you don't ban the words anymore we're going
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:36.700]  to use them it's not the words that are bad it's the bad people so you could call it the bs revolution
[3:50:37.500 --> 3:50:44.140]  because it's bs to say the left can engage the most satanic garbage human animal clones
[3:50:44.140 --> 3:50:49.180]  mass killing of already born babies and it's like oh that's no big deal did you hear trump he said bs
[3:50:51.340 --> 3:50:57.020]  but notice as soon as he said it no stations complained no tv no satellite we let one caller
[3:50:57.020 --> 3:51:00.540]  go through they freak out and i get it because the lefts they're calling and filing complaints
[3:51:00.540 --> 3:51:06.060]  but no one's going to enforce it i'll leave it at that let's just say i'm just going to leave it at
[3:51:06.060 --> 3:51:12.940]  that uh but it just shows the intimidation where conservatives are so scared they won't say sh-t
[3:51:14.300 --> 3:51:21.020]  shit but the left can teach kit have convicted pedophiles come in and have five-year-olds still
[3:51:21.020 --> 3:51:27.820]  on their lap without parents even knowing in many cases like colorada let a pedophile have your
[3:51:27.820 --> 3:51:35.020]  kids on their lap that's okay just don't say the the anglo-saxon word for feces because when you
[3:51:35.020 --> 3:51:47.020]  outlaw people's culture you outlaw their words you know i like all those anglo-saxon words
[3:51:47.020 --> 3:51:52.300]  tony montana likes one because of the f uses it a lot it sounds good doesn't it it's a good word
[3:51:53.100 --> 3:51:57.980]  actually describes it too it's got a lot of different meanings like you got or i'm gonna or
[3:51:57.980 --> 3:52:02.860]  that was a great i mean it's got a lot of meanings it's a nice word why are we so scared of it oh
[3:52:02.860 --> 3:52:08.460]  because we're all good we're all but we didn't do anything about 50 million 60 million dead babies
[3:52:08.460 --> 3:52:12.700]  we didn't do anything about all this other stuff we just sat around and felt good went to church
[3:52:12.700 --> 3:52:22.140]  because we were so good all day what a load of bullshit it's bullshit the pedophiles taken over
[3:52:22.140 --> 3:52:29.820]  is the enemy not the president using old english thousand years old not spoken by any norman
[3:52:29.820 --> 3:52:38.620]  nobility and the elites that captured england that is the most anglo-saxon we scottish but he
[3:52:38.620 --> 3:52:45.500]  even gets it more that is the sexiest thing i've seen a while politically i mean that's just like
[3:52:45.500 --> 3:52:50.780]  you want rebel you want outlaw because it's one thing about leftist says it no one listens
[3:52:50.780 --> 3:52:57.020]  but it's the president saying it in his exoneration in the main west wing dining you know in the main
[3:52:57.020 --> 3:53:04.700]  broadcast area saying this is bs and then using a banned word to the system saying we see through
[3:53:04.700 --> 3:53:10.620]  i gotta move quick let's go to mark in colorado ahead mark thanks for holding hey hello alex
[3:53:10.620 --> 3:53:18.060]  it's good to talk to you um are you there yes sir thanks for calling yeah um i have a couple
[3:53:18.060 --> 3:53:22.620]  questions i wanted to answer especially i address them to the country of canada and if there is an
[3:53:22.620 --> 3:53:28.940]  honest government on the face of the earth which i doubt um you know who the biologist was that
[3:53:28.940 --> 3:53:34.940]  stole from the lab you know what she stole from the lab you know when she stole it from the lab
[3:53:35.580 --> 3:53:39.820]  you know how she stole it from the lab obviously everything's on film so why is she not hanging
[3:53:39.820 --> 3:53:46.860]  up by her toes till she tells us who did it well these they know the why you know i smelled espionage
[3:53:46.860 --> 3:53:52.060]  from the second i heard that report which was quite a while ago and you know think of this
[3:53:52.060 --> 3:53:57.420]  if this chinese scientist was allowed to go back to wuhan and they leaked this out certainly the
[3:53:57.420 --> 3:54:03.420]  chinese president couldn't say well we stole it from top of canada they'd hang him by his by his
[3:54:03.420 --> 3:54:09.980]  thumbs so you know i just smell so much intrigue in this whole event oh no i agree with you i think
[3:54:09.980 --> 3:54:15.020]  we know the virus is deadly it's manmade the question is who did it deep state the chai
[3:54:15.020 --> 3:54:18.780]  comms the us i mean i think it's all open to speculation because we don't know but they
[3:54:18.780 --> 3:54:23.740]  don't want to speculate we're supposed to sit there and go oh what are you telling us we're
[3:54:23.740 --> 3:54:28.060]  gonna you know we're the vanguard most of what we said turned out to be true because we're looking
[3:54:28.060 --> 3:54:31.660]  at real facts and i'm proud of the audience i'm proud of the guests because you know it's been
[3:54:31.660 --> 3:54:37.260]  the audience that's giving us a lot of intel yeah canada can answer these questions now they can
[3:54:37.260 --> 3:54:45.500]  call you up in a few minutes you know i mean um we would have more uh more to deduce from and we
[3:54:45.500 --> 3:54:52.940]  wouldn't be speculating and now the damage is done and now like uh uh doctor mike adam said
[3:54:52.940 --> 3:54:59.020]  this thing is out there so you know other nefarious people can do this i'm just so sick and tired of

[3:56:44.060 --> 3:56:48.300]  may have to come to a point where we have to stop orders and they they don't even want to hear that
[3:56:48.300 --> 3:56:54.060]  folks because they're really worried it is as bad as we think and they've refused to sell to
