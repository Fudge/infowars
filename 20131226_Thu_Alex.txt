[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.680 --> 00:42.520]  all right V in Nevada ahead of Ron Paul joining us them will go to Jody and
[00:42.520 --> 00:47.360]  Wesley and Jim and Mike everybody else is holding yeah I remember seeing this
[00:47.360 --> 00:51.440]  months ago that no one seen Nelson Mandela no one was allowed to go in and
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.600]  seem there was a big debate about whether he was alive or not and they do
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.760]  this a lot when famous world leaders die the Soviets would do this and these are
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.400]  communists so they act the same they would hide the fact that they'd been dead
[01:03.400 --> 01:08.840]  for a while you've also saw speculation that Castro's been dead a bunch too so it
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.800]  doesn't always mean that but I saw this last week and this week I did see it in
[01:14.800 --> 01:18.720]  foreign press that family been demanding the same others had been
[01:18.720 --> 01:22.680]  demanding the same and then it was that they couldn't cover it up anymore so
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.000]  they just suddenly announced he passed in the night no details of why and just
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.840]  the pieces I've got in the way communist operate they follow a handbook you
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.080]  have the article here out of your local paper and it's got basically the same
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.640]  stuff I've seen I'm glad you raised this so so tell folks what the article is
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.320]  about and we're gonna get it linked up on info wars dot com right now you bet
[01:46.320 --> 01:51.240]  you bet and I could not be prouder to be handed it to Alex Jones himself sir
[01:51.240 --> 01:56.320]  check this out reading into the article but the young woman has come under fire
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.840]  here too I'm in other local news I've been looking into it they had a denial of
[02:02.840 --> 02:06.600]  service attack they had a denial of service attack perpetrated on them
[02:06.600 --> 02:12.640]  like probably the same day that they tried to break this news there that
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.560]  entire news website was shut down for three days and they try another guardian
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.600]  express it seems like a pretty good publication go ahead pretty good you
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.520]  know they break some kind of juicy stuff you know I'm an info how man I'm
[02:25.520 --> 02:32.000]  gonna look true but they trace they trace the denial of service attack back
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.960]  to South Africa there is your caramelizer your your your your crystallizer
[02:37.960 --> 02:45.400]  this is probably the one of the single most cast and covered news stories ever
[02:45.400 --> 02:52.560]  now I've been digging for some reason or another right after Obama showed up
[02:52.560 --> 02:55.920]  there is when the machine will shut off now if you look in this article it says
[02:55.920 --> 03:02.600]  that the family was debating over some kind of state or something like that
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.440]  they were having a legal you know tie-up in that Mandela wasn't basically there
[03:06.440 --> 03:12.920]  to make decisions so they had to keep him alive because you can't have these
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.640]  sorts of legal proceedings over in the state and stuff if a person is dead so
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.400]  they basically been pumping air into a corpse in order to keep him alive
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.840]  so that's judicial I'm sorry oh god this sounds terrible so that the legal
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.360]  proceedings could you know continue they can continue to fight over you know
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.200]  what's going on I don't know what happened once Obama showed up okay and
[03:36.200 --> 03:39.880]  now he's been you know the are supposedly the life support's been
[03:39.880 --> 03:44.320]  turned off or whatnot me and my sister are very passionate about this kind of
[03:44.320 --> 03:50.360]  thing and she found even that they had the casket they just recently put the
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.160]  casket out in public and I will bet you every gun in my arsenal and I love my
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.360]  guns that they've got people out there walking around in empty casket I promise
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.360]  you Mandela's been dead for about six months probably and the fact that this
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.080]  site was attacked you know these globalists work you know if it whenever
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.440]  something's on the level and it's going to inform people they come out and get it
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.760]  so the denial of service of trade back to South Africa and I really just want
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.160]  to have you completely read that article I want Alex Jones do me the honor
[04:23.160 --> 04:28.420]  read that no no but I mean I remember that hearing about people saying where
[04:28.420 --> 04:31.400]  is he he's dead in the controversy in South Africa people can pull those
[04:31.400 --> 04:34.040]  articles up Watson or somebody could do an article about this so that was
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.040]  definitely a controversy and they just finally said he was dead and people will
[04:37.040 --> 04:41.080]  do this so that they can continue to operate and sign his name and do things
[04:41.080 --> 04:44.200]  I mean this this sounds like a bunch of murdering communists would operate so
[04:44.200 --> 04:47.920]  standard procedure thank you very much for reminding us of that story we'll
[04:47.920 --> 04:51.480]  look into it very very interesting all right former congressman Ron Paul's

[08:10.640 --> 08:18.240]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[08:18.240 --> 08:40.200]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:40.200 --> 08:45.560]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition we
[08:45.560 --> 08:49.080]  are now into the second hour we have a guest that we're getting hooked up on
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.880]  Skype right now who's an expert on the technotronic technocracy age of the
[08:53.880 --> 08:59.440]  government the governing system that the globalist actually describe themselves
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.280]  as being adherence of and this is the system they're trying to set up so that's
[09:03.280 --> 09:09.240]  coming up here in a few minutes first off congressman McDermott is saying he
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.720]  hasn't seen this much panic on the floor since 9 11 House Democrat compares
[09:14.720 --> 09:19.720]  congressional panic over Obamacare to worst terror attack in nations history
[09:19.720 --> 09:25.600]  well yeah that manufactured globalist event killed 3,000 people almost tragic
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.560]  and then thousands more from the deadly dust the government lied about but this
[09:29.560 --> 09:34.720]  is going to kill the economy and the engine of prosperity and kill millions
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.520]  through death panels and ration care on record I mean we knew what was in the bill
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.920]  we knew the plan and now get ready get ready to become impoverished because they
[09:46.920 --> 09:50.480]  want you impoverished under cloud and piven to give up on the free market blame
[09:50.480 --> 09:55.560]  capitalism for crony fraud capitalism that they brought in where they
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.800]  socialize our lives but then transfer the wealth to themselves so that is just
[10:01.800 --> 10:08.200]  some of the news also CBS is reporting that the TSA agent officer bled for 33
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.040]  minutes an LAX shooting airports are supposed the most secure places in the
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.640]  country except for like military bases and then this guy bled for 33 minutes
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.560]  although he got the SWAT team all suited up and ready again it's the culture of
[10:21.560 --> 10:25.640]  just worrying about their safety all day until the point is nobody's safe
[10:25.640 --> 10:31.120]  because a nanny state can do nothing but make you domesticated a nanny state
[10:31.120 --> 10:44.840]  can do nothing except basically turn you into a sheep it's so simple and then
[10:44.840 --> 10:50.520]  we've got the other news up on info wars comm and prison planet comm reports
[10:50.520 --> 10:55.560]  out Obama is an actor trained by Harry Lennox this is a big deal of this goes
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.640]  viral that Harry Lennox is saying and it's on record they were friends for
[11:00.640 --> 11:08.200]  about 17 years and that they had done work together and they go to their
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.120]  houses and now he's reportedly says Obama's horrible and as a rat that's
[11:13.120 --> 11:21.960]  another quote a rat and that Obama was trained by him to be presidential and
[11:21.960 --> 11:27.040]  then of course if you watch Harry Lennox do an interview it's Obama the same
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.840]  cadence the same voice Obama is copying Lennox or Lennox is copying Obama it's
[11:34.840 --> 11:40.280]  like the same guy and I believe Lennox over over Obama so that article and the
[11:40.280 --> 11:46.560]  source on that is up on info wars comm right now also again the Federal
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.120]  Reserve is planning to accelerate money printing congressman warns of Obama
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.840]  creating secret security force armed security force that's actually in the
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.160]  Obamacare bill and then the media is like he would never do that they've
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.880]  already set it up with mercenaries with top security clearances guarding federal
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.480]  buildings now and then the billions of bullets all the training and the rest of
[12:07.480 --> 12:13.520]  it I mean this is just simply simply amazing and then some of the other news
[12:13.520 --> 12:20.920]  countdown u.s. its debt ceiling in 84 days and again Obama said raising the
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.240]  debt does not raise the debt only not raising it that's the only thing that
[12:25.240 --> 12:33.080]  is financially irresponsible we have a bigger debt than we have yearly GDP we
[12:33.080 --> 12:37.760]  have a higher debt to savings ratio than Spain and Greece that are both
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.120]  completely bankrupt and their answer is get a steeper into debt why not the
[12:42.120 --> 12:46.360]  globalist want us impoverished and if Rand Paul wants to cut the defense
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.360]  budget he's a traitor and if Ted Cruz wants to cut some of the corporate
[12:52.360 --> 12:58.760]  welfare and entitlement welfare oh he's a horrible person you can't continue to
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.800]  do this and have a hundred and one million people on food assistance and a
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.480]  hundred plus million people on government dole there's more people on the
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.080]  dole now than in the workforce let me say that again what about the people
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.720]  going bankrupt everywhere what about the people losing their houses well the
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.160]  folks that have been not working for five ten years they go I don't care tax the
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.200]  rich it's the ultra-rich lobbying for that against the middle-class their
[13:25.200 --> 13:28.880]  historic enemy to bankrupt the country once they've done that you're all going
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.560]  to have your welfare taken away here's an article China to ease one child
[13:33.560 --> 13:40.440]  policy that's because it's caused such a problem having upwards of what is it
[13:40.440 --> 13:47.760]  60 70 more million men then they have women and it's causing all sorts of
[13:47.760 --> 13:52.800]  societal problems and India is about to outstrip them in population and they've
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.120]  ended the labor camps that's being reported by Reuters China unveils
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.240]  boldest reforms in decades shows that the new president is in command books they
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.800]  don't need labor camps anymore because they call them jobs and you go in their
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.920]  suicide nets and they force drug you and forced abortion and you're basically
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.200]  locked up at night and they just don't call it labor camps and don't worry
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.360]  China is now on the UN Human Rights Board deciding what's human rights along
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.400]  with Cuba along with Cuba it's better Saudi Arabia is probably a bigger
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.880]  tyranny than China per capital building worse is North Korea and I expect them
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.880]  to be made you know the head of the UN operation so that's just some of the
[14:38.880 --> 14:44.560]  news up on info wars.com up on prison planet.com EPA block cities from
[14:44.560 --> 14:51.680]  installing fire hydrants again the EPA shutting down over 500 power plants
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.560]  Bloomberg reports Philadelphia's 119 fire hydrants that cost about 2,000 each
[14:55.560 --> 15:01.280]  waiting in a warehouse to be installed yet they sit there in dry dock because
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.000]  federal regulators say their fittings might taint drinking water with lead.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.880]  Now the last lead smelting plant in the US it's a very important metal for a lot
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.800]  of national uses it's been shut down so you can't even get bullets but they
[15:14.800 --> 15:20.120]  allow lead in the food from China just no lead in food produced here and I'm
[15:20.120 --> 15:23.760]  talking microscopic amounts you can't have here you can just ship it in at
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.120]  thousands of times that again everything is meant to shut us down
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.960]  shut us down shut America down because remember the globalist they're all
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.440]  above the law they're all exempt this is what their neo feudalism is under a
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.480]  technological tyranny a technocracy and that leads us now to our guest will be
[15:42.480 --> 15:49.000]  with us for the balance of the hour and then the top former secret service
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.640]  agent he was the head of operations when when the president would go overseas
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.840]  Dan Bongina is gonna join us a lot of key intel at the start of the next hour
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.600]  and then we'll take phone calls last 30 minutes or so I promise but Patrick
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.400]  would I was familiar with his writings and work from news with use dot com and
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.360]  other places but I heard him for an hour on Dr. Stan Monteev a few nights ago
[16:12.360 --> 16:20.920]  and I've read the technotronic age I've read the Anglo-American establishment
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.920]  I've read Quigley's books I've read Brzezinski's books I read council on
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.080]  farm relations publications and so I knew everything was saying was accurate
[16:30.080 --> 16:33.520]  but he knew stuff I didn't know and I went looked it up and it was accurate so
[16:33.520 --> 16:39.280]  I want to get him on because he is an editor of a weekly financial analysis
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.760]  service findings and forecast he has studied elite globalization policies
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.640]  which need to do to understand economics since the late 70s when he partnered
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.720]  with the late Anthony C Sutton who was a listener and been on the show to co
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.760]  author trilaterals over Washington volumes 1 and 2 he remains a leading
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.400]  expert on the elitist trilateral Commission their policies and
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.040]  achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.080]  order he is also leading expert on historic and modern
[17:08.080 --> 17:14.360]  technocracy which plays a prominent role in current world affairs that says it
[17:14.360 --> 17:20.800]  you know lightly an economist by education a financial analyst and writer
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.360]  by profession an American constitutionalist by choice would hold a
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.720]  biblical worldview he has a deep historical insight into the modern
[17:29.720 --> 17:34.840]  attacks of sovereignty property rights and personal freedom such attacks are
[17:34.840 --> 17:41.920]  the epitome and by the implementation of UN policies such as gen 21
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.680]  sustainable development smart growth in an education the widespread adoption of
[17:45.680 --> 17:49.960]  common core 2 plus 2 equals 5 his current research builds on trilateral
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.680]  Commission hegemony involving transhumanism technocracy and more and
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.240]  how these are co-opting economics politics and religion which together
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.200]  represent the major pillars of society yes they're taking over all sciences
[18:04.200 --> 18:08.040]  philosophies and re-engineering them and I appreciate them coming on we're gonna
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.280]  skip this network break because I'm behind this is such important
[18:11.280 --> 18:14.520]  intelligence so station shouldn't be skipping this break it's a network break
[18:14.520 --> 18:21.120]  we're going to do this because it's his time is important August forecast comm is
[18:21.120 --> 18:24.920]  his site he will be here frequently there's so many amazing minds out there
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.120]  that we just you know you just you just end up forget in our rush and Anthony
[18:29.120 --> 18:33.000]  Sutton of course advised Congress discovered all the documents at the
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.360]  Ford Foundation and others with Patrick Wood it was a top congressional
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.520]  advisor on the plan to convert America to a tyranny how our government funded
[18:41.520 --> 18:46.520]  Stalin Lenin before him Hitler didn't didn't run them or control them built
[18:46.520 --> 18:51.320]  them just like Saddam and al-Qaeda and all of it and to understand the
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.080]  scientific tyranny the application of dehumanization we give you probably one
[18:56.080 --> 19:00.480]  of the greatest living experts because I went and looked into him and I'd seen
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.240]  his writings I was like I forgot about Patrick Wood why has he never been on
[19:03.240 --> 19:05.560]  the show he might have been on I might have forgot but I don't believe there
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.200]  been with us and and it's just so important a treasure trove the reason
[19:09.200 --> 19:12.680]  I'm building this up is you don't understand this is your world this is
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.560]  how it really runs these are the guys that in Congress got the documents and
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.680]  went to the Canadian archives and got the intel to put out the intel and to
[19:21.680 --> 19:27.040]  post the documents on their websites I had setting on about 17 years ago and
[19:27.040 --> 19:29.440]  I got ready to get him on a few years later and he said I'm sorry I'm too ill
[19:29.440 --> 19:32.800]  but I appreciate your work and he died like a week later I couldn't believe he
[19:32.800 --> 19:36.440]  was like on his deathbed was sending me emails back so I just really admire his
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.360]  work as well and we need to remember these men that have fought so hard Mr.
[19:40.360 --> 19:44.640]  Wood I know it's probably annoying having me gush over you but your intel is so
[19:44.640 --> 19:50.200]  vital to the preservation of human dignity well thank you Alex I appreciate
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.120]  the opportunity to to get some of this information out I've been trying hard as
[19:54.120 --> 20:00.840]  you know and I always enjoy doing radio and TV interviews whenever I can well
[20:00.840 --> 20:04.600]  let's do this let's say you're talking to a new audience if you had five minutes
[20:04.600 --> 20:08.040]  on national TV which this basically is now three million people right now
[20:08.040 --> 20:11.840]  conservatively watching and listening how would you introduce it to layman
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.440]  because my listeners are very smart very informed but they always want to give
[20:16.440 --> 20:20.400]  stuff to their family and so they want it crystallized give us the basic
[20:20.400 --> 20:23.320]  overview and then get into the nuts and bolts of
[20:23.320 --> 20:29.000]  technocracy well it's really a you know it's a complex and a deep topic but
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.520]  basically the first idea is us the problems we've been having in the last
[20:34.520 --> 20:39.440]  35 to 40 years especially have been economic and nature rather than
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.760]  political and there's a lot of emphasis in the public like in the tea parties
[20:43.760 --> 20:48.360]  and the conservative movement and even in liberal circles as well that the
[20:48.360 --> 20:54.600]  world revolves around politics that is arguing in Congress and you know fighting
[20:54.600 --> 20:59.640]  with the executive branch and so on and my studies on the trilateral commission
[20:59.640 --> 21:05.880]  have pretty much pointed out what I think with great detail that the takeover
[21:05.880 --> 21:09.880]  of America has been economic in nature and that was the nature originally of
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.720]  the trilateral commission that was formed in 1973 by David Rockefeller and
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.440]  Zabigniew Brzezinski they they said frequently that they were going to
[21:19.440 --> 21:24.480]  create a new international economic order that they used up in every one of
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.680]  their early publications we didn't really know at the time exactly what that
[21:29.680 --> 21:34.240]  would look like but we had a pretty good idea for meeting the policies and they
[21:34.240 --> 21:40.720]  have managed over a period of now since 1973 some 35 plus years to create this
[21:40.720 --> 21:44.320]  new international economic order and if we look around this is what we see today
[21:44.320 --> 21:48.800]  Alex this is what's important to realize back then people criticized us for
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.360]  being conspiracy nuts today we have the force of history behind us which after
[21:54.360 --> 21:59.280]  25-year period of course becomes history we can now look back at history and see
[21:59.280 --> 22:03.440]  that what we said and said in the 1970s was exactly right this is exactly what
[22:03.440 --> 22:08.800]  they've done we know that the world system today is broken almost beyond
[22:08.800 --> 22:14.680]  repair and we have to put we have to put the finger where the finger belongs and
[22:14.680 --> 22:20.960]  it belongs with these this very small elite group of internationalists that
[22:20.960 --> 22:24.920]  were represented by the members of the trial out of commission back in 1973 and
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.840]  ever since I might add and they have influenced our government our executive
[22:29.840 --> 22:35.800]  branch of our government especially they have influenced our government to an
[22:35.800 --> 22:40.320]  extreme that has literally excluded the American people all together we have no
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.400]  control over Congress anymore see it appears and the executive branch is
[22:45.400 --> 22:50.320]  just going to do what it wants to do so there's been a fundamental change in the
[22:50.320 --> 22:55.560]  political system on our country for sure but the political system was really
[22:55.560 --> 23:02.680]  just useful idiots for this elite group of economy changers if you will they
[23:02.680 --> 23:07.800]  had to use the political system to get what they wanted to do economically
[23:07.800 --> 23:13.560]  over these last years and so we see we see things like the North American
[23:13.560 --> 23:18.840]  free trade agreement NAFTA CAFTA we say that we see the trans-pacific
[23:18.840 --> 23:24.200]  partnership being negotiated right now that that is hopefully not going to get
[23:24.200 --> 23:27.640]  put through on fast track but the administration is trying to get fast
[23:27.640 --> 23:35.440]  track authority established again so you know this this hagenemy has has
[23:35.440 --> 23:43.920]  continued from 1973 to the day hasn't led up nobody has identified these people
[23:43.920 --> 23:49.080]  behind the scenes nobody has even politicians will not read write about
[23:49.080 --> 23:52.660]  them or speak about them in fact I think the only living
[23:52.660 --> 23:56.600]  politician or politician living or dead that I know that ever talked about the
[23:56.600 --> 24:01.520]  trial at our commission was Barry Goldwater when he wrote his memoirs
[24:01.520 --> 24:08.360]  with no apology back in 1979 so this group has not talked about these people
[24:08.360 --> 24:14.080]  not talked about we've been writing about them since 19 well 1977 really and
[24:14.080 --> 24:18.400]  nothing has changed that you know they're doing the same thing today they
[24:18.400 --> 24:22.960]  did back then I don't know how it's like a summarized in a very short pretty
[24:22.960 --> 24:27.080]  time Alex well you've done a great job in fact I'm gonna pull up the Barry
[24:27.080 --> 24:31.440]  Goldwater quote with no apologies where he describes how it's an economic
[24:31.440 --> 24:36.360]  takeover we're designed to fight a Stalin a Hitler a Mal we see a foreign
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.440]  enemy but when it's corporate and regulatory and incremental and it
[24:40.440 --> 24:43.880]  creates a global group of less than a hundred corporations and Rockefeller's
[24:43.880 --> 24:49.080]  own words he was written New York Times articles bragging about it how they
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.120]  want centralized control and how they divide up the world US based companies
[24:54.120 --> 24:59.840]  get the toll roads in Spain Spain gets the toll roads over here it's where they
[24:59.840 --> 25:05.320]  divide up the world amongst themselves and then bring in a technocracy to be
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.280]  able to control the population scientifically where it's impossible to
[25:10.280 --> 25:13.160]  ever get out of it or even know what you're in and you dumb down the
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.000]  population so I want to walk down walk through what technocracy and the
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.520]  technotronic age is what they're doing with it because I mean as best I
[25:20.520 --> 25:28.840]  understand it it is the it is the Cecil Rhodes plan of 1900 and the
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.840]  British royalty and their empire that was in trouble they said we'll go
[25:32.840 --> 25:37.520]  corporate take down our flag but use corporate energy to still control these
[25:37.520 --> 25:41.960]  holdings that we once had like India and other places and at the same time
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.520]  we'll export this corporate plan and and and team up with other robber barons in
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.320]  the United States and Europe that's what Bilderberg later became but their
[25:50.320 --> 25:57.080]  philosophy comes out of eugenics and Malthus and Galton and so it's basically
[25:57.080 --> 26:02.200]  eugenics scientifically deployed through a world government corporate
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.440]  system so it's very hard to fight I want to get your take on that in a moment but
[26:06.440 --> 26:11.320]  we did find the quote from no apologies with Barry Goldwater he says quote the
[26:11.320 --> 26:16.040]  trilateral Commission is an international is international again the
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.640]  trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.360]  multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.120]  seizing control of the political government of the United States the
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.240]  trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control
[26:32.240 --> 26:37.040]  and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.040]  and ecclesiastical the churches from no apologies now let me break this down for
[26:42.040 --> 26:48.480]  folks and give you the floor America was pretty much the sole superpower by the
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.040]  end of World War two so the globalists had to create a fake bipolar world by
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.640]  giving weapons to the Soviets to then build them up to let us become a tyranny
[26:57.640 --> 27:03.040]  and then share in a backdoor globalist deal taking over different areas of the
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.680]  world in the name of fighting each other in full spectrum dominance then they
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.720]  ended that farce and then moved on to the new al-qaeda threat which they
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.680]  actually ran to use that to take our liberty so I'm basically describing the
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.040]  main trait of technocracy is that it's totally amoral except for the eugenics
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.360]  based system that it doesn't even it uses everything as Carol quickly said
[27:25.360 --> 27:30.160]  socialism fascism communism as long as it's command and control go ahead sir
[27:30.160 --> 27:37.440]  well the book the book brave new world by Aldous Huxley we refer to it in pretty
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.680]  much everywhere people talk about oh it's a brave new world that book was
[27:41.680 --> 27:48.040]  written in 1932 Alex and it was written by Aldous Huxley looking straight into
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.160]  the face of tech of technocracy that was a big movement back then I didn't
[27:53.160 --> 27:58.520]  discover the technocracy movement from the 1930s until a few years ago and
[27:58.520 --> 28:03.240]  when I did it picked my interest so much I had to investigate and just you know
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.720]  go crazy looking for information to try and find out what they're all about it
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.480]  was a it was a huge movement back in those days had a big popularity a large
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.720]  popularity in Canada and especially in the west although it did pretty well the
[28:17.720 --> 28:24.200]  years as well but these these technocrats specified very carefully what they
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.360]  would do if they could replace capitalism they believed in the Great
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.600]  Depression that capitalism was dead unemployment lines were you know wrapping
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.400]  around blocks soup kitchens were you know for just serving people all day long
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.000]  and they believed that the that they could provide an economic system that
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.720]  would be better than capitalism it didn't get very far it kind of died out as a
[28:46.720 --> 28:54.800]  movement around 1938 to 40 but today it's had a resurgence if you will sure
[28:54.800 --> 28:58.600]  it's been adopted as the globalist management program it has now been
[28:58.600 --> 29:01.640]  adopted by the globalist management program and the reason I say this is
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.440]  important when we follow the money back in the 1930s the Rockefeller Carnegie
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.840]  crowd were dumping buckets of money onto the eugenics movement this is well
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.320]  known well documented they did not dump any money on the technocracy movement
[29:16.320 --> 29:20.640]  back down and so the technocracy movement kind of withered and died after a
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.720]  period of time however when Zbigniew Brzezinski resuscitated those ideas in
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.360]  1970 with his book called between two ages America's role in the
[29:31.360 --> 29:37.080]  technophonic era that apparently caught Rockefeller's eye that's right
[29:37.080 --> 29:41.440]  Patrick Woods stay there will explain who David Rockefeller is Zbigniew
[29:41.440 --> 29:47.080]  Brzezinski and more these two men you can say more than anybody now literally
[29:47.080 --> 29:54.080]  govern our civilization we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on

[34:13.960 --> 34:21.960]  The sound machines in your smile To the quiz I could be alive
[34:21.960 --> 34:28.960]  Just need a hold of your eyes
[34:51.960 --> 35:06.960]  Let you know that I'm out here constantly doing my research and studying.
[35:06.960 --> 35:15.960]  At first when I first heard about you, I'm a first-time caller, but I heard about you about a year ago from a friend of mine.
[35:15.960 --> 35:22.960]  I decided to check you out. I had been growing up on a little bit of Rush Limbaugh, a little bit of Glimbeck, and others.
[35:22.960 --> 35:29.960]  It was a savage nation, but I listened to your show. I'm a truck driver. I drive up and down these highways.
[35:29.960 --> 35:34.960]  I do in-house delivery out of High Point, North Carolina.
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.960]  I just wanted to let you know, man, that I'm out here. I'll let these customers know about you.
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.960]  I've done my research outside of God. I believe in you, brother. I believe in your cause.
[35:45.960 --> 35:51.960]  I believed it for 10 years myself before I found you, which is kind of like a blessing in my life,
[35:51.960 --> 35:55.960]  because you opened up a whole new perspective on things that I had overlooked,
[35:55.960 --> 36:01.960]  because I was also dumbed down with this mainstream media and society.
[36:01.960 --> 36:08.960]  After opening up everything and kind of just revealing your Pandora's box and what was going on, I see it was the truth.
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.960]  I think the hardest thing for me is trying to go to my family members.
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.960]  God, it seems like they're the ones that don't want to believe in it.
[36:17.960 --> 36:23.960]  Oh, listen, brother, I know the feeling. I'll be around family members and people that aren't really listeners,
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.960]  and they're nice folks and they're somewhat awake compared to the average person,
[36:27.960 --> 36:34.960]  but you almost feel like you're doing bad things to tell them about bad stuff that's happening.
[36:34.960 --> 36:37.960]  It's almost like impolite, but we don't have a future if we don't.
[36:37.960 --> 36:41.960]  We owe it to them to admit just how bad things are,
[36:41.960 --> 36:48.960]  because, again, as good people or as just folks that aren't overtly evil, none of us are perfect,
[36:48.960 --> 36:56.960]  we are blind to just how bad, bad people are and that it's limitless what they'll do.
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.960]  So I totally understand what you're saying and what you're getting at,
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.960]  and that's why I personally, I don't really beat family over the head with this info
[37:05.960 --> 37:08.960]  because they don't already know what's going on.
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.960]  I reach out to folks just randomly everywhere and tell them what's happening,
[37:12.960 --> 37:15.960]  and it's certainly working. There is an undoubted awakening happening,
[37:15.960 --> 37:18.960]  and Ron Paul concurred, I think, for the first time ever.
[37:18.960 --> 37:21.960]  He said we're getting close to a turning the tide or close to a tipping point.
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.960]  He now thinks we're right there, and I agree with Dr. Paul who's a pretty smart cookie.
[37:26.960 --> 37:28.960]  So what else do you want to throw out there, Jody?
[37:28.960 --> 37:34.960]  I appreciate you promoting the show to folks, because that's how we're going to expose these people.
[37:34.960 --> 37:36.960]  Absolutely, sir. I agree 100%.
[37:36.960 --> 37:40.960]  I just want to let you know also that I go to customers' homes every day.
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.960]  I deal with 40, 50 customers every trip.
[37:44.960 --> 37:48.960]  I'm all over this country, all 48 states, so I get to see a lot of these things
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.960]  you're talking about as I'm doing my travels here.
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.960]  And I have noticed how things are changing.
[37:55.960 --> 37:58.960]  I've been looking out for the armored vehicles, the things like that,
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.960]  the Sheriff's Department and things I go through Dallas.
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.960]  I lived in Dallas for three years, and I love Texas.
[38:04.960 --> 38:07.960]  If I ever retire, tell my wife that's where I want to live at.
[38:07.960 --> 38:11.960]  Would love to live right next door to you, and you're like my biggest hero.
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.960]  But anyway, outside of that stuff, I just want to say,
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.960]  maybe you could tell me how I could convince my wife who's an intelligent woman,
[38:22.960 --> 38:26.960]  4.0 GPA graduated, high honors.
[38:26.960 --> 38:31.960]  In the medical field, I do science research study on like the first stage one,
[38:31.960 --> 38:32.960]  and phase one of...
[38:32.960 --> 38:34.960]  No, I get it. She's a smart lady.
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.960]  What should I convince her of?
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.960]  Well, I just wanted to know if you had 30 seconds to tell my wife,
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.960]  or to try to convince my wife of what's going on in our country today,
[38:46.960 --> 38:51.960]  and to really wake up and be a part of my team and the info war team,
[38:51.960 --> 38:55.960]  the team is driving for the truth in the right direction, what would you say?
[38:55.960 --> 38:57.960]  All right, well, I appreciate your call.
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.960]  Let me just say this to your wife, Jody. Thank you, Jody.
[39:00.960 --> 39:06.960]  I can't make her do research on the topics we're covering,
[39:06.960 --> 39:09.960]  and I notice a lot of professionals that are really smart
[39:09.960 --> 39:12.960]  are some of the hardest people to wake up to this because
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.960]  they know there's problems in society, but they see it as almost positive
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.960]  that they overlook all that and just move forward and take care of business,
[39:21.960 --> 39:23.960]  as Elvis Presley would say.
[39:23.960 --> 39:25.960]  And you certainly have to take care of business,
[39:25.960 --> 39:29.960]  and you can't let all this tyranny get you down and stop you from living a life.
[39:29.960 --> 39:32.960]  But you've got to understand historically,
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.960]  when corruption builds to this level, it brings down civilizations and horrible tragedies happen,
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.960]  and tyranny is a norm in history, not an exception,
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.960]  and we've got a really bad batch of tyranny cooking up in the kitchen,
[39:46.960 --> 39:48.960]  and it needs to be thrown out.
[39:48.960 --> 39:55.960]  And so I understand statistically that husbands and wives don't listen to each other
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.960]  as much as they'd listen to a random salesman at the door.
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.960]  And so I guess I'm a random salesman at the door selling freedom.
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.960]  And I would just say to Jody's wife that there's so much admitted evil
[40:11.960 --> 40:14.960]  by the criminals that hide in government and major corporations
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.960]  that if I tried to just list a few things, it would make my head spin.
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.960]  I mean, there's thousands of declassified, and I use this a lot because everybody knows this,
[40:23.960 --> 40:28.960]  lethal studies that were killing people carried out by our government
[40:28.960 --> 40:32.960]  right through the last decade from the 30s.
[40:32.960 --> 40:35.960]  And no one ever got in trouble for any of it.
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.960]  And that's because there's a eugenicist-based power structure hiding within western governments.
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.960]  Hitler was only one eruption of that that went too far for even the establishment.
[40:47.960 --> 40:53.960]  And so I understand that this stuff's scary and it's easy to just deny it,
[40:53.960 --> 41:01.960]  but I'll assure you that it is real and that I am actually wrong about a lot of this.
[41:01.960 --> 41:03.960]  It's worse than I normally have thought.
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.960]  So it's not that I'm exaggerating. It's the other way around.
[41:09.960 --> 41:13.960]  And I wish every day I was wrong, ma'am.
[41:13.960 --> 41:15.960]  I wish every day this wasn't true.
[41:15.960 --> 41:19.960]  But I have the textbooks. I have the documents.
[41:19.960 --> 41:23.960]  I keep plugging this every day just because it's been on my desk the last few months.
[41:23.960 --> 41:24.960]  I need to put it back on the bookshelf.
[41:24.960 --> 41:26.960]  EcoScience, it's free online.
[41:26.960 --> 41:32.960]  It's been scanned online about how they put stuff in the water to reduce our IQ and sterilizes.
[41:32.960 --> 41:35.960]  The White House regulations are currently talks about, you know,
[41:35.960 --> 41:38.960]  dumbing us down and breaking us up and having us fight with each other.
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.960]  I mean, these are social engineers.
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.960]  And you ignore all of this at your own peril.
[41:46.960 --> 41:54.960]  Dan Bongino, the Secret Service agent, senior agent over Obama's foreign trips,
[41:54.960 --> 41:57.960]  basically has said it's worse than anyone knows.
[41:57.960 --> 42:00.960]  He had to sign agreements not to talk about it, obviously.
[42:00.960 --> 42:06.960]  And it is, last night, I talked to a Secret Service connection.
[42:06.960 --> 42:08.960]  It doesn't matter.
[42:08.960 --> 42:10.960]  See, I don't even want to get into this.
[42:10.960 --> 42:12.960]  It's just so crazy.
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.960]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[42:16.960 --> 42:19.960]  There's a cult stuff going on.
[42:19.960 --> 42:20.960]  And we're in trouble.
[42:20.960 --> 42:22.960]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.960]  And, ma'am, I know you probably feel like, well, what can you do about it?
[42:26.960 --> 42:28.960]  So why not just deny it?
[42:28.960 --> 42:30.960]  And so fine, just deny it.
[42:30.960 --> 42:34.960]  But down the road, when things get so bad you can't deny it anymore,
[42:34.960 --> 42:37.960]  and then at least get your heart right with God.
[42:37.960 --> 42:39.960]  And I said, I take a lot of calls.
[42:39.960 --> 42:42.960]  I just spent six, seven minutes on that one subject.
[42:42.960 --> 42:43.960]  Or longer.
[42:43.960 --> 42:45.960]  Let's go to Wesley real fast in Mississippi.
[42:45.960 --> 42:46.960]  Go ahead.
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.960]  Hey, Alex, I want to say that the new coffee and the nascent iodine are amazing.
[42:51.960 --> 42:52.960]  I love the coffee.
[42:52.960 --> 42:54.960]  I should take this home right now.
[42:54.960 --> 42:57.960]  And if your wife doesn't believe this stuff,
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.960]  it's because she hasn't taken the time to look into this stuff.
[43:00.960 --> 43:03.960]  That's the only way you can come to that conclusion.
[43:03.960 --> 43:05.960]  30 minutes to look into this stuff.
[43:05.960 --> 43:06.960]  Research new order.
[43:06.960 --> 43:07.960]  Research Illuminati.
[43:07.960 --> 43:09.960]  Research all this conspiracy.
[43:09.960 --> 43:12.960]  And there's no way you can come away from it without realizing it's the truth.
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.960]  And I want to commend you, Alex, because there's so many Christians that are blind to this evil.
[43:17.960 --> 43:20.960]  And yeah, I know you don't like to accept the praise and everything,
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.960]  but at least, I mean, I'm surprised that you mentioned stuff like the Nephilim
[43:24.960 --> 43:27.960]  and the Book of Enoch and this stuff, because that's what this stuff is.
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.960]  That's what Kurzweil and Hugo Degueres,
[43:31.960 --> 43:34.960]  that's what they're all talking about when they're talking about hybridization
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.960]  and transhumanism and the singularity they're all trying to come to.
[43:38.960 --> 43:42.960]  They're talking about the same stuff that happened in the days of Noah.
[43:42.960 --> 43:45.960]  It's actually what it is, because that's what Jesus said.
[43:45.960 --> 43:48.960]  The days of Noah, that's what it's going to be like when the end times come
[43:48.960 --> 43:51.960]  and history term will be like it was in the days of Noah.
[43:51.960 --> 43:52.960]  What was going on in the days of Noah?
[43:52.960 --> 43:55.960]  Well, the sons of God were coming down and having sex
[43:55.960 --> 44:00.960]  or genetically modifying human beings to create giants,
[44:00.960 --> 44:02.960]  which no church will ever talk about the giants.
[44:02.960 --> 44:05.960]  No church ever explains why Goliath was, you know,
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.960]  of not being tall while Agaba Shrine was 18-foot feet tall on Amos.
[44:10.960 --> 44:13.960]  They say the Amorites were, you know, the tall...
[44:13.960 --> 44:15.960]  No, I know, and that's actually what they all...
[44:15.960 --> 44:17.960]  But the occultists now, even mainline literature,
[44:17.960 --> 44:20.960]  believes the Anunnaki, all this, if I don't get into it,
[44:20.960 --> 44:22.960]  but the elite, and I don't cover stuff I can't prove,
[44:22.960 --> 44:24.960]  but you see the movie Prometheus?
[44:24.960 --> 44:27.960]  That's an Anunnaki, nine-foot tall guy.
[44:27.960 --> 44:30.960]  That's what they're telling us we came from.
[44:30.960 --> 44:33.960]  And the Bible says, no, that's who came here to manipulate us,
[44:33.960 --> 44:36.960]  and that's basically, you know, the fallen angels.
[44:36.960 --> 44:38.960]  And I don't get into all that because the media picks up on it.
[44:38.960 --> 44:39.960]  I just cover...
[44:39.960 --> 44:41.960]  You look at why they're doing all this engineering,
[44:41.960 --> 44:43.960]  why they're think they're God.
[44:43.960 --> 44:47.960]  The elite are into this themselves.
[44:47.960 --> 44:49.960]  What's that term that they say we were seeded by aliens
[44:49.960 --> 44:53.960]  that's like Harvard even believes in MIT and Transpermia?
[44:53.960 --> 44:56.960]  What's that term? What is it?
[44:56.960 --> 44:59.960]  Transpermia, yeah, that's in the piece I did with Aaron Dykes.
[44:59.960 --> 45:02.960]  It's excellent on Secrets of Prometheus leaked.
[45:02.960 --> 45:04.960]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[45:04.960 --> 45:07.960]  And again, whether that's real or not, that's what they think, okay?
[45:07.960 --> 45:09.960]  Sculling bones, all of it.
[45:09.960 --> 45:11.960]  And they think they're in touch with these entities.
[45:11.960 --> 45:14.960]  That's what demon conjuring and all that stuff is, folks,
[45:14.960 --> 45:16.960]  that every culture gets into.
[45:16.960 --> 45:18.960]  And the demons say, take your kid up on a pyramid
[45:18.960 --> 45:20.960]  and chop their heart out.
[45:20.960 --> 45:22.960]  Every culture went to kill their kids,
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.960]  so these creatures would give them power.
[45:24.960 --> 45:26.960]  I don't know if that's real or not,
[45:26.960 --> 45:29.960]  but as a sociologist, as an anthropologist,
[45:29.960 --> 45:32.960]  as an archaeologist, as a lay researcher,
[45:32.960 --> 45:35.960]  I look at this and go, why does every culture do this?
[45:35.960 --> 45:37.960]  Well, they tell you why in the movie Prometheus,
[45:37.960 --> 45:43.960]  which is a religious tract promoting by the transhumanists
[45:43.960 --> 45:45.960]  that of course they don't think it's evolution
[45:45.960 --> 45:51.960]  and all this Darwin stuff, that we came from this.
[45:51.960 --> 45:55.960]  And then some bad gods were going to come back
[45:55.960 --> 45:57.960]  and destroy the earth because they'd mixed their genetics
[45:57.960 --> 45:59.960]  with us and they didn't like that,
[45:59.960 --> 46:01.960]  but the good aliens stopped it all.
[46:01.960 --> 46:03.960]  I mean, they're just telling you the story of the devil
[46:03.960 --> 46:06.960]  and the snake and all of it in that movie.
[46:06.960 --> 46:08.960]  Super heavy, folks.
[46:08.960 --> 46:10.960]  Super heavy.
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.960]  I don't know if any of this is real.
[46:12.960 --> 46:14.960]  I know the Federal Reserve's private
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.960]  and they tell me it's governmental.
[46:17.960 --> 46:19.960]  By the way, he mentioned it.
[46:19.960 --> 46:22.960]  I've got to fund my operation.
[46:22.960 --> 46:23.960]  I need fuel.
[46:23.960 --> 46:25.960]  It's expensive to build an operation like this
[46:25.960 --> 46:27.960]  and we need capital in case we get sued
[46:27.960 --> 46:29.960]  or attacked to defend ourselves.
[46:29.960 --> 46:31.960]  And you've done that so we can expand in the face
[46:31.960 --> 46:33.960]  of the New World Order, fearlessly.
[46:33.960 --> 46:35.960]  Thank you for your prayers.
[46:35.960 --> 46:37.960]  My favorite brand of coffee took me years to find out
[46:37.960 --> 46:39.960]  how to get it directly from the farmers.
[46:39.960 --> 46:40.960]  We put it out.
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.960]  Everybody that tries it loves it.
[46:42.960 --> 46:46.960]  It's a medium roast, high mountain,
[46:46.960 --> 46:49.960]  shade-grown, and it's even better than Guatemalan.
[46:49.960 --> 46:50.960]  Guatemalan is my favorite.
[46:50.960 --> 46:52.960]  You go over the board of the Mexicans, even better.
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.960]  They think because the soils aren't played out
[46:54.960 --> 46:57.960]  and it's grown totally organically.
[46:57.960 --> 47:00.960]  Infowarslife.com for our two different Patriot blends,
[47:00.960 --> 47:03.960]  including the one with mushrooms for immune boost.
[47:03.960 --> 47:05.960]  It's very fairly priced for a pound of this,
[47:05.960 --> 47:08.960]  lightly or medium roast coffee.
[47:08.960 --> 47:10.960]  We've got it without the mushrooms and with the mushrooms.
[47:10.960 --> 47:12.960]  It's excellent.
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.960]  Most of the coffee gives me headaches or heartburn.
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.960]  That's the reason I like this.
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.960]  It doesn't give me headaches or heartburn.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.960]  I don't know why it's my favorite coffee.
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.960]  I never thought about putting out coffee until my wife,
[47:22.960 --> 47:24.960]  like five years ago, said you should put up
[47:24.960 --> 47:26.960]  Wake Up America coffee and say Jones for it.
[47:26.960 --> 47:30.960]  And then I actually tracked down how to get it and did it.
[47:30.960 --> 47:32.960]  That helps support our operation.
[47:32.960 --> 47:35.960]  The Survival Shield Nation Iodine,
[47:35.960 --> 47:37.960]  we have plenty of that in supply.
[47:37.960 --> 47:39.960]  And you can give it as gifts to your family
[47:39.960 --> 47:42.960]  for detoxifying and protecting from the radiation
[47:42.960 --> 47:45.960]  that goes into the thyroid with all this Fukushima garbage.
[47:45.960 --> 47:46.960]  It's more important than ever,
[47:46.960 --> 47:48.960]  and it just really gives me a brain boost,
[47:48.960 --> 47:50.960]  which is what Dr. Grip said it would do.
[47:50.960 --> 47:52.960]  We have Maiden1776.com.
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.960]  It's also on Infowarsstore.com
[47:54.960 --> 47:56.960]  with the new limited edition George Washington.
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.960]  The answer to 1984, 1776 bronze and nickel belt buckles
[48:01.960 --> 48:04.960]  that are custom one through 500, and that's it.
[48:04.960 --> 48:07.960]  We've got the Maiden America T-shirts with Liberty messages.
[48:07.960 --> 48:09.960]  This is just the introductory round of this
[48:09.960 --> 48:12.960]  at Maiden1776.com.
[48:12.960 --> 48:15.960]  That just takes you right to the page on the shopping cart
[48:15.960 --> 48:17.960]  that has it, and that's how we fund our operation.
[48:17.960 --> 48:19.960]  And you can still give it as Christmas gifts.
[48:19.960 --> 48:21.960]  Last year we had to have the orders in by the 17th
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.960]  to guarantee delivery in the U.S.
[48:23.960 --> 48:25.960]  It's by the 19th this year.
[48:25.960 --> 48:27.960]  You'll get it before Christmas, the day before Christmas.
[48:27.960 --> 48:29.960]  I recommend you order now, though,
[48:29.960 --> 48:30.960]  to make sure you get it all earlier.
[48:30.960 --> 48:33.960]  The apparel, the ball caps, all of it.
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.960]  Everything at Maiden1776.com is Maiden America.
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.960]  Some of the other stuff's made in South America
[48:39.960 --> 48:41.960]  and, you know, everywhere else.
[48:41.960 --> 48:43.960]  I'm not against giving those folks jobs
[48:43.960 --> 48:44.960]  where they have it set up.
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.960]  They can never get out of poverty yet.
[48:45.960 --> 48:47.960]  So we're moving towards Maiden America.
[48:47.960 --> 48:50.960]  Everything at Maiden1776.com is Maiden America.
[48:50.960 --> 48:52.960]  We got golf shirts, you name it.
[48:52.960 --> 48:54.960]  I mean, we're talking about shirts costing me.
[48:54.960 --> 48:55.960]  I was corrected.
[48:55.960 --> 48:57.960]  $13 to $15 for some of these shirts
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.960]  that we sell for $24.95.
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.960]  At a store like Dillard, you'd pay $100
[49:02.960 --> 49:03.960]  for a golf shirt like this.
[49:03.960 --> 49:07.960]  So it's premium, designer, Maiden America,
[49:07.960 --> 49:11.960]  golf shirts, you name it, for $24.95.
[49:11.960 --> 49:14.960]  You absolutely cannot beat that deal.
[49:14.960 --> 49:18.960]  There, scroll down and I'll show them.
[49:18.960 --> 49:20.960]  By the way, I listed the price on these.
[49:20.960 --> 49:21.960]  I want to lower the price on those ball caps.
[49:21.960 --> 49:23.960]  I didn't see that they were that much.
[49:23.960 --> 49:26.960]  I want to find out how much to scroll down.
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.960]  All right, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:28.960 --> 49:30.960]  I see some of the prices on there.
[49:30.960 --> 49:32.960]  I'm going to lower some of the prices on those
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.960]  shirts right after the show, because that's not exactly.
[49:34.960 --> 49:36.960]  I get so busy and I run everything around here
[49:36.960 --> 49:37.960]  that I can't make all the decisions.
[49:37.960 --> 49:40.960]  Everybody does a great job, but I'm going to have the prices
[49:40.960 --> 49:42.960]  on some of those shirts lowered.
[49:42.960 --> 49:44.960]  But they're not even that much compared to what designer stuff is.
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.960]  In fact, they're about half off even at the price they are now.
[49:46.960 --> 49:48.960]  But my main mission of putting this down
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.960]  is to take back the culture, too.
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.960]  I'm seeing so many pro-gun T-shirts around Austin,
[49:53.960 --> 49:55.960]  including our T-shirts.
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.960]  I went to a Megadeth concert, an Iron Maiden concert
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.960]  a few months ago, and literally, I don't know,
[50:03.960 --> 50:05.960]  50 to 100 M4s T-shirts.
[50:05.960 --> 50:06.960]  But that wasn't it.
[50:06.960 --> 50:07.960]  That's not why I got excited.
[50:07.960 --> 50:11.960]  I saw all these other come and take it in Latin,
[50:11.960 --> 50:13.960]  Bola and Lobby shirts.
[50:13.960 --> 50:15.960]  We're going to come out with a bunch of those.
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.960]  Under the 1776, Made in 1776 brand.
[50:19.960 --> 50:21.960]  I just saw Patriot stuff everywhere,
[50:21.960 --> 50:23.960]  and now I go to other cities and see it.
[50:23.960 --> 50:26.960]  We are really a giant minority that's growing
[50:26.960 --> 50:28.960]  towards being a majority.
[50:28.960 --> 50:30.960]  I don't care whether you're black or white, old or young.
[50:30.960 --> 50:33.960]  I really like it when I see you wearing a Mola and Lobby shirt.
[50:33.960 --> 50:35.960]  I identify with you.
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.960]  We're on the same page.
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.960]  We are in the same tribe of liberty.
[50:39.960 --> 50:42.960]  Since you see that's the secret to beating the globalists.
[50:42.960 --> 50:45.960]  They want a fake collectivism of race or all this stuff.
[50:45.960 --> 50:48.960]  How about an individual collectivism of individuals
[50:48.960 --> 50:50.960]  coming together for liberty?
[50:50.960 --> 50:52.960]  And so that's what this is all about.

[50:57.960 --> 51:00.960]  We'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls

[51:40.960 --> 51:43.960]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.960]  Let's take a stand against the globalists
[51:45.960 --> 51:47.960]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[53:27.960 --> 53:31.960]  At TheUltimateKnife.com
[53:57.960 --> 54:00.960]  At SilverLungs.com
[54:28.960 --> 54:31.960]  We add it to jet fuel,
[54:31.960 --> 54:33.960]  barium, salt, limb to oxide
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.960]  to put up sunscreen to protect us from global warming.
[54:36.960 --> 54:37.960]  You can look that up.
[54:37.960 --> 54:40.960]  Textbooks teach kids about chemtrailing.
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.960]  So there's a giant.
[54:42.960 --> 54:43.960]  Last time I checked,
[54:43.960 --> 54:44.960]  $5 billion a year,
[54:44.960 --> 54:47.960]  just Department of Energy with one group.
[54:47.960 --> 54:49.960]  And then look, Stephen Colbert,
[54:49.960 --> 54:51.960]  Colbert government likely covering up
[54:51.960 --> 54:53.960]  chemtrail conspiracy.
[54:53.960 --> 54:55.960]  So they have an expert on their quote
[54:55.960 --> 54:57.960]  and we need the geoengineer to save the earth
[54:57.960 --> 55:00.960]  because of climate change.
[55:00.960 --> 55:02.960]  And then Colbert goes,
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.960]  what if the government is already doing this
[55:04.960 --> 55:05.960]  and not telling us about it?
[55:05.960 --> 55:08.960]  But still, it's all in the context of a joke.
[55:08.960 --> 55:10.960]  It's like, oh, what if the NSA's
[55:10.960 --> 55:12.960]  really spying on us 15 years ago?
[55:12.960 --> 55:14.960]  And I'm like, here's the documents.
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.960]  Oh, shut up.
[55:16.960 --> 55:19.960]  I mean, it's absolute.
[55:19.960 --> 55:21.960]  But people go, I don't see any documents on
[55:21.960 --> 55:23.960]  chemtrails because they're not called chemtrails.
[55:23.960 --> 55:25.960]  It's called geoengineering programs.
[55:25.960 --> 55:27.960]  High altitude aerosol programs,
[55:27.960 --> 55:28.960]  stuff like that.
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.960]  You type that in, you'll get it all.
[55:30.960 --> 55:32.960]  Patents, how they do it, where they're doing it.
[55:32.960 --> 55:34.960]  And then all these cooks point up
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.960]  at regular condensation trails and go,
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.960]  look, that's it.
[55:38.960 --> 55:40.960]  So there's also disinfo on the other side,
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.960]  but it's going on, boys and girls.
[55:44.960 --> 55:45.960]  When I was a kid,
[55:45.960 --> 55:47.960]  condensation trails went away in seconds or minutes.
[55:47.960 --> 55:48.960]  They didn't stay there for hours
[55:48.960 --> 55:49.960]  and here in the sky gray.
[55:49.960 --> 55:50.960]  Look at this.
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.960]  And it goes on.
[55:51.960 --> 55:53.960]  The video is up on infowars.com.
[55:53.960 --> 55:55.960]  We'll probably cover this on the nightly news tonight.
[55:55.960 --> 55:57.960]  It's pretty darn important.
[55:57.960 --> 56:00.960]  That's an infowars.com story up there,
[56:00.960 --> 56:03.960]  breaking all of that down.
[56:03.960 --> 56:04.960]  And some of the other news,
[56:04.960 --> 56:07.960]  Rahm Emanuel to fast 24 hours in support
[56:07.960 --> 56:09.960]  of immigration reform.
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  They mean totally bringing in unlimited numbers
[56:11.960 --> 56:14.960]  of people to vote, to take all of our money
[56:14.960 --> 56:16.960]  and take all of our guns and enslave us.
[56:16.960 --> 56:17.960]  That is the public plan.
[56:17.960 --> 56:19.960]  Rahm Emanuel who's,
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.960]  I don't think it's the Israelis folks,
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.960]  but I mean, he was in the Israeli military.
[56:23.960 --> 56:25.960]  He is an Israeli first year,
[56:25.960 --> 56:27.960]  just like the new Fed head they want.
[56:27.960 --> 56:29.960]  And it's like having this French communist
[56:29.960 --> 56:31.960]  as the head economist for Obama.
[56:31.960 --> 56:33.960]  I mean, our country is just over,
[56:33.960 --> 56:35.960]  half the news anchors are from England
[56:35.960 --> 56:37.960]  and they're just getting as used to nothing
[56:37.960 --> 56:39.960]  but foreigners running our lives.
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.960]  And I mean, Rahm Emanuel is a Chicago mob boss pig.
[56:43.960 --> 56:46.960]  He is a big, disgusting piece of trash.
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.960]  And I'm so sick of him.
[56:48.960 --> 56:51.960]  He's just a miscreant trash bag
[56:51.960 --> 56:54.960]  who wants our guns while he's got bodyguards
[56:54.960 --> 56:55.960]  and I'm sick of it.
[56:55.960 --> 56:57.960]  Jim in Bulgaria.
[56:57.960 --> 56:58.960]  I didn't see that call.
[56:58.960 --> 56:59.960]  Thanks for holding.
[56:59.960 --> 57:00.960]  Sorry, Jim, to make you hold.
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.960]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[57:02.960 --> 57:03.960]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[57:03.960 --> 57:04.960]  Hey, buddy.
[57:04.960 --> 57:05.960]  I like to,
[57:07.960 --> 57:08.960]  I like to say,
[57:08.960 --> 57:10.960]  I want you to say hi to your new
[57:10.960 --> 57:12.960]  future info wars reporter.
[57:13.960 --> 57:14.960]  All right, brother.
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.960]  We got about a minute and a half though.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.960]  Thank you.
[57:16.960 --> 57:17.960]  Yeah.
[57:17.960 --> 57:18.960]  You're pretty fast.
[57:18.960 --> 57:19.960]  Okay.
[57:19.960 --> 57:20.960]  Well, you're an inspiration to me.
[57:20.960 --> 57:22.960]  And I kind of like to make a joke here
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.960]  a little bit and say that you're,
[57:24.960 --> 57:26.960]  you're the reason why I left my friends and family
[57:26.960 --> 57:28.960]  and I moved out of the United States
[57:28.960 --> 57:30.960]  and I came here to Bulgaria to prepare
[57:30.960 --> 57:34.960]  for this worldwide economic collapse
[57:34.960 --> 57:36.960]  and world war.
[57:36.960 --> 57:37.960]  But of course it's,
[57:39.960 --> 57:41.960]  you know, it's true.
[57:41.960 --> 57:43.960]  I mean, you had just the other person.
[57:43.960 --> 57:45.960]  There's Jody's wife.
[57:45.960 --> 57:48.960]  My wife, she was like a zombie.
[57:48.960 --> 57:49.960]  I mean, for years and years,
[57:49.960 --> 57:51.960]  I used to tell her about this stuff
[57:51.960 --> 57:52.960]  and she just couldn't get it.
[57:52.960 --> 57:54.960]  So I had, I had to leave.
[57:54.960 --> 57:56.960]  I had to leave her and I had to leave everybody.
[57:56.960 --> 57:57.960]  And here I am.
[57:57.960 --> 57:58.960]  I'm in Bulgaria.
[57:58.960 --> 58:00.960]  And I just wanted to say that,
[58:02.960 --> 58:03.960]  you know, in the future,
[58:03.960 --> 58:05.960]  when all of these Christians,
[58:05.960 --> 58:07.960]  these Christians and Jews that are being killed,
[58:07.960 --> 58:09.960]  I'm being put here.
[58:09.960 --> 58:11.960]  So I don't want to say where I am,
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.960]  but they can come here and they can be safe.
[58:14.960 --> 58:16.960]  In northern Bulgaria,
[58:16.960 --> 58:18.960]  I have this place here that I'm preparing
[58:18.960 --> 58:20.960]  with food, water.
[58:20.960 --> 58:21.960]  I'm...
[58:21.960 --> 58:22.960]  Brother, that's exciting.
[58:22.960 --> 58:24.960]  And you know, upload videos to YouTube from Bulgaria.
[58:24.960 --> 58:26.960]  Anybody can go out and independently report
[58:26.960 --> 58:28.960]  and say, as an affiliate,
[58:28.960 --> 58:31.960]  I'm reporting for infowars.com.
[58:31.960 --> 58:33.960]  For liability, it doesn't mean
[58:33.960 --> 58:34.960]  that people can go set us up
[58:34.960 --> 58:35.960]  that you actually work for us.
[58:35.960 --> 58:36.960]  You can just say,
[58:36.960 --> 58:39.960]  I'm here reporting independently for infowars.com.
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.960]  And if it's good, we'll play it around.

[59:49.960 --> 01:00:16.960]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.960]  Dr. Edward Groob, one of the smartest
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960]  people I know, is going to be joining us
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.960]  coming up to cover a host of issues
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.960]  in the next segment.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.960]  Then we've got another doctor coming on,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.960]  brain surgeon, medical doctor.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.960]  He pretty much comes in the same analysis as
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.960]  Dr. Groob and Dr. Russell Blalock.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.960]  Hard to get guess.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960]  We appreciate him coming on.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960]  We'll talk about Obamacare and how his
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.960]  predictions of what it would do.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.960]  I thought we're a little over the top
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.960]  to show how naive I am and exactly
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.960]  what Blalock said is now happening.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]  You can go back to the interviews
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.960]  four years ago, two years ago,
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.960]  a year ago, six months ago.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.960]  I mean, it is precisely,
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]  precisely.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.960]  By the way, Dr. Blalock goes
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.960]  and we went and covered him in Las Vegas.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.960]  There was like 2,000 medical doctors
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.960]  and scientists there, paying huge amounts
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.960]  of money just to hear him speak for two hours.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.960]  He developed all the stuff that's
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.960]  common literature now, like cytotoxins
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960]  and all these terms that he literally
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.960]  25, 30 years ago researched in and coined
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.960]  are now like mainline.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.960]  He invented a bunch of the top brain
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960]  surgeries used today.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.960]  I'm not trying to go into a worship
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960]  festival Blalock.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960]  It's just that he is amazing.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960]  He's going to be joining us coming up
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960]  in the third hour because I don't have
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960]  the staff.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.960]  If I had the money, I would have people
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.960]  that just chronicled in a word search.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960]  I guess we're kind of doing that now.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960]  Everything we talk about what our guests
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960]  say and predict so that we could then
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.960]  just go right back to it and pull it,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]  like a word search at this point in the
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960]  video or in the audio, they said this
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960]  and we could go back and find it.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960]  By the way, I mentioned this earlier
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960]  but we were able to find it.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960]  Bush in January of 2009,
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.960]  when Obama was president-elect,
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.960]  he was saying, you know I like Obama.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.960]  We've been playing golf and hanging out
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.960]  and you know what's great about it?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.960]  Obama as things collapse and get really bad.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.960]  He's not going to go, oh, what was me
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]  and cry about it.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960]  He's just going to deal with it.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960]  And it was all an inside, oh my gosh,
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960]  they're going to drop the hammer on everybody.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960]  This is the controlled implosion.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.960]  I mean, they're right out there telling
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960]  you what they're going to do to you.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960]  And if you play ball with them,
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960]  you can be like Bill Clinton and keep
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  half the money that he collected
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960]  for the charity in
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960]  Haiti.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960]  And he uses it for his
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960]  $40,000
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.960]  one-way trip
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960]  luxury $50 million
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.960]  jet he flies on.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960]  So you give money
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960]  for little black kids in Haiti,
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960]  it literally goes into the
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960]  pocket of the pig,
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960]  Clinton, when he flies to Japan
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960]  to get paid a half million dollars
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960]  to get a delayed payoff, that's how they do it,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.960]  his speeches.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960]  Or he flies to London to be paid a million dollars
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960]  or flies to university to be paid
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960]  $100,000 is his lowest thing
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960]  for universities.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960]  He flies on a private jet with his
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960]  hookers
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960]  and all his drugs and the rest of it
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960]  paid for
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.960]  by
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960]  poor people that send in money to help Haitian
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960]  kids.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960]  I'm sorry, it's just
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960]  so sick.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960]  And then you've got Foxconn,
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960]  the worst factories in China, many studies have
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960]  shown, where they have
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960]  a urinal under the women and the men
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960]  and you have to defecate and urinate at
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960]  your chair.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960]  And then they've got
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960]  suicide nets and they drug you and they
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960]  do forced pregnancy test and do a
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.960]  forced abortions right there in the factory
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960]  and then you stay in these Warren
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960]  200 square foot
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960]  well actually in some areas you actually get in a coffin
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960]  and they slide you into the wall, I'm not joking.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960]  So actually 200 square foot is for us here now.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960]  That's where they're going to raise the taxes,
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960]  where you have to live in a 200 square foot.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]  That's Bloomberg, San Francisco, New York are doing it.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960]  Actually there it's
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960]  coffin size, I'm sorry it's smaller.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960]  And they put you in these coffins in the wall
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960]  and then you defecate and urinate standing there
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960]  at the thing and they put you on drugs
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.960]  and of course they're getting ready to replace them with robots.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960]  They put you on the board of Apple, it's like
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960]  oh that's nice, if you're against
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960]  the Chinese being used as slaves
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960]  you're racist against them.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960]  And again, they didn't industrialize
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.960]  China to empower the Chinese people.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960]  They did it to enslave them and use them up
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.960]  while the Communist Party pigs
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.960]  shut up their perched on everyone.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960]  If you want a good economy, you're like Henry Ford
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960]  who paid people about 10 times
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960]  what the regular factory wages were.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.960]  He said, I want people to have money to buy my cars.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960]  The last 50 years,
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960]  iodine has been
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960]  phased out of our staple foods
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960]  and replaced with the halogen
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960]  bromine, a practice
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.960]  now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.960]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.960]  Fluoride, ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.960]  Alex Jones here, in 1924
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960]  the federal government did the right thing
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960]  and encouraged salt producers
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960]  to add iodine.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.960]  and the results are on record
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.960]  reports documented
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960]  a 15-point IQ increase
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960]  in areas that had previously
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960]  been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960]  Unbound, clean, in a
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960]  glycerin base, nascent iodine
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960]  was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960]  A prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960]  economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960]  The globalist model is to
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960]  shut down societies and starve
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960]  patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960]  to the global takeover.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960]  That's why we've assembled the most vital

[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.960]  during power outages or out in the field.

[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:37.960]  Music
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960]  a lot of people think that the essence of
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.960]  tyranny is black uniforms, cameras, drones
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.960]  secret police and yes
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960]  we've got all that.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960]  And a government that runs al-Qaeda publicly
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.960]  and uses the threat of al-Qaeda to take our liberties
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960]  and a government that has the IRS
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.960]  persecuting gun groups, veterans groups
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960]  pro-life groups, alternative medicine groups
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960]  I mean you name it
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960]  the tyranny is there, the examples of corruption
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960]  are legion. But even in congress
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960]  we've got a special report coming up
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960]  on the nightly news tonight because there's a bunch
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960]  of examples of this are having hearings
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960]  now about the
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960]  executive branch being a dictatorship.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960]  Oh, I'll just
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.960]  make the illegals legal.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.960]  I'm the president, I'm God.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960]  I'll just put us under NATO. Well, you can't do that.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960]  It's unconstitutional. I do whatever I want.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960]  I'll just shut down all the power plants
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960]  that General Electric doesn't
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960]  own and double and triple their profits.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.960]  I'll just
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960]  put
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.960]  carbon taxes in a regulation about
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960]  microwaves that isn't even law
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.960]  and then put carbon tax on
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960]  everybody's carbon expenditure.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960]  Obama did that this year
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960]  and it's just
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960]  now added to your bill.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960]  He didn't even sign an executive order.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960]  I mean they could start interpreting
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960]  his flatulence if they wanted to
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960]  and have some
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960]  tea reader, a tea leave reader.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960]  That's how the ancients did it. They would take
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960]  bones and put in a fire and how the bones
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960]  broke, they would go off that
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960]  or they would go to the oracle of Delphi,
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960]  some woman breathing in obnoxious
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960]  gases, hallucinating stuff.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960]  Really they had the people behind them telling her
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960]  what to say, it's political manipulation.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960]  But my point is, is that
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960]  they could run the country according
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960]  to Obama going out
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.960]  and looking at a butchered bull
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960]  every morning and reading its intestines.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960]  That's what the Romans would do.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.960]  It's literally
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960]  god-imperor type stuff as begot.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.960]  And Congress, I played a clip earlier
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960]  as having hearings going,
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960]  well actually the president's been set for
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960]  the executive to be a dictator
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960]  and now suddenly everything's
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960]  executive. Exactly.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960]  We're now going into
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960]  a dictatorship.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960]  Let me show you a headline up at drudgerport.com
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960]  that like drudge does.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  Dirty Harry, that's Harry
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960]  Reid, exempts staff from Obamacare.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.960]  And by the way, now admits there are
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960]  death panels. Because it's
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960]  now law suckers.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.960]  And that is from CNN.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.960]  That's right, one of the main
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960]  architects in the Senate of it admits
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960]  that
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.960]  his people are exempt. And again
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960]  that's the real essence.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960]  At the bottom of tyranny is that
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.960]  four legs bad, two legs good
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960]  to use the George Arwell
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960]  animal farm analogy.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  Because it started out with the pigs
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.960]  with the horses and other animals.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960]  Let's revolt against the humans.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960]  Four legs good, two legs bad.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960]  By the time the pigs were done
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.960]  and run the humans off with the horses help
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960]  they were inside the house
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.960]  dressing like humans saying two legs good,
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.960]  four legs bad.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.960]  It's totally illegal.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960]  I came into work today
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.960]  to visit me and was showing me
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.960]  his insurance. It went up
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960]  30 something percent two months ago.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.960]  So a lot of people's double
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.960]  triple quadrupled or 500
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.960]  something percent in Texas with Humana
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960]  for families with no preexisting
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960]  conditions. And he got another letter.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960]  It's up 30% again.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.960]  So that's how they're doing it every few months.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960]  It goes up 30 something percent.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960]  My dad's never used
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.960]  his insurance.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.960]  For a reason, I learned this from him.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960]  I don't know why he does it, but I guess
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960]  he keeps your insurance down.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.960]  When he goes to the doctor once while for a trip
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960]  he just pays cash.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960]  It doesn't matter, that still gets filed
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960]  with him through the surveillance system.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960]  And that's what Obama cares about as well
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.960]  tracking everything you do, feeding it back.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.960]  This is the mega total ripoff
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960]  and it's designed to try to
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.960]  stop alternative medicine from getting
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.960]  any kind of Medicare or insurance money.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.960]  It's designed to lower the quality of care
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960]  and it's designed to let insurance companies
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960]  in some cases charge
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960]  11 times what they did previous
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960]  and not cover preexisting conditions.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960]  And all these morons that
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960]  are in the news going, well, 10% of America
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960]  was able to sign up. They're now going
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960]  and going, I signed up. I'm in the system.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960]  They go, well, we can't even get on a system.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960]  You're not signed up. Where's your insurance card?
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.960]  They go, it's free. Obama.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.960]  I got an Obama phone. Now I get
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960]  Obamacare.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]  And they look at him and they go, there is
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.960]  there was previous under charity care
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]  under law. We've pretty much gotten
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.960]  rid of that now. Some doctors
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.960]  are still trying to do it, but they're being told
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960]  by the big management companies you can.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]  Just like it came out in the news yesterday,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960]  I saw it on Drudge too, that small banks
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960]  and credit unions are being shut down
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]  under the banking regs
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960]  that were supposed to fix the mega banks.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]  The mega banks wrote that to shut down their competition.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960]  They've got unlimited bailout money now
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960]  and then the local bank can't do fractional
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960]  reserve banking. So they're shutting down
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960]  that they don't want you to get money.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.960]  They want a fixed system, come
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.960]  print day.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960]  All you're going to get is this
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960]  good job. They got you addicted to
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960]  government and the NFL distractions
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.960]  and the opiate of the masses,
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960]  the gladiatorial diversions and
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960]  now they've fattened us up and now
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.960]  it's butchering time.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.960]  And many of you will settle
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.960]  for 10% of the chicken feed you've been
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.960]  getting by the time they're done
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.960]  instead of being free and wealthy and prosperous.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960]  You want slavery.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.960]  You love slavery and the system
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960]  thinks that you're ready now.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960]  You'll eat GMO,
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.960]  you'll drink all the poison, you'll do whatever you want.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960]  Well, why not? Why not just take your pension funds?
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.960]  Why not spy on everybody without warrants?
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.960]  Why not set up checkpoints?
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.960]  Why not cut babies out of women's wombs for CPS
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960]  now? Why not
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960]  have the FBI persecute the Tea Party
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.960]  under orders from the White House and it comes out
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.960]  and no one gets in trouble. That's how Hitler started
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.960]  just persecuting his political opposition
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960]  with regulations and audits
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960]  and things.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.960]  And so I wanted to get Dr.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.960]  Ed Groob in here with us because
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960]  man, I tell you, none of us are perfect.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.960]  I have a vision of what I want in my life
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960]  but I obviously
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.960]  can't get there overnight.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.960]  I thought they'd kill me anytime for
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960]  a decade so I just ate like a pig,
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.960]  was totally unhealthy and because
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.960]  I've been physically attacked and death-rated a lot and I just thought,
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960]  well, you know, I even worry about what I look
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960]  like or feel like now, I realize it's long haul.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960]  Tommy Pallotta, a movie producer
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960]  friend of mine, he said, Alex,
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960]  that's how they really kill you is making you think
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.960]  they're going to kill you and then you just don't care about
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960]  yourself. You're killing yourself.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.960]  So it's taking me about five, six years to lose 40
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960]  something pounds to get healthier
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960]  and I weigh 275
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960]  pounds at the height of it folks. I'm still a little
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.960]  bit overweight but actually standing there out of the shower
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960]  I got a little bit of fat on my stomach. I just got a long
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960]  torso. I actually look pretty good now.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.960]  I don't look that good on TV. It puts weight on you.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960]  But the point is, is that my brain
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]  works so much better
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960]  and I've gotten into supplementation
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.960]  and tried to research it the last three, four years
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960]  in this process of detoxing,
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960]  trying to get my life straight
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960]  and I finally
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.960]  found Dr. Group
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960]  and the things he was doing and I learned
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.960]  stuff from him that I didn't hear from
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960]  anybody else that has just been
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.960]  absolutely miraculous like he helped us develop
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.960]  this only form, it's the only form
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.960]  totally proprietary of nascent iodine
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960]  that
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960]  is totally bioavailable and absorbed by the body, not bound
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.960]  and other
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.960]  iodine is great as well. I mean it's just this is
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960]  the best stuff from my research
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.960]  and of course that helps us fund our operation
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.960]  as well in FullWarsLife.com
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960]  but I wanted
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.960]  to get him in here to talk about this big stack of news
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  where Harvard
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960]  now admits fluoride decreases IQ
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960]  areas
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.960]  in Germany and other ones all over are moving fluoride
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.960]  so good news
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.960]  and then we're going to get into some other
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.960]  systems of detox with him as well because the
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960]  real revolution here
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960]  is that they're targeting our bodies
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.960]  so that we're so poisoned that
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960]  we can't even get upset
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960]  or motivated to resist them
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960]  so the revolution starts with our bodies
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.960]  it starts with getting our kids out of the public schools
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960]  it starts with decoupling
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960]  from the system not carrying what Hollywood
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960]  and the media say and that's happening
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.960]  Congress has a 6% approval rating
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.960]  the mainstream media is dying but we've got to go
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960]  all the way and not just leave
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]  Babylon
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960]  not just come out of Egypt but actually build
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.960]  a new promised land
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960]  and there is no silver bullet but there's a process
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960]  and Dr. Ed Group joined us
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960]  here today in studio
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960]  advisor to infowarshealth.com
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.960]  infowarslife.com
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.960]  and of course infowars.com
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960]  and he's here with us today
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960]  you've heard my rant about Obamacare
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960]  and how the government and the corporations are exempt
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.960]  I mean is that not the ultimate form of discrimination?
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960]  of course they're screaming
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960]  racism all day
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960]  if you love liberty as a distraction because
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.960]  they're actually cheating all of us
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960]  that aren't on the inside group
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960]  it's been going on for a long time
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.960]  when they started putting fluoride in the water
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960]  and everything else and poisoning the air and poisoning the food
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960]  but today
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960]  you know if you look at the combination
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960]  of chemicals that we're exposed to every day
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960]  I mean fluoride is so toxic
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960]  I mean the hydrofluorosilic acid
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960]  that they put in the water supply
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960]  if you have a hard time saying that
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960]  you just automatically know
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.960]  it's a poison I mean it's almost as poisonous as arsenic
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.960]  so what I try to do
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.960]  is tell people it's everywhere I mean if you go to
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.960]  Starbucks and get some coffee you're drinking fluoride
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960]  if you drink beer you're drinking fluoride
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960]  wine all the food that you make
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.960]  the bread that you eat
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.960]  all that has to be made with water right
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960]  I mean the water that you're spraying on your yard
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.960]  your organic garden
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.960]  plus they add it to the bread
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960]  prescription medications have fluoride
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960]  I mean you're right it's designed
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960]  to dumb you down
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]  to make you
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960]  non-motivated and non-aggressive
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960]  so really
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960]  what I want to talk about is how people can address
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960]  that and how people can reduce that because
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960]  there's a million chemicals we could pick out there but really
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.960]  if you take like the top five
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.960]  I mean they know and it's been in the water system
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960]  and it's been everywhere for so long
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.960]  how detrimental fluoride is
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.960]  it wasn't until
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.960]  like for example if you stick your hand
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960]  in hydrofluoricic acid
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960]  you will die just because you came in contact with it
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960]  that's how poisonous it is
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960]  you can't breathe the gases
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960]  so it was funny that Anthony
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.960]  Gucciardi mentioned in late 2012
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960]  you know well what is out there
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.960]  I mean what can you develop a product that will get rid
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.960]  of fluoride inside the system
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960]  I was like you know what that's a great idea
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960]  that's right it's Gucciardi that came up with it
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960]  so I said you know I've got about a two year waiting list
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960]  for product development but I was like wait a second
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960]  you can address
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]  the main chemical that's dumbing people down
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.960]  you know reducing the IQs of children
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.960]  you know the list goes on and on
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.960]  and you've talked about it for years and years
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.960]  what if we could develop a product
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960]  that would actually help the body detoxify
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960]  fluoride and you know
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.960]  with the survival shield with the iodine product
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960]  that we came up with that's great because
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960]  the iodine saturates the thyroid
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960]  and it doesn't let the fluoride in
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960]  but what about something that we could
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960]  use and take on a regular basis to protect the children
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.960]  and techniques on how to
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960]  avoid fluoride from coming into the system
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960]  that's right we're going to talk about that today
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960]  because we are launching
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960]  the new product today
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960]  we're only going to put about five minutes on that
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960]  and get into news and analysis folks but
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]  this is amazing because Dr. Group
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960]  off record said hey

[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960]  or something you've got to stay up all night
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960]  try not drinking coffee try taking a double dose of the iodine
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:07.960]  for me great news pure water lovers bigberkeywaterfilters.com

[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960]  let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield

[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.960]  now I want to get into Obamacare
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.960]  with Dr. Ed Group and all this news
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960]  where cities and counties
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960]  are pulling fluoride out of the water
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960]  in New Jersey
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960]  in states like Arkansas
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.960]  a whole bunch of them
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.960]  are passing federal
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960]  mandates of money to the states
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960]  where the state doesn't get the federal money
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960]  that's really state money
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960]  citizen money
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.960]  if they don't fluoridate so they're passing laws
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.960]  that the water's got to be fluoridated
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.960]  and public schools
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.960]  have to have it
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.960]  when for seven years
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960]  the American dental association
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960]  and medical association have said
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960]  under five don't drink it
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960]  and I've had arguments with doctors
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.960]  and they go oh my god no one told me this
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960]  so we forced them to say
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960]  don't drink it
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960]  and the scientists at the FDA have gone public
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960]  God bless them
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960]  that's an example of good people in government
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  in 2000 and again in 2009
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.960]  90 plus percent of them signed official deals
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960]  could have been fired and said take it out
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960]  it's giving people cancer, thyroid, IQ
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960]  and they said no
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960]  so here's the deal folks
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.960]  I actually got to commend the government scientists
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960]  trying to get it out
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960]  it's the citizens sitting down on their butts
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960]  people should be angry so Dr. Group
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960]  I want to get into fluoride and all that but you've got the floor
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960]  we are launching
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960]  fluoride shield, fluoride detox
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  but it doesn't just detox that
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960]  and it is the super combo
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960]  because you already had this idea
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960]  as you said a couple years ago
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960]  you were so busy I should also add you're one of the major formulators
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  in the country
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.960]  you yourself have lines of stuff that are your national best sellers
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.960]  and are really I guess
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.960]  neutral medical I guess they'd call them
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.960]  hospitals you name it
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960]  but the whole point is I appreciate you helping us do this
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.960]  because you're on board with the liberty movement
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.960]  tell us about how you developed
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960]  and are allowing us to be the sole proprietary
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960]  distributor of it
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.960]  fluoride shield, tell us what's in it
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.960]  first of all
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960]  just an incredible idea
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960]  and so I really wanted to put a lot of effort into
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960]  and spend a lot of time researching it
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960]  because ultimately I want to help everybody out
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.960]  just like you and by the way
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.960]  you couldn't get one of the agreements
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960]  for about six months
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.960]  and this all got held up and I said just take it out
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960]  you said no
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960]  I will not put it out unless it's I'm sorry
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960]  go ahead
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.960]  no it's exactly what it was and the ingredient was
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.960]  it actually is a black mass
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960]  it's an organic mass that grows
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.960]  out of the mountains in the Himalayas
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960]  so they actually have to go up there
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.960]  and harvest it at a certain time of the year
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960]  it's like a black ooze and they harvest it
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960]  and it's very high in minerals and it's been
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]  used in Ayurvedic for thousands
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  of years it's a miraculous
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960]  healing compound but it's
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.960]  high in full of acid and has the ability
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.960]  to help chelate and pull metals and toxic
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.960]  compounds out of the system so
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960]  that was one of the main ingredients
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960]  and by the way these ingredients are hard
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960]  to get I've got organic full of acid
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960]  in there I've got tamarin
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.960]  which a lot of people don't know about and that
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.960]  mobilizes metals and fluorides from the body
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960]  nation iodine, contro and then
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.960]  iodine in there as well not a lot
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.960]  like the survival shield but you can actually take
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.960]  the fluoride shield and the survival shield
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960]  at the same time and you explained how it all
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.960]  triggers it one thing gets
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.960]  it moving the other grabs it explain it
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960]  yes well it's got zeolites in it too
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960]  and so basically what we want to do is we want
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960]  to take something that's going to target
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.960]  toxic chemicals especially fluoride
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]  some of it like cilantro is going to
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960]  mobilize it from the cells
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960]  and then the zeolites are going to pick it up
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.960]  and the full of the gas is also going to
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.960]  chelate it or bond to it
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960]  so you can extract it normally from the body
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.960]  so
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.960]  especially with the dental fluorosis
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.960]  the skeletal fluorosis people losing hair
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960]  arthritis
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.960]  joint pains all over the United States
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.960]  I mean one of the best things
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.960]  when he came up with that idea was like that's great
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.960]  because that's the one
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.960]  thing that you can really turn you around
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.960]  super fast I mean as far as
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.960]  health is concerned because you need to
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.960]  be able to
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  understand and have mental clarity
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960]  if you want to fight against the opposition
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960]  if you want to fight against everything else
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960]  especially with the Obamacare situation
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960]  right now people need to start taking
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960]  responsibility for their own health
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960]  they need to start cleaning their body
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960]  they need to start detoxifying and they need to be
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.960]  aware of the things that they're putting in their system
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.960]  and you warned us on air and you warned me
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960]  because I took it for several months
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.960]  just the proprietary nation item
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.960]  before we actually bottled it and put it out
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.960]  that get ready
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  you may start detoxing and I felt
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  a few weeks into it kind of sick for a while
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960]  but then it passed like you said
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960]  and then you said look I'm not going to say a bunch of this on air
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  but just wait what it does to your clarity
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960]  and I guess just the nation item alone
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.960]  I guess stripped out a bunch of stuff
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960]  that was fogging me up in my glands
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960]  for lack of a better word Leigh Ann has said the same thing
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960]  I mean I literally can be
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]  staying up all night I don't drink coffee now
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960]  I will hit the iodine and of course you got to consult
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960]  a physician sometimes I take more than what it says
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960]  recommended you told me privately what you really take
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960]  and I was like man is this guy crazy
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960]  let me tell you this stuff is amazing
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960]  well it's easy to tell people to
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960]  avoid artificial sweeteners avoid alcohol
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960]  you know they can avoid it but it's hard to tell people
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960]  to avoid fluoride because what
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960]  are you going to not go out to the restaurant and eat anymore
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960]  are you not going to have water anywhere
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960]  all the foods made with water the soup I mean everything
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960]  it's hard to avoid fluoride
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960]  it's in everything so
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.960]  that's why I figured it's a great idea
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.960]  to have a product that someone can take on a regular basis
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.960]  that will actually help them
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.960]  immobilize and eliminate fluoride
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.960]  what is it doing in the brain though for the clarity
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960]  it's amazing what is it doing is decalcifying
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.960]  the pineal gland number one
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.960]  which is bringing your consciousness up
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960]  and making you more aware
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  and giving you a more spiritual connection
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  and then it's undoubted
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.960]  the dreams I'm having I mean
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]  quite frankly this stuff's amazing
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.960]  we're going to be right back with
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.960]  we're on the march the empire's
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.960]  on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.960]  and the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.960]  why does the United States
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.960]  spend the largest percentage of GDP
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.960]  in the world on health care
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.960]  why do we have the highest cancer rates
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.960]  on the planet the highest rates
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.960]  of diabetes autism
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.960]  and every other major disease
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.960]  it all comes down to one thing
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.960]  we are what we eat
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.960]  our food is devoid of nutrition
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.960]  and processed with poisons and additives
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.960]  our water is filled with toxic
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.960]  poisons and big pharma rates
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.960]  and we're going to have to
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.960]  take away the toxic poisons
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.960]  and big pharma runoff
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.960]  all of this has been engineered by design
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960]  we can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.960]  by giving ourselves the nutrients
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.960]  our body desperately needs

[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.960]  of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.960]  grow their unique shade grown arabica beans
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.960]  we have now managed to secure

[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.960]  in the last 50 years
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.960]  iodine has been phased out
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.960]  of our staple foods and replaced
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.960]  with the halogen bromine
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.960]  a practice now banned
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.960]  in nations around the world
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.960]  guess what else is in the halogen family
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960]  in 1924 the federal government
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.960]  did the right thing and encouraged
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960]  salt producers to add iodine
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.960]  it's the good halogen
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.960]  on the periodic table and the results
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.960]  are on record reports documented
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.960]  a 15 point IQ

[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.960]  been deficient in iodine
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.960]  bottom line iodine is important

[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960]  and what I do is
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960]  I go out and research things
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960]  for years and then what I use
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.960]  for myself and my family my children
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.960]  all take this my wife takes it she's like

[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.960]  well obviously
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.960]  ProPure is the best gravity fed
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.960]  filters out there that I could find
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.960]  with cuts up the glyphosates
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.960]  the fluoride so I sell that
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.960]  I use it
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.960]  and then you can block them putting
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.960]  the fluoride in your water
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.960]  and be healthy and we can fund the media
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.960]  operation win-win-win
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.960]  that's just old-fashioned
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.960]  free market good products capitalism
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.960]  you know good karma
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.960]  good reputious so whatever you want to call
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.960]  it folks that's what I'm into
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.960]  and again I'm being honest
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.960]  about it I'm like well it's got all these other
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.960]  five great ingredients I'm sick of waiting
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.960]  let's call it you know
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.960]  fluoride shield
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.960]  turbo or something once I get
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.960]  the shilligy because he's like
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.960]  well we've got some good shilligy
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.960]  but it's not the best and I want it
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.960]  this and I'm like look
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.960]  been waiting six months here for this
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.960]  oh and that's the final issue
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.960]  they only got half the shilligy they thought
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.960]  this is not a
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.960]  advertising tactic though it is
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.960]  the truth is what sells
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.960]  but it is true we got
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.960]  a third of what I originally wanted to order
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960]  and it's going to be four to six weeks
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.960]  till I get more
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.960]  and so I almost didn't
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.960]  even come out with it just because it's pointless
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.960]  because we're just going to sell out of it like two days
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.960]  but we have two new products
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.960]  supermail vitality
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.960]  and the fluoride shield
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.960]  that will sell out in days
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960]  and we won't have more for four to six weeks
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.960]  period
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.960]  I've been wanting to get Dr. Gruppen in here anyways
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.960]  so that's it
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.960]  we have plenty for now
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  of the
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.960]  survival shield proprietary
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.960]  nascent iodine and just to give you an example
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.960]  the other ones which I'm sure are great for you and everything
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.960]  are black on paper
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.960]  because they're oxidized mixed with alcohol
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.960]  this is bound up in the
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:45.960]  non-gmo from Germany
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  glycerin and turns bright blue on paper
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.960]  I'm just giving you an idea of the differences here
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.960]  just visually what goes on
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.960]  and we do have plenty of that

[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.960]  and it's also good to store as well
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.960]  but this is something you take daily
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:09.960]  consult your physician because a lot of you are super toxic
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.960]  like I was
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.960]  I mean this is not a game
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.960]  this is not a joke, this is real stuff
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.960]  and what's blown me away
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.960]  is that I'm like listen
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.960]  I'm taking forever let's go find
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.960]  I told group this for somewhere else to put this out
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  and I found out the industry
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.960]  is so unbelievable
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  with fillers and all the rest of it
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.960]  that I could get stuff for like
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.960]  $2 ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.960]  instead of paying $16
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.960]  $20 a bottle myself or something to get the real stuff
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.960]  and I wouldn't did research
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.960]  I mean that's the difference
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  with these companies and these fillers
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  and even a lot of the stuff it's seen is super good and wonderful
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.960]  and again
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.960]  I don't need to differentiate the competition
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  to sell this stuff I'm telling you folks
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.960]  we're bringing you from our research
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.960]  the very best
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.960]  stuff and I'm done plugging it let's get into
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.960]  fluoride but let's finish up Dr. Group
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.960]  what you were telling me about
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.960]  what fluoride does how it supercharges the body
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.960]  the point is this is available now
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  it'll be the middle of January
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.960]  until we have more of this folks
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.960]  and I'm not even getting into the supermail if I tell you
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.960]  we got such a small amount of that
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960]  and I'll be honest with you folks
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.960]  when we had the formula three months ago
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.960]  for about a month I quit taking it
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  except for about a third of the even recommended dose
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.960]  because I don't need the supermail
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  okay okay I don't need it in the morning
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.960]  if you know what I mean and I'm going to
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960]  literally start I mean I can't take it
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  okay but for guys out there
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.960]  let me tell you
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  the leading competitors are double the price
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.960]  like a hundred bucks for this stuff
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.960]  and our stuff's you know 50 something
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.960]  or 60 something
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  because the ingredients that are in it
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960]  I wanted to try all this stuff out
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.960]  other competitors don't do anything or give me a headache
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960]  this supermail vitality
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.960]  when we finally get enough of it is going to be a market
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.960]  changer okay the problem
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.960]  is that it's so hard to make
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960]  and again group like why is it so hard to make good stuff
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  and then you've got the floor
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.960]  because nobody else out there
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  takes the time and effort to research the ingredients
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  to make sure that they mix everything correctly
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.960]  that they use cold processing
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.960]  that they use all glass equipment
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.960]  I mean most of stuff out there is done in aluminum
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.960]  based production vessels
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.960]  stainless steel production vessels all that
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  can affect the way that it mixes together
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.960]  people use alcohol extractions
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  which are dated back
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.960]  to you know thousands and thousands of years
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.960]  ago no one's reinvented the way
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.960]  to process herbs
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.960]  or came up with new technology
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]  and utilize new technology
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.960]  since we have really I mean
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.960]  and that's like starting from scratch
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.960]  and figuring out how we can extract
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960]  because see alcohol extractions only get
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960]  about 40 to 50 percent of the constituents
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960]  of the plant out but what kind of
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.960]  pitches that don't buy this it's too strong
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.960]  I mean I don't know what
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.960]  is in the super male vitality separately
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.960]  what's in the male vitality is a proprietary
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  formula and I developed it because
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960]  men everywhere are experiencing
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.960]  angiopause right now because they're putting all the garbage
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  in them when you turn 30
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.960]  you your body a male
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.960]  their body starts producing more estrogen
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.960]  than testosterone and we have a major problem
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.960]  with all the estrogen soy
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.960]  all the phytates, the plastics
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960]  everything that's mimicking estrogen
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960]  and actually talking about fluoride it does the same thing
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.960]  fluoride causes excess
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  aluminum to be put up into the brain
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960]  which causes problems
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  and fluoride is associated
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.960]  with excess estrogen levels in the body too
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  and fluoride
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960]  reduces sperm count
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.960]  it reduces the reproductive
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  area well that's why John P. Holdren says
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  they put it in the water is for mainly infertility
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.960]  to make you infertile
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960]  and what we have now is we have two women
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.960]  being two girls being born for every one male
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.960]  so they're trying to reduce the amount of males
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.960]  with the fluoride and all the other stuff
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.960]  with the male vitality
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  that was designed to bring you back
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.960]  to when you were a teenager again bring you back
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  to where you're 18 regulate
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  and normalize your hormone levels growth
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.960]  why can't I handle it
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.960]  well you probably just
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.960]  you're already like a dominant
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960]  you know testosterone male
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  I mean this is for and
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.960]  you know you're only 39 too so anytime
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  after 40 you know you're
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.960]  as your levels continue to go and plus
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.960]  you're avoiding the estrogens and I was about
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.960]  to say and I've been exercising I mean
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  I still take it sometimes like in the morning
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  I'm tired don't work out or something it's just that
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.960]  I did get crazed in about three weeks on this
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  well you have to look at your personality
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.960]  and you have to look at what you know if you're having fatigue
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.960]  if you're having extra weight gain like males do
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.960]  around the trunk area if you're eating
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.960]  a crappy diet with all kinds of estrogens
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.960]  and stuff like that
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  and you're having you know sexual dysfunction
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.960]  which look at all the men on Viagra
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  and everything these days and again I just want to say
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.960]  folks just
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.960]  just get the male vitality
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  it's going to sell itself wait till people try this
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.960]  put it this way it makes you feel like you're 16 or 17
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.960]  again and yeah that energy boost
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.960]  no I'm just saying I take a lot
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  less of it
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.960]  you were telling me but also we're going to come out with a female version
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960]  but quite frankly you were saying
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960]  women that does the same thing for women
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.960]  I've had women call my office and basically
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.960]  say what are you giving to my husband
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  and do you have some for me
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.960]  because
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  it's completely changed their relationship
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.960]  I mean they're able to have sexual relations again
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.960]  they're balanced out
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.960]  I mean the guy is confident about himself
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.960]  because he's gaining muscle he's losing that extra fat
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.960]  he feels young again
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.960]  and all about with health
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960]  health really is
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.960]  giving you self confidence
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.960]  I mean when you look in the mirror and you look good
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960]  and you look healthy then you're self confident
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.960]  and you go out into the world
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.960]  when you look in the mirror and you don't look good
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.960]  and you feel bad and you're hungover
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.960]  or anything like that
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  you don't have that self confidence for that day
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.960]  you don't have that drive and that passion
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.960]  to go out into the world and accomplish what you want to accomplish
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.960]  and that's why I want to help people
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  detox the fluoride and really you know
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.960]  with fluoride it affects
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.960]  babies and it affects children
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.960]  and it affects older people
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  even worse
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.960]  and you know especially with children
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.960]  with fluoride fluoridated water
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960]  in with their baby formulas
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960]  I mean they get 400 times the amount
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.960]  or at least
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.960]  we did this with natural news editor
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.960]  naturalnews.com Mike Adams
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.960]  where he brought in the leading a few years
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  and we should do this again leading baby formulas
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960]  they were like 75% sugar and high fructose corn syrup
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.960]  I mean no wonder
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.960]  I've seen the studies where kids that drink formula
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.960]  have smaller brains
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  exactly, exactly
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.960]  you're meant to be getting fat right from your mama
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.960]  and the tests that have come back
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.960]  when they tested breast milk have shown
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.960]  very, very, very low fluoride levels in there
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.960]  but when you
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.960]  put water and you bathe
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  the children in fluoridated water
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960]  and you're around it all the time
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.960]  then you're going to have all those endocrine disorders
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  and you were telling me what fluoride does to other things
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.960]  like how it supercharges the uptake of aluminum
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.960]  yeah it supercharges the uptake of aluminum
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.960]  it causes damage to the liver
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.960]  causes damage to the brain
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  causes damage to the kidneys
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.960]  it reduces IQ
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.960]  like we talked about
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.960]  it gives you that brain fog
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.960]  it reduces, it can cause skin rashes
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.960]  people that have skin rashes or can be fluoride sensitive
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.960]  the list goes on and on and on and on
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.960]  but it's just the fact that it chronically
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.960]  suppresses the immune system too
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960]  and that way you can't activate your own
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960]  body self healing mechanism
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.960]  which we've talked about a bunch of times
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.960]  it's all about reducing your chemical exposure
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.960]  and cleansing your system
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:19.960]  on a regular basis cleaning the air
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.960]  cleaning the water
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.960]  but the thing is even though people have
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.960]  water filtration systems
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.960]  and restaurants sometimes have water filtration systems
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.960]  it's not going to get the fluoride out
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.960]  I mean they're just carbon based systems
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.960]  you have to have specialized either distillation systems
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.960]  which is why we use
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.960]  in the production of our products
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.960]  triple distilled water
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.960]  it doesn't get any cleaner than that
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960]  and then we mix that in a certain percentage with glycerin
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960]  and then we use that as an extraction medium
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.960]  for the herbs or whatever we're extracting
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.960]  what is happening
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.960]  because when we sold out of it
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.960]  I looked into carrying other so called
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.960]  nascent iodine and we just
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.960]  couldn't sell it because it tasted so bad
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.960]  and also
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960]  what
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.960]  it tastes
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960]  and looks like it's oxidizing
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.960]  what's happening with iodine
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.960]  that's put in with alcohol that makes it black
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.960]  instead of shiny pretty blue on paper
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960]  you know
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.960]  we've tested multiple different types of iodine
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.960]  manufacturers and we're getting different results
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  across the board
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960]  first of all it's an ethyl alcohol
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.960]  an ethyl alcohol it might be genetically modified
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.960]  it might not but alcohol is definitely
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.960]  a toxin to the body
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.960]  that's the number one reason why I don't like
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.960]  alcohol extractions
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.960]  number two is you're not able to extract
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.960]  or bond the substances
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960]  into the matrix like you are with glycerin
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.960]  vegetable glycerin
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.960]  is what I'm talking about we would never use animal products
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.960]  but with the glycerin
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.960]  you actually hold the iodine in the matrix
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.960]  and then when you release it
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960]  it should turn a purplish color that means
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.960]  that you're releasing free iodine
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.960]  onto whatever
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.960]  you want to release it onto
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.960]  so basically with the alcohol based tinctures
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.960]  number one they taste really really bad
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.960]  we don't know what the microgram dose is
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.960]  in some of them they're all different
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.960]  and they're really hard to give to children or even pets
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.960]  look I mean you have dogs and cats
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  right now practically every dog and cat
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.960]  that's raised on
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.960]  a human diet because people give their dog food
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  and the contaminated
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.960]  GMO dog food which is full of chemicals
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.960]  and toxic metals and all that stuff to their pets
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.960]  and then their pets eat
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  the crappy food they eat
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.960]  dogs and cats are having hypothyroidism
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.960]  and hyperthyroidism just like humans
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.960]  you can't give
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.960]  the alcohol based product to pets
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960]  but I just want to be clear
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.960]  this is such a giant country
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960]  giant world we're not in competition with folks
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.960]  other thyroid type deals
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.960]  and iodine I think it's great get it from
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.960]  the quality gourmet salts that have it
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.960]  get it from other nascent iodines whatever
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.960]  my point is we're explaining why
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.960]  this system is glycerin based
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.960]  right and I'm a big supporter
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.960]  I mean it doesn't really you know
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.960]  it's just like if you want to drive a car
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.960]  do you want to drive a Bentley or do you want to drive
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  like a little Volkswagen or something like that
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  it's a matter of looking at
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.960]  but if people can't afford
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960]  it's double the strength
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960]  of our competing competitors
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.960]  our survival shield
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.960]  or our fluoride shield that's in the big 2 ounce bottle
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.960]  by the way
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.960]  they can still get
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.960]  the gourmet salts correct
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.960]  that have some of the good iodine in them
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.960]  you can get like Himalayan crystal salt
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.960]  which actually has natural iodine
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960]  and it's not processed it's not bleached
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.960]  all stuff like that you can eat seaweed
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.960]  organic seaweed of course make sure it's not coming from
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.960]  over there by Fukushima
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  but you know there's different
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.960]  processing techniques too that we even actually
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.960]  test the raw iodine when it comes in
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.960]  with Geiger counters just to make sure that it's not
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.960]  you know putting out any type of
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.960]  radiation it's just a matter of
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.960]  what steps are you going to take to ensure that
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.960]  you're giving the highest quality product
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.960]  to somebody these days because
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960]  I've spent years looking at all different types of
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  products out there that's my whole life is evaluating
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.960]  and formulating products and getting people
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960]  the right information that they can trust
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.960]  I've put my name on it that means
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.960]  that all of that information has been researched
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  extensively and it's a passion of mine
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.960]  just like yours to bring this information
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960]  out to the public so
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.960]  I want to produce the best product
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.960]  out there and one of the reasons why I started that
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.960]  is because I looked and I couldn't find any good
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960]  products out there they all have
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  magnesium, steered in them if you track
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.960]  it down they're using herbs that are
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.960]  two or three or four years old it's sat in a warehouse
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  with 200 degrees or 150 degrees
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.960]  somewhere or in a shipping container
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.960]  I mean when you really start tracking
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  back take your product off the shelf
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.960]  at any drugstore or major retailer
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.960]  and if you call that company
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.960]  first of all they're probably not even going to give you
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.960]  any information on it and if you
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.960]  really track about it listen some of the biggest companies
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.960]  we were looking at private label stuff
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  the bottle costs more than
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.960]  what's in it and I was like no we're
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  not going to buy this I mean what is going on
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.960]  out there well because everybody wants
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.960]  to produce a cheap product they don't really care
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  about the end consumer I mean that's the good
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.960]  thing about you that's a good thing about me is
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.960]  we actually care about the end consumer
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.960]  I mean I don't want the bad luck
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.960]  from selling people stuff that didn't
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.960]  highest quality I mean that's like God fearing
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.960]  I don't want to get into
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.960]  pitching the thing I think I'm not even trying to we just whenever
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.960]  we're talking we always talk about this so it's kind of
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.960]  inside baseball stuff what do you make
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.960]  of the federal government lobbying states and states
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960]  passing laws saying cities
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.960]  can't take fluoride out I mean for me
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.960]  that is so outrageous
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.960]  why do you think the establishment doctor group
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960]  wants to put hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.960]  and other fluorines
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.960]  and the bromine all that they're putting in the bread
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.960]  I mean they've got to
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.960]  know what they're doing of course they know what
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.960]  they're doing I mean as a whole part of the population
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.960]  control scheme is about keeping people dumbed
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960]  down it's about keeping people sick I mean and that's
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960]  why so we can't be mad at Americans and others
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.960]  in the West that are so unhealthy highest
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.960]  cancer rates dying all of that
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960]  and being zombies
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  we've been poisoned we are
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.960]  being poisoned I mean and that is a super
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.960]  toxic chemical I mean the phosphate
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.960]  industry for fertilizer which is
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.960]  a whole nother big scam but they produce
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.960]  they use the phosphate containing
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.960]  rocks they pour sulfuric acid on it they get
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.960]  these chemicals they have
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960]  it would be more cost it would cost them
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.960]  way more money to dispose of this because
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960]  hydrofluorosalic acid is
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960]  so toxic it's almost
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.960]  as toxic as arsenic with the amount
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  that they're producing for the fertilizer
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960]  industry and I'm maybe talking about the aluminum production
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.960]  industry what are they going to do with all
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.960]  that stuff and this goes back actually into the
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960]  early 1900's so they're dumping
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.960]  it in the water supply because they know
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960]  that it's going to kill everybody off
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.960]  eventually it's it's a slow poison
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.960]  it's a slow death and again for those that
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.960]  don't know from aluminum smelting they have it
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.960]  as a byproduct fertilizer but the big one at
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  the end of World War II and they had big spills
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960]  in Tennessee that were killing the whole river was
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.960]  the uranium enrichment they mined out of
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.960]  the same limestone they had all this
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.960]  hydrofluorosalic acid left
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960]  and they went what do we do from the Manhattan
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960]  project we put it in the water
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.960]  oh man yeah and what
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.960]  happened was the citizens have actually
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.960]  especially like in San Diego and some
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.960]  areas throughout the United States
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  they've have action networks and they've
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  fought dating back
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.960]  to the early 1900's and have laws
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.960]  in the cities that they cannot
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  fluoridate the water but now what's happening
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.960]  is big brothers coming down
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.960]  and saying to the states you have to
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.960]  you know enforce this fluoridation and the
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960]  states are actually over turning
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.960]  or cutting the funding to these small
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.960]  cities that have not had fluoridated water
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.960]  for hundreds of years exactly making
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.960]  and forcing them to fluoridate the water
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.960]  now well I was about to say when I just
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.960]  happened to be at a hotel and they were having
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960]  a water convention in Arkansas where they
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  passed a law the year before to make you
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960]  have fluoride and I'm no exaggeration
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960]  I forget it was like 30 40 I forget I mean
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.960]  had had water guys we were big
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.960]  listeners and we don't put it in the water
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960]  even though they make us buy it and we got it
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.960]  it gets gotten rid of it's not only and
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.960]  they were they were all in a conspiracy
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.960]  of liberty
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.960]  and for their families they were just
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.960]  not doing it see that's how we're
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.960]  going to save people I'm sorry go ahead
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.960]  well what I'm saying is it's not just the
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960]  fluorosilic acid that's that they're getting
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.960]  from China now shipping over but it's all
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960]  the arsenic and lead stay there explain
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.960]  that exactly stay there

[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.960]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.960]  i fell into a burning ring of fire
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:15.960]  i went down down down
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:17.960]  and the flames went higher
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.960]  i'm not going to talk about the products anymore
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.960]  that we just launched super metal vitality
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:23.960]  and the fluoride shield
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.960]  of course it pulls out a bunch of other toxins as well
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:27.960]  but i was asking you during the break
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.960]  and you said you know you'll talk about it
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.960]  your super metal vitality that you developed
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.960]  for us you're explaining it gets your body
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:35.960]  to release the testosterone how does it do that
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  well what i like to do
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.960]  is formulate stuff
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.960]  that's going to actually help the body heal itself
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.960]  instead of having somebody
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:45.960]  that just needs to be on something forever
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  so what that's designed to do
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.960]  since automatically the male body
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.960]  quits producing hormones
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.960]  at least testosterone and dha
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.960]  and some of the male hormones
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.960]  by around 30 to 40
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.960]  but we're seeing that even younger now
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.960]  because of the estrogen dominance
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.960]  what i wanted to do is actually
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.960]  instead of like what's going on right now
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.960]  where guys are going to the doctor
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.960]  and they're getting these testosterone shots
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  and all this testosterone creams
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.960]  and it's altering their hormone levels
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.960]  because they're shooting it into their bloodstream
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.960]  what i wanted to do is put stuff together
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.960]  where it was going to naturally balance out
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.960]  your hormone levels
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.960]  so the mixture of herbs and constituents
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.960]  actually increases your testosterone levels
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]  by let's say 20-25%
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]  because it
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  your body produces more testosterone
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.960]  and it regulates the production
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.960]  of estrogen
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.960]  again i just want to be honest
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.960]  i take like a third of what the recommended dose is
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.960]  growth hormone too
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.960]  growth hormone is a major factor
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  and the formula was designed
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.960]  to balance out your growth hormone levels as well
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.960]  it's amazing
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.960]  getting back into fluoride
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.960]  studies saying get it out of the water
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.960]  cancer, IQ reductions
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.960]  what are they going to do
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  we can put those on screen
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.960]  just google Harvard study IQ
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.960]  how can they keep it in the water
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.960]  when it's totally on record
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.960]  and all their own EPA
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.960]  scientists are saying get it out
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.960]  and FDA
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  if you take a pea size amount of toothpaste
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.960]  you're supposed to
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.960]  if you swallow a pea size amount of toothpaste
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.960]  you're supposed to call poison control
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:21.960]  you're supposed to report by
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.960]  just by the general citizens
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.960]  by getting the information out
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.960]  the government
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.960]  at the scientist level says take it out
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  but the politicians won't
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.960]  well that's just because that's how the system works
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  they're not going to take it out
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.960]  because they don't want a bunch of healthy people around
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  hopefully
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.960]  there is more
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  science leading to the damaging effects
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:45.960]  of fluoride every single day
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  which is a good thing
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.960]  hopefully in the next few years
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.960]  we can completely get it out
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.960]  look at all the other countries that don't even fluoridate their water
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.960]  or pulling it
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.960]  Germany, England, they're pulling it
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.960]  and China, which is a big manufacturer
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.960]  of arms and everything
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.960]  is shipping us all that fluoride
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.960]  that toxic fluoride to put it in our water system
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.960]  and they put iodine in the water
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.960]  heavily contaminated
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.960]  I've seen pictures of people
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.960]  at the water plants, the technicians
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.960]  that add it to the buckets
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  at the bottom of the bucket
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:19.960]  they don't even know what it is
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:21.960]  there's local newscast of all places
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.960]  Oklahoma did one or another, I've aired them
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:25.960]  where they went and tested
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.960]  it says fluoride from China
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.960]  and half of it's not even fluoride
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:31.960]  it's a mixture of every poison they've got in China
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960]  they ship here for the idiot Americans water
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.960]  that's because China gets rid of all their toxic
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  waste by shipping it over here
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.960]  all the lead and the arsenic
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.960]  and the cadmium
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.960]  and the melamine for the babies
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.960]  I saw a statistic
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.960]  that 90% of pharmaceuticals
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.960]  are made in China including
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.960]  a lot of the vitamins
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  that's right, that's right
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:55.960]  there's a lot of counterfeiting going on over in China too
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.960]  there's counterfeiters out there right now
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.960]  that are taking popular products
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:01.960]  they're getting a manufactured in China
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.960]  they're putting the exact label on them
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.960]  and they're selling them on Amazon and through eBay
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:07.960]  so if you're looking for a good quality product
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:09.960]  make sure you go to the source
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.960]  or make sure you go to someone reputable
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.960]  out there and they're taking over
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:15.960]  and they're focusing on the nutrition industry
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  because the nutrition and supplement industry
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.960]  is growing at a rapid rate
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.960]  because people don't want to have to rely on their doctors anymore
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960]  Wow
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.960]  Alright, infowarslife.com

[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.960]  it won't be four to six weeks until we get more
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:33.960]  of both of these
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.960]  infowarslife.com
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  Alright, Dr. Grapp, I'm going to come back in the five minutes

[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.960]  with Obamacare
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.960]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:14.960]  out of the water supply yet
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.960]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.960]  I am extremely excited to announce
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.960]  the exclusive infowarslife
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.960]  fluoride shield formulation
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.960]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:27.960]  from around the world to help the body
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.960]  remove not just toxic fluoride
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:30.960]  residues from the body
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:32.960]  but a whole host of toxic substances
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.960]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.960]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:39.960]  I use fluoride shield every day
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.960]  secure your fluoride shield
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:43.960]  and other pioneering formulations

[01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:47.960]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:49.960]  and support the info war at the same time
[01:59:49.960 --> 02:00:11.960]  That's infowarslife.com
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.960]  Alex Jones
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.960]  We've got NSA whistleblower
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.960]  par excellence
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.960]  formerly in NSA security
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.960]  and I don't mean security guards out front
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.960]  I mean actually over NSA security areas
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.960]  who is one of the main people
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.960]  in the top two or three days
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.960]  up there with Snowden
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.960]  it's just that when he blew the whistle
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960]  they weren't arresting people back then
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.960]  for exposing criminal spying
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.960]  He's the one of course months ago
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.960]  that explained all the European spying
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.960]  exactly what was happening
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  it broken the London Guardian
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.960]  and then they retracted the story
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.960]  under British government threats
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.960]  but it was still too late
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.960]  now the British government is outthreatening again
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.960]  Right now let's go to Terry in Washington
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.960]  Terry, thanks for holding them
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.960]  we'll go to JD, Juan, Don
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.960]  and uh
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.960]  I didn't say that on purpose but that actually says
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  Don Juan on the screen
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:29.960]  with the two names next to each other
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.960]  Let's go to Terry in Washington
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.960]  go ahead
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.960]  Hey, Alex
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.960]  Hey buddy
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.960]  Hey, I'm sitting here and watching what you're radiating
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  I can't believe
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.960]  how old Bob and Lynn Biden
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:45.960]  have screwed this country up so bad
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.960]  I mean
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.960]  Obama Bin Leiden
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  that's a good name for them, yeah
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960]  Obama and Lynn Biden
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:55.960]  Yeah, there you go
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.960]  Don't forget the succulent, luscious Hillary
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:01:59.960]  Oh God
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:01.960]  That's it, oh man
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.960]  I'll tell you if she gets in we're really screwed
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.960]  Do you think our girlfriends really like her?
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.960]  or just
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:09.960]  it's like asking to the playmates
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:11.960]  really like Hugh Hefner or is it Forrest Money
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.960]  I wonder if all the women like
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.960]  with her
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.960]  and Janet Reno and all of them
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.960]  because Janet Reno came out and the Miami papers got caught
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:21.960]  with a 12 year old in the back of a car
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.960]  Janet Reno years ago, it was like 15 years ago
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:25.960]  was on so many drugs
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.960]  that she was
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:29.960]  pulled over, had vomited all over the
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  child that was a CPS child
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  I'm sorry, go ahead, what were you saying?
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  That's true story by the way
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.960]  No, that's fine
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:39.960]  The NSA
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.960]  Now we know
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.960]  the real story behind
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:45.960]  what happened in the last couple years
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.960]  but
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.960]  I challenged Obama
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.960]  to tell me why
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.960]  he didn't stop
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.960]  the shooting at the theater
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.960]  Sandy Hook
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.960]  Fort Hood
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:01.960]  the Boston Marathon bombing
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.960]  so that tells you right there
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  the NSA does not work
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.960]  and it's not there for that reason
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.960]  It's not there for that reason
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  Well, number one
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.960]  questioning our leader is racist
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:17.960]  do you understand you may have to be sent
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.960]  for reeducation
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.960]  plus you don't criticize our leader
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  I appreciate your call
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.960]  I apologize for that racism folks
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:27.960]  Let's talk to JD in California
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.960]  Welcome sir
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:31.960]  Hello
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.960]  Yes sir
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:35.960]  Yeah, I was just going through
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.960]  there and I saw that healthcare.gov
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.960]  story
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:41.960]  and I noticed I wonder if it's one of
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:43.960]  the elite sick joke or something
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:45.960]  but it looks like somebody is
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.960]  hanging themselves to death
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.960]  all you see is a pair of legs and a kicked out
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.960]  stool underneath them
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.960]  What are you talking about specifically
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.960]  at healthcare.gov
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.960]  Just the cover page
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.960]  of the website
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:01.960]  Well, you know, they did have
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.960]  the number 1-800-FU
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:05.960]  on purpose
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  because you have to understand with con artists
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  throwing it in your face is
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:11.960]  the most luscious part
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:13.960]  How much do you think his
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.960]  followers will take
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:17.960]  Well, like you joke about all the time
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.960]  even though it's not a joke
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.960]  I really think that they would walk right off the cliff
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.960]  but they're heading the guillotine hole
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.960]  you know as long as they promise
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.960]  something free they're just that
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.960]  gullible and you know
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.960]  willing to believe that something's going to come free
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:33.960]  Well, yeah, I mean that ought to be a plan
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.960]  just to say look stick your head in the guillotine
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:37.960]  and you're going to not be racist
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.960]  and the average person
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.960]  would actually kill people
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:43.960]  Yeah, that's right, the healthcare insurance
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.960]  market is open, there it is, I think that's one of the tiles
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.960]  we put together or somebody else did
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.960]  that's not officially on the site but don't give them any ideas
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.960]  because they did put on the cover of Newsweek
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.960]  the case for killing Granny and it showed a plug being
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:55.960]  pulled out of the wall
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.960]  dumb little yuppies think they're going to get some extra goodies
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:01.960]  we'll be right back
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.960]  I've done deep research
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.960]  nascent iodine is the purest cleanest
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:33.960]  absolute best form of iodine
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.960]  to protect yourself and your family
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:37.960]  it's made right here in the USA
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:39.960]  completely non-GMO
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.960]  I searched out the best quality
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.960]  and now have developed a double strength form
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:45.960]  of nascent iodine exclusively available
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.960]  at infowarslife.com
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:49.960]  nascent iodine is on record
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.960]  as one of the only safe ways to detox
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.960]  from fluoride poisoning
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:55.960]  survival shield nascent iodine
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:57.960]  for super high quality nascent iodine today
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.960]  at infowarslife.com
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:01.960]  that's infowarslife.com
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.960]  Alex Jones here to tell you about

[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.960]  up at drudgereport.com
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  from Breitbart.com
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.960]  Germany
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:35.960]  U.S. may have targeted

[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.960]  so ridiculous
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.960]  it's kind of like oh

[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.960]  because we ordered all the software makers to make them
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  and now we're where the Chinese government may be using
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.960]  and jeeper creeper

[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:05.960]  the truth is they can't hide any of this
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:07.960]  they don't hide any of it
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.960]  it's public that
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:11.960]  the big defense contractors
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:13.960]  you know will run giant child kidnapping rings
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.960]  worldwide including the U.S.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.960]  Fox News always asking where's this kid
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:19.960]  they were raped and murdered 20 years ago
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.960]  in Saudi Arabia
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:23.960]  those guys pay a lot to murder your child
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:25.960]  what do you think they're doing in there right now
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.960]  I mean it's not like it's some secret
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:31.960]  your daughter might still be alive in Thailand
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.960]  right now in a dungeon
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:35.960]  20 years later
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:37.960]  got a bunch of murderers running the country
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.960]  a bunch of mafia people that make mafia look like good guys
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:41.960]  everybody's so naive
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:43.960]  or the cops
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:45.960]  I know we're all afraid
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  and yeah you're right about a better watcher
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  so I'm not going along
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.960]  what do you think I intend to do here
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.960]  I'm fully playing on them killing me
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.960]  I don't look forward to it and don't like it
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:57.960]  but I'm like full steam ahead
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.960]  ramming speed that's the only spirit you can have
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:01.960]  I cannot
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:03.960]  help but resist these people
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:05.960]  who's going to stand up for all these kids
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:07.960]  who's going to stand up for all these women
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.960]  you want to be a gangster culture
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:11.960]  they think you think that's cool
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:13.960]  well you now live in one you're the slave
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:15.960]  stop acting like one
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:17.960]  laying down only encourages it
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:19.960]  look at this, Merkel
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:21.960]  Bush used to have a toilet that followed him around
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:23.960]  and he actually had a groom of the stool
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.960]  George W. Bush
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.960]  that would tidy him up make sure that
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  none of the paper got left or anything
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.960]  was a chemical toilet
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:33.960]  because they caught the French
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:35.960]  and others setting up stuff in the surlyes
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.960]  to find out what George W. Bush is on
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.960]  of course
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:41.960]  in fact I would expect the NSA
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.960]  to be spying on Merkel
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.960]  that's who you're supposed to spy on
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.960]  as foreign governments
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.960]  you're not supposed to spy on the American people
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:51.960]  and supposed to give all your Google searches
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.960]  to the perverts at the TSA
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:55.960]  everything's backwards here
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:57.960]  you're supposed to spy on Herr Merkel
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.960]  but the globalists are letting all this come out
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:01.960]  so they won't be spied on
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:03.960]  see how that works
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.960]  it's unbelievable let's go to phone calls here
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.960]  and I do mean Herr Merkel
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.960]  who looks like the cousin of Janet Reno
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.960]  maybe Merkel's the mother
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:13.960]  of
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.960]  who's that young man on MSNBC
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:17.960]  Maddow
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.960]  let's go to Jonathan in New York
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.960]  I mean that lady on there
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.960]  excuse me
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.960]  no, no, no
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.960]  you used to have a show on Saturday Night Live
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.960]  now
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.960]  it's got a show on
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  MSNBC I forget the name
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.960]  what's the name of the
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.960]  Pat? Pat
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.960]  what's the name of Pat's show on MSNBC
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.960]  what do they call it? The Pat Show
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.960]  or oh no
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.960]  I thought it was the Pat Show
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.960]  it's not the Rachel Maddow show
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.960]  okay whatever
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.960]  and look there she is on screen
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:53.960]  giving birth to TSA it doesn't matter
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:55.960]  she runs off, it runs off
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.960]  you know to suck our blood
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:12:59.960]  you're a radio listener
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:01.960]  you have to actually watch this on info wars.com
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:03.960]  or prisonfunded.tv
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:05.960]  and you can see the birth of
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.960]  actual footage
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.960]  the birth of Rachel Maddow
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960]  and mommy running away
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.960]  to help all the people
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.960]  at the university
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:17.960]  to help give all the people
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.960]  the young ladies their admission
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:21.960]  alright let's go ahead
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.960]  Jonathan you got cut off
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:25.960]  by the break you had another point go ahead sir
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.960]  yeah
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:29.960]  thanks for having me I'll talk to you again
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.960]  I live in FEMA region number two New York state
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.960]  and I think I remember you saying that
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.960]  within the month of November they get to start
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.960]  doing quote unquote
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:39.960]  the shutdowns of the power grid
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.960]  so I think this is just perfect timing
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.960]  for them to be showing this
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:45.960]  American blackout video
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  just before everything starts
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:49.960]  well no they have actuaries of the power companies
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:51.960]  to get you ready to pay four or five times
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  what you did and get power about three hours
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:55.960]  a night enough
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:57.960]  because they can control you it'll come on when you get
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:59.960]  home and you're supposed to go to bed by eight
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:01.960]  so you'll have it like five to eight
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.960]  you understand I mean no that's the plan
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.960]  you're gonna live in hell
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:07.960]  that's the plan to operas they teach the kids
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:09.960]  in Britain with these training videos
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.960]  you'll get meat once a year
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:13.960]  to go somewhere you'll have to get authorization
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:15.960]  on your smartphone this is all the plan
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:17.960]  ration cards to eat
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:19.960]  I mean hell world hell world
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:21.960]  with globalist and jet copters
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:23.960]  above you with your kid with your kidnap child
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.960]  with them I mean literally just feeding on you
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:27.960]  how's that sound
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:29.960]  I
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:31.960]  had no comment with that one then
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:33.960]  well god bless you I'm gonna jump
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.960]  no in every culture you get an elite
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:37.960]  who likes to be psychopathic so the druid elite
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:39.960]  would say I want your kids a sacrifice
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:41.960]  the asex said I want your kids a sacrifice
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:43.960]  the Babylonian said I want your kids a sacrifice
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.960]  the Romans said I want your kids in the arena to sacrifice
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:47.960]  when a Roman lord would die
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  they would kill slaves fight to the death
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.960]  over it
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.960]  the psychopaths got control of some of the Norman
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.960]  they said when the noble dies
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.960]  we burn your wife we don't want to listen to her
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:59.960]  that's actually a good custom I'm joking
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:01.960]  I mean all this stuff every culture
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.960]  they demand to murder you and then you bow
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  and they cut your heart out
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:07.960]  and then the priest class with the asex
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.960]  and the Mayans and other Mayan cultures
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:11.960]  is all Mayan
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:13.960]  the lower priest class
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:15.960]  is running off the daily sacrifices
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.960]  and every city had to have it
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:19.960]  you had to have meat
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:21.960]  and the premium the god wanted a child
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:23.960]  because you know
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:25.960]  Chokmul or Quitscatlapodal or
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.960]  Winged Serpent they wanted
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.960]  because the god wanted the meat because obviously the priest
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:31.960]  tasted it that tasted better everybody knows veal's better
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.960]  and Longham veal's
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.960]  better and so they would
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.960]  hang the bodies down at the bottom of the pyramid
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.960]  and then you would go and pay
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.960]  you're offering the priest class to get a succulent
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:43.960]  a slice
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:45.960]  and I mean what's wrong with that
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.960]  and I'll guarantee you if you were against that
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.960]  you would have been called an extremist
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.960]  and every culture ate children
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.960]  I mean don't just say it's the asex
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.960]  they just kind of created a science
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.960]  and they had good agriculture with their chalupas
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:15:59.960]  that's what they called them
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.960]  these floating wooden rafts
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:03.960]  on rivers that you could get
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:05.960]  like five or six growth cycles a year
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.960]  not just two so they had a huge population
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:09.960]  and meat was on the dish
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.960]  I mean who doesn't like meat
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.960]  I mean flesh, human flesh
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.960]  tastes like pork they say it was delicious and succulent
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.960]  okay and I support it
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:19.960]  I support all government not supporting governments hateful
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:21.960]  and evil and I don't be an extremist
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:23.960]  now let's talk to Don at Tennessee Don you're on the air
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.960]  go ahead of course they're reinventing all that now
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.960]  they're reinventing governments
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:29.960]  God bow down to it
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.960]  do whatever it says give us total power
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.960]  and so they're taking the offering now taking your baby's diaper off
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.960]  so the pedo
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:37.960]  TSA person likes to look at that
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:39.960]  you know and some of them have the job
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.960]  you can see the ones I go look at that when he's looking at that hot chick
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:43.960]  he's gonna grab her they're gonna buzz her
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:45.960]  oh yeah oh yeah we'll sit there and drink coffee
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.960]  oh yeah look at that they're going after
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:49.960]  look at that woman
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:51.960]  we're walking up to this rock concert
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:53.960]  with one of my friend's wives
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:55.960]  looks like a Miss America
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:57.960]  and they
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.960]  flagged her
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:01.960]  and it was a woman
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:03.960]  and boy let me tell you she took her time
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.960]  and was drooling
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:07.960]  let me tell you she got
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:09.960]  I always sat there and watched it and she grabbed her crotch
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:11.960]  grabbed her
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:13.960]  and I know you want to go in
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:15.960]  and then grabbed her breast right in front of me
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:17.960]  and I'm sorry this is pornographic this is what they do in America
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:19.960]  and the guys were all laughing
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.960]  and looking at us going
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:23.960]  I mean it was almost going to be like
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:25.960]  wow wow wow
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:27.960]  wow wow land of the free
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:29.960]  home of the brave

[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:33.960]  and I don't blame that woman
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:35.960]  attractive woman but that woman don't like you
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.960]  she likes men see
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:39.960]  but doesn't matter you get to do whatever you want
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.960]  it's all about your power
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.960]  and next it will be eating children
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:45.960]  I'm telling you if they get their way
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:47.960]  for the earth
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:49.960]  actually the UN biological diversity assessment
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.960]  1996
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:53.960]  actually says they want to reintroduce human sacrifice
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:55.960]  like the Aztecs so see they're already promoting
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:57.960]  and I'm not joking if you just tuned in
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.960]  Don and Tennessee I apologize sir
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:01.960]  you've been holding like a real trooper go ahead
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:03.960]  sir uh
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:05.960]  over the past year federal funds
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.960]  for hospital care of the poor have been cut
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.960]  I mean this means overlays
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:11.960]  nurses doctors have been let go
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:13.960]  at one hospital here in town
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:15.960]  800 people have been let go
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:17.960]  with another one 400 people
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:19.960]  were let go and even
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.960]  they even cut the size of the
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.960]  of the lunchroom in half
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.960]  no no it's a devastating operation
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:27.960]  they're shutting everything down 300,000
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.960]  just lost their healthcare set to double in Florida
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:31.960]  I mean isn't this great
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:33.960]  this is a substantial effect
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:35.960]  on the least our local economy
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.960]  because they've sent a lot of the factory
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:39.960]  jobs overseas and
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:41.960]  these are the last kind of
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:43.960]  golden nugget
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:45.960]  and they're going to cut the welfare
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:47.960]  and they're going to cut the food stamps
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:49.960]  right at the same time how's that sound
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:51.960]  well
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:53.960]  I'm retired so I'm a little bit out of the mess
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.960]  but uh thanks
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.960]  for listening to me
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:18:59.960]  and sir I appreciate you holding

[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:03.960]  and actually I make jokes that it's so sad
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.960]  it's gallows humor they are devastating
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:07.960]  the economy right now
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:09.960]  and uh did you see
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:11.960]  where they're hiring arm guards now for financial collapse
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:13.960]  at the federal biz opportunities
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:15.960]  website
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:17.960]  yes sir I heard about that
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:19.960]  on a jolly
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:21.960]  show too but I mean you understand
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:23.960]  that this is all planned out
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:25.960]  that's at infowars.com
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.960]  it's all planned out you understand
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:29.960]  well it certainly
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.960]  looks planned out
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:33.960]  one thing that kind of disturbed me is I
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.960]  like to write letters to my
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.960]  congressman and during the federal
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:39.960]  shut down they actually let
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.960]  some of the office workers
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:43.960]  for the senators and stuff
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:45.960]  go hang

[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:51.960]  it looks like the whole democracy
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:55.960]  is shutting down if you ask me
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.960]  well sir here's the

[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:19.960]  we are what we eat
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.960]  our food is devoid of nutrition
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:23.960]  and processed with poisons and additives
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:25.960]  our water is filled
[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.960]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:29.960]  all of this has been engineered

[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:33.960]  turn the tide against the eugenicist
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:35.960]  by giving ourselves the nutrients

[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:07.960]  out of our staple foods
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:09.960]  and replaced with the halogen bromine
[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:11.960]  a practice now banned
[02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:13.960]  in nations around the world
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:15.960]  guess what else is in the halogen family
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.960]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen
[02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:19.960]  Alex Jones here in 1924
[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:21.960]  federal government did the right thing
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:23.960]  and encouraged salt producers
[02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.960]  to add iodine it's the good
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:27.960]  halogen on the periodic table
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:29.960]  and the results are on record
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:31.960]  reports documented a 15 point
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:33.960]  IQ increase in areas
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.960]  that had previously been deficient in iodine
[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:37.960]  bottom line iodine is
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.960]  important unbound clean
[02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:41.960]  in a glycerin base
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:43.960]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself

[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.960]  Wayne Madsen is our guest
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:47.960]  and back in June
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:49.960]  of this year the London Guardian
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:51.960]  interviewed him
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:53.960]  he laid out how they're spying
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:55.960]  where they were spying what they're doing
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.960]  but he pointed out Europe
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:33:59.960]  was also spying back
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:01.960]  what was going on with it
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.960]  they didn't say it was discredited
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:05.960]  they didn't say it existed
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.960]  it was taken down less than a day later
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.960]  then they started having all these government operatives
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.960]  attacking they had the White House run
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:13.960]  MSNBC come out and just say oh
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:15.960]  Wayne Madsen is crazy
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:17.960]  CNN attacked him
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.960]  who else attacked you
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:21.960]  my point is that it shows
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:23.960]  the daily beast
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.960]  that's right
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:27.960]  and Wayne noticed
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:29.960]  it's not just that they're lap dogs
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.960]  they won't report the news
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:33.960]  they attack real journalists
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.960]  who are getting death threats
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.960]  these are enemy soldiers basically
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:39.960]  well you know that whole issue
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.960]  it was interesting
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:43.960]  I mentioned how the Twitter campaign
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:45.960]  started and it was both in the US
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:47.960]  and the UK
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:49.960]  and one of the guys in the UK
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.960]  was a guy named Damien Thompson
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:53.960]  he works for the Guardian and the Observers
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.960]  competitor the Daily Telegraph
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.960]  which I call the Daily Tory Graph
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:59.960]  you know they're just in bed
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.960]  with the Tory party over there
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:03.960]  and
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:05.960]  you know that should have been no surprise
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.960]  that they would have attacked
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:09.960]  their competitor but this was a
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.960]  Twitter campaign and I would note
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.960]  it's very interesting NSA used to just
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:15.960]  maintain a system
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:17.960]  called first groups and they changed the name
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:19.960]  since I exposed it but they would just keep
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:21.960]  track of journalists who wrote about NSA
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.960]  obviously they were after their
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:25.960]  sources but it was done very quietly
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:27.960]  very covertly
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.960]  but now they're basically
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:31.960]  more aggressive
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.960]  they're hiring but basically they got their
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.960]  shills out there appearing on
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:37.960]  as you said MSNBC, CNN
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:39.960]  they were on this reliable sources
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:41.960]  that used to be how
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.960]  Howie Kurtz's show on CNN where they
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:45.960]  had three guys with the
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:47.960]  Daily Beast all attacking me
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:49.960]  you know so
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:51.960]  that's great television
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:53.960]  journalism but just
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:55.960]  recently
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.960]  the association
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:59.960]  newspaper editorial
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.960]  writers had a meeting
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:03.960]  where Newport Rhode Island where they gave
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:05.960]  an award to the
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.960]  president of the Naval War College
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.960]  and it's his people
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.960]  his professors that are launching
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.960]  the personal attacks against
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:15.960]  anyone who writes about NSA
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.960]  NSA whistleblowers Tom Drake
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.960]  Bill
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:21.960]  Benny, Kirk Webe
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:23.960]  Ray McGovern
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:25.960]  myself
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.960]  Jim Bamford
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.960]  all these individuals are constantly
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.960]  being attacked out of the Naval War College
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.960]  on Naval War College time
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:35.960]  they claim to not use the Naval War College
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:37.960]  computers but somebody
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:39.960]  on WordPress has a blog where
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:41.960]  they're attacking this group
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:43.960]  at the Naval War College and the latest
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:45.960]  I heard is these professors
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:47.960]  think that I'm secretly running this
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.960]  blog on WordPress which I'm not
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:51.960]  I don't know it's anonymous I don't know
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:53.960]  who runs it but they're apparently talking
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:55.960]  about threatening me with the lawsuit I said bring
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:57.960]  it on come on I want
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:36:59.960]  any judge to laugh that one out
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:01.960]  and you know I might have to even
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:03.960]  subpoena their friends at NSA
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.960]  for their surveillance records
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:07.960]  to show that you know I have nothing
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:09.960]  to do with any any blogs
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.960]  although I agree with what the blog
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.960]  is saying they're saying that these guys are violating
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:15.960]  the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:17.960]  political activity on government
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.960]  time we're paying for this
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:21.960]  well it's famous
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.960]  I mean look at the announcements
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:25.960]  that they've now lifted the ban on domestic
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:27.960]  Pentagon lying and
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:29.960]  psyops and so that's
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.960]  going on but separately NSA propaganda
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.960]  video among the highest
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:35.960]  downvoted percentages in YouTube
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:37.960]  history
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:39.960]  simply amazing the NSA
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.960]  director and the NSA
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:43.960]  director general Alexander
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:45.960]  came out and said
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.960]  we need to persecute the press we need
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.960]  to go after anybody that does this
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:51.960]  and it's got 14,561
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:53.960]  dislikes
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.960]  243
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.960]  likes and so you know here's
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.960]  the deal let
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.960]  the Pentagon come out and admit they're
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.960]  involved in domestic lying and propaganda
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:05.960]  they're just being traitors to America let
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.960]  these people attack you no one listens
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:09.960]  to them or believe in them you want to beg them
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.960]  to attack you Wayne oh I
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:13.960]  enjoy it I you know like I said
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:15.960]  they can bring on all the law suits
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.960]  they want for
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:19.960]  frivolous
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:21.960]  claims
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:23.960]  but you know it's funny
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:25.960]  Alexander gave an interview and I thought this was
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.960]  very bizarre he likened people
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.960]  who object to NSA surveillance
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.960]  to little boys
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:33.960]  who don't want to take a bath or a shower
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:35.960]  now I
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:37.960]  it's always perv talk it's like
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.960]  the senator that said
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:41.960]  these are lovepats from the TSA
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.960]  right well maybe general
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.960]  Alexander should get together with Jerry
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:47.960]  Sandusky if he's got this
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:49.960]  thing about little boys
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:51.960]  not taking showers you know
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:53.960]  I'm telling you though they
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:55.960]  always have this perv talk
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:57.960]  yeah but I mean here it is
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:59.960]  NSA director general Alexander and cyber
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.960]  security and everyone hates him
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:03.960]  and then he gets up there at the hacker
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:05.960]  conferences and talks to him in this
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.960]  droning mind control voice
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:09.960]  and then they later admit he was trying to calm
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.960]  the audience these people are crazy
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:13.960]  no one's buying their baloney
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:15.960]  where do you think all this is going
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:17.960]  where's their train headed right now
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:19.960]  oh my god well I'll tell you
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:21.960]  you know NSA will survive this
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:23.960]  I think Alexander may
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:25.960]  well he's going to be replaced anyway
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:27.960]  he's being replaced with a navy guy navy admiral
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:29.960]  we don't know much about him but you know
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.960]  these guys are always the same
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:33.960]  you know the NSA directors come and go
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:35.960]  although Hayden and Alexander
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.960]  were at NSA longer
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:39.960]  than any other predecessors
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:41.960]  which is rather odd that
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:43.960]  that position is starting to turn into
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:45.960]  like the FBI director which is a
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:47.960]  10 year term we do got a new one coming
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:49.960]  now Obama was
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:51.960]  that is swearing in yesterday so
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.960]  that's bad because
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:55.960]  at least you know if they
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:57.960]  you cycle in a new director every
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:59.960]  three or four years you might get
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:01.960]  you know some new blood but basically these guys
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:03.960]  come and go the issue at
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:05.960]  NSA is the civilians who remain
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.960]  there and really are running that show
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:09.960]  and so
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.960]  NSA will
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:13.960]  you know continue to exist
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:15.960]  they're talking about you know there's an internal
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.960]  commission or committee
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:19.960]  that was named that's going to come up with
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:21.960]  some reforms I mean that's like
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:23.960]  putting you know bank robbers
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:25.960]  on a committee on
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:27.960]  how to reduce bank debts
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.960]  sure it's a whitewash where they can
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:31.960]  suck in everybody and subpoena them and
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:33.960]  find out who's there and then make sure
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:35.960]  everybody gets cement shoes
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:37.960]  that's how testimony works
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:39.960]  I want to go to some phone calls across the board
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:41.960]  here you'll be able to speak to it all Wayne
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:43.960]  but first off the
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.960]  Google barges
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:47.960]  they're launching a bunch of them in San Francisco
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:49.960]  they admit that it's got
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:51.960]  Google personnel with department of defense
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:53.960]  we know Google's hooked in with NASA they get
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:55.960]  Air Force prices on gasoline
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.960]  Air Force refueling
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:59.960]  and you've got these barges being
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:01.960]  built the word is even if they pass
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.960]  laws against this these are going to hook into the Google
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:05.960]  glasses and the NSA
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.960]  to where it won't matter
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:09.960]  they'll be offshore
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.960]  with their own generators with
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.960]  with diesel
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:15.960]  brought out to them to run
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:17.960]  their little NSA cubes offshore
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.960]  what is your intel
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.960]  look Google was
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:23.960]  there's a CIA
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:25.960]  venture capital company called Incutel
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:27.960]  Incutel and
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:29.960]  before it was something else but this
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:31.960]  group exists to find
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:33.960]  up and coming tech companies
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:35.960]  especially in the Bay Area of San Francisco
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.960]  to give them seed
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.960]  money and Google got seed
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:41.960]  money from the CIA to create
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:43.960]  this huge
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:45.960]  search engine it was originally done for intelligence
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:47.960]  search
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.960]  and Oracle like that company
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.960]  was found it was CIA
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:53.960]  seed money to create relational database
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:55.960]  systems now we have Oracle
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:57.960]  Incorporated and Google Incorporated
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:41:59.960]  and we have Facebook
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:01.960]  Facebook got CIA seed money
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.960]  and Twitter I would
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:05.960]  I would almost guess that Twitter is no exception
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:07.960]  they had their IPO the other day
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:09.960]  well even local news admits it's a
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:11.960]  Google operation and tied into Google glasses
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:13.960]  I mean what do you
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.960]  do you have any idea exactly
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:17.960]  what this flotilla
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:19.960]  of cube like
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:21.960]  little NSA command bases
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.960]  are they're building
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:25.960]  yeah I'm not surprised they're on barges
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:27.960]  gambling barges if
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:29.960]  if the heat comes on
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:31.960]  gambling in these places
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.960]  they'll just take the barges and go elsewhere
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:35.960]  and stay with the Google barges
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:37.960]  they're very mobile so they can do
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:39.960]  whatever they want until
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:41.960]  why they picked the Bay Area because the one thing I know
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:43.960]  about the Bay Area the people in that
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:45.960]  area are very very concerned about
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.960]  their privacy they tend to be a lot more
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:49.960]  progressive
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:51.960]  in their thinking about
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:53.960]  government surveillance than
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:55.960]  other parts of the country but I'm sure
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:57.960]  one of the reasons it's on their own barges
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:42:59.960]  is mobility they can move them around
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:03.960]  other NSA
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:05.960]  points that we need to look at
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:07.960]  they're now announcing all those black boxes
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:09.960]  we mandated they're going to wirelessly track
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.960]  you and tax you and the NSA says
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:13.960]  we're allowed to track that without warrants
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:15.960]  well I mean they can say they're allowed
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:17.960]  to move into my house I guess next I mean
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:19.960]  it is just out of control
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:21.960]  what mad dogs
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:23.960]  it's like a government riot they're just
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:25.960]  it's a spirit of do whatever we want to the people
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:27.960]  is it because of these
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:29.960]  corporate interest I mean why is it
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.960]  so corrupt yeah NSA wouldn't
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:33.960]  be what NSA is today without
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:35.960]  the government contractors I mean
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:37.960]  after all Snowden was a contractor for booze
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.960]  Allen and you know that's
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:41.960]  that's part of the mix they make big bucks
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.960]  when General Hayden took over
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:45.960]  NSA you know SAIC
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:47.960]  cleaned up on a major
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:49.960]  rehaul of the signals intelligence
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:51.960]  operations there
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:53.960]  money was wasted on this thing
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:55.960]  called trailblazer
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:57.960]  hundred you know hundreds and
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:43:59.960]  hundreds of millions of dollars down the tubes
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:01.960]  and and and all
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:03.960]  of Hayden's buddies at SAIC
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:05.960]  made out like bandits
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.960]  and I'm glad you so we're paying for our own enslavement
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:09.960]  and they're getting rich in the process committing
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.960]  these crimes against our privacy while they
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:13.960]  gobble up America I'm glad you brought
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:15.960]  that up because Hayden is on
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:17.960]  a train for those that forgot last week
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:19.960]  literally
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:21.960]  bragging and from what I heard
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.960]  threatening reporters like I can have
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:25.960]  you renditioned I run everything
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:27.960]  black sites I'm in command
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:29.960]  on a train babbling as
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.960]  well you know louder than I am
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:33.960]  that he's just totally awesome
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:35.960]  and of course you've talked about
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:37.960]  him at CIA
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:39.960]  dinners you've been at and stuff
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:41.960]  coming up and getting in your face what I
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.960]  mean he just radiates to me
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:45.960]  the image
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.960]  of an absolute degenerate I'm sorry
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.960]  yeah well I mean Hayden
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:51.960]  Hayden there's
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:53.960]  a lot of information on his background
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:55.960]  too when you even want to get into the
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:57.960]  curb stuff too but
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:44:59.960]  his exploits in Sarajevo for example
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:01.960]  during the Balkans
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:03.960]  I don't have any intel I just look at him and he's a creep
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:05.960]  yeah well
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.960]  but hey look who Hayden's business
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:09.960]  partner is you know Hayden's in the chair
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:11.960]  top group with Michael
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:13.960]  chair top so you know this
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:15.960]  is the gruesome to some of surveillance
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:17.960]  when you think about it
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.960]  naked body scanner guy and then
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:21.960]  makes money off videotaping your children's
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:23.960]  private parts and then you got and then you got
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:25.960]  Alexander coming by retiring and he'll
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:27.960]  probably join him with his boys in the shower
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:29.960]  you know
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:31.960]  it sounds like the only guy they're missing is Jerry
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:33.960]  Sandusky let me ask this with all your DC
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:35.960]  madam until all the other stuff what percentage
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:37.960]  of people are
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:39.960]  pedophiles versus just perverts
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:41.960]  like what percentage are gay
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:43.960]  heterosexual or pedophiles in DC
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:45.960]  well as far as a gay
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.960]  I remember Barney Frank when he was caught
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:49.960]  running a callboy service out of his
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:51.960]  with underage with underage yeah
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.960]  and he said he said if you
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:55.960]  if you expel me
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:57.960]  or you know do anything other than a mile
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:45:59.960]  century I'm going to name 25%
[02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:01.960]  of the members of the house so I know
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.960]  for fact they're gay so that was in the
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:05.960]  mid 80s so there's
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:07.960]  a baseline from somebody I have to believe
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:09.960]  his numbers I mean he would know
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:11.960]  and then the
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:13.960]  other thing is in most of those 25%
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:15.960]  back then happened to have been Republicans
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:17.960]  and yeah that's the word
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.960]  generally Republicans are gay
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:21.960]  and
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:23.960]  and the Democrats like to rape women
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:25.960]  usually for some reason right right
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:27.960]  they're into the drunken debauchery
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:29.960]  business but I'm serious
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:31.960]  it keeps popping up they beat up and rape
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:33.960]  women right and then the
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.960]  and then the Republicans are gay but then across
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.960]  the board a large percentage are pedophiles
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.960]  yeah yeah a lot are and
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:41.960]  I think it's very hard to put a percentage
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:43.960]  on that but
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:45.960]  I mean we had another guy back then
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:47.960]  when Frank got caught
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.960]  there was Jerry Studs a congressman
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:51.960]  from Massachusetts and he was a Democrat
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:53.960]  by the way but he got caught with
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:55.960]  underage pages and but we'd seen that
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:57.960]  over and over again that's about an
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:46:59.960]  eight to ten year cycle in the
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:01.960]  in the Congress with these underage pages
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:03.960]  we had these blow
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:05.960]  blow ups in the early 80s and then we had
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.960]  mid 80s and then we had
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:09.960]  that guy well we had the White House
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:11.960]  with the underage callboys that was in the
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:13.960]  washington times right at the end of the
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:15.960]  80s that that story came out
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.960]  that involved members of Congress and we had
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:19.960]  what's his name fully from Florida and
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:21.960]  that in the most recent one a few years
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:23.960]  back
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:25.960]  wow well I want to go to some phone calls
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:27.960]  here Brian and David and Anthony
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:29.960]  and Andrew and others they'll be all over
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.960]  the map but Brian says
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:33.960]  is us special forces op vet
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:35.960]  wants to talk about government contracting
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:37.960]  he's probably got some comments on this go
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:39.960]  ahead Brian thanks for holding
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:41.960]  yeah I just had a couple of
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:43.960]  comments Alex
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:45.960]  what I wanted to mention about the
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:47.960]  contract you were talking yesterday about
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:49.960]  how much the police
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:51.960]  has been militarized in the U.S.
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:53.960]  and I was at a gun shop
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:55.960]  the other day and there was a guy
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:57.960]  wearing full multi cam state police
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.960]  Texas state police and I had
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:01.960]  a
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:03.960]  pistol on a side
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:05.960]  drop leg holster you know it looked like
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:07.960]  he was out of
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:09.960]  wider you know days or something
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.960]  but it was like full multi cam it's something
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:13.960]  that you would see you know overseas
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:15.960]  and so you see this militarization of what
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:17.960]  you're talking about and then you see the
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:19.960]  mentality of what you always say the guy
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:21.960]  fucking their eyes out at you and a lot of
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:23.960]  this is
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:25.960]  some of this is implemented from
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:27.960]  the prime vendor contract
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:29.960]  from you know there's like
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:31.960]  four of the prime vendors
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:33.960]  they changed the name of it it's the
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:35.960]  tailored logistics support
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:37.960]  contract I believe now
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:39.960]  so basically
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:41.960]  there was a
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:43.960]  strategy ship where
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:45.960]  the government contractors I think after
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:47.960]  they realized that the U.S.
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:49.960]  would be pulling out of the Middle East
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:51.960]  you know they were making a bunch of money for a long time
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:53.960]  but then once it started to
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:55.960]  scale down they were trying to figure out
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:57.960]  how are we going to make money
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:48:59.960]  how are we going to continue to make money
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:01.960]  and then also who are we going to sell to
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:03.960]  that's right they're on record now saying
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:05.960]  they're now going to make the veterans and gun owners
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:07.960]  their new enemy and the government's giving them
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.960]  the funds to turn every town into
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:11.960]  Fallujah go ahead and finish your point
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:13.960]  well basically
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:15.960]  you know the veterans
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.960]  I mean a lot of them are patriots the ones
[02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:19.960]  that aren't everybody you know
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:21.960]  they still kind of want to live out
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:23.960]  you know some of the experience
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:25.960]  experiences that they had over there
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:27.960]  and that doesn't necessarily always have to be
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.960]  that but if they get into
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.960]  the you know the police or anything back
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:33.960]  here then a lot of what they learned overseas
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:35.960]  is actually being pushed on to
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:37.960]  American citizens they don't think about things like
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:39.960]  the Constitution they're right that they're violating
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:41.960]  and so where you were saying the rifle
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:43.960]  you know the point is that somebody's head
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:45.960]  wherever that was the other day
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:47.960]  that's something that you'd see standard overseas
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:49.960]  that's Sacramento yeah now
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:51.960]  they just any excuse
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:53.960]  to shake us down and teach us for slaves
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:55.960]  and the cops don't get they're being given
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.960]  this evil power because the globalists
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:49:59.960]  are getting ready to take us down I mean
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:01.960]  these cops are gonna have their family bankrupt
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:03.960]  mama ain't gonna have a house
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.960]  I mean you guys are literally helping bring on our destruction
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:07.960]  the good news is I see the police
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:09.960]  actually waking up
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.960]  but the problem is they don't care they just put those guys
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:13.960]  on you know duty writing tickets
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:15.960]  and they put the guy that wants to be Rambo
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:17.960]  in charge you know of a Humvee
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:19.960]  with a machine gun on it at a checkpoint
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.960]  and he pulled up to it I mean now they have
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.960]  points with active duty Marines
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:25.960]  in California searching people
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:27.960]  I mean it's totally evil they're getting ready for collapse
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:29.960]  but any other points
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:31.960]  yeah just two real quick
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:33.960]  points one thing
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:35.960]  Art Acevedo right before you had him on
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:37.960]  your show I tried to get in at the time
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:39.960]  there was a big Texas police chief
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.960]  meeting retired and I think
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:43.960]  current and he had gone
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:45.960]  and spoke at the meeting and I heard
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:47.960]  from a police chief buddy mine he was retired
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:49.960]  and he said that
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:51.960]  you know on your show he said oh I'm not
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:53.960]  you know I don't want to do this I want to do that
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:55.960]  I know that from that meeting
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  he actually got up in front of all these police chiefs
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.960]  retired and current and basically said
[02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:27.960]  stay there stay there I want to hear this

[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:40.720]  guy was really cussing. We went back to the video. He wasn't. He just really is like siop
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:46.520]  trained man. We're, you'll almost be convinced by what he's saying. And it's amazing. So,
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:52.680]  so tell us at, at, at this police chief meeting, what your friend, this retired police chief
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:57.800]  said Art Acevedo said, look, I know he wouldn't be getting invited up to hang out with Obama
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:01.520]  and call for national gun control, but he's here. Like, I don't want your guns. I just
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:05.560]  want what Obama wants. Feinstein, I don't want your guns. I'm just on records saying
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.200]  ban them all. So, so tell us what Art Acevedo really said.
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:15.120]  So what I was told was that he basically got up in front of everybody and, um, and was
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:19.960]  trying to convince, you know, all the, these police chiefs that we really have to move
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:26.560]  toward, you know, some sort of gun control policy and that, um, uh, that's a whole,
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:31.840]  you know, auditorium of all these current and previous police chief that it was just
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:35.000]  like an awkward silence and everybody kind of started looking around at each other. So
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  it didn't go over well with a lot of, I guess there's a lot of Texas Patriots still left.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.040]  And, uh, and so it didn't go over well. And that was just a very kind of awkward moment.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:49.240]  I think for him, it's for everybody in the room. Um, so that was refreshing here. I
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:53.760]  wanted to try to, you know, get online to actually ask him directly about that. Cause
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:57.400]  you could probably find out what the, what the conference is. I don't know if it happened
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:55:59.920]  one, once a year. I'll actually try to find out myself.
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:04.560]  Well, he's on record saying that, and you know, his dad ran guns into Cuba against Fidel.
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:08.280]  That's why I've told him, I said, look, you say you're not a communist, but go join Fidel.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.160]  They took the guns there. I mean, I'm not, Art Acevedo is a real charming guy, but man,
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:17.800]  I tell you, you know, it's really sad folks. I appreciate your call. Let me tell you that
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:23.240]  their strategy is to turn the state red by bringing in Hispanic voters, making them
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.120]  legal and then, and then getting them to vote to take the guns. Why would folks fleeing
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:32.440]  Mexico where you can't own guns want to come here and then be disarmed here as well? I
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  mean, that's, you know, it's just, it's so sick. It's so sick. Um, let's get, uh, Wayne
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.040]  Madsen's take on what he just heard. What is the disarmament agenda really all about
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:44.040]  Wayne Madsen?
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:51.880]  Well, I mean, when you look at what's going on, you know, we had the UN, uh, uh, adopt
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:57:02.640]  or approve this small arms treaty. You know, every time they do that, though, they talk
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:09.640]  about small arms control around the world. Yet, when you go into these war zones, like
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:15.000]  Syria, for example, they're still exporting these, these weapons to these rebel groups.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:20.640]  And who are the rebels? Al-Qaeda? It doesn't seem like there's any kind of, uh, logical
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:23.680]  policy at play here.
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:28.560]  And now we've got the government schools under Michelle Obama saying you parents can't be
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:34.920]  trusted to pack their school lunches. Just broken infowars.com by Steve Watson. School
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:43.640]  test teachers, kids, command, this is a quote, commands of government officials must be obeyed

[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:59.880]  whistleblower. What, what is it the heart of this authoritarian takeover? And then tell
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:02.880]  us about your new book that folks can find at Wayne Madsen report.com.
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:08.720]  Well, it's all about, you know, obeying orders. Um, I thought it was interesting the other
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:13.960]  day I read a story about a kid that pointed his finger at another child in school. Like
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:20.440]  bang bang, kid was suspended immediately. I mean, which one of us has never done something
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:21.440]  like that?
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:26.960]  Well, no, it exactly, it's about we're all criminals now for something that isn't criminal,
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:31.240]  but they're okay. And if you look on screen of your TV viewer, the name of Wayne Madsen's
[02:58:31.240 --> 02:58:36.520]  book, I'll give that to folks, National Security Agency surveillance, reflections and revelations
