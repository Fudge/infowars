[00:00.000 --> 00:08.080]  Welcome to the InfoWars Sunday broadcast and today we're going to be joined by Alex Jones
[00:08.080 --> 00:10.200]  as well as by Roger Stone.
[00:10.200 --> 00:11.680]  He'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:11.680 --> 00:13.240]  We have a lot of breaking news.
[00:13.240 --> 00:19.920]  You've probably seen at this point the patriot, I guess you could call him Gorilla Truther,
[00:19.920 --> 00:26.080]  getting behind the Fox News set and exposing the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[00:26.080 --> 00:31.080]  Now this is something that Alex put out on Friday and in less than 24 hours we had somebody
[00:31.080 --> 00:32.080]  taking him up on his offer.
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.880]  And of course he put a lot of money into the kitty to pay people to get this message out.
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.720]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are not about consensual sex that's happened with his so
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.680]  called bimbos that she talked about.
[00:46.680 --> 00:52.000]  Now he had a lot of women on the side that it was consensual but the real issue is the
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.120]  non consensual things that Bill Clinton did, attacking Juanita Broderick and Hillary Clinton
[00:57.120 --> 01:03.600]  attacking the women that Hillary had attacked, doubling down after the fact, cold blooded
[01:03.600 --> 01:05.440]  attacks on these women.
[01:05.440 --> 01:09.000]  That's why we need to get this information out and it was really funny if you look at
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.920]  this video and if you haven't seen it, you can see it on Infowars.com.
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.480]  We have Patriot Storms Fox set exposing Bill Clinton's sex crimes.
[01:17.480 --> 01:18.480]  We have that there.
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.600]  We also have the video.
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.320]  Very funny to see it, we've got Tucker Carlson turned around and saw it.
[01:23.320 --> 01:24.800]  He thought it was hilarious.
[01:24.800 --> 01:26.960]  I was rolling on the floor laughing.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.560]  You'll enjoy this if you see it.
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.880]  And of course it's interesting also that the person that is right next to Tucker Carlson,
[01:32.880 --> 01:35.560]  this in the middle, is Abby Huntsman.
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.080]  And if you remember, she was the one who came on and said after Alex Jones talked to Pierce
[01:41.080 --> 01:45.360]  Morgan they came back and they said, well, we should challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
[01:45.360 --> 01:46.360]  match.
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.360]  We're going to play that clip for you.
[01:47.360 --> 01:50.440]  I'd love to see him shot, maybe by somebody in uniform, haha.
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.760]  Of course, she is the daughter of Huntsman who ran for president, I think it was back
[01:55.760 --> 01:56.760]  in 2008.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.560]  He was a very short blip on the screen.
[01:58.560 --> 02:01.040]  She's working for MSNBC at the time.
[02:01.040 --> 02:03.240]  Now she's working for Fox News.
[02:03.240 --> 02:04.240]  Very interesting.
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.280]  Alex is going to be breaking that down.
[02:05.280 --> 02:07.360]  This is the way we win, folks.
[02:07.360 --> 02:12.880]  BLM, Black Lives Matter, is out there violently protesting people.
[02:12.880 --> 02:14.560]  This is a peaceful protest.
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.920]  This is done in places where we're told that the public is going to be invited to appear
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.520]  behind the guest hosts and it's just simply exercising free speech peacefully.
[02:24.520 --> 02:26.640]  There's no trespass involved here.
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.840]  You can do this lawfully and creatively and that's what Alex is calling people to do and
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.920]  of course we're going to have him break that down when we come back.
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.440]  We're also going to be talking to Roger Stone about the exclusive announcement that he put
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.840]  out today on Twitter.
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.680]  If you see it on The Hill, they talk about the fact that Roger Stone tweeted out that
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.000]  by Wednesday, Hillary Clinton's campaign will be done.
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  Hashtag, WikiLeaks.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  We all expect that there's going to be a major announcement on Wednesday by WikiLeaks.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.520]  That's been promised by Julian Assange that it would happen in October.
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.040]  So we're going to have Roger Stone on with us in the second hour to talk about this.
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.320]  And there's a lot of breaking news that is economic as well.
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.240]  When we look at what's happening with Deutsche Bank stoking fears of another 2008 financial
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.000]  crisis as well as OPEC finally throwing in the price, you know, they just cannot get
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.040]  the economy going even with incredibly cheap oil prices and they tried a price war against
[03:24.040 --> 03:26.440]  domestic producers here in the United States.
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.440]  They've tried using their political surrogates like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to try
[03:30.440 --> 03:33.040]  to shut down all domestic energy production.
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.640]  And still, they had to throw the towel in that's a sign of two things, resiliency of
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.640]  the American economy.
[03:39.640 --> 03:46.640]  And it's also a resilient, a sign of the fact that we have a very sick world economy
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.440]  that cannot respond to oil prices being low.
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.120]  Energy is one of the key issues in terms of getting our prosperity back as well as if
[03:56.120 --> 03:58.840]  you look at things like life expectancy.
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.440]  And as they went into this price war and we saw the price get lower and lower, they still
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.400]  could not drive many American producers out of business.
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.400]  That's the interesting story.
[04:08.400 --> 04:11.280]  But when we come back, we're going to take a look at the economic news as well as this
[04:11.280 --> 04:12.800]  guerrilla marketing program.
[04:12.800 --> 04:14.600]  Alex Jones will be joining us right after the break.
[04:14.600 --> 04:15.600]  Stay tuned.
[04:15.600 --> 04:32.440]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[04:32.440 --> 04:36.440]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[04:36.440 --> 04:39.920]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[05:21.880 --> 05:22.880]  That means it's pure.
[05:22.880 --> 05:31.720]  At InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion, take action now before we sell out.
[05:31.720 --> 05:35.360]  It's Sunday, October 2, 2016.
[05:35.360 --> 05:42.920]  We are now only 36 short days before the historic election.
[05:42.920 --> 05:46.200]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our maxar.
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.560]  That's what Donald Trump said back in Cleveland in July, and it has the New World Order panicking
[05:51.560 --> 05:52.560]  today.
[05:52.560 --> 05:59.240]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice globally against the New World
[05:59.240 --> 06:06.240]  Order, this is the Alex Jones.
[06:06.240 --> 06:16.560]  Welcome back, I've been waiting for this segment all morning long.
[06:16.560 --> 06:22.480]  We are rolling out the red carpet, not for Tucker, but for some adorable, adoptable dogs.
[06:22.480 --> 06:31.040]  We're here, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.040]  shelter violence.
[06:32.040 --> 06:40.040]  We've got a very excited man behind us, not a real kitten, he's a little bit upset, but
[06:40.040 --> 06:41.040]  that's okay.
[06:41.040 --> 06:42.040]  Everything is fine.
[06:42.040 --> 06:48.040]  We're surrounded by dogs and if there's anything that calms the human heart, it's a canine.
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.040]  That's the whole point of the segment actually, they're with Best Friends, and Johnny is live
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.040]  as the co-founder of the Best Friends Animal Society.
[06:57.040 --> 07:02.320]  The establishment is now in total panic, and if citizens take action, we can bring down
[07:02.320 --> 07:06.360]  the controlled media facade once and for all.
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.280]  Citizen action on the street in the information war can win this election.
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.640]  The United States can then link up with the United Kingdom, Russia and other countries
[07:15.640 --> 07:22.160]  that are leaving the global government and reestablishing national sovereignty worldwide.
[07:22.160 --> 07:26.720]  I'm very upset with the mainstream media, we've seen incredible deception from them.
[07:26.720 --> 07:33.200]  We saw Lester Holt be the third person in the debate last Monday night, and they've
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.440]  now had to admit at the debate commission that indeed the crowd couldn't hear Donald
[07:37.440 --> 07:41.360]  Trump when he was talking, but Hillary was soaked into the sound system, and they were
[07:41.360 --> 07:43.400]  fading his mic up and down.
[07:43.400 --> 07:47.880]  I noticed it live on air, they said he was a conspiracy theorist, now they admit it's
[07:47.880 --> 07:49.880]  actually true.
[07:49.880 --> 07:58.160]  He will debate coming up next at CNN, and Anderson Cooper admitted CIA agent will be the quote
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.160]  moderator.
[07:59.160 --> 08:02.560]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen, this is out of control.
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.320]  And now the mainstream media is covering up Bill Clinton's true crimes.
[08:07.320 --> 08:12.040]  The fact that Bill Clinton has settled sexual assault cases before, I have interviewed the
[08:12.040 --> 08:18.400]  women that he has raped, there have been nurses and witnesses to it happening that rush into
[08:18.400 --> 08:24.040]  the hotel rooms minutes after it happens and the women are bleeding, this is well known.
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.920]  This is what they do, and Hillary Clinton has always covered up for him, that's been
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.920]  her job.
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.520]  A lot of men who are gay have a fake wife called a beard.
[08:33.520 --> 08:38.720]  Now Bill Clinton's not gay, but Hillary Clinton is his beard for the fact that he is a sexual
[08:38.720 --> 08:43.560]  assaulter and a predator, but look at him attacking innocent countries, bombing Belgrade,
[08:43.560 --> 08:48.240]  bombing Aspirin factories in Sudan, killing a half million Iraqi children with increased
[08:48.240 --> 08:53.160]  sanctions, worse than what the Bushes did, they are a crime syndicate.
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.640]  They represent the old order with the Bushes as well.
[08:56.640 --> 09:03.440]  And that's why on Friday's show, I thought, you know, they will fire anybody off Fox, CNN,
[09:03.440 --> 09:09.600]  SNBC, or BANOM that talks about Bill Clinton and sexual assault, it's a fact, it's come
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.600]  out in the news.
[09:10.600 --> 09:14.640]  And I said, we're selling this shirt to Roger Stone Design that says Bill Clinton was a
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.320]  rapist basically, Bill Clinton in the word rape, to try to get the word out, why not
[09:19.320 --> 09:25.600]  have a bounty of $1,000 for anybody that can get up on national TV and not break any laws
[09:25.600 --> 09:30.520]  for five seconds with the shirt clearly visible saying rape, and $5,000 if you can get the
[09:30.520 --> 09:34.880]  audio out that you're concerned about his sexual assaults or it should be investigated
[09:34.880 --> 09:38.840]  or if you believe he's a rapist that he's a rapist and the evidence shows that there's
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.840]  a cover up.
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.520]  This guy's far worse than Bill Cosby and I'm going to sit here and watch this double
[09:42.520 --> 09:46.560]  standard within less than 24 hours, Saturday morning, some gentleman, we don't know his
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.920]  name yet, but he's going to win $5,000, you know, email us, sir, got up, got the rape
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.160]  shirt on TV for five seconds and then brought up the sexual assaults.
[09:56.160 --> 09:59.800]  Now I'm still going to pay the $5,000, but anybody else does this, you're not going to
[09:59.800 --> 10:00.800]  get it.
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.200]  Use a bullhorn or use your voice, but don't go over the barricade.
[10:04.200 --> 10:08.080]  I know they're out on the street, you're not invading their studio, but still trying to
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.600]  climb over the barricade, once they try to stop you, I understand, you kind of use it
[10:11.600 --> 10:13.960]  to hold on, still is not right.
[10:13.960 --> 10:20.040]  So you have to follow laws, they get crowds out there all the time, all the time, waving
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.760]  their signs, their Hillary, their Trump signs, whatever, they're out there doing it, they're
[10:23.760 --> 10:29.560]  asking for it, go out there, follow the local laws, wear the shirt, get the shirt in full
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.320]  wars.com, that'll help pay for all the bounties we're going to pay, get the Hillary for Prison
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.240]  shirt in full wars.com as well.
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.400]  But regardless of what you do, go to info wars.com and print off the big PDFs we have
[10:39.400 --> 10:44.240]  of it and post those up around your town as well to create local news stories.
[10:44.240 --> 10:49.640]  And this is about the people overriding the censorship and control that's in MSM.
[10:49.640 --> 10:52.040]  It's a lot bigger than the Clintons, it's a lot bigger than Trump, it's bigger than
[10:52.040 --> 10:55.680]  Alex Jones or in full wars, it's about the people taking action.
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.520]  The French resistance did things similar to this with the B-Symbol, we've had contests
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.680]  before that had hundreds of newspapers covering it and dozens of TV stations, so we're going
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.120]  to also have a contest I announce later in the week as well dealing with posting posters
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.860]  exposing the Clintons of different types, not just rape, Benghazi you name it, and then
[11:13.860 --> 11:17.800]  videotaping it, putting it on YouTube and then whoever gets the most coverage is going
[11:17.800 --> 11:18.800]  to get a big prize as well.
[11:18.800 --> 11:26.120]  We're going to put the rules up by Monday for both these contests, but some people say
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.440]  well what happens if a bunch of people go out and say rape on TV, it'll create a giant
[11:30.440 --> 11:34.960]  tsunami, that's what we want and we'll turn it into a big national story just like Hillary
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.240]  for president but even bigger.
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.360]  And listen, we're risking losing the country, desperate times mean desperate measures, so
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.920]  I need all of you to take action, all of you to think about ways to do this especially
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.720]  if you're in LA, New York, D.C. or other areas where national news is going to be taking
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.440]  place and there's other creative ways to also get this out there, just do it legally and
[11:53.440 --> 11:59.360]  do it lawfully and check your local laws and you will win the prize, $1,000 or $5,000.
[11:59.360 --> 12:05.560]  Now there's a $100,000 cap, that's our budget, we think that this promotional probably sell
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.160]  maybe that much T-shirts but it doesn't matter, I just want to try to get this out because
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.240]  I have daughters, I love women and I'm sick and tired of watching these people claim that
[12:14.240 --> 12:17.480]  they represent women when they're such creditors over women and they're so horrible.
[12:17.480 --> 12:21.800]  So infowars.com will have all this information posted and we want to salute the young man
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.440]  that did this and also want to point out the New York Times has called us asking if Tucker
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.120]  Carlson rigged this with us.
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.200]  Tucker Carlson had nothing to do with this, I announced this yesterday on the air and
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.720]  whoever this young man is went and did this because it was one of the first live shows
[12:34.720 --> 12:35.960]  on the street.
[12:35.960 --> 12:39.360]  That's what happened but they're already looking for someone so they can burn Tucker Carlson
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.800]  and get him kicked off Fox because there's already been a coup at Fox with the whole
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.800]  Roger Ailsing and now he's trying to take over the rest of the media.
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.800]  It's really happening.
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.880]  I mean as of today the UN has gotten authority over the web and so a really dark time of
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.480]  oppression is unfolding, it's time for us on the ground to get the word out, not just
[12:56.480 --> 12:57.480]  on the internet.
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.480]  I'm Alan Jones signing off for infowars.com, I want to salute you all out there that are
[13:01.480 --> 13:04.360]  fighting for liberty, the true liberals, the true constitutionalists, if you're watching
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.880]  or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[13:06.880 --> 13:13.320]  And again you can see that article at infowars.com, Patriot Storms Fox said exposing Bill Clinton's
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.240]  sex crimes and as Alex was pointing out they're trying to attack Tucker Carlson over that.
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.400]  He saw some humor in that.
[13:20.400 --> 13:24.880]  The way this breaks down is take a look at the way the Daily Mail reported this, headline
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.320]  man shouts, Bill Clinton is a rapist on live TV to win $5,000 from 9-11 conspiracy theorist
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.680]  Alex Jones and this writer Jennifer Smith for the Daily Mail goes on to say, well it's
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.800]  not clear whether Jones has lived up to his promise to give the man the money.
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.360]  Understand the timeline on this thing.
[13:41.360 --> 13:48.440]  Alex announced the contest on Friday afternoon, Saturday morning this guy does this and within
[13:48.440 --> 13:51.520]  a couple of hours it's not clear if Alex Jones has paid this guy yet or not.
[13:51.520 --> 13:55.120]  I don't know that Alex even knows the guy's name yet, I mean we put it up there, Alex
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.840]  is good for it folks, he's paid off on all of these contests in the past, it's just
[13:59.840 --> 14:02.160]  the way they smear people.
[14:02.160 --> 14:06.560]  But understand when we say that Bill Clinton is a rapist, we're not smearing Bill Clinton,
[14:06.560 --> 14:07.560]  we're telling the truth.
[14:07.560 --> 14:11.840]  And we're telling the truth about Hillary Clinton that she, through these women that
[14:11.840 --> 14:16.960]  Bill Clinton raped and sexually abused, this is not consensual, we have to understand
[14:16.960 --> 14:17.960]  the difference.
[14:17.960 --> 14:25.080]  He's got a long string of consensual bimbos, but he also has a long string of sexual victims
[14:25.080 --> 14:27.160]  behind him as well, that's what we're talking about.
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.080]  People like Juanita Broderick, people like Kathleen Willey and when you look at the people
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.720]  that are there, of course, I thought it was interesting that Abbey Huntsman was there.
[14:35.720 --> 14:39.360]  Remember this clip from a couple of years ago when Alex Jones went on with Piers Morgan,
[14:39.360 --> 14:40.600]  let's play that clip.
[14:40.600 --> 14:47.520]  Made $960 million in years, I don't care what the justification is, that you're allowed
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.080]  in this country to own a semi-automatic weapon, much less a hang-up, but what do you need
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.720]  a semi-automatic weapon for, the only reason I think you need it is Piers, challenge Alex
[14:58.720 --> 14:59.720]  Jones to a boxing match.
[14:59.720 --> 15:00.720]  Here's Abbey Huntsman.
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.160]  Let's talk with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them.
[15:04.160 --> 15:05.160]  I'd love to see that.
[15:05.160 --> 15:06.160]  In uniform.
[15:06.160 --> 15:07.160]  There you go.
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.160]  Okay, she went from MSNBC.
[15:10.160 --> 15:15.240]  She goes from MSNBC to Fox News as part of the remakeover of Fox News, and of course she's
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.080]  the daughter of John Huntsman, the guy who was a tiny blip on the screen in the 2008 presidential
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.080]  elections.
[15:21.080 --> 15:22.080]  Stay with us when we come back.
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.520]  We're going to talk about the tax issue that has bubbled up this weekend with Donald
[15:25.520 --> 15:36.880]  Trump.
[15:36.880 --> 15:39.200]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[15:39.200 --> 15:44.160]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10
[15:44.160 --> 15:47.480]  to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[15:47.480 --> 15:48.480]  It's incredible.
[15:48.480 --> 15:52.160]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.600]  very same groups with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  point or two ahead.
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.800]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this,
[16:02.800 --> 16:04.200]  it's incredible.
[16:04.200 --> 16:11.680]  We're talking 3, 4, 5, 6 times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit,
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.240]  and so many other places.
[16:13.240 --> 16:18.360]  In fact, sometimes he's got 10 times more likes and 10 times more views.
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.120]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people.
[16:21.120 --> 16:22.840]  Hillary'd have 500.
[16:22.840 --> 16:27.360]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states and the Democratic primary.
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.160]  And we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.000]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.600]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[16:38.600 --> 16:43.680]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[16:43.680 --> 16:49.400]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting
[16:49.400 --> 16:52.640]  with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[16:52.640 --> 16:59.560]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers
[16:59.560 --> 17:00.680]  per stream.
[17:00.680 --> 17:06.400]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[17:06.400 --> 17:10.120]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.200]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.600]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[17:16.600 --> 17:21.200]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[17:21.200 --> 17:24.280]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[17:24.280 --> 17:26.120]  Most of your videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[17:26.120 --> 17:27.980]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[17:27.980 --> 17:29.480]  This lady's a joke.
[17:29.480 --> 17:31.120]  She's not liked by our own party.
[17:31.120 --> 17:36.400]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready
[17:36.400 --> 17:38.440]  for election fraud.
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.520]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[17:42.520 --> 17:47.280]  When Obama says it's preposterous, he doesn't even know what that is.
[17:47.280 --> 17:49.880]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.560]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to
[17:54.560 --> 17:56.560]  stand down and not take action.
[17:56.560 --> 17:58.960]  We don't have somebody who's going to throw in the towel if there's fraud.
[17:58.960 --> 18:04.280]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[18:04.280 --> 18:06.360]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.280]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.440]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[18:13.440 --> 18:20.200]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud or scandals, it doesn't
[18:20.200 --> 18:22.000]  matter because we've been in the arena.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.720]  We've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism.
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.640]  The maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.080]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:32.080 --> 18:37.280]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure
[18:37.280 --> 18:38.520]  on the line.
[18:38.520 --> 18:40.360]  He is the man on the arena.
[18:40.360 --> 18:42.560]  And I'm honored to be on that arena with him as well.
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.320]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[18:47.320 --> 19:16.600]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[19:16.600 --> 19:34.360]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:05.200 --> 19:56.240]  2016, the Alex Jones show, and as you hear Tower Power saying, taxed to the
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.240]  Macs.
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.240]  Yeah, we're all taxed the Macs, aren't we?
[19:58.240 --> 20:02.240]  Part of this distraction, and it is a distraction, talk about Donald Trump's tax returns.
[20:02.240 --> 20:05.960]  I want to tell you why they're using this as a distraction.
[20:05.960 --> 20:11.480]  Folks, they want you to think about his tax returns and not your tax returns.
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.400]  Hillary Clinton has put out her tax plans, and it doesn't matter what income level you're
[20:16.400 --> 20:17.400]  in.
[20:17.400 --> 20:19.680]  From the very poorest to the very richest, your taxes are going to go up.
[20:19.680 --> 20:24.600]  I'm going to break that down for a couple of the middle income tax brackets.
[20:24.600 --> 20:29.040]  But they want you to just be jealous about Donald Trump's taxes.
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.040]  You know what?
[20:30.040 --> 20:31.440]  They're selling is not hope.
[20:31.440 --> 20:33.200]  They're selling envy, okay?
[20:33.200 --> 20:38.320]  Or maybe they're selling rape, rape of the economy, just like Bill Clinton has raped
[20:38.320 --> 20:39.920]  so many women.
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.720]  We also got to go ahead and take the music down.
[20:41.720 --> 20:46.320]  We also have coming up in the next segment.
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.440]  We're going to have Alex Jones breaking down a leak from Hillary Clinton, throwing millennials
[20:53.440 --> 20:56.840]  under the bus, saying they're the children of the Great Recession.
[20:56.840 --> 20:59.880]  She talked about them as basement dwellers, as baristas, okay?
[20:59.880 --> 21:04.080]  That's what she thinks of these people who are Bernie Sanders supporters.
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.520]  And I thought it was interesting.
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.520]  She says, well, I think we can get free college.
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.040]  They think they can get free healthcare.
[21:09.040 --> 21:10.840]  Why would they think they can get those things?
[21:10.840 --> 21:15.720]  It's because the Democrats have been lying to them, promising them free college.
[21:15.720 --> 21:19.520]  She's been promising free healthcare for the last 25 years.
[21:19.520 --> 21:25.000]  It was Hillary Clinton, as first lady, that pretended that she had some authority to
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.120]  take over, what was it, about a seventh of the economy, the medical industry.
[21:29.120 --> 21:30.120]  Now they're doing it.
[21:30.120 --> 21:31.360]  They're on their way.
[21:31.360 --> 21:33.520]  They've got a gradual program that they're bringing in here.
[21:33.520 --> 21:37.360]  They slapped her down and said, you know, you tried to go too fast on this.
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.240]  We've got to take a more gradual approach, and that's what they're doing right now.
[21:40.240 --> 21:41.920]  But make no mistake about it.
[21:41.920 --> 21:45.680]  They're trying to take over our full economy here.
[21:45.680 --> 21:47.760]  Starting with our healthcare.
[21:47.760 --> 21:52.800]  But she goes on to say, I'm occupying from the center left to the center right.
[21:52.800 --> 21:57.680]  You know, I think it's very important that we understand that it isn't simply a left-right
[21:57.680 --> 21:58.680]  political paradigm.
[21:58.680 --> 22:04.080]  See if you can find a picture of a thing, look for a Nolan chart, N-O-L-A-N, pull up
[22:04.080 --> 22:05.080]  the Nolan chart.
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.280]  This is something that one of the founders of the Libertarian Party came up with a few
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.280]  years ago.
[22:09.280 --> 22:13.360]  And what it does is it asks some questions, or you look at the positions of some particular
[22:13.360 --> 22:20.040]  politician, and you map them on an axis, with one axis, vertical axis being economic freedom,
[22:20.040 --> 22:21.920]  the other one being personal freedom.
[22:21.920 --> 22:25.480]  Then you take that axis, and if you rotate it 45 degrees, you get a diamond.
[22:25.480 --> 22:28.680]  If you're looking at the broadcast right now, you see that diamond.
[22:28.680 --> 22:29.960]  And you can break that down.
[22:29.960 --> 22:33.040]  You'll see people who are on the left liberal and on the right liberal, okay?
[22:33.040 --> 22:39.360]  But what do you do with somebody that's like, we got like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin?
[22:39.360 --> 22:44.120]  And we're told, well, one of them is an extreme leftist, the other is an extreme rightist.
[22:44.120 --> 22:49.440]  Where do authoritarians go on this simple line that they always tell you about the political
[22:49.440 --> 22:50.440]  spectrum?
[22:50.440 --> 22:52.200]  Okay, it is not simply a line.
[22:52.200 --> 22:54.760]  You need at least two dimensions to see what's going on.
[22:54.760 --> 22:58.320]  No, Stalin and Hitler would both be down there in the authoritarian block.
[22:58.320 --> 22:59.320]  And you know what?
[22:59.320 --> 23:02.800]  So with Hillary Clinton, she's not centrist at all.
[23:02.800 --> 23:04.240]  She's bottomist, okay?
[23:04.240 --> 23:05.240]  She's authoritarian.
[23:05.240 --> 23:07.240]  If you look at that chart, she's down at the bottom.
[23:07.240 --> 23:10.360]  So you can have people that are on the left, people on the right, they give you some political
[23:10.360 --> 23:13.520]  personal freedom or they give you some economic freedom.
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.280]  But the people who want to take all your freedom are down at the bottom when you rotate that
[23:17.280 --> 23:18.280]  chart.
[23:18.280 --> 23:19.520]  And it makes a lot of sense when you look at that.
[23:19.520 --> 23:25.160]  You know, Ronald Reagan talked about, are we going, not left or right, but up or down,
[23:25.160 --> 23:26.160]  okay?
[23:26.160 --> 23:30.040]  You want to go up towards freedom or do you want to go down towards government control,
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.040]  central government control?
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.040]  Alex is going to be talking about that coming up in the next segment.
[23:34.040 --> 23:37.800]  In this segment, the time that we got left, I want to talk about taxes because they are
[23:37.800 --> 23:42.280]  crowing about the fact that New York Times went in and illegally got these documents
[23:42.280 --> 23:44.920]  about Donald Trump's taxes and said, look at this.
[23:44.920 --> 23:49.400]  We don't think that he has paid any taxes in the last 20 years because he had nearly
[23:49.400 --> 23:52.120]  a billion dollar loss in 1995.
[23:52.120 --> 23:53.120]  Where does that come from?
[23:53.120 --> 23:54.840]  Where are they making these assumptions?
[23:54.840 --> 23:58.160]  CNN has a former tax accountant.
[23:58.160 --> 24:02.720]  He says it's wrong to assume that Trump's nearly billion dollar loss came from his own
[24:02.720 --> 24:07.840]  money and this is Edward McCaffery, okay?
[24:07.840 --> 24:10.080]  And he is a former tax person.
[24:10.080 --> 24:12.600]  He knows what he's talking about, folks.
[24:12.600 --> 24:19.040]  Listen, I want to give you two examples in terms of your home mortgage.
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.720]  They say it's awful that Donald Trump took tax deductions that he's entitled to.
[24:23.720 --> 24:27.640]  They don't want you to understand the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion.
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.160]  So tax avoidance is saying, I'm going to take the deductions that I'm allowed to take.
[24:32.160 --> 24:37.080]  Tax evasion says, I'm just going to ignore the tax system or I'm going to lie on the
[24:37.080 --> 24:38.840]  form or whatever.
[24:38.840 --> 24:44.560]  But avoidance is not cheating, any more than it's cheating to take your home mortgage deduction
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.720]  if you have that or to deduct medical expenses if you get over the massive threshold that
[24:49.720 --> 24:52.420]  they put on the tax form, okay?
[24:52.420 --> 24:57.640]  If you take your home mortgage deduction, that is simply tax avoidance.
[24:57.640 --> 25:00.520]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.280]  You're going to get into the system if you're going to fill out all the forms.
[25:05.280 --> 25:08.440]  Doing it that way, there is nothing wrong with that.
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.760]  And when you look at the situation that you got going with Donald Trump, it is not wrong
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.640]  for him to use the legal tax deductions that are available to him.
[25:17.640 --> 25:23.800]  Now, another example, I had a friend when I was working back in North Carolina who was
[25:23.800 --> 25:24.800]  building a home.
[25:24.800 --> 25:27.840]  He went to a home builder and he gave him a lot of money as a down payment to build
[25:27.840 --> 25:28.840]  this custom home for him.
[25:28.840 --> 25:35.160]  And the guy, like a lot of builders, got overextended on his debt payments and the guy went bankrupt.
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.320]  He had absolutely, he lost all that money and a lot of money from other people as well.
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.240]  So my friend took him to court, sued him and won, but the guy didn't have any money.
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.940]  So what he got was a judgment for X amount of dollars for his loss.
[25:48.940 --> 25:55.280]  And he could take that a little bit at a time for 20 years and then you lose whatever
[25:55.280 --> 25:56.280]  you haven't claimed.
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.560]  And for him, he didn't have that much money, he probably wasn't going to get it back even
[26:00.560 --> 26:06.520]  taking it as a credit against his taxes, using it as a deduction every year for up to 20
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.520]  years.
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.160]  So that's what we're talking about with Donald Trump.
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.520]  It could be something like that, a massive loss that he had or it could be somebody
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.760]  that defrauded him or somebody that he sued and won, got that judgment against him and
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.080]  had to take that over a 20 year period.
[26:21.080 --> 26:23.280]  That is something that happens to ordinary people all the time.
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.960]  It's like taking your mortgage deduction if somebody defrauds you and I don't know what
[26:27.960 --> 26:32.440]  the basis of this is and we won't know if we don't see his tax returns.
[26:32.440 --> 26:37.360]  But understand that if you're looking for the tax returns, they're not trying to get
[26:37.360 --> 26:38.360]  greater transparency.
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.760]  What the Clinton camp is trying to do is muddy the water in endless complexities.
[26:43.760 --> 26:49.560]  And we've talked about this before, how Money Magazine used to for the longest time, I don't
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.240]  know if Money Magazine is even around anymore, but I know back in the 1990s that we get 30
[26:53.240 --> 26:58.880]  to 50 tax accountants and they would look at a tax return for a family, not a business
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.120]  event, not even a small business, but just a family that had some events.
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.800]  Maybe they had some inheritance taxes or they sold some stocks or they sold a couple
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.280]  of home, they sold a home or a vacation home, a second home or something like that.
[27:11.280 --> 27:17.680]  Some unusual events and it was a family that had maybe $120,000 income or something.
[27:17.680 --> 27:21.640]  So they had a good deal of income and they had a couple of unusual events and they would
[27:21.640 --> 27:27.200]  give this to 30 to 50 tax accountants and guess what they would get, 30 to 50 different
[27:27.200 --> 27:28.200]  answers.
[27:28.200 --> 27:35.320]  And the answers can range anywhere from 10 or $15,000 in taxes owed to $10,000 to $15,000
[27:35.320 --> 27:37.040]  worth of taxes that came back.
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.600]  See, that's the way the tax code is set up on purpose.
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.120]  A law that is sufficiently complex is the same as having no law at all.
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.560]  And it can be used as a weapon, it can be used as a weapon against you, it can be used
[27:51.560 --> 27:53.720]  as a weapon against political candidates.
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.480]  It can be used as a weapon, as we've seen in the Obama administration, against political
[27:57.480 --> 28:03.680]  opponents using the IRS to audit people that they don't like, coming after them and even
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.040]  turning over their information to political opponents.
[28:08.040 --> 28:13.200]  And when all of this is going on, understand the New York Times paid absolutely no taxes
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.200]  in 2014.
[28:14.200 --> 28:16.720]  They did the same thing they're haranguing Donald Trump for.
[28:16.720 --> 28:21.440]  Stay with us, we'll come back, Alex Jones is gonna break down Clinton throwing the Bernie
[28:21.440 --> 28:29.640]  Sanders supporters under the bus.
[28:29.640 --> 28:36.600]  The future is bleak if we as a nation don't change something.
[28:36.600 --> 28:47.920]  There's a reason why we do this, you know, you've had shootings that are questionable.
[28:47.920 --> 28:53.960]  You have, you know, riots in Milwaukee, you have people losing their mind in Louisiana.
[28:53.960 --> 29:00.120]  While I believe law enforcement police officers are always trying to do the right thing, oftentimes
[29:00.120 --> 29:02.280]  they're missing the train.
[29:02.280 --> 29:07.520]  The more training we have, the more experienced we have, the more self aware we are.
[29:07.520 --> 29:13.920]  The better savior you're in, the longer you can do this.
[29:13.920 --> 29:17.440]  The better savior you're in, the more observant you're gonna be.
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.580]  The better savior you're in, the more aware you're gonna be.
[29:20.580 --> 29:26.960]  The better savior you're in, the quicker you're gonna be able to assess and then go to action.
[29:26.960 --> 29:28.060]  They need to be on the range.
[29:28.060 --> 29:32.240]  They need to be in the gyms, they need to be in Marsh Clark Studios, they need to be
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.720]  skills that can ultimately be able to save lives you know they're there to
[29:35.720 --> 29:38.760]  serve they're there to protect the public and right now there's this
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.720]  perception that they can't do that whether that's from maybe a systemic
[29:43.720 --> 29:50.120]  problem within the departments themselves or the greater problem is that
[29:50.120 --> 29:55.320]  the bureaucracy and how police departments are organized are preventing
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.480]  them from getting the training that they need.
[29:58.480 --> 30:05.080]  Welcome to sheepdog response you know we yesterday we worked like 16 hours
[30:05.080 --> 30:10.320]  we're in the gym fighting grappling you know working on coughing striking
[30:10.320 --> 30:15.960]  takedowns all with the intent of being able to protect people you know we're
[30:15.960 --> 30:20.920]  not showing people these skills so they can go and hurt other people that's not
[30:20.920 --> 30:24.680]  what's happening here we're giving them skills so they can go protect people so
[30:24.680 --> 30:29.120]  they can go save lives you know time after time the more training you have
[30:29.120 --> 30:32.760]  the more experience you have the better decisions you're gonna make you know if
[30:32.760 --> 30:36.960]  you're in a position where you're in a fight for your life just because you
[30:36.960 --> 30:42.120]  can kill somebody doesn't mean you need to you may not need to if you have the
[30:42.120 --> 30:46.520]  training if you have the experience you know if you're going to put your life
[30:46.520 --> 30:49.400]  on the line if you're gonna step up and say I'm here to serve the public I'm
[30:49.400 --> 30:53.800]  here I'm committed to provide safety to the group of people you can't do that
[30:53.800 --> 30:57.720]  alone and you can't do that the average person can't do that you have to have a
[30:57.720 --> 31:04.680]  very specific skill set and train to be able to one provide it and in a safe way
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.600]  not only for yourself but also for the public and there's only a handful of
[31:09.600 --> 31:13.720]  people that understand and recognize what those skills are and I'm gonna pour
[31:13.720 --> 31:16.960]  my life and my heart into making sure that I can give these skills to the
[31:16.960 --> 31:25.240]  guys that need it and the guys weren't blue you know that's those guys
[31:26.880 --> 31:33.520]  I'm gonna lay it out short sweet I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists
[31:33.520 --> 31:38.840]  and their program for world government that I stopped working out I was a total
[31:38.840 --> 31:44.920]  fitness nut 20 years ago about 15 years ago I just stopped working out I
[31:44.920 --> 31:51.040]  gained close to 100 pounds I have lost 50-60 pounds of fat or more I've gained
[31:51.040 --> 31:56.320]  20 pounds of muscle I'm stronger than I was when I was 22 when I could bench
[31:56.320 --> 32:02.400]  press close to 400 pounds squat 600 it's actually scary and it's because I take
[32:02.400 --> 32:09.440]  products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that
[32:09.440 --> 32:14.120]  basically feminized men we've produced these products with top scientists and
[32:14.120 --> 32:20.160]  researchers like dr. group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and
[32:20.160 --> 32:24.480]  at the same time support info wars and our fight for both human liberty and
[32:24.480 --> 32:44.360]  freedom you're listening to the Alex Jones show we are on the march the
[32:44.360 --> 32:55.160]  Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Alex Jones here on
[32:55.160 --> 33:00.240]  this live Sunday broadcast with a breakdown of just the historical
[33:00.240 --> 33:06.320]  hypocrisy it's so over the top it's like it's from a dark satire novel or
[33:06.320 --> 33:10.960]  something the rigging against Donald Trump the lying the twisting Google
[33:10.960 --> 33:15.100]  Facebook Twitter admitting that they're siding with Obama and censoring
[33:15.100 --> 33:20.080]  anybody promoting Trump the mainstream media admitting that they're spinning
[33:20.080 --> 33:23.840]  polls and engage in deception the fact that the debate Commission now admits
[33:23.840 --> 33:28.960]  that Trump's Mike was being faded down and was not sending audio to the crowd
[33:28.960 --> 33:34.040]  the audience couldn't even hear him they admitted yesterday that was true over
[33:34.040 --> 33:37.000]  and over again I see Trump tell the truth tell the truth tell the truth tell
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.560]  the truth tell the truth and they take his strongest points and they turn it
[33:40.560 --> 33:43.320]  against him a year and a half ago when he first announced the presidency he
[33:43.320 --> 33:46.920]  said listen I know all the loopholes that the elite have written in the loss I
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.280]  will use those loopholes to bring massive money back to America he gave
[33:51.280 --> 33:57.200]  examples he said look the Chinese have a 10% lower tax on corporations than we
[33:57.200 --> 34:01.640]  do that makes all the corporations move there we cut it down to their level or
[34:01.640 --> 34:06.960]  lower they'll all come back or a lot will and they said oh my god he doesn't
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.080]  corporations to pay taxes no he wants to bring them back here we have the
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.280]  highest corporate m tax income tax in the world now the latest thing is they
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.040]  have illegally gotten his tax returns from 1995 where he admittedly had a
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.800]  $900 million loss and declared bankruptcy in some of his companies each new
[34:23.800 --> 34:27.920]  venture he does is a new corporation 90 plus percent of his ventures have been
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.200]  very successful most business people one out of six is successful he's nine out
[34:33.200 --> 34:37.280]  of ten or even better but he has declared bankruptcy four times and he used
[34:37.280 --> 34:42.000]  that loss then to move forward over the next few years and basically not pay
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.560]  taxes because the loss that's what all the rich do Google pays 3% tax if you
[34:49.560 --> 34:54.920]  go to General Electric 2 to 3% tax again some major global corporations pay
[34:54.920 --> 34:59.960]  zero tax and then the leaders of those corporations do the exact same loopholes
[34:59.960 --> 35:04.520]  that Trump does and pay near zero the truth is Trump isn't elitist enough to
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.800]  pay no taxes like they do the upper super billionaire crust are the ones
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.880]  fact famous billionaires have said taxes those are for poor people those are for
[35:14.880 --> 35:22.080]  commoners he wants to end all that where China has a currency 35% beneath
[35:22.080 --> 35:28.000]  ours devalued which again makes people go build things there because it's
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.680]  cheaper to manufacture they've got energy three times cheaper than us because
[35:31.680 --> 35:34.960]  they have all these dirty coal power plants they're shutting down our clean
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.760]  ones these are simple things let us have cheap energy let us have lower taxes
[35:39.760 --> 35:46.000]  let us have a currency that isn't undervalued against others and we will
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.240]  explode America's been the engine of the world we've been sold out but they take
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.840]  this and they spin it like it's a giant controversy because the system thinks
[35:54.840 --> 36:05.640]  all of you are stupid Trump wants to cut taxes for the super red well we're
[36:05.640 --> 36:10.720]  not going there my friends I'm telling you right now we're going to write
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.400]  fairer rules for the middle class and we aren't going to raise taxes on the
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.400]  middle class the establishment is hoping the general public is ignorant
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.800]  about the current global crony capitalist economic system it's time to
[36:25.800 --> 36:33.640]  wake up in 2014 the New York Times paid zero taxes I could go on and on with
[36:33.640 --> 36:35.520]  example after example and it's worse than that
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.360]  Carlos Slim the Mexican kingpin one of the richest men in the world basically
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.560]  controls the New York Times and is the majority owner but I'm going to ask
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.760]  Bernie Sanders supporters something right now you claim you're against
[36:48.760 --> 36:51.960]  mega banks and super huge corporations that have rigged the economy and they
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.520]  have and you're right when you say they pay almost no taxes and that's a screw
[36:55.520 --> 37:02.840]  job they've given all their money to Hillary 98 to 2 billionaires have given
[37:02.840 --> 37:09.800]  to Hillary she's gotten 20 to 1 corporate contributions there's never been a
[37:09.800 --> 37:13.520]  more unified Republican Democrat power structure against the candidate in
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.760]  history because they know he's a nationalist they know he's not out to
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.320]  get America and now there's this new recording it's posted on info wars.com
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.160]  of Hillary Clinton talking to donors making fun of Bernie Sanders people and
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.120]  calling him baristas and saying basically they live in their mother's
[37:30.120 --> 37:33.640]  basement in fact that's the quote and that you're all a bunch of losers this
[37:33.640 --> 37:37.720]  is what she's saying that these big fat cat corporate people who don't want to
[37:37.720 --> 37:40.320]  have a free market they don't want competition they want to sew the whole
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.640]  thing up so you've got Sanders on the extreme left of populism and then you've
[37:44.640 --> 37:50.040]  got this populist Trump who's liberal in many ways who you're rejecting you're
[37:50.040 --> 37:53.520]  being chumped by the very same power structure it's time for everybody to
[37:53.520 --> 37:56.840]  reach out to Sanders supporters with the recording of Hillary and here's a
[37:56.840 --> 38:00.640]  clip when their children are the Great Recession and they are living in their
[38:00.640 --> 38:06.000]  parents basement so if you're feeling that you're consigned to you know being
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.640]  a barista you're not a bad person have you been forced to stay with your
[38:09.640 --> 38:12.760]  parents because this economy's been in depression for eight years you're not a
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.440]  bad person because you're a barista thank God we've still got some service
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.880]  industry but the truth is that's starting to contract and our wealth that was saved
[38:20.880 --> 38:24.360]  up over a hundred years starting to disappear we've got to make American
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.480]  rate again we've got to put it first the most important difference between our
[38:28.480 --> 38:35.760]  plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.920]  Americanism not globalism will be our credo to talk about how desperate the
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.240]  power structure is look at how a month and a half ago I came out and said we
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.720]  should watch for election fraud because our intel Obama came out and attacked
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.760]  me Hillary did as well Trump came out and said we should look at this they
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.600]  said oh he's crazy there's no such thing what is election fraud Obama said and
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.720]  then they announced two weeks later they're gonna federalize the elections
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.720]  and it's in Bloomberg today that they have got evidence of the election systems
[39:04.720 --> 39:08.840]  being scanned by outside groups the Russians so the feds are gonna take it
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.320]  over ladies and gentlemen the fixes in only a landslide will defeat these
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.240]  people and that's what brings me to my last central point here today a man on
[39:18.240 --> 39:23.200]  Saturday morning got behind the set like everybody else does with signs with
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.760]  his Bill Clinton rape shirt from him for store.com and he began to yell Bill
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.080]  Clinton's a rapist now he started climbing over the barricade which you
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.520]  shouldn't do you should follow up he's still gonna win the $5,000 but just to
[39:34.520 --> 39:37.360]  be clear we're not calling for violence with the media we're calling for
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.920]  peacefully standing behind the camera when it's in a public area and getting
[39:40.920 --> 39:44.720]  images out and audio out exposing the terror that's taking place we're not
[39:44.720 --> 39:48.160]  like Black Lives Matter beating up people that have Trump signs in their
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.240]  yards beating up homeless people for no reason you know because they're white
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.640]  with George Soros funding and trying to start a race war we are peacefully
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.760]  engaged in an information war that's having a huge effect and history is
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.200]  taking place right now so we need to see the next 35 days till this election a
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.360]  maximum effort because this is part of Briggs it it's part of Russia pulling out
[40:06.360 --> 40:09.480]  the New World Order it's part of nationalism rising again it is
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.680]  historic and exciting time to be alive so please take action and realize that
[40:13.680 --> 40:27.280]  the people are on the March the Empire is on the run there's not only evil on
[40:27.280 --> 40:30.120]  this world there's good as well and no matter what color you are where you're
[40:30.120 --> 40:33.840]  from on the planet you can promote individualism free market free ideas
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.840]  free association the classical Renaissance enlightenment system that
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.560]  has developed almost all the good things we have in this world we can stand up to
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.240]  this together we can say no to this but history is happening right now we're at
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.760]  the crossroads and it's now time for everybody to have the maximum effort you
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.920]  know I'm promising to give this fellow that did this $5,000 and I am forgetting
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.840]  the visual and the audio on air if you get the visual it's a thousand a lot of
[41:01.840 --> 41:05.080]  people are saying Alex we're insulted we'll do this for free that's the whole
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.200]  point is to begin a cascade event it's to create some excitement absolutely do
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.760]  it for free then the point is is expose it be part of history take action don't
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.520]  be a spectator be the man or woman in the arena I want to salute all of you
[41:18.520 --> 41:21.280]  that have taken action again of every race color and creed God bless you all
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.680]  because you are the resistance and again that's the way we get the
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.320]  information out the Hillary for prison t-shirts have been a phenomenal way to
[41:30.320 --> 41:33.080]  get the information out we've had article after article written by the

[46:54.800 --> 46:58.400]  hour is going to be Roger Stone he tweeted out today that Wednesday will be
[46:58.400 --> 47:03.160]  the end of Hillary's campaign hashtag wiggie leaks so we've got him on to
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.560]  explain that as well as talk about all the developments that have happened in
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.960]  the last say 48 hours with the Trump campaign a lot of things have happened
[47:10.960 --> 47:14.560]  one of these the tax information I started talking about that earlier I
[47:14.560 --> 47:18.800]  want to finish up with that as well but when we look at the release of this
[47:18.800 --> 47:23.120]  information that Alex was just talking about calling with Hillary Clinton
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.200]  calling the Millennials basement dwellers and baristas talking about the
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.400]  children of the Great Recession as she puts it let's understand what's going on
[47:32.400 --> 47:35.880]  with this folks we look at another article that came out today Clinton
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.640]  announces today National Service Reserve for Millennials I'm afraid that the
[47:40.640 --> 47:44.080]  people and the Millennials are people about 18 to 30 years old it's my sons
[47:44.080 --> 47:49.040]  or that age and I really feel sorry for them because they have had their
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.280]  opportunities destroyed by the policies of big government especially by Obama
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.000]  and Hillary Clinton and she's going to double down on those policies to the
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.160]  extent that you won't have a job you won't have any ability and neither will
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.080]  your parents to help you through college know you'll be dependent upon the
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.640]  federal government if you're a good little boy or girl and you go to the
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.560]  National Service Reserve and you do the things that Hillary Clinton tells you to
[48:14.560 --> 48:17.000]  do whether or not the market wants that or not whether not anybody
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.520]  voluntarily wants that they're going to tell you that it's a good thing because
[48:20.520 --> 48:24.880]  the government says it's a good thing and if you go in and do what they say as
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.520]  their little slave they may throw you some little pork barrel trinkets they
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.720]  said you might be eligible you might be eligible for college credit based on
[48:33.720 --> 48:37.680]  your financial need or you might be able to get time off from work based on
[48:37.680 --> 48:41.760]  financial need or you might get a modest stipend in other words they're
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.640]  going to barely pay you if at all they're going to find some ways and not pay
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.600]  you but they want to push you into this mandatory service this is something that
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.200]  is so dear to the heart of the socialist authoritarians like Hillary Clinton and
[48:55.200 --> 48:59.560]  Barack Obama the two of them are always talking about the dream that they have
[48:59.560 --> 49:04.280]  of forcing young people into government service to do whatever they say to do
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.280]  because they want to control you totally understand they want to put you on a
[49:08.280 --> 49:13.880]  plantation as their slave and they may give you some little trinkets they say
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.920]  Clinton will negotiate with higher education institutions and corporation
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.720]  and corporations to get those benefits in other words the government isn't even
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.600]  going to pay you they're going to strong-armed people or they're going to
[49:25.600 --> 49:30.360]  put out mandates and fatwas to force companies to do that that's the way
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.440]  they're rolling with us you have to understand they're not offering you
[49:33.440 --> 49:38.760]  hope they're offering you envy and they're offering to rape the economy
[49:38.760 --> 49:41.960]  let me give you an example of that let's talk about what's going on with this
[49:41.960 --> 49:45.280]  because you know they want to misdirect you constantly throughout these red
[49:45.280 --> 49:48.400]  herrings and we start to look at some of the real issues they say oh no no no
[49:48.400 --> 49:53.920]  they pull out the smelly fish drag it along the trail and then you lose track
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.560]  of where you're going completely destroy completely lose the scent that you were
[49:58.560 --> 50:02.080]  following down I want to go back to this article from Time magazine back in
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.160]  July what would Clinton and Trump tax plans mean for you and this is not a
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.640]  conservative organization looking at this this is Time magazine and they're
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.920]  looking at various groups of people different income groups what would these
[50:16.920 --> 50:20.480]  tax plans mean for you so they pull up several of them here's one right here
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.080]  singles and married joint filers earning between 23,000 and 45,000 average income
[50:26.080 --> 50:31.200]  $35,000 so think about that about $35,000 they say if you're a full-time
[50:31.200 --> 50:37.040]  Walmart employee making $13 an hour then that would equate to about $27,000 a
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.320]  year so you'd be right in the middle of this you'd be kind of on the lower end
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.320]  of it actually 23 to $45,000 okay what would happen to you you'd get a tax
[50:47.320 --> 50:52.360]  increase under Hillary Clinton you get a tax decrease under Donald Trump so you
[50:52.360 --> 50:57.080]  get $15 more taxes per year under Hillary Clinton or under Donald Trump you
[50:57.080 --> 51:01.800]  get $969 less so let me say to you that if you're working in retail you're
[51:01.800 --> 51:07.000]  working at about $13 an hour even at that magic number of $15 an
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.560]  hour that they're pushing for then what that means to you is that the difference
[51:11.560 --> 51:15.240]  between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is going to be about $1,000 a year for
[51:15.240 --> 51:21.160]  you $984 a year do you can you afford to just throw that away and understand
[51:21.160 --> 51:26.600]  that's going to be per year so over four years it's about $3,900 more that you're
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.320]  going to be playing paying under Hillary Clinton that's for the Walmart
[51:29.320 --> 51:36.080]  workers what about people who are making between 81 and 143,000 dollars average
[51:36.080 --> 51:41.720]  income 112,000 well those people would see a tax hike from Hillary Clinton and
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.640]  a tax cut of $5,300 from Donald Trump in other words the combined difference
[51:46.640 --> 51:55.120]  between the two would be $5,500 and 12 a $5,512 so if Hillary Clinton becomes
[51:55.120 --> 52:01.880]  president those people would pay $5,512 more per year than they
[52:01.880 --> 52:08.400]  would under Donald Trump or over a period of four years about $22,000 you see
[52:08.400 --> 52:14.240]  how that works let's take somebody that is at the very top okay those people
[52:14.240 --> 52:18.720]  also going to get their taxes cut and so that's the way Time Magazine spends it
[52:18.720 --> 52:23.760]  it's policy politics of envy saying oh look at this the people at the top are
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.160]  going to get an even bigger tax decrease and you know the people that I just those
[52:28.160 --> 52:33.280]  two branches those two groups I just gave you people making an average $112,000
[52:33.280 --> 52:40.040]  that group of people they would make they would save about $22,000 over four
[52:40.040 --> 52:46.080]  years the people at the lower level the Walmart workers would save about $4,000
[52:46.080 --> 52:50.120]  over four years because they're making a lot less they're making about one fifth
[52:50.120 --> 52:53.880]  of what the other people are making that's the way percentages work and you
[52:53.880 --> 52:57.360]  know even though they have what they call a progressive income tax system
[52:57.360 --> 53:01.440]  where the percentages go up as your income goes up you're still always
[53:01.440 --> 53:05.280]  going to see a bigger tax break for the people at the top and so the way the
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.920]  Democrats spend that is by using envy they tell you you don't want to vote
[53:09.920 --> 53:13.800]  for somebody that's going to save you $4,000 because somebody else is going to
[53:13.800 --> 53:18.080]  save more so you don't want that to happen because the other people in the
[53:18.080 --> 53:21.600]  middle class they're going to save $22,000 over four years and you're only
[53:21.600 --> 53:25.360]  going to save $4,000 so you should vote for the person that's going to cost
[53:25.360 --> 53:29.120]  you $4,000 because you don't want to see somebody else get ahead see that's the
[53:29.120 --> 53:34.320]  politics of envy it's also the politics of rape of economic rape you know it's
[53:34.320 --> 53:39.960]  the economy stupid as Bill Clinton and his campaign staff understood the first
[53:39.960 --> 53:43.160]  time he ran for president take a look at the last one they look here they look
[53:43.160 --> 53:48.000]  at all these different income groups and the last one they look at is Uncle Sam
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.600]  how does Uncle Sam fair under Hillary Clinton and under Donald Trump well
[53:52.600 --> 53:58.520]  under Hillary Clinton Uncle Sam gets more money he gets $30 billion more
[53:58.520 --> 54:06.320]  under Donald Trump Uncle Sam gets $545 billion less okay so Uncle Sam has a
[54:06.320 --> 54:16.480]  difference of $575 billion difference between Hillary and Donald each year so
[54:16.480 --> 54:21.240]  over four years you're looking at about 2,300 billion or 2.3 trillion dollars
[54:21.240 --> 54:25.520]  that's a massive amount of money there's going to be pulled out of the
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.560]  economy pulled away from small businesses pulled away from individuals
[54:29.560 --> 54:34.720]  pulled away from employees who are going to not see pay raises because their
[54:34.720 --> 54:38.840]  employer was paying more taxes or had to pay more Obamacare mandates or
[54:38.840 --> 54:44.640]  whatever that's not even looking at the tax we call Obamacare think about the
[54:44.640 --> 54:50.240]  fact that we had 16,000 new IRS agents added to administer this tax it is a
[54:50.240 --> 54:53.920]  mandate it is an unconstitutional mandate but it is true it is a tax as
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.120]  well it is a tax that goes from you to the private insurance corporations that
[54:59.120 --> 55:04.560]  got Obama and Hillary to write their rules to make money for them that's a
[55:04.560 --> 55:07.520]  good example right there if you look at the difference in just Obamacare
[55:07.520 --> 55:13.240]  understand that people have already seen a 50% to 300% increase in insurance
[55:13.240 --> 55:18.240]  premiums under Obamacare and they're hiding a massive increase it's going to
[55:18.240 --> 55:21.680]  take place right after the election it's going to be a minimum of 50 to 60% we
[55:21.680 --> 55:28.280]  see insurance Obamacare markets as they call them quote-unquote that are going
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.080]  to be going bankrupt there's an article up on drudge report today about one
[55:32.080 --> 55:35.560]  state where the Obamacare institutions are going to be going
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.280]  bankrupt unless they have a 50 to 60% increase right away you have to
[55:40.280 --> 55:45.440]  understand this is something that was written by the big insurance companies
[55:45.440 --> 55:50.520]  for the benefit of the big insurance companies and you should understand how
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.760]  this is going to take even more money out of the economy the people at the
[55:54.760 --> 55:59.440]  very lowest they again they sell this idea of envy hoping that you don't look
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.560]  at the fact that the people at the very lowest level they talk about Donald Trump
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.280]  having three different tax rates that he's proposed here nice I should have
[56:06.280 --> 56:12.640]  four the fourth rate is zero that's the people that are that are making taxes
[56:12.640 --> 56:19.760]  that are a single person making $25,000 a year pays zero taxes under his plan
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.040]  but you don't want that because somebody that's making a lot more money than you
[56:24.040 --> 56:27.720]  is going to get more of a tax savings than you do so you should shut this
[56:27.720 --> 56:31.680]  whole thing down and pay Hillary more taxes see that's the kind of thinking
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.760]  that keeps people in the basement literally in the basement in their
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.520]  parents basement because they can't have any opportunity you understand these
[56:41.520 --> 56:47.960]  are also the people who are bringing in so many foreign workers that the young
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.680]  people the millennials can't find part-time work in the first place that
[56:52.680 --> 56:55.840]  is I think one of the biggest crimes the fact that they have shut that down to
[56:55.840 --> 56:58.360]  them just as they have made it more expensive for them to get cars and made
[56:58.360 --> 57:01.640]  it impossible for them to find jobs because they're competing with adults
[57:01.640 --> 57:05.320]  looking for full-time work that aren't even American citizens they want us to be
[57:05.320 --> 57:12.040]  right back 2016 you're now 36 days out from the November elections you're
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.520]  listening to Alex Jones
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.000]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do joins us you
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.680]  worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force get I've been working

[57:31.120 --> 57:34.760]  I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and
[57:34.760 --> 57:38.080]  I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brain force
[57:38.080 --> 57:41.480]  right there I pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.840]  everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars people really
[57:45.840 --> 57:48.480]  love it read about it find out why third-party

[58:04.440 --> 58:08.520]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other

[58:25.320 --> 58:30.400]  pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put tops
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.680]  in some food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing
[58:34.680 --> 58:39.520]  with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that

[59:32.360 --> 59:41.520]  war it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight in the
[59:41.520 --> 59:45.200]  next segment we're gonna be joined by Roger Stone he's gonna give us his
[59:45.200 --> 59:50.160]  exclusive update on his what's gonna happen on Wednesday and he tweeted out
[59:50.160 --> 59:54.880]  and referenced WikiLeaks that on Wednesday the Hillary Clinton campaign
[59:54.880 --> 59:58.880]  will be done will be finished they're gonna talk about it talk to him about
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.200]  what he sees happening on Wednesday with Julian Assange and about the other
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.360]  things that have broken over the last 48 hours there's been a lot of news coming
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.640]  out as I was talking about in the last segment again pulling out this
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.200]  information about Donald Trump's tax returns saying that he had nearly a
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.440]  billion dollars in a loss and we don't know whether that was a failed business
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.800]  or whether that was a defrauding somebody defrauded him and he got a
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.760]  lawsuit as I pointed out I know someone who had a situation I'm trying to build
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.040]  a home they had the builder go bankrupt abscond with a lot of their money as
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.440]  did many other potential homeowners they were never able to get that money back
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.960]  from them even though it was owed to them but when you have a loss like that
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.840]  whether it is a business loss or whether it is something like that we're
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.400]  defrauded you have to take that each year and you can take up to 20 years to
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.560]  take that off but you can the only way that you can recover that if somebody
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.440]  doesn't pay you is to take that gradually so we don't know what the case is
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.400]  with Donald Trump's situation but what they're trying to do is get you angry
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.680]  about the fact that he took a tax deduction do you take your mortgage
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.480]  deduction would you like to have more deductions do you use all the mortgage
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.640]  deductions that you have if not why not and if you don't you're foolish you're
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.960]  foolish not to do that if it's a legal deduction you should be able to they're
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.680]  not accusing him of cheating they're not accusing him of tax evasion okay it's
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.600]  the difference between a legal profit that you make in a business and money
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.120]  laundering do you understand the difference there you can have a
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.200]  straight-up business where you are operating publicly and making a profit
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.640]  doing all the paperwork for the government paying them their taxes so
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.920]  forth and so on that's a profit okay you're trying to avoid paying taxes but
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.400]  if you've got a criminal operation like you're selling drugs or something okay
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.600]  and again I'm not saying that drugs selling drugs should be criminal I'm
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.440]  not in favor of prohibition but let's whatever whatever it is that you're
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.360]  doing okay I'll say there's something violent but it's illegal and so what
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.520]  you do is you try to wash that money and make it look like it's legal so you open
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.960]  up a restaurant or something and you channel your illegal money through there
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.280]  or you channel it through HSBC where FBI director Comey used to sit on the board
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.360]  directors you channel it through those people just like El Chapo did when he
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.960]  had his own checkout window at HSBC you clean up your money and then you get it
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.120]  in that's the difference that we're talking about here folks we're talking
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.640]  about the difference between having a profit and doing something criminal like
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.960]  money laundering it is not wrong to try to avoid taxes and yet the New York Times
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.760]  it tries to imply that there's something wrong in 2014 paid no taxes at all let
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.120]  me read you this quote from Forbes magazine that Breitbart puts out they
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.960]  say for the tax year 2014 the New York Times paid no taxes yet got an income
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.080]  tax refund of $3 million even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.920]  million you understand that they got a profit before taxes of $30 million they
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.920]  get a refund of three and as Forbes says think about that their post tax profit
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.360]  was higher than their pre-tax profit New York Times they say the explanation for
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.960]  this is in their 2014 annual report the effective tax rate for 2014 they said
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.000]  was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.120]  revenues for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.400]  limitations got that you understand that you understand that complexity I
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.960]  don't understand let me read that to you a second time to say if you don't know
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.840]  what that it read a second time while we'll read it a second time the reversal
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.120]  of revenues for uncertain tax positions due to a lapse of applicable
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.800]  statutes of limitations I have no idea what that means but that's the games that
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.600]  they play that's the games in New York Times plays to make sure that they don't
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.120]  not only don't pay any taxes but they have a profit of $30 million and they
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:50.280]  get back another $3 million see that's the hypocrisy and at the same time they
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.200]  put this out there because they don't want you to focus on the fact that Donald
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.480]  Trump is proposing the largest tax simplification and tax reduction ever
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.480]  proposed bigger than JFK bigger than Ronald Reagan and yet Hillary Clinton
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.280]  wants to raise taxes to the highest rate that we have seen across the board she
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.200]  wants to raise taxes on everyone and at the top end go up to 65% that's what I
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.560]  call trickle-down poverty folks those higher rates are going to trickle down
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.080]  to you as well stay with us to be right back with Roger Stone

[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.920]  saying by Wednesday the Clinton campaign will be done hashtag WikiLeaks so we
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.440]  want to break it that down with Roger Stone joining us now is Roger Stone
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:28.480]  welcome Roger great to be here okay tell us what is coming well first before we
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.200]  do that let's talk about what happened yesterday with the Gorilla marketing that
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.640]  we saw there on Fox News that was an amazing piece right there and I think
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.360]  that tells us a lot about the power of the mass public in terms of the
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.920]  awakening of people and also getting this information out to people in
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.960]  unusual ways I think that was very effective what's your take on that what
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:55.400]  it shows David is that one person can make a difference the mainstream media
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:05.360]  wants to obliterate the narrative about Bill Clinton and his sexual predator
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:11.200]  nature the fact that he has sexually assaulted or bitten or raped or exposed
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:18.240]  himself to at least 13 women that we know of and that his wife Hillary Clinton
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.960]  has been an accessory after the fact in every one of those assaults because she
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:31.720]  is the one who intimidates threatens discredits and bullies his victims in the
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:38.640]  case of Juanita Broderick a very brave lady she intimidated Juanita to her face
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.800]  now the mainstream media hates this narrative and therefore they want to
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:50.640]  transpose it into affairs you know bulls marriage this has nothing to do with
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.280]  affairs or his marriage it is not about marital infidelity it is not about
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:03.560]  adultery it is not about girlfriends or mistresses or one-night stands or what
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.840]  my friends in Philadelphia called the Gouma it's about sexual assault it's
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:18.440]  about violence against women and for example Michael Smirkanish of CNN has a
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:25.280]  lively Saturday show I've been on the show a number of times Michael's a very
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:32.240]  smart guy a longtime associate and friend of mine in fact he was once the
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.920]  right-hand man to Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo I got him a position as a
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.200]  high-level appointee in the Reagan administration where he was the regional
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.200]  administrator for housing and urban development a job from which he was
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.840]  ultimately fired because he could not follow directions it's not that Michael
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.320]  has a lot of enemies it's just that all of his friends hate him in any event
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:07.760]  yesterday on CNN when a surrogate for Donald Trump began to discuss Bill's
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:15.800]  epic sexual abuse of women Michael kept referring to it as infidelities and you
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.680]  know about his marriage this is intellectually dishonest now Michael
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.600]  Smirkanish is a lawyer in fact he's a very fine lawyer and he knows the
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.960]  difference between infidelity and rape if he doesn't he should refresh himself
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:38.000]  on the rape statuettes in Pennsylvania state law so this is a phony narrative
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.320]  put forward by the mainstream media this is why it's important that people who
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.360]  support the cause who are enlisted in the info war get on the media and take up
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:57.480]  Alex Jones' challenge to get on television wearing your rape t-shirt your
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:04.000]  iconic Bill Clinton rapes t-shirt written about in Time magazine available at
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.280]  the info wars dot com store available at the stone cold truth dot com store and
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.520]  by the way Alex and I have agreed to donate a portion of the proceeds to a
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.060]  rape crisis center but it's important that people take Alex up on this
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:27.160]  challenge the mainstream media is not going to report this honestly well
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.080]  absolutely you know you go back and you look at what happened in the 1990s and
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.160]  the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the impeachment technically was for
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.400]  committing perjury and I've tried to explain that many times my liberal
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.320]  friends as I know they just went after him because he had an affair everybody
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:44.680]  has affairs so forth and so on they always make it about consensual sex not
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.440]  about the sexual assault not about the rape they've always covered that up
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.280]  that's one of the reasons why they focus so heavily on Monica Lewinsky because
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.400]  that was a consensual issue but they they would completely avoid Juanita
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.400]  Broderick or Kathleen Willie or all these other women that you mentioned
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.800]  13 or so women that he has that have come out and said that they were raped
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.880]  by him without consent and that's a huge difference there but that's why we have
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.800]  the rape t-shirt that is the point that needs to be driven home it is not about
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.040]  consensual sex it is not about some guy who's a flander you know my friends will
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.640]  also look at this and say oh you know well yeah he's a real stud it's very you
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.720]  know he may be a flander but you know all these women really love him and it
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.240]  makes him even cooler in their eyes and yet it's about rape that's why we put
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.480]  that there it is about rape it is about the abuse of women and the fact that
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.040]  Hillary Clinton joined in with him in cold blood you could say that what she
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.240]  did I think is is even worse than what Bill Clinton did I mean you could what
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.160]  she does completely cold-blooded you can't even say that it was a crime of
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.680]  passion at any sense and I'm not saying that rape is excusable because some guy
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.320]  is is passionate about it but I'm saying that what she did was simply from a
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:04.280]  cold political perspective damaging these women as many of them have said in a
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  way that was lasting beyond the physical abuse even that Bill Clinton did the
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.320]  fact that Juanita Broderick says she can't get over the fact that she was
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.120]  raped and she was only she was actually a year younger than Chelsea Clinton is
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.160]  today so I put that in perspective as Donald Trump kind of pulled back and
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.960]  said I don't talk about this with Chelsea Chelsea's a year older than
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.160]  Juanita Broderick was when she was raped that never goes away for her but it
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.880]  also never goes away for her the fact that she was threatened to her face by
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.560]  Hillary Clinton well and she was bitten twice bills this is Bill's MO at least
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.320]  three women confirmed by NBC's Mike Izakov and confirmed by the Washington
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.680]  Post that he bites through the upper lip of his victims it's a it's a very
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:54.200]  common disabling move for rapists now I understand that the mainstream media
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.520]  doesn't want to talk about this Sam Stein at the Huffington Post has a piece
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:06.560]  up now in which he talks about the last person who brought up Bill's affairs now
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:12.680]  Stein's a nice enough fellow but this is intellectually dishonest the issue here
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.440]  that's nothing to do with consensual sex whether it is Juanita Broderick or
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.680]  Kathleen Willie or Paula Jones or Christie Zurcher or Sandra Alan James or
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:28.040]  Liz Ward Grayson although she changed her story after she was given a bit part
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.840]  by a Clinton crony in Hollywood these women were all sexually assaulted what
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.760]  could be more politically incorrect than sexual assault and violence against
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:46.880]  women that is the issue here but he gets a free pass they get a free pass for
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.920]  this because Hillary is a woman isn't that ironic although it was a misstep
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.720]  for for Donald Trump to post last week that he was considering invent inviting
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.680]  Jennifer Flowers to sit in the front row wrong metaphor yes Jennifer Flowers has
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.760]  a 12-year consensual relationship with Bill Clinton now it is true that three
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.800]  Arkansas state troopers burst into the apartment of her next-door neighbor
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.080]  Gary Johnson an attorney and beat him so badly they leave him for dead because
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:24.160]  he unfortunately has witnessed Bill coming and going with his own key to
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.880]  Jennifer Flowers apartment so we still have cold-blooded violence on the part
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.720]  of the Clintons no I urge those who understand this issue and who are
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:41.120]  engaged in this great struggle to take Alex Jones up on his challenge if you
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.080]  can appear on television for a few seconds and clearly display the rape
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:54.560]  t-shirt he will pay you $1,000 if you can do so with a bullhorn and say Bill
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.320]  Clinton is a rapist he will pay you $5,000 and I spoke to him earlier today
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.040]  this does not have to be network television if you get on television in
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:10.360]  Philadelphia or Cleveland or Detroit and we see it then you can qualify but we
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.800]  gotta go to break Roger when we come back and talk to Roger Stone about what's

[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.160]  globalist are in total panic they admit they're in panic their whole corporate
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.040]  world government that's anti-free market that's crony capitalist he is in
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.960]  retreat and I'm out here with my family today taking off the day listening to
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.640]  Roger listen David I'm doing a fabulous job and I'm glad they're I'm glad they're
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.480]  covering the fact that you're the ones that known rapist who settled cases for
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.640]  sexual abuse 12 known Roger has been the tip of the spear was best-selling book
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:48.160]  exposing this it's documented it's well-known but I am on the edge of my
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.240]  seat as the listeners are that's why I just called in and said hey let me take
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.880]  over I know they said it was coming up to get into WikiLeaks because I had no
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.720]  idea whenever I was gonna do a broadcast thing with David I had to take
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.920]  day off so I was listening that he was gonna break this on our show today so I'm
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.680]  so honored and again it may get pushed off something may happen there's been
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.240]  threats the signs won't be up in the big window now doing it you know from the
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:17.560]  from the facility that he's staying at in London the the facility of that's
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:22.760]  basically based on a foreign government but at the same time this is such a big
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.520]  deal because the fact is he's saying something probably to come out on
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.680]  Wednesday so Roger is saying this is the quote end of Hillary on Wednesday I
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.520]  agree and if the information is powerful like all the other assigned
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.160]  information is powerful the mainstream media isn't trying to ignore it so
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.600]  whatever information he's about to release from the Ecuadorian embassy all
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.520]  of us that means through the listeners you are the power of the show he'd
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.920]  to magnify it he could push it need to get it out there but separately from
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.320]  that then I'm gonna hang up on that Roger and David take it over it's been a
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.200]  lot of time a couple segments on this we have already seen information come out
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.320]  that should bring the globalist down we've got to continue to put it out and
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.400]  the good news is no matter what they say it's Donald Trump it only seems to
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.120]  blow up with their face but history is happening just like what's the 24 hours
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:13.400]  after I called for folks to storm actual TV shows or out in public it began to
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.600]  happen if the people take action this facade will fall we're on the edge of
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.440]  history I'm gonna turn this over to both David Knight and Roger Stone right now
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:28.200]  but the videos on info wars.com with this big national movement we've
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.520]  launched to expose Bill Clinton sex crimes it's important for all of you
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.880]  listening to realize just like the young man that we don't know his name yet you
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.080]  ease of contact is just like the young man that took action in New York is
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.480]  changing history you are changing history you literally are the power
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.720]  that's not that's not be complimenting you when I say that you are the power you
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.760]  are the strength you are the info war but gentlemen I'm gonna hang up go ahead
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.920]  and take over tell us about this huge WikiLeaks info I'm so honored you're
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:57.560]  doing this here on the show Roger Alex great to be here let's let's wrap up
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.280]  our discussion of the important Clinton t-shirt project because I must say this
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:08.240]  do not break the law do not break and enter a TV studio we want you to do this
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.760]  in a legal way when the TV cameras are outside when there's an open shot and you
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.920]  see it all the time at Trump rallies particularly at Clinton rallies at Bill
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.920]  Clinton's rallies then that is the time to strike very very soon we're going to
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:30.600]  be unveiling our next important product the Bill Clinton rape whistle which you
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:36.680]  will be able to buy at info wars.com or at stone cold truth.com so if you hear
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:42.520]  that Bill Clinton is coming to town get your Bill Clinton rape whistle to greet
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:48.320]  him hundreds of people blowing their rape whistles cannot be ignored by the
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:54.080]  mainstream media. Absolutely and you know Roger when we look at this I think
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.520]  it's important people understand just like the Hillary for prison t-shirt
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.120]  people have to understand that it's not mistakes it's multiple felonies that's
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.520]  why we have the Hillary for Clinton t-shirt and you know that's only by the
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.480]  way that's only going to go for another 30 days this can become a collector's
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.040]  item you can find that at info wars.com that supports our operation just like
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.600]  the rape t-shirt supports our operation and supports this marketing campaign to
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.480]  get the truth out because just like it's not a mistake it's multiple felonies it
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.960]  is not consensual sex it is multiple rapes that's why we have the t-shirt
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:31.080]  that's why we have the campaign to drill that into people because the mainstream
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.480]  media is trying to spend this constantly they've been doing it for the last 25
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.560]  years telling people oh this is just an affair he's actually pretty cool and
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.640]  nothing to see move on okay that's what they're saying but I want to get to the
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.000]  what you tweeted out today about Wednesday what's going to happen on
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.360]  Wednesday that's going to end the Hillary Clinton campaign. Well I think it's
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.760]  first it's important David to set the table as you know earlier this week
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:02.440]  congressman Jerry Nadler a left-wing corpulent Democrat from Manhattan called
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:08.560]  on the FBI director to open an investigation into Roger Stone and his
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:14.280]  connections to WikiLeaks. Yeah McCarthyism. Yeah it's the new McCarthyism.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.720]  Joe McCarthy Roy Cohn Jerry Nadler it's a matched set of of witch hunt. I have
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.240]  been completely forthright here and in other interviews that Assange is in my
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:33.120]  view a hero he does not work for the Russians let me repeat that he does not
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.240]  work for the Russians there's no evidence to the contrary he is fighting
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.640]  the deep state he has leaked documents equally embarrassing to the Bush regime
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.200]  and liberals loved him then but now you see an online effort funded by Soros
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.480]  run by the money laundering criminal David Brock to discredit Assange I
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.640]  actually saw a tweet saying oh Assange is whatever he releases will be fake no
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:07.600]  whatever he releases will be real now an intermediary met with him in London
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.360]  recently who is a friend of mine and a friend of his a believer in freedom and
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.640]  I am assured that the mother load is coming Wednesday it wouldn't be an
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:26.920]  October surprise if I told you what it was but I have reason to believe that it
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:33.200]  is devastating because people with political judgment who are aware of the
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.680]  subject matter tell me this so right now you see a terrible scrambling by the
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:45.320]  Clint Knights to attempt to discredit Assange to try to soften the blow I have
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.480]  said from the beginning that I believe that mr. Assange has all of the emails
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:57.240]  that the Clinton hench women whom I have a den who by the way was partying with
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:03.520]  Barbara Bush this weekend in Paris yeah yeah a bit quite a party proving that
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:08.480]  the Bushes and Clintons are together in a crime syndicate that's right and
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.600]  Cheryl Mills they thought they destroyed all these emails they thought they were
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:20.960]  deleted bad news WikiLeaks has them all its handcuff time because herein lies the
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.360]  proof of the criminality of the Clintons now we've seen disinformation in the
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.280]  last 24 hours saying that Assange is postpone this he's moved I do know this
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.320]  he does fear for his life and he should right now the globalists and the
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.920]  Clintonites are trying to figure out how to kill him we know that a man broke
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:48.400]  into the Ecuadorian embassy and got as far as the second floor before he was
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:55.240]  detained but it took the London police almost two hours to respond to the call
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.080]  for help even though they have a cordon around the Ecuadorian embassy they've
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.960]  spent millions of dollars to try to keep Julian Assange in prison there it took
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.160]  them two hours to respond to this as they were notified they had a break in
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.600]  stay with us gonna be right back with Roger Stone and what's coming up on
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  Wednesday we'll be right back
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:31.200]  more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.080]  has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.040]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.000]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.240]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.200]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.200]  it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself for
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.680]  your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.120]  the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.520]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:14.480]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.440]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.520]  for a long time Alex because I think it's very very important what the aging
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.760]  process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:53.040]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.560]  you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.840]  trials it's one of the most effective substances in the world it works like an

[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:52.320]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:56.400]  GCN radio network
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:00.840]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Roger
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:05.800]  Stone and he mentioned that Wednesday was going to be the date for WikiLeaks to
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.760]  release the documents they had on Hillary Clinton remember Julian Assange has
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.200]  been saying for a long time there was going to be an October surprise it was
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.480]  going to be very damaging to Hillary Clinton it was going to be the end of
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:20.800]  Hillary Clinton so much information was going to come out that to expose her and
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.800]  I get very concerned Roger when I see this we talk all the time about the
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.240]  clear and present danger to Donald Trump's life when he rises in the polls
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.040]  and of course we've seen other instances we had Andrew Breitbart saying had some
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.280]  major revelations that were going to come out in the day before that happened
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.480]  he died we I've been concerned for a very long time about Julian Assange
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.720]  safety is we went to the break you were talking about how there was an intruder
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.440]  at the Ecuadorian embassy where he's been essentially cordoned by London
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.720]  police they've spent millions of dollars over the years to keep him imprisoned
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:58.280]  in that embassy I know they wouldn't take two hours to respond if Julian Assange
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.400]  began to leave that embassy but they took more than two hours even though
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.320]  they're posted right outside the embassy as you can see in that picture there
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.240]  even though they're posted right outside there permanently they took over two
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.280]  hours to respond to the fact that there was an intruder there so I'm very
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.960]  concerned about it especially the earlier report said that Julian Assange was
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.360]  going to make the announcement from the balcony at the Ecuadorian embassy I
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.440]  mean that sounds like a Martin Luther King moment to me yeah I think that that
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.520]  they should rethink that because he is more valuable to the movement alive
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:32.560]  yeah and look I don't want to overstate this because I know that my critics are
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:38.440]  watching I don't control Assange and nobody does he is his own man and he is
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.720]  committed to fighting the deep state and he may change his mind about what to
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.680]  put out and when to put it out but my very best intelligence from a mutual
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.960]  friend who has spoken to him in London is that the mother load is about to come
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:35:00.240]  and it will be extraordinarily damning to the Clintons that's why you see this
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:07.280]  extraordinary panic and why you see the media now wanting to talk about Donald
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:13.320]  Trump's taxes now there's a huge difference between tax avoidance and
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:21.680]  tax fraud Donald Trump took advantage of tax laws passed by Republicans and
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:28.840]  Democrats together and paid his fair share under the law if he didn't take
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.880]  the deductions then he's too dumb to be president and I don't want him to be
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:39.440]  president or he would be like Hillary Clinton who has the the legal firm where
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.480]  Comey and Loretta Lynch were studying on the partners at law firm they used to
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.720]  do the taxes for the Clinton so they put out a nice neat package of taxes and
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.920]  then launder a massive amounts of money through their foundations and their
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.240]  network of institutions that they've got going there that's the way they play it
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.720]  see those that information from the Clinton Foundation absolutely when
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.000]  you've got that it's no different than taking a mortgage deduction I mean you
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.920]  want to try to minimize your taxes that's what everybody does if they got
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.000]  half a brain you want to try to minimize your taxes they're not saying that he
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.840]  did anything illegal but they're trying to say that it's a bad deal if he
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:17.880]  doesn't pay taxes you've got people like Warren Buffett saying oh it's a crime
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.640]  that my tax rate is lower than my secretary's rate or whatever well he
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.880]  could always pay more taxes but that's virtue signaling from him from Hillary
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.760]  Clinton from the New York Times even though New York Times did the exact
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.720]  same thing they didn't pay any taxes and and I don't know if what they did to
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.680]  again I read the statement that they put out and it was very legalistic I
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.960]  don't know what they did to get three million dollars back when they had a
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.560]  profit of 30 million but that's the way the New York Times plays it but then
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.640]  they criticized Donald Trump for doing the same thing yeah you got to wonder
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.600]  whether they pass him those tax savings on to the Mexican billionaire Carlos
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.560]  Slim owns a majority interest in the New York Times and who is of course the
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.920]  single largest donor to the Clinton Foundation Ponzi scam so it is a look I
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.760]  don't want a president who pays more than he's than he is required to this is
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.440]  the guy I want in charge of the federal treasury somebody who counts every
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.320]  dollar somebody who is not beholden to special interest and therefore could
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.000]  actually cut waste if you're paying the government more than you're legally
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.640]  required to as I say you're too dumb to be president United States well it's an
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.120]  effort to try to get people to pay attention to Donald Trump's taxes and
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.840]  not to their own taxes Donald Trump has put out the largest tax decrease that
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.040]  any president has ever proposed larger than tax than Reagan's tax decreases and
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.920]  yet Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on everyone from the poorest to the
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:50.720]  richest she brags about how she's going to put a death tax of 45 to 65% on
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.760]  people as an estate tax a death tax that's going to devastate small
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:58.760]  businesses it's gonna devastate small farms they don't have the corporate
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.240]  lawyers to fight these kind of re-evaluations and she's gonna go up
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.880]  on taxes for everybody she's bragging about that highest tax rates we've had
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.680]  since Ronald Reagan came in she wants to re-institute they don't want people to
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.240]  see that they want people to buy into this politics of envy and get upset about
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.840]  the fact that Donald Trump took legal tax deductions now this is this is what
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.480]  my friend Lionel calls the rodeo clown media so in other words don't look at
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.480]  the massive theft and corruption the Clinton Foundation look over here at
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:33.080]  Donald Trump taking perfectly legal tax deductions over losses that he had it
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:38.560]  is it is really pathetic by the way I think it will have very little effect
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.360]  now the great question about Trump's taxes has been answered so it's time for
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.920]  Hillary to release all the emails I mean Trump's taxes are now out there we
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.760]  know what the riddle is it's time for Hillary to to have the same kind of of
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.680]  exposure the same kind of disclosure and if she doesn't do it I'm convinced that
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:05.440]  mr. Assange will do so you know another place Roger where there's been a
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.360]  misdirection is on Cuba trying to get Florida Hillary came out this last week
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.840]  and made some allegations that Donald Trump had tried to avoid sanctions in
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.360]  Cuba ignoring the fact that it's been Hillary Clinton and the Obama
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.840]  administration that took down the sanctions that have been there since the
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:30.120]  1960s against Cuba that's the most amazing thing to me and yet they have
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.840]  to do that because there's a massive Republican vote that is Cuban in Florida
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.880]  so it is a purely political move ignoring the hypocrisy of the felony
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.560]  violations that Obama just committed with the violation of Iran sanctions
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.520]  sending plain loads of foreign currency on secret plane flights from Switzerland
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.000]  to Iran in clear violation of his own declaration of Iran as being a terror
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  estate things that were actually funnies yeah Cubans that I know Cuban
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.800]  Americans my wife is a Cuban American her her father was a diplomat under
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:10.960]  Batista who fled for his life because he was on a hit list in the Central
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.800]  Intelligence Agency informed him shortly after he was to return for
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:21.120]  indoctrination in Cuba that he should not go back to his homeland he lost
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:27.920]  everything in the Cuban revolution but Cubans that I know and I know many know
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:34.760]  that the under the embargo lifting that those who do business in Cuba cannot
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.800]  partner with local Cuban business people they have to partner with the
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.200]  government the government takes dollars they give worthless pesos to the people
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:49.240]  and they use the money to reinforce the secret police people still disappear in
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:54.800]  the middle of the night in Cuba the Castro brothers are not some kind of
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:01.560]  romantic Robin Hoods they are totalitarian thugs who oppress Christians
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.760]  in gays and women and anyone who disagrees with the communist rule and
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.920]  people are still fleeing that regime and the Cubans in Florida should be Cuban
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:14.560]  Americans in Florida should be very upset about what you just described there
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.400]  and yet what Hillary Clinton does as we see over and over again is she does this
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.120]  misdirection she comes in and makes an allegation false allegations about
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.040]  Trump or water and of something of a very minor nature to take away the fact
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.720]  that they have created the situation where people they say we've taken down
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.080]  the barriers and yet they've established a partnership with that
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.400]  authoritarian regime is what they've actually done yeah by the way I don't
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.880]  think this moves the Cuban vote on iota these are very informed people yeah I
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:50.160]  think older the older Cubans I think are motivated by the issue of Castro in the
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:56.240]  embargo the younger Cubans are not to them Fidel Castro who's hey isn't he a
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.880]  funny old man with a beard and a cigar yesterday I spoke to a very respected
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:08.280]  Cuban American Democratic pollster hang on save that till after the break we're
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.640]  gonna be we're talking to Roger Stone stone cold truth and we'll be right
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:30.760]  back stay with us the establishment anti-trump push continues the UN
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.240]  tweeted for eight million Americans abroad to stop Trump urging them to get
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:39.640]  out and vote to defeat Trump the UN quickly erased the tweet from the record
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:44.440]  1984 style and made a statement saying it was a mistake and that it did not
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.240]  originate from the UN news center if you believe that now the Arizona Republic
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.920]  the largest newspaper in Arizona is backing Clinton a Democrat for the
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:57.920]  first time in its history the Arizona Republic is now losing subscribers and
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.240]  receiving death threats the USA today has made an unprecedented move and
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.640]  endorsed Clinton declaring Trump unfit to be president so establishment
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.360]  politicians and establishment media are clearly against Donald Trump this is

[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.200]  Roger you were just talking before we went to the break we were talking about
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:55.600]  Cuba and how Hillary Clinton is making a very fee-will-play for the Cuban vote
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.600]  trying to get them upset about sanctions implying that a third party that was
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.960]  tangentially alleging that a third party that was tangentially involved with
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:10.800]  Trump and tried to do something in violation of the embargo that we had
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.160]  there ignoring the fact of course that even if that were true Terry McAuliffe
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:20.320]  the governor of Virginia the person who was the former chair of the DNC same
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.080]  position that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had to cover for Hillary Clinton he
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.080]  ran Bill Clinton's reelection campaign he ran Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:35.000]  he went to directly himself to Cuba to try to set up business deals while
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.480]  the embargo was in place and was essentially thrown out but she brings
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.520]  this up even as we see them violating the sanctions committing felonies in
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.640]  Iran but you had some information about the Cuban vote in Florida I'm very
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.680]  concerned to see what's going on there because that is a must-win state for
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.000]  Donald Trump as well isn't it? Yeah I don't think this makes much difference in
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.920]  all honesty even though it was plastered on the front page of the Miami Herald
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:05.600]  an independent consulting firm which Trump does not have any interest in made
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:10.260]  an exploratory trip to Cuba to look into doing business there they were
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:16.560]  notably unsuccessful at some point Trump reimbursed this company I really don't
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.520]  know why so Trump never did any business in Cuba and he may not have even
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.360]  understood the implications of reimbursing a consultant that he that
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:32.880]  he had hired to look for business opportunities around the globe but a
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.560]  very respected Democratic consultant Spolster pardon me who is himself
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.640]  Hispanics someone I have enormous respect for tells me that Trump has
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:51.240]  reached a 34 percent of the vote among Hispanics that there was no drop in just
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.040]  in Florida that there was no drop in his support now Romney topped out in
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:04.400]  Florida at 28 and a half so 34 would be sufficient for Trump to carry the state
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:09.360]  and indeed I think he's a couple points ahead it's important to understand that
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:15.120]  the Hispanic vote in Florida is not monolithically Cuban in fact the greater
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:20.840]  portion of Hispanic voters in Florida are Puerto Ricans Colombians and so on
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:27.360]  and they are habitual traditional Democrats if Trump can hold a third of
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:33.080]  the Hispanic vote which he's getting today that will be sufficient to carry
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:38.680]  the state now one of the concerns I have is that the targeting foisted on the
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.960]  Trump campaign by the Republican National Committee is designed to help
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:49.800]  Marco Rubio get reelected but does not include white Union Democrats in the
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.840]  central and southern part of the state who are Trump supporters they would
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:53:01.400]  probably vote Democratic down ballot so the Trump campaign needs to understand
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.480]  that they're being given a Mickey and that they need to use their own targeting
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:12.800]  to reach voters who are likely to vote for Trump not Trump and the entire
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:17.360]  Republican ticket let's talk about the steal the vote issue because you're
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.640]  involved in that in terms of looking at the election monitoring the election
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.080]  looking at the tricks that are being played and we just mentioned Terry
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:30.400]  McAuliffe governor of Virginia who has worked very hard to try to get felons
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:34.960]  the right to vote in Virginia believing that they're going to vote for the new
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:39.360]  felon in chief Hillary Clinton but we've also seen just as last week in
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.600]  Harrisonburg Virginia a small town of 50,000 people we saw 20 plus people who
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.280]  were dead registering to vote that only came to light because a person in this
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.000]  small town was looking at the names and happened to notice one of the names
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.440]  being a deceased judge so wait a minute this guy's dead started looking at the
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:00.800]  list in detail and found 20 dead people there but of course we're told all the
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:04.400]  time whether it's in North Carolina or Virginia or other places don't worry we
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:09.600]  shouldn't have any voter ID that is simply racist to have a picture ID we
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.840]  have picture ID for everything that we do with the government but talk to us
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:17.480]  about the concerns that you have for stealing the vote what people can do to
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:21.720]  monitor this on election day yeah I mean you look you need a photo ID to get on
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:26.200]  an airplane in any airport in the United States is that is that racist I'm not
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:31.000]  sure I understand but look President Barack Obama tells us that voter fraud
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.160]  literally does not exist that is absurd excellent report on Fox the other night
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:41.600]  with Brett Baer focusing on four or five people who voted in two states on the
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.400]  same day they would vote in Indiana and then drive to Wisconsin and vote again
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.880]  so of course it exists but it's important understand the distinction
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.760]  between voter fraud people not registered to vote people voting in the
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.240]  place of dead people people voting multiple times and election rigging that
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:06.200]  is the electronic manipulation of the computerized voter machines that we
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:10.640]  know Hillary did during the Democratic primaries in at least 12 states
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.920]  according to an authoritative study at Stanford University I think this is a
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:22.120]  great danger this is why we started stop the steal dot org I asked people to go
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:28.400]  there and volunteer for our exit poll program because the only way we can
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.000]  ensure the integrity of this election is with scientifically conducted exit
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.720]  polls in certain pre-selected key precincts in key counties in key states
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:44.240]  where we suspect that there will be shenanigans if the results of the
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:51.400]  machines do not knit do not match roughly the results of the exit polling in
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:57.800]  other words if there's a wide swing you have evidence of voter fraud in a
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:05.000]  basis on which Trump could challenge the the legality in the outcome of this
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.840]  election and that's very important because we've seen this happen throughout
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.800]  Central and South America just in Brazil we just had the female president
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.560]  there impeached she was very unpopular she was behind ten points in the poll
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.080]  and then they had a lot of electronic voting machines and on the day they had
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  the election they decided that on that particular day they weren't going to have
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.320]  the organization that does exit polling participate so they just took a powder
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.040]  and she handedly won and we've seen this throughout Central and South America and
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:37.880]  yet we see this company vote votes smartmatic which is the largest
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.640]  electronic voting machine company they were brought in by the GOP and Utah to
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.000]  run their primaries are our people at the top both Republican and Democrat in
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.680]  the United States are bringing in these electronic voting machines everywhere
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.520]  that's something that that really concerns me and course interestingly
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.200]  David these companies keep quickly changing names as soon as their machines
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.040]  are identified so dye bowl which supplies the machines for example in
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:10.000]  both Florida and Ohio they changed their name to premier election services
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.800]  exactly that's all the time we've got thank you for joining us Roger Stone
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:31.840]  Stone called truth.com thank you Roger
