[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:11.000 --> 00:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have always broken down the fact that Oprah Winfrey is a top globalist,
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.000]  a top eugenicist who pushes a one-world religion through her private foundation.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  She's even got a New Age movie coming out to brainwash the children.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  Well, they've readied her to run against Trump in 2020
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  and to fire that campaign up in about a year.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  But we know the secrets about Oprah Winfrey that they don't want you to know.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  There were Associated Press articles, Leningradian articles, ABC News articles,
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  videos as well that they pulled eight years ago, seven years ago when this news came out.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  We're going to break down why Oprah Winfrey will never be elected president of the United States
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  because of the skeletons in her closet.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  They want to call Trump a Nazi?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Look out, lady.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  We know what you're designed to do.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  You're the blackface to carry out the enslavement of black folks and everybody else.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  Here's a John Bowne report first.
[01:17.000 --> 01:25.000]  The truth is powerful and Trump operates unlike any statesman I've seen in modern history in the truth.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  And that's what's so refreshing about it.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  But he said, you know, the mainstream media really needs me to win in 2020.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  You guys had almost no ratings and it completely imploded until I came along
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  and you're still a shadow of your former selves because you're fake news.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  But he said, you need me.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  And look at the economy, look at all of it.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  It's all roaring back and optimism and so many other good things.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  And Trump is delivering on what he said very sensible policies across the board.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  And they are just flipping out completely inverting all of this.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  And now Michael Wolf known for yellow journalism.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  I mean, he's famous for festooning his news reports without right fabrications.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  Like you hang ornaments on a Christmas tree.
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  This is, you know, I think not an exaggeration and not unreasonable.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  It's not unreasonable to say this is 25th Amendment kind of stuff.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  This is, I mean, anybody say that in the West Wing to you all the time.
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  25th Amendment.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  They would bring up the 25th Amendment.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Yes.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  Actually, they would say we're not in the sort of in the mid period.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  We're not at a 25th Amendment level yet.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  Or they would alarming.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  This is alarming in every way.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  And then this, this, this went on.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Okay, this is a little 25th Amendment.
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  So 25th Amendment is a concept that is alive every day in the White House.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  He's now come out and said he has no way to know if any of it's true.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  And he's gone to say, quote, I'll do whatever is necessary to get the story.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  Oh, they just absolutely love to hurt innocents.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  They just rubbed their hands together to break down civilization, to destroy families,
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  to defile everything they can and to deceive and to mislead.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  It's built their own universe of fraud.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  This is the compendium of their abomination, desolation.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  People like him enjoying the climate of fake news media, corporate media,
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  and the open season on the truth, open season on the president,
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  open season on loyal, decent, hardworking, honorable folks.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  Open season because the trash knows it's being taken out.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  And so the trash is fighting for its political, cultural, and spiritual life.
[04:00.000 --> 04:10.000]  And its life is culturally ruling us, smiley-faced demons out there like Brian Stelter and Michael Wolf.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  They're all going to point at our champion who is in the center of the arena under massive attacks
[04:17.000 --> 04:27.000]  and whole balconies, whole cacophonies, whole lines of these carrion crows, these buzzards, these vultures,
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  these rotten flesh-eaters.
[04:32.000 --> 04:42.000]  They sit up there and all crow and cackle in chorus that we're bad and we're fake and we're evil.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  So when you judge a tree by its fruits, all we deliver is the news before it's ever forced out.
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.000]  All we deliver is the cutting edge. All we deliver is danger to them.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  All we deliver is the reality.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[05:07.000 --> 05:14.000]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic,
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing.
[05:52.000 --> 06:07.000]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase of fuzzy operation.
[06:23.000 --> 06:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:31.000 --> 06:38.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex John.
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.000]  Ha ha ha, man. I love watching President Trump troll the media, the controlled corporate media.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  We're going to cover some of that trolling today.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  And Sink Uggur that openly wrote that women are subhumans, that women are genetically defunct
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  because they don't love his Islamic worldview. He literally wrote that because they don't all want him,
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  that they're basically chatteled. They've declared me mentally ill.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  Oh, like they've declared Trump mentally ill because I attacked Brian Skelter
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  and said that he's a literal demon politically and that he's drunk politically on the blood of our children,
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  which, of course, in the entire compendium of the rant, I'm pointing out that the arrogance,
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  the spirit of Brian Skelter, in my view, the arrogance of the particular photograph I was talking about,
[07:32.000 --> 07:40.000]  brings that to mind. So it was satire and they know that.
[07:40.000 --> 07:49.000]  And so what they do is they cobble it together, acting like I'm actually believing he's from hell itself.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  No, I'm saying people like Skelter are manifesting hell and I just brought it up because the photo,
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.000]  who poses for a smiling photo like this?
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  I mean, I can't even, it's what is it about sociopaths and psychopaths that they don't know how fake they look?
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  I mean, just look at this. Him and Wolf. I said, you know, Wolf's his daddy.
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  Of course, Wolf's not his daddy. And I said in the rant, metaphysically, he might as well be his daddy.
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  So they play fast and loose with the truth. That's why they're who they are.
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  But I love how this crazy person built their own media operation that reaches more people than the young turds do
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  on terrestrial radio and so much more on our websites, tens of thousands times bigger than theirs.
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  I wonder how they do that. I wonder how they juxtapose the fact that they say I'm mentally ill,
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.000]  but I didn't have to get money from Gulf state dictatorships to fund my operation.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  See, and I love how the media matters quotes are real short little quote, quote,
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  and then it'll put other words with quote, quote, creating false sentences out of context.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  It's what they do. And I trolled them consciously.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  I said, I just trolled them. They know it's a troll.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  They're trolling their audience saying that I didn't say it was satirical at the front, the back.
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  It's, I can't even look at her. It's kind of like what Megan Kelly did before she left Fox News
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  when she was covering Pizzagate and misrepresenting what I'd said.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  She played a clip of me saying, I don't know if Hillary's actually, you know,
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  enslaving or sacrificing or killing kids, but she's personally responsible for the policies
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  that have killed hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of children,
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  many of them which have been raped, killed and tortured.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  And then I showed news articles. Well, they noticed they didn't show video on Megan Kelly.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  The Kelly file or whatever it was called, they just showed audio and it was edited together.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  So again, I like that because they go out, they lie to their audience,
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  but the audience then goes, I better go check out what Alex Jones actually said.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  They go hear what I actually said in its completeness and then they know, oh, you are fake news.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  And President Trump does the exact same thing, but here's the bottom line.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  I got so much to cover today. They are in full panic, less than one year into Trump.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  We're now 11 months and 20 days or so.
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.000]  We are coming up in, what, 11 days on the anniversary of the inauguration of Donald John Trump
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  and the stock market, the new jobs, the jobless numbers are the lowest ever.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  The exuberance, the new factory startups are record.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  I mean, we have really turned the corner. You could say, come back from the dead.
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.000]  And he's breaking the back of political correctness and so much more and cutting off foreign aid to countries that hate us and fun terrorist groups.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  I mean, he's really taking action and you would tune into mainstream news or establishment news.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  You would think the world had ended. In fact, I never got to this yesterday,
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  but we've got a Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweet where she pointed out that the media claimed we would have financial Armageddon.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  Even when he was president-elect, they said before he gets into office, the stock market's going to plunge.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  Because they wanted to plunge the economy because they know what Trump's doing.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  He's running on prosperity. They're running on control, on domestication, on people not being independent, but dependent.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  That's their admitted plan. So Trump wins by fulfilling.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  Trump wins. Even if you believe he's a sociopath, there's only one thing he says that all the talking heads tell us so much.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  They're projecting who they are onto Trump.
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  Nancy Pelosi warned economic Armageddon under President Trump, which of course means the total opposite has taken place.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  President Trump policies are inspiring an economic lift off.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  Lift off just means the economy has lifted off. It's even stronger than that.
[12:08.000 --> 12:16.000]  But Trump knows he's using the bubble they designed for themselves to transfer wealth, to transfer wealth back to the people from the globalist.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  But that's going to be short-lived. He's got to get the industry and the startups and the exuberance going.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  And we have ignition. We do have lift off.
[12:24.000 --> 12:32.000]  In fact, what she wrote, what she said there is the perfect description of lift off, of taking off the economy.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  And we've got a beachhead in Washington in some areas.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  We're turning the corner. The states are waking up. The people are waking up.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  So the globalists are spewing racial division, sexual division, class warfare, and admitting they're doing it cold bloodedly everywhere.
[12:47.000 --> 12:58.000]  And all they're doing is destroying their audience bases, whether it's the Golden Globes or whether it's CNN or whether it's the NFL or whether it's entertainment.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  People are leaving en masse because they're tired of being beaten over the head with all this garbage.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's amazing.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  So we're going to cover so much today and get into so many angles.
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  But look at the arrogance of Michael Wolfe, a known charlatan.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  The Wolfe and Journalist clothing saying that this book will bring down the president.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  Boy, everything was going to bring him down.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  And he was going to lose the primaries. And you were going to keep him from being inaugurated.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  You were going to keep him from getting the delegates and being seated.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  And then you were going to remove him because he's a Russian agent.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  And all it did was blow up in your face and prove that you were the ones in bed with all these different foreign powers and foreign groups.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  It's simply incredible.
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  And I keep telling you that the left is coming out of the closet about the fact that they are Satanist and that they are pedophiles and that they are sick, sick people.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  And even the LA Times and others say a new generation of LA Satanists finds community in blasphemous times.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  And they say that Trump is forcing people to turn to Satanism.
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then when I cover this, they go, oh, Jones is crazy. There's no such thing as Satanist.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  It's simply incredible.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[14:23.000 --> 14:36.000]  But the big news today, when we come back, Oprah Winfrey gave a speech last night and she pledged to empower women to stand against the great evil of Trump.
[14:36.000 --> 14:44.000]  When everything she does worldwide is about getting women to sign on to the UN to be disempowered and to be sterilized.
[14:44.000 --> 14:54.000]  She is the heart of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It's even linked on infowars.com to mainstream news articles, but that are in the way back machine and the archive machine because they've tried to expunge them.
[14:54.000 --> 15:09.000]  Where she goes to elite meetings with Bill Gates, David Rockefeller before he died, Ted Turner, all of them to discuss how she's the front for women to get rid of husbands and to become wards of the state and become sterilized.
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  And she's running a worldwide church with a tax-free foundation she's got to brainwash children in the third world.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  She's got a new movie coming out as a vehicle. But don't worry, just like Google says, don't be evil.
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  And when they're pure evil, they're called the good club and population's their goal.
[15:28.000 --> 15:39.000]  Billionaires try to shrink world population, report says, and it leaked out of the Rockefeller meeting at the Einstein University.
[15:39.000 --> 15:49.000]  And it's all how they're going to bring in a world government and a world youth corps, a world sterilization corps, where they teach the kids to hate themselves because of the environment.
[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  And it's just totally sick. Oprah Winfrey is an absolute anti-human Nazi troll.

[20:16.000 --> 20:23.000]  1884 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:52.000]  So yes she can, Oprah Winfrey. You get a car, you get a car, you get a car. Everybody gets something free if you just vote for Oprah Winfrey against Donald Trump coming up.
[20:52.000 --> 21:07.000]  But you know that that campaign has already started. She's being drafted. She's being pushed. She's being prepared by the establishment.
[21:07.000 --> 21:18.000]  And there she was last night perched at another one of these stupid award shows amongst a bunch of other Hollywood idiots.
[21:18.000 --> 21:34.000]  And I don't just say that. I mean they make me sick just looking at their ugly mummy faces and all the piles of swag and jewelry and crap all piled up around them like their little demonic dragons sitting on top their gold.
[21:34.000 --> 21:49.000]  And then they cut to Meryl Streep who defends pedophilia, who defends a man that kidnapped and raped a 13-year-old girl anally and won't apologize about it.
[21:49.000 --> 21:57.000]  Roman Polanski but that she says Richard Dreyfus once slapped her too hard in a scene where they'd agreed she'd be slapped.
[21:57.000 --> 22:06.000]  You know that's how you do stunts and you agree I'll do this stunt. You don't want to get slapped for real and the director wants it. They have a stunt double comes in who's paid.
[22:06.000 --> 22:16.000]  But oh I'm a victim Richard Dreyfus slapped me too hard once. I remember that slap scene. It's powerful because he really swaps her.
[22:16.000 --> 22:26.000]  I mean I've been in movies where I actually fall to my knees and bloodied my knees take after take as I get tasered by the police and drug into a futuristic SWAT vehicle.
[22:26.000 --> 22:35.000]  Should I come out and say Richard Linkletter abused me. He told me to fall to my knees in the concrete and he's a bad man for putting me in scanner darkly.
[22:35.000 --> 22:44.000]  No, but this is victimology because she's a pig because Meryl Streep's a monster. But let me tell you who's really bad and we're going to dig into her big time.
[22:44.000 --> 22:52.000]  We've already done. I've been telling about Oprah Winfrey forever saying that we're readying her for president. She's the one that pushed Obama, all of it.
[22:52.000 --> 23:05.000]  She is a monster ladies and gentlemen. She is part of one of the most powerful or the most powerful secret government cabals that only 15 to 20 global leaders attend.
[23:05.000 --> 23:16.000]  She is the only black person to ever have attended it. And they sell it the few times they reported on it on ABC News and others that they're like the super friends.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun. And it's got Oprah Winfrey on the clip and it's got David Rockefeller. I forget which which film it is.
[23:24.000 --> 23:34.000]  But when one of my films got a clip of it in it and they're just going to save the earth. They're going to save the kids teaching you humans are bad with carbon taxes and global government.
[23:34.000 --> 23:45.000]  Just like Hillary was supposed to get it and so they had that book that was supposed to come out right after Hillary got elected, where Chelsea was going to run the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation worldwide
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.160]  and, and teach kids to be sterilized basically. Well, here it is, Oprah shifts blame from
[23:51.160 --> 23:58.440]  me too onto general public, fails to condemn Weinstein. And you get to see Meryl Streep
[23:58.440 --> 24:08.520]  and all of these mummies. But Meryl Streep, she just defends a child rapist, a child kidnapper.
[24:08.520 --> 24:15.640]  That's bad enough. Oprah Winfrey with her arrogance and her whole act that she's this good person
[24:16.280 --> 24:22.200]  is truly disgusting. Because you look into what she does for the UN worldwide, they trick women
[24:22.200 --> 24:27.320]  to sign on to this world church body. She's get that that's tax exempt. And she produces these
[24:27.320 --> 24:33.000]  propaganda pieces of people in Africa and other places. And she's the black face of eugenics
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.760]  and population control and dumbing down, not just in Africa, but all over the third world,
[24:39.320 --> 24:46.040]  where she comes in with the Bill and Melinda Gates group backing her. And she's the black face of
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.160]  depopulation and black abortion. So if you are a real white supremacist,
[24:53.400 --> 24:57.800]  you really should support her. If you are someone that believes in world population
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.800]  reduction, particularly brown people, but they want to keep the brown folks that don't get exterminated
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.360]  and use them as a weapon again against the West and say whites are bad. The globalist program
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.560]  is basically an AI war system that's been AI'd out now, but it's basically the whole British
[25:11.560 --> 25:19.000]  divide and conquer to be synergistically wicked, where it just attacks everybody,
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.440]  plays everybody off against everybody. It's pure evil. So again, you have the swollen,
[25:24.440 --> 25:34.120]  corrupt, satanic Hollywood, thrusting this lady out there. But when she's not busy kissing on
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.040]  Harvey Weinstein, she's busy as a front group for Bill and Melinda Gates. And by the way,
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.360]  the media will say, oh, Jones is crazy. He says the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a eugenics
[25:42.360 --> 25:50.200]  group. It's in my film in game. You can pull it up. There's two interviews from more than 15 years
[25:50.200 --> 26:02.120]  ago in super low quality on PBS. And on those programs, they are interviewed, Bill Gates and
[26:02.120 --> 26:07.720]  his father, Bill Gates senior, formula of army intelligence, former head of the Planned Parenthood,
[26:08.520 --> 26:12.280]  where they admit they're the world's too populated. We need a world government to come in and reduce
[26:12.280 --> 26:19.160]  population. Do you understand? And I guess I could just join Bill Gates and play along with
[26:19.160 --> 26:23.000]  the whole liberal program and sit there and watch, you know, all the Latin Americans shot up with
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.320]  Gardasil, it's a Sterilent and all the rest of it. But I'm not going to go along with this. And
[26:27.320 --> 26:33.160]  it's going to be so sick to see them try to force feed us Oprah Winfrey. Read the articles.
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.840]  Celebrities call for Oprah Winfrey to run for president following Golden Globe speech. We're
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.400]  going to play that speech coming up. They're called the Good Club and they want to save the world.
[26:43.400 --> 26:49.640]  That's the London Guardian. And when you read it, it says they are a world government.
[26:51.400 --> 26:57.400]  And the members have spent 125 billion. This was back in 2009, as I said, like eight years ago.
[26:59.720 --> 27:03.400]  But really, it's all tax exempt. Their, their, their fortunes have only gotten bigger. They
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.080]  just take some of the profit and then put it into the deep population and brainwashing a
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.320]  world government. The meeting called by Gates Buffett Rockefeller was held in response to the
[27:11.320 --> 27:15.000]  global economic downturn of the numerous health and environmental crises. Oh,
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.080]  then you read though, it says at the end, they are an alternative world government.
[27:19.880 --> 27:25.320]  And their main goal is population reduction through the United Nations, but they're the Good Club.
[27:28.600 --> 27:31.480]  Go read it for yourself, ladies and gentlemen. And this is their own
[27:33.560 --> 27:39.800]  PR. Oh, and they're these great donors that care about you so much and that want to
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.400]  take care of you and be sweet to you. Henry Ford, the admitted Nazi.
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.080]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator. Andrew Carnegie, complete psychopath.
[27:52.040 --> 27:54.920]  John D. Rockefeller. Excuse me. Do you need to know anymore?
[27:57.960 --> 27:58.600]  Bill Gates.
[28:03.480 --> 28:07.160]  I mean, you've got to read this. There's other articles here. It is billionaires.
[28:07.160 --> 28:10.440]  Try to shrink world population. Report says associated press.
[28:12.200 --> 28:18.040]  And now they're setting up a world government in a bid to curb world population.
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.000]  Almost all the attendees are politically liberal. Do you think it's a star chamber of philanthropics?
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.600]  Is something to worry about or something to be grateful for with their goal of shrinking world
[28:30.600 --> 28:36.600]  population? They tried to come out of the closet eight years ago. It didn't work. They went back
[28:36.600 --> 28:45.320]  into it, but that's who hope for one for you. So hey, when I say she's a Nazi, that's too kind.
[28:45.880 --> 28:52.600]  It's the Eugenesis. It was the Ford Foundation. It was the IBM groups that literally created
[28:52.600 --> 28:59.160]  the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the whole Nazi ideology. Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.720]  of my pillow. And like all of you out there, I had problems sleeping. Pillows would go flat.
[29:03.720 --> 29:07.560]  I would flip flop all night long. I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache,
[29:07.560 --> 29:11.880]  or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours. When I invented my pillow, I wanted
[29:11.880 --> 29:16.200]  it to where you can move the patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an

[29:20.840 --> 29:25.080]  faster and you will stay there longer. It's not about how much time we spend in bed. It's about

[29:29.720 --> 29:34.840]  States. I have a 10-year warranty. You can wash and dry my pillow and I give you a 60-day money

[31:04.680 --> 31:08.360]  Thump and why this is an important book and how it ties into things. And I just thought to myself,
[31:08.360 --> 31:13.880]  you know, this is brilliance. This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the
[31:13.880 --> 31:19.240]  president. You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[31:19.240 --> 31:24.200]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable,
[31:24.200 --> 31:29.320]  fluffy little bunny. It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it. It's actually hilarious. I was
[31:29.320 --> 31:32.920]  cracking up reading the whole book. My wife was cracking up. And it's a great book for adults.
[31:32.920 --> 31:39.000]  It's a great book for children. We're selling the book. We've got it bundled as well here with a
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.200]  one off poster. That's a collector's item. Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the
[31:44.200 --> 31:49.480]  poster are $29.95 that helps support us. So get the book Thump, the first 100 days, and Alex
[31:49.480 --> 31:54.280]  Jones and Thump, the art of Info Wars for a limited edition at infowarstore.com.
[31:57.880 --> 32:02.200]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Info Wars Life.
[32:02.200 --> 32:06.680]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[32:06.680 --> 32:11.240]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent
[32:11.240 --> 32:15.560]  discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[32:15.560 --> 32:20.040]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[32:20.040 --> 32:25.480]  those naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[32:25.480 --> 32:30.280]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[32:30.280 --> 32:35.480]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase
[32:35.480 --> 32:40.040]  the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[32:40.760 --> 32:44.280]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats
[32:44.280 --> 32:47.960]  and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[32:47.960 --> 32:51.400]  Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by Info Wars Life.

[32:57.400 --> 33:04.200]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:04.200 --> 33:25.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:34.600 --> 33:40.360]  So, while the globalists destabilize Africa, Latin America, Asia, and try to keep them from
[33:40.360 --> 33:44.360]  becoming industrialized, which then makes you only have two kids on average, that's just historical
[33:44.360 --> 33:48.600]  fact, works the same way from Japan to the United States, they've done it in tasks in
[33:48.600 --> 33:53.560]  certain areas of Africa, Latin America, it's happened. So that actually stops the overpopulation
[33:53.560 --> 33:56.040]  if you believe in that, and there are some areas that are obviously overpopulated.
[33:57.240 --> 34:03.080]  But as the president is reporting, 10 million African migrants preparing to flood Europe under
[34:03.080 --> 34:08.920]  the UN's own plan on top of the 10 million that they've already flooded Europe with. Meanwhile,
[34:12.840 --> 34:21.400]  back in the United States at the Hollywood Golden Toilet Awards, they brought in SJW
[34:21.400 --> 34:29.000]  Antifa creatures to set them next to the, quote, celebrities. And when you look at the mummies
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.760]  that are in this Hollywood event and the Meryl Streep who defends pedophilia and child rape,
[34:35.880 --> 34:43.720]  and then you've got pontificating up there, the big news, you've got Oprah Winfrey who's yet
[34:43.720 --> 34:50.040]  to talk bad about Harvey Weinstein with all the witnesses of rape and all the intimidation and
[34:50.040 --> 34:56.440]  all the rest of it, you can go back to a 2014 award show and others and catch photos and video.
[34:56.440 --> 35:02.920]  Let's put it on screen for TV viewers of Oprah Winfrey sucking Harvey Weinstein's ear.
[35:04.600 --> 35:10.840]  I would liken that to actually sucking on the devil's rear end, because the word is actually
[35:10.840 --> 35:15.560]  that's where the crap comes out of Harvey Weinstein's ear. Okay, I'm being sarcastic there.
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.960]  The headline, Jones believes Harvey Weinstein's anus is his ear. I'm not being serious. Excuse me.
[35:21.960 --> 35:28.600]  I am being serious if you're a radio listener about her sucking on his ear. In fact, let's
[35:28.600 --> 35:35.320]  retweet the photo right now at Real Alex Jones. Not only does Oprah Winfrey push African depopulation,
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.280]  which we just documented earlier, associated press, you name it, London Guardian, she also
[35:42.280 --> 35:47.560]  sucks on Harvey Weinstein's ear, doesn't decry him when hundreds of victims come out,
[35:47.560 --> 35:52.440]  including dozens and dozens of people that the chauffeurs and others who he had for years say,
[35:52.440 --> 35:59.880]  no, he would jump on top particularly small actresses who were 18 years old and rape them,
[36:00.760 --> 36:07.800]  shove their legs up behind their ears and rape them with this considerable 300 pound body.
[36:08.760 --> 36:17.320]  He would get 105, 106, 107 pound women reportedly and rape them. Then he'd throw them a rag and
[36:17.320 --> 36:23.880]  say, clean yourself up, get out of the car. And then he's such an addict, he'd go pick up another
[36:23.880 --> 36:30.440]  one and another one. Reportedly, this guy's quite the rape of stud. And I'm not encouraging that
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.000]  immediately. So he says, he's a stud for raping. No, I mean, he's a stud when it comes to it. He's
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.520]  sick. You know, like Hitler was an ace at being evil. And you look at this, then you've got her
[36:42.520 --> 36:46.520]  with Meryl Streep in the shot. They even cut to Meryl Streep when they talk about how men are all
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.080]  bad and women are going to rise up against them. And they're going to be the change when she works
[36:51.080 --> 36:59.240]  for the globalist and literally sucks the crusty, fetid scruffulous covered degenerate stinking
[36:59.240 --> 37:07.560]  ear of Harvey, the reported rapist scumbag, Weinstein, the guy that also flies on the
[37:07.560 --> 37:16.840]  Lolita Express pedophile airplane with Bill Clinton. Oh, and who else? Oh, Kevin Spacey. And who else?
[37:18.440 --> 37:24.360]  It goes on and on, doesn't it? Blow that up, though. Carefully, ladies and gentlemen, Oprah
[37:24.360 --> 37:32.200]  Winfrey sucking Harvey Weinstein's ear. And case folks think we photoshopped this, this,
[37:32.200 --> 37:38.280]  we didn't. Can we please pull up the actual news article where you found it from 2014?
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.480]  Drumroll, please. Because I know I saw it in there during the break. We double checked this
[37:43.480 --> 37:50.760]  photo. This is in mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen. There it is. Pop sugar. The real fun
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.520]  happens offstage at the Critics Choice Awards. And what's the real fun? Blow it up.
[37:56.520 --> 38:05.560]  That's January 17, 2014. Four years ago. There she is. And ladies and gentlemen,
[38:05.560 --> 38:12.120]  that is her sucking French kissing his ear, sticking her tongue in his ear.
[38:14.280 --> 38:22.520]  British actresses as Weinstein used Oprah as bait for sex. Oh, oh, infowars.com, January 8th.
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.440]  Today. I didn't even know we had this article out. See how it's all synergistically coming
[38:28.440 --> 38:35.800]  together. Infowars.com. Can we add Weinstein to this article sucking with her sticking her tongue
[38:35.800 --> 38:43.560]  in that disgusting hole? Good God. Oprah Winfrey will never be president. She sticks her tongue
[38:43.560 --> 38:53.960]  in Weinstein's ear in public and then tells us that she stands for women. She is a globalist
[38:53.960 --> 39:00.600]  tool bag of Bill and Melinda Gates. Oh, by the way, I really started peaking on Bill and Melinda
[39:00.600 --> 39:05.720]  Gates about six years ago. And I got real clear messages from them. And then Melinda even gave
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.880]  a speech and said, if you don't stop, people saying that we're trying to hurt people. If you
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.800]  don't stop, a lot of people are going to die. And then I got absolutely clear messages that
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.240]  you will shut up about us. Well, I didn't shut up. Did I? And I can't shut up because now
[39:21.240 --> 39:28.040]  you've deployed Oprah against us. And when she's not luring women in as is being reported to Harvey
[39:28.040 --> 39:37.800]  Weinstein, she's hanging out with you guys and listen, listen, I know you guys failed.
[39:37.800 --> 39:44.120]  And I know that IBM and the Cold Springs Harbor Research Facility that was literally
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.920]  funded over 80% by the Rockefeller family. The Rockefeller family created the modern
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.160]  eugenics in the US, came out of England, they deployed it, and they fully financed the Kaiser
[39:55.160 --> 40:02.680]  Wilhelm Institute that was the scientific hub in Germany of Hitler's entire operation,
[40:02.680 --> 40:09.880]  the European Union, everything. And they had congressional hearings about it later,
[40:09.880 --> 40:12.760]  the McCormick-Dickstein hearings. I mean, I've got clips of it in my film in-game.
[40:12.760 --> 40:20.760]  You understand that's why I'm so frustrated that I mean, this is history. This is fact.
[40:20.760 --> 40:27.800]  Oprah Winfrey literally runs a giant tax-free foundation that's a world government Rockefeller
[40:27.800 --> 40:34.840]  front to carry out population reduction. And it's even in the news. And then you get lectured by her
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.800]  and they cut to a woman that publicly defends child rapist. And then this woman's buddies with
[40:39.800 --> 40:44.840]  Weinstein won't say anything about him. And look, the rocks listening to her, Duane Johnson's
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.120]  listening so intently because he's such a good man to Oprah. And he hangs around with Tom Hanks,
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.720]  all these other people. And I don't want to hate Duane Johnson because he doesn't have any background
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.280]  like this. But let me tell you something right now. If Duane Johnson wants to get elected president,
[41:00.280 --> 41:03.080]  I like the fact that he's supposedly a Republican, more of a conservative,
[41:04.040 --> 41:08.440]  doesn't have a chip on his shoulder, very charming guy. I like him. I don't like hardly anybody in
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.760]  Hollywood, but I can get fooled by his charm. Maybe I'm being fooled. Maybe I'm not. But man,
[41:12.760 --> 41:21.720]  stop hanging around with that mausoleum of scum. Do you understand? America, Duane is sick of
[41:21.720 --> 41:28.040]  Hollywood. We are tired of it like poison. We're vomiting up out of us. And I still haven't even
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.120]  gotten to some of the Golden Globes garbage and we're going to, we're going to play some of it
[41:32.120 --> 41:37.800]  when we come back. It's just being lectured when you know that this woman is a monster by every
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.280]  yardstick. Let me just stop right there. We have not come up with new specials yet, but I've got
[41:42.280 --> 41:47.240]  to end the free shipping that's been going since before Christmas. And I've got to end the 50% off
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.080]  brain force and the 50% off X2 and the 50% off supermell vitality and the 50% off the real red
[41:53.080 --> 41:57.560]  pill, the 50% off the high quality fluoride free toothpaste that's four to five of colloidal
[41:57.560 --> 42:04.120]  silver and iodine, all super blue products, 50% off. I've got to end this because Tim Fruget
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.880]  of the warehouse and marketing manager came over here and he came over and he said, listen, Alex,
[42:09.880 --> 42:14.120]  we are selling out a DNA force at 33% off. We are selling out of brain force. We already sold
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.920]  out of my CoCX as you know, at the regular price. I mean, it discounted. We sold a little back for
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.480]  auto ship. We're selling out of everything. So we're not getting some of the stuff for months.
[42:23.480 --> 42:29.320]  You've got to stop. So I've got to get with Tim today, come up with the new specials and things,
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.720]  but these have been the biggest in years. Water filtration, air purifiers, high quality,
[42:33.720 --> 42:38.440]  swarble food, every shop with a good guys help fund folks that will fearlessly take on these
[42:38.440 --> 42:44.520]  comebacks because we love infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[42:44.520 --> 42:51.400]  But I am ending these specials today. They absolutely must end because we are exhausting
[42:51.400 --> 42:55.480]  all of our supplies and won't have some for months and then we'll lose a lot of money. We need your
[42:55.480 --> 43:03.160]  support infowarstore. Introducing cell force by info wars life. Cell force focuses on mitochondria
[43:03.160 --> 43:09.240]  efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's
[43:09.240 --> 43:14.440]  cellular engines. Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting
[43:14.440 --> 43:20.680]  mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[43:20.680 --> 43:26.840]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging
[43:26.840 --> 43:34.120]  is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants
[43:34.120 --> 43:39.800]  found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant,
[43:39.800 --> 43:45.240]  the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[47:03.800 --> 47:19.720]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.800]  Well the globalists are panicking all over the world. Nationalism is coming back. People want to
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.760]  determine their own destiny. They want to be free market. They're pro family. They're pro prosperity
[47:45.480 --> 47:53.480]  and so raising its ugly head again Hollywood has a bunch of SJW George Soros funded globalists
[47:54.200 --> 47:59.880]  at the Golden Globes and they're rolling out the fact that they plan to run her for president in
[47:59.880 --> 48:05.880]  2020. That means in about a year she'll be announcing they plan to run Oprah Winfrey,
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.720]  the woman who literally pushes a worldwide tax-free church that's a front for the Belomel
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.440]  and the Gates Foundation. I just covered the articles earlier that tells women not to have
[48:16.440 --> 48:21.800]  children at the family is bad. You can pull up press conferences of her pushing that and the
[48:21.800 --> 48:27.000]  whole plan is depopulation and we covered some of those articles earlier. Billionaires try to
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.720]  shrink world population report says associated press Oprah Winfrey the only black person to attend
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.640]  that secret meeting that later leaked out and she's right at the heart of that
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.680]  with the Belomel and the Gates Foundation. That's how she gets out of paying taxes. It is simply
[48:44.680 --> 48:53.240]  incredible. Meanwhile if you expand on all of this we have a flashback it's on info wars.com by
[48:53.240 --> 49:01.240]  Jamie White in news wars.com. British actresses says Weinstein used Oprah as bait for sex. Oprah
[49:01.240 --> 49:05.960]  duped her into thinking Weinstein would help her career says the actress. Now reportedly
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.280]  she will not Oprah will not criticize Weinstein or said anything he's done is wrong.
[49:10.840 --> 49:15.320]  She said nothing about Weinstein or Hollywood's problem with women. She said it was Trump and
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.840]  Republicans and we now have photos of her in an article about how behind the scene stuff gets crazy
[49:20.840 --> 49:26.680]  in Hollywood of her sucking on the ear and sticking her tongue in Harvey Weinstein's ear.
[49:27.880 --> 49:37.080]  So this is the lady who again lures these young ladies in to basically culturally societally
[49:37.880 --> 49:46.120]  in a sexist way lead them into the spiders web. That's who she is. She is the ultimate Benedict
[49:46.120 --> 49:51.480]  Arnold. You must research what a monster this woman is but imagine Meryl Streep in the audience
[49:51.480 --> 49:55.320]  they cut to her during the Golden Globes when they're talking about men being bad and here she
[49:55.320 --> 50:00.680]  is defending Roman Polanski kidnapping and raping a 13-year-old girl ain't only reportedly blood all
[50:00.680 --> 50:06.120]  over the place raping little girls they bleed everywhere that's loving that's trendy that's
[50:06.120 --> 50:15.160]  good but again if you try to restore the economy you're a bad person but Trump knows by winning by
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.360]  restoring things by fixing things he will defeat all their lies he'll show us how real he is and
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.120]  how they're the fraud how they're the fake how they're the lie but Oprah Winfrey will never be
[50:24.120 --> 50:31.000]  elected president because she is part of a African particularly depopulation group that mainly targets
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.920]  Africa with vaccines and contracts where women agree to be sterilized and you can argue well
[50:36.920 --> 50:40.840]  that's in that nice okay she's telling you the whites are out to get you and men are out to get
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.040]  women and then she's funding a group to it has a church worldwide that pushes women not getting
[50:46.040 --> 50:50.360]  married that men are bad but then she gets married and has all these boyfriends and basically brings
[50:50.360 --> 50:55.400]  women to Weinstein and then sticks her tongue in his ear let's show the news article again
[50:56.200 --> 51:03.800]  we just tweeted it out at real Alex Jones Oprah Winfrey attacks men in Golden Globe
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.840]  speech says nothing about Harvey Weinstein remember the time she openly stuck her tongue
[51:08.840 --> 51:15.640]  in his ear info wars.com flashback British actress says Weinstein use Oprah as bait for sex I want
[51:15.640 --> 51:21.560]  to hit her with all these tweets with that photo and let's talk about how the establishment the
[51:21.560 --> 51:29.960]  globalist picked her to be who she is today as a Judas go as a black face a smiling sweet face
[51:29.960 --> 51:40.520]  to to lure little flies and little bugs into the spider's web look it up the Cold Springs
[51:40.520 --> 51:44.680]  Harbor group that's what they were meeting up in New York about the original eugenics group
[51:44.680 --> 51:52.360]  that funded Hitler she is the only black person allowed in the group Oprah Winfrey is literally
[51:53.400 --> 51:58.600]  one of the number one enemies of black people in the world in my view let's go ahead and play this
[51:58.600 --> 52:04.440]  clip of her grandstanding and looking at Meryl Streep oh we love the women Meryl men are the problem
[52:04.440 --> 52:10.440]  oh the media is so wonderful Trump's so evil here is her sickening garbage on the listing
[52:10.440 --> 52:16.040]  sinking ship that is the filth that is Hollywood. I'd like to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press
[52:16.040 --> 52:22.760]  Association because we all know that the press is under siege these days but we also know that it
[52:22.760 --> 52:29.800]  is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute look out oh the absolute truth we give

[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  tortured by racist black people and the media tries to cover it up so she gets in a time
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.280]  machine to go back to something that's terrible as well to come out and inflict and say white
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.040]  men killed the black lady just stick a knife in the wound put some salt in and that's all she
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.520]  does it's so easy and it's so trapped but she's the angel she's the good person let's continue

[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:38.840]  oprah lemphrey has engaged in a race baiting class warfare six and a half minute extravaganza at the
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:47.960]  golden globes hollywood uh self congratulatory society and in this event she didn't criticize
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.160]  any islamicist oppressing women she didn't criticize communist regimes oppressing women
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:59.560]  she dredged up tragic events from the 1940s and 50s of white men killing black people
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.840]  and then basically said see whites are devils and all men are devils but never said a word about
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:14.200]  her good buddy harvey winstein that women report that he would use as bait info wars dot com
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:20.920]  british actress says winstein used oprah as bait for sex oprah duped her into thinking winstein
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:26.920]  could help her career actress says and then we have the bizarre photo that we've tweeted out at
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:35.720]  real alex jones of oprah lemphrey sticking her tongue in his ear at another award ceremony
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:42.360]  in 2014 and you can go to the news article i mean it's a real photo again she doesn't
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.200]  criticize him as a modern day story she says the courage of women and then makes it look like
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.520]  it's only men hurting women in history as if men and women aren't the same species
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:00.120]  she didn't go look at the young turks sink uger or however you say his name saying women are
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.520]  genetically inferior and have problems even though women have an extra chromosome and
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:10.360]  a another set of dna and a mitochondria and blah blah blah you could actually say that men are
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:16.600]  genetically deficient because men are split off out of the species that is women but she
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:22.600]  doesn't tell women the big secret that they are the species she comes and tells them don't have kids
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.880]  don't have men kill the species she runs a women's group where they pledge not to have children
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.560]  for the earth this is what she pushes through the keiser vilhelm institutes of the cold springs
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:42.440]  harbour facility with billa melinda gates that's what it is i have the articles mainstream news
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.840]  where she pushes a worldwide depopulation agenda billionaires tried to shrink world's
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:53.720]  population ap and at the head of it oak for wimpery she's the face for africa so the africans
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.880]  will think it's good when she comes and tells them that they can't have cars or air conditioning just
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:05.560]  like obama told them but that would actually lower their population to two people replacement rate
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.560]  it's actually lower than that when you industrialize any group of people so the the answer over
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.640]  population even you believe the metric in all cases and it is overpopulated some areas would be
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.160]  industrialization but that's been blocked because you don't want to give people civilization you
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:23.080]  want to control them you want to manage the crisis that you exacerbate and that you make even worse
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:30.120]  truly sick did she say there's meryl street who praises roman polanski and says he should be
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:37.720]  able to get away with raping a 13-year-old girl anally no and will the media call her out for
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.320]  defending weinstein and not criticizing him the answer is no but if we get this information out
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.600]  oak for wimpery will never be president the job is every woman you know being suckered by her
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.680]  show her the news articles show her this video show her the history and understand what a pig she is
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:02.760]  good luck lady getting away with your weinstein relationship and all the rest of your behavior
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.440]  lady good luck but she's just designed to push this whole me too movement and act like trumps
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:17.720]  the abuser of women and not hollywood that she is a front person for now joining us is a best-selling
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:23.000]  author and researcher michael malis michael malis dot com he grew up behind the iron curtain so
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.800]  he understands the tyranny of collectivism he's at twitter at michael malis he's written dear reader
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.800]  kim jung ill and he's been over there and researched it i've read the book very powerful but the reason
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.320]  he's here is we're told trumps mentally ill when kim jong-un said a few weeks ago i had the nuclear
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:47.400]  button on my desk and i am preparing to privately blow the us up well the us could actually nuke him
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.680]  at that point for making another threat pointing a gun at somebody and saying i'm gonna pull the
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.680]  trigger even if you're not tending to i have a right to pull mine and take you out before you do
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.960]  you have the weapon you've made the threat you've tested it you're pointing it at me okay
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:05.720]  okay i'm clearing present danger so i can depend myself but trump just said we have a bigger button
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.480]  and it works saying hey we're ready to stand up against you that is a very measured statement
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:17.400]  they say the president's mentally ill an idiot of a phone a top real estate mogul top golf course
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:24.920]  mogul top tv guy the biggest in reality tv history genetically you you you look at some
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.080]  money successfully what four or five kids so he runs for president the first time
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:40.760]  and wins against all the odds and they call the president a loser and mentally ill well then i
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:46.040]  want to be mentally ill too then trump said you know i think it's kind of genius that i ran and
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.800]  i've done all these things i think that's genius well success is the mark of intelligence okay
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.280]  and navigating all this i mean i don't want to call myself a genius but if they're calling me
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.520]  mentally ill or saying i have Alzheimer's the antidote is to say oh i'm really doing a great
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:06.280]  job my mind's all there no trump knows you go to the other extreme and say i'm a genius well
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.440]  i think it is genius how he's defeated the mainstream media the globalist how he's brought
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.720]  the economy back with with the people's health how he's turned all of their attacks against him
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.040]  michael malice i mean this is not a worship trump fest as everybody knows i've been critical on him
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.240]  on letting sessions go on this mementine marijuana jihad well the opiates kill everybody and i don't
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.720]  like that going back on the afghan deal and a few other things but overall i it's almost messianic
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.720]  what he's done in less than one year i want to get into north korea but just you know as a political
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.160]  analyst and writer and researcher and a pundit we was falling fox news you name it uh i mean
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.640]  it's almost embarrassing how much i want to gush over trump but i you know i'm gushing over the
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:53.640]  truth here or do you disagree well i what i'm excited about as someone who has spent a lot of
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.360]  time trolling on twitter is that he announced that he's going to have awards for the most dishonest
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.800]  people in media i mean this is kind of unprecedented in a way he's innovating how presidents communicate
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.600]  with the population which is something fdr did back with the fireside chats back in the day
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.120]  and the press is going crazy because people like you and many citizen journalists don't need the
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.400]  media they are bypassing them and they're getting their messages directly the the guy from univision
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:24.440]  i'm blanking out his name whore whore whore whore ramos he recently said in an interview he's like
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.360]  i hate twitter because now people insult me every day and call me names it's like yeah
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.480]  back in the day you can sit on your high horse and condemn people and mock americans who don't
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.960]  agree with you and this is from both sides to some extent and now they're saying no you're the idiot
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.800]  you're the jerk you shouldn't be talking down to us and they don't know what to do with themselves
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.480]  i mean it's like kind of when i was in university and had all these college professors were
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.920]  rareholder than now and i you know had my fun putting them in their place they couldn't handle it
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.160]  because they had their tenure and they don't have to answer anyone and that's not the american way
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.040]  i mean one of the great things about this country is everyone is held accountable you don't have this
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.480]  kind of uh cast system where people are above the commoners and never have to respond this is
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.440]  exactly what we were fighting against well as you know edward brinez the modern father of propaganda
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.680]  he changed the name from department of war department defense he ran the whole modern feminist movement
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.240]  to get women to smoke cigarettes that's all declassified saying it's feminist smoke cigarettes
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.760]  because women didn't smoke them before and so hundreds of millions have died because of that
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.200]  being trend trendy but he created the modern award shows as you know i'm back to the 20s and 30s
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.920]  to make politicians look like hollywood and hollywood look like politicians to then give each other
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.760]  awards and literally grandstand so the fact that trump's turning it around their award shows making
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:44.360]  it a roast to make fun of them it's going to have bigger ratings than the oscars they postponed it as
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:51.000]  you know for yesterday uh from today to the 17th so that has time to build up and it's just pure
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.280]  genius how he's taking the narrative away so is it not pure genius as i mean that is genius
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.600]  well i what i it's just amazing to me how these women who think that putting on a black dress
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.400]  just like everybody else are being brave what in front of cameras when what would have been brave
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.480]  is if they had said something back in the day behind closed doors and done something about it
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.160]  and what's really funny to me is you know callix you get often attacked with they want you people

[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:36.840]  why i originally wanted to get him on and i'm not again trying to pontificate on trump but
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:43.000]  saying he's addled in an idiot when he has more energy than most 25 year old men and it's super
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.440]  smart in my conversations with him i can't believe how smooth he is how he finishes my sentences
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.360]  you think i'm obnoxious interrupting people uh trump can like guess what you're about to say
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.560]  and then they're saying he has Alzheimer's and why not say hey nobody's been able to get north
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.240]  korea in decades not just two years two years since the hotline but decades since they said
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:11.320]  let's have real talks with the south uh by trump not playing along like the clintons did and everybody
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:17.320]  he's brought over the table that is genius so again michael malis author of the dear reader
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.040]  about north korea give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.840]  over there well let's go back to you and i alex are old enough to remember reagan remember when
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:32.040]  reagan was going to be sworn in he's this crazy cowboy and soviet union is going to nuke us and
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.040]  you know there are all these new wave songs that we dance to about mushroom clouds and we're all
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.360]  going to be living under radiac radar actor fallout that's how it happened you remember perfectly
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.800]  well both reagan and korbachev committed to peace and the soviet union fell peacefully without a
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:51.640]  shot being fired in 1989 through 91 and this was the greatest pro-liberty thing that happened in
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:57.480]  our lifetime and yet you know if you listen to them in 1980 and 81 it would have been uh you know
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.160]  literally the world was going to end we heard this constantly how many books were published the
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:07.320]  coming nuclear holocaust and so on and so forth now we remember very clearly in last summer north
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:12.440]  korea said they were going to nuke guam last i checked guam is still here now north korea people
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:17.560]  admit very clearly that it's a country like no other if you want to be uh boorish about it you
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.720]  can call it a freak show or you could call it an outlier if you want to be fancy about it the point
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.560]  is there's no other country like it there's no other country as bad as north korea so the idea
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.440]  that we should be speaking them uh the way we would speak to our friends the uk or to our
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.960]  rivals russia it doesn't necessarily hold true that this that's kind of a non sequitur the idea i would
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.080]  say is talking to them like any other country it's not intuitive that that would work at all
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.360]  and in fact when you have a country that's blatantly saying explicitly we're going to nuke america
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:52.200]  that our organic response should be thank you sir may i have another that doesn't follow either
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:21:00.200]  not even saddam hussein was threatening to nuke us that's right and let me ask you this then i mean
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.640]  trump has had to basically get it lined up where it looked like war was about to happen
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.040]  and they've definitely got the assets in place i think let me just say one more point i just i
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.200]  let me just say i'm sorry to interrupt you alex when he had that tweet about north korea has a
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.840]  bomb a button and i have a bigger more effective button and everyone's clutching at their pearls
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:21.640]  does anyone think north korea didn't realize that we have a bigger bigger nuclear arsenal with them
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.080]  does anyone think that kim jong-un isn't painfully aware that we can destroy north korea uh they
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:31.400]  know this perfectly they talk about it in their literature all the time they're not stupid they're
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.760]  a very very evil country but there's no country on earth that isn't a word that we have the world's
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.320]  largest nuclear arsenal this is not a secret well that was actually my next question is
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:49.640]  studying north korea who really runs it and why are they so evil why are they so selfish
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:55.880]  why don't they just reform what is wrong with them well if you i talk about this heavily in my book
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:03.160]  if you look at these countries libya is a great example iraq uh and several others when the the
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:09.160]  countries liberalized romania was the example kim jong-il himself used when these country liberalized
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.960]  very often the people at the top are shot and with good reason you look at qaddafi he was
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:20.680]  sodomized to death saddam hussein was hung and libya had a nascent nuclear program they agreed to
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.160]  give it up and what happened is right now you have slavery there so north korea very quickly
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.520]  realizes the best on defense defense is a good offense uh kim jong-il said he wants to turn
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.400]  the country into a hedgehog meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.240]  and if you think about it how much easier i don't think they would have been running their
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:44.120]  mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very very strong weaponry something
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.000]  would have happened to him so they are very conniving in their hold on power they're very
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.160]  uh interested in self-preservation and unfortunately it's at the expense of the you know 25 million
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:01.000]  north korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity don't they
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.400]  know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and and and then the globalist
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:13.320]  using north korea has a strategy of tension that that is coming to an end it is coming to an end
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.240]  and and they're scared and they're clearly scared and you see that they're reaching out the south
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:23.400]  korea their arch rival in some kind of to china very publicly last year and in the recent months
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.400]  has been turning their backs on them russia to some extent has been turning their backs on them
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.880]  you know putin liked the idea that north korea could kind of be a thorn in our side but even he's
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.280]  not going to be defending you know concentration camps and starving children political purposes
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.880]  he's a far cry from stalin so north korea has been an international embarrassment especially
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.320]  for china although they do serve a purpose but china wants to have this
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.760]  dignified appearance the olympics is there any bigger symbol of global cooperation that you
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.400]  know that south korea is having the olympics now this is every country is turning their back in
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.280]  the north and they don't know what to do this is kind of uncharted territory for them thank god and
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.840]  i'm not saying this is the end of the north korean regime which i pray every day that it is but if
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.280]  this were the end this is what the end would look like and we know the strategy of letting them get
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.600]  better and better weapons and better and better delivery systems is what's brought us here so
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.520]  that's the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again thinking you'll get a
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.400]  different outcome i mean i see what trump's doing is the only sane thing and now the fact that they
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.240]  are looking at negotiations i think the sanctions are starting to break their back what do you think
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:33.400]  well i mean in the 90s they chose to let one to two million percent one to two million people starve
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.640]  rather rather than let the un in and give them food because they said if the government isn't
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:43.240]  providing food and the government be superfluous so this is a nation that has absolutely perfect
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.880]  in its immorality but the fact that they're starting to remember like last year you know
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.520]  donald trump's a dotard all these awful things about america save a rattling and now they're
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.360]  like doves now he was talking to them they're like birdie standards they want peace in their
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.400]  sweethearts so something has obviously changed in their calculations the fact is they've been around
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.200]  for 70 years that is not an accident they're clearly doing something right in their evil and
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.000]  then their torture and now if they're having to change it's because they were forced to change
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.560]  and i think it was a combination of uh trump china and japan you know maybe trump's not a
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.480]  genius maybe the people running things have been complete out of control idiots and now just
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:28.200]  because trump isn't insane that seems like it's genius well i i mean this is a tricky tricky
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:34.040]  situation because when you have a leadership that is content to hold its own population hostage
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.320]  you know it's kind of like a bank robbery on a scale multiplied by a million there's no easy
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.880]  answer and you can't blame at least i don't bill clinton entirely for trying to uh you know pacify
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.680]  them and bribe them and that worked to some extent for some time but at the end at the end
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:56.920]  of the day how do you get someone who has absolute power to give that up what incentive can you give
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.360]  him there's very little we can give kim jong-un that would make his life better so it's only a
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.920]  function of making things worse for him personally because he does not care about his population
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:13.720]  and he is the very caricature of a fat little spoiled rotten weak demon uh he is just the
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:18.840]  arc type of evil and uh i just feel sorry for the people i think you describe it the best of
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  mr malice they are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on and

[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:20.840]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.840]  it certainly is ladies and gentlemen
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:32.120]  you know i've told the great guy that does our voice over intros don't make it sound like i'm
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:37.080]  all high and mighty do the voice where he just does it dry i've had the same guy doing them for
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:44.680]  like 18 19 years but then kind of like announcing it like dun dun dun it's a big deal we are a big
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:50.680]  deal you're a big deal we've changed the world we're taking on real scum and winning we're
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:56.440]  promoting americana and free market and prosperity and real diversity and real community
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.640]  so i guess we might as well have some intros they're like
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:08.280]  dun dun dun because that's what hollywood and the globalist do they build themselves up is
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.320]  the biggest thing around but it's just something in my style i'm not like that but i realize there's
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:19.880]  got to be a balance like i should be more positive so many people that i love and care go man you
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:26.520]  got to stop working sometimes and enjoy the good things in life and i totally agree but i can't go
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:31.720]  see a movie that isn't filled with propaganda you can't go to a football game without there being a
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:40.760]  bunch of anti-american crap everywhere so i don't want to be like this anymore i don't want to be
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:48.120]  so angry but i we're getting run over here folks we're getting torn up and now we're just starting
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:55.480]  to fight back and the enemy is showing its real face it's rearing its ugly head and quite frankly
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:02.200]  it's uglier than i even thought it was but we really should celebrate not just this broadcast
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.800]  but everything you've done other people that are fighting tyranny across the country in the world
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:13.960]  because we have come so far and man just 10 years ago people didn't know the fellow reserve was
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:19.080]  private uh just 10 years ago people didn't know there was really a world government they were setting
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:25.400]  up everything we talk about now is just mainstream news i was reading the financial news this morning
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.760]  and it's like the private corporate world government's in trouble and many are asking of
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.960]  the us will just absorb all those systems now and as china jockeys for control of the world
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:42.200]  government and i'm like reading cnbc talking about world government just like they're talking about
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:49.160]  about the price of eggs or something at the grocery store but then i thought is that really
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:55.960]  victory or is that them now trying to demystify okay yeah there's a world government let's just
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:01.480]  not really worry about it and nothing to just kind of like caddy shackery he's dropping plastic
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:07.240]  explosives dropping the holes and it's shaped like mr squirrel mr rabbit hey mr gov we're
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:14.600]  not going to worry about it plastic explosives or anything because that's what this is like
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.880]  we're just going to sexualize your kids okay the un openly says namble is right and sex with
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:26.040]  five-year-old should be legal you know when you actually pull back from these globalists it
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:33.080]  it's unbelievable that we got to this point and i get why i sound completely crazy
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:42.120]  because it is completely crazy i mean it's crazy that hollywood's a bunch of devil
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:49.240]  whispers and satanists it's in the la times just came out and meditated it's crazy to know that
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:54.520]  george soros wants to create weaponized marijuana that's so strong you don't mind being a slave
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.360]  and the media makes a joke out of it when i've read what the government's actually put out
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.440]  and you're like wait a minute you're you for marijuana or against marijuana i'm for decriminalization
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.200]  i don't want to put everybody in jail i don't want to put nonviolent zombies in jail but a lot
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:16.520]  of people i know that are big marijuana smokers they're just not all there some people studies
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.080]  show it really helps but the reason i bring that up is let me cover this article because the minute
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.600]  i saw this headline i already knew what the story was going to say because i'd read studies about
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.320]  this in the from the 60s when they were thinking about deploying marijuana on the general public
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:39.640]  to make us passive and you can think well that's a good thing except they're deploying it to make
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:45.800]  us passive so that we'll live in worse living conditions so again you read about how they
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.240]  treat farm animals and you read about how the globalist operate and then you gotta understand
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:57.000]  they've got white papers for humans on what they're doing to animals so let me cover this first
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:04.760]  this is about a high times magazine here's why scientists gave fish weed and it goes in to
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:11.160]  say that they raise the fish to lobby and other things in tiny blue barrels and that they try
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:16.280]  to kill themselves and kill others because they're living in filthy feces filled sludge
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.640]  and have hellish lives just like a chicken you know they've cut their beaks off in the factory
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:28.120]  farms they'll try to kill themselves with their own beaks you know folks i'm not a pita person
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.040]  because they're eugenicists that want to control the whole animal rights movement but on the other
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.520]  end of it you got to have major animal rights because we're eating this stuff that went through
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.840]  these hellish lives the shrimp that's raised this way doesn't really have a big brain or anything but
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:47.240]  it tries to kill itself as well but these fish they feel and it's wrong and but but the issue is
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:55.880]  it says they give them marijuana so that they're docile and accept living by the hundreds and
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:01.640]  small blue barrels and so they just eat and drift to the bottom and crap on themselves
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.880]  well hillary calls you a bunch of barista potheads in your mother's basement and said how much she
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:13.800]  hated you soros admittedly has gone for the whole marijuana movement not the modern one to just
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:21.560]  legalize he's the one that pioneered look it up what you now see in pennsylvania michigan hawaii
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:28.200]  the night circuit ruled you get a medical marijuana license for glaucoma whatever it is
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.680]  there's hundreds of great uses it has a lot of great uses if you if you're taking chemo and
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.320]  can't hold down food what usually kills you is the not eating
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.920]  they said we're gonna come take your guns they send them letters in hawaii they go you got one week
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:48.680]  in pennsylvania they said you got three days look it up and i tell the marijuana people this i've
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.920]  been on some of the big marijuana shows and they can't even get upset about it because they're all
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:38:01.480]  just programmed to get upset about you know the right wing trying to keep me away from my weed
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:08.600]  and it's the savior of earth and you know it's a religion to them and they don't want to hear
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:13.320]  that the left is coming after them and it makes it a lot harder to wake them up when sessions
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.960]  comes out and says we're going to overturn 20 something state laws and we're going to arrest
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:25.080]  marijuana medical marijuana users and we're going to it's it's it's horrible and it's one of the
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:31.000]  worst things trumps done and it's catastrophic to trump and populism and it's downright unamerican
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.520]  the cops need to be busting people on the deadly opium and people selling heroin to kids and people
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:40.360]  selling methamphetamine need to need to be thrown under the prison
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.960]  we need to make marijuana something that is is useful but but dangerous and the weaponized
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.200]  strains they've got and you know the media made fun of it in my custody battle and said jones
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:59.240]  says he only smokes at once a year yeah right anybody that knows me knows that hey alex won't
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:06.280]  trust him as marijuana i'm no no no no no no no i don't like it because it has the opposite
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.240]  effect of making me feel docile and relaxed it makes me paranoid i don't have fear until i
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.920]  smoke marijuana either and suddenly start getting scared i feel my breath feel my heart beating i
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:22.440]  don't like it now sometimes i smoke it it's not as bad but the point is is that it varies person
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.120]  to person some type a people might really help them some people that aren't very well motivated
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.120]  it'll ruin your life but read this article everyone knows cannabis is a big business and
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.840]  the prospect of economic growth and opportunity of course is one of the most pervasive arguments
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.440]  of the case for legalization from seed to smoke the cannabis industry stretches across multiple
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.240]  sectors of the economy but who could have guessed that weed attracted the attention of the agriculture
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.440]  industry as a means to increase profit margins and what do they say we're gonna we're gonna
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:55.480]  tranquilize animals put them in horrible conditions well there that's why they're coming out with
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:02.600]  chickens that have no brains now no upper brains they won't kill themselves when they're beaks fish
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:08.440]  farm weed will help fish chill out it goes into how they kill themselves how they're in total filth
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.600]  how it's a nightmare scenario and they go it doesn't matter let's just not make the pens bigger or
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:19.080]  happier and then we demand an economy that scales up because the more quality you demand the better
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.920]  you get as well no let's just drug them with weaponized marijuana well that's what's being done
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:32.520]  to you and it goes into their horrible conditions it goes into it and that's the whole plan that's
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:38.120]  what the fluoride's about it hits your sterilization as well and it's all admitted it's all admitted
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:43.240]  that's why they're pushing weaponized weed okay so we need to be balanced about it and admit the

[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:52.120]  at infowars.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:06.360]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:15.320]  come to mind alex jones alex jones but there's a lot of controversy around this that work about
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.760]  alex jones for google is being accused of hiding negative stories about hillary and her campaign
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:25.960]  but kids against algal rhythm to marry stories like the clinton body count story that's according
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:37.560]  to website info wars after martin lucas king has been shot to death and mess with denny jfk
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:43.480]  was shot from the back and the front he was almost accused of her planned impulsion it's just
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.680]  I think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that we do not understand how
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.960]  they work operating in areas that we can't control us is this global governance that
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:07.160]  lasts is it one world the central bank has been charged his reclaims the fact that accidentally
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:12.520]  some former us naval officers say it was on purpose they described the day's action as part of a
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:19.400]  continuing cover russian intelligence compiled a dossier on mr. kump during visits to musko
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:26.280]  russian stop denied everything he called it all fake news and he accused cnn of being fake news
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:32.840]  this is the natural emergency if they kill trump or remove trump it will cause a massive civil war
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:40.920]  in this country this is a female high level in the yard war with russia are you aware that mr stone
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.600]  also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with julien assange in which
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:51.480]  things the white house the president are citing info wars they could shut us down your neck if you
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:59.800]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones and ladies and gentlemen
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:06.520]  we are solving history we're exposing the globalist plan and we're defeating it there's no way you can
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:13.240]  set up this big giant private corporate world government and then get away with it if there's
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:20.120]  opposition but they arrogantly built it acted like that by the time they got it in place they'd
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:27.320]  have such a brainwashed tv head internet video game head population that they would be able to
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.840]  roll forward with tpp all the rest of this stuff where they transfer all of our sovereignty out of
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.960]  the country just like they did with the eu most countries never even voted to enter it they just
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.560]  voted on trade deals that then politicians later changed in committee to take over and
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.640]  briggs is going to be a long process defeating the globalist is going to be a long process but
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:55.400]  when you've got the nation state and the institutions that aren't perfect but in the west pretty darn
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.680]  good compared to globalism and you've got the globalist corporations transferring our power
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:11.000]  to shadowy multinational groups that are tax exempt i've had the cia high level i've had
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.840]  the fbi asked me i've had top media i've had a lot of people say jones how did you
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:26.680]  engineer the main populist operation to trigger the chain reaction to bring down globalism
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.920]  and i always explain a i didn't do that there were people fighting it beforehand i picked up on
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:38.360]  what they were doing and i understood that it's going to look like it's invincible until it starts
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:43.640]  imploding and then the minute it starts imploding it's going to go quickly because it is the most
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:51.320]  top heavy delusional thing how are you going to set up a private corporate world government
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:58.440]  where your tax exempt and you are above the law and you have diplomatic immunity and then you
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.560]  come into the nation state and teach people that they can't have prosperity and teach them a modern
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:10.280]  environmental movement to hate yourself when the globalists are exempt well their only hope is to
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:19.000]  have cultural religious division and that's what i mean i watched oprah wimphrey speech the golden
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.080]  gloves and it was stunningly evil the race spading the playing women off against men
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:34.040]  just the the fake acting was incredible and i just thought to myself there's no way this
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:41.080]  witch will ever be president because we know who she is she's so arrogant that she's involved in
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:46.760]  the bill mullin the gates foundation that specifically targets black people for depopulation
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:52.040]  and she'll argue well they live in squalor well then let them have industrialization then
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.680]  you just can't sit back and bring in economic control and make women get sterilized so they
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:04.280]  get a little bit of money and oprah wimphrey or or or tell us you're a white supremacist lady
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.560]  i get the problems in africa i don't want to bring a bunch of military aged men on north africa
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.800]  to come into europe ten million i've been rape and kill everybody that have left us cover it up
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.880]  because that's your plan use them to bring us down while you're bringing them down i don't
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:25.240]  like any of it you think i like tens of millions of mexicans coming in getting brainwashed to be
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:30.520]  racist and have chips on their shoulders and think i'm evil because i'm a gringo blah blah blah
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:34.440]  doesn't matter because most of them aren't getting brainwashed but that's your plan but it doesn't
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.840]  mean that i didn't sit there and go well yes mexicans take your garter cell shot drink your
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:48.360]  fluoride because i've got a soul i can't look at some baby whether it's got black skin or brown
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:54.120]  skin or pink skin and think well because that person's a certain color and because that group's
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.320]  been brainwashed to hate me i better organize around taking them out and that's what the
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:05.160]  globalists have done they force you all into your race group so they can manage all the groups and
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:11.880]  they write textbooks on this the british had a few thousand troops took control of india
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:18.120]  that i forget the numbers but it's it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.120]  the population you know tens of millions of people at that time and the british took over
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:29.000]  with a couple thousand people playing groups off against each other and now it's being done on a
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.760]  mass scale and Oprah Winfrey and all these dirt bags know exactly what they're doing but i have to
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:42.280]  counter their racism saying you're a racist pig but not because you're black you may get some
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:46.520]  dumb racist person who's white or black to hate somebody because they're told all this stuff and
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.440]  racist whites may do something to you so you hate whites all whites or racist black does something
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:59.320]  so you hate all blacks that's called being manipulated but remember Oprah Winfrey is an
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:04.200]  elitist pig who wants to be at the very top of the global pyramid for her own ego and so she's
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:10.600]  the only black person ever led in to the cold springs harbor eugenics human genome program
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:18.280]  the human genome program you oh ibm runs it ibm ran it back when it was the race mixing study facility
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:24.680]  that literally created the system for hitler do you understand what i'm telling you is 100
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:33.480]  percent new york times bestselling books by black and others it is a hundred percent fact
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:41.480]  that bill gates and melinda gates and warren buffett and Oprah Winfrey took over the eugenics
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:49.320]  operation of john d rockefeller the great great granddaddy right through david who died after
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:56.600]  a sixth heart transplant last year and that this woman has been handed the literal
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:03.160]  baton that hitler was just an off-growth of
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:11.960]  itself because this eugenics operation was so evil it even set germany up and british
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:16.280]  and us intelligence told hitler he was going to be given all of europe with a european union
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.080]  the king of england was going to become the head of the european union monarchy he was german
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:25.080]  look it up that's why he advocated not because he had an american wife
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:35.960]  and then the globalist set up germany and brought it down just like they set up the russians at the
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:41.880]  end of world war one and it's the same thing and now they were going to set up america and
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.960]  bring us down and have china be the new heart of the power and donald trump and alex jones and
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:59.480]  matt drudge and you said no no no we want a world based on free market being honest being good
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:04.680]  being straight dealers straight shooters and guess what that's why they're scared and that's why it
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:11.160]  makes me so mad to know oprah wimfrey is part of the most elitist evil organization on earth
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:21.800]  and she wants to run her mouth about racism she makes me literally boil disgusting now i need to

[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:53.160]  to marry stories like the clinton body count story that's according to website info wars this
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.720]  sounds like it's confirmed there are recent shooters to the fully automatic

[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:20.440]  i think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that we do not understand how
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:28.680]  they work operating in areas that we can't control ufo is this global governance at last is it one
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.280]  world the central bank is in charge is real claims the attack was accidental but some former u.s naval
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.560]  officers say it was on purpose they described the day's action as part of a continuing cover
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:45.560]  russian intelligence compiled a dossier on mr trump during visits to moscow russian
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:51.800]  stop denied everything he called it all fake news and he accused cnn of being fake news
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:00.120]  if they kill trump and remove trump it requires a massive civil war in this country this is a
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:07.160]  female high level religion we are at war with russia are you aware that mr stone also stated
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:11.480]  publicly that he was in direct communication with julien assange and wiki weeks the white house
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:18.200]  the president are citing info wars they can shut us down your next if you are receiving this
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:27.160]  transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones i was booked to talk about the very issues i'm
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:30.760]  just describing you're not even asking you about them because they're not interesting facts for
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.120]  you that's not true i have a plenty of questions in immigration you've attempted to fill a buster
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:38.120]  by talking about your flights no i'm not i want to ask you a question because i don't have no don't
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:46.200]  think condescending jake even jake president and the white house the reason why i want to talk about
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.960]  the president's experiences what i've seen with him traveling to meet dozens of foreign leaders
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:56.600]  with his incredible work okay you're not answering the questions i understand you have 24 hours a
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.760]  day of answering the material you're not going to give three minutes for the american people
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.920]  i get it the real experience of Donald Trump there's one viewer that you care about right now
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:09.240]  and you're being obsequious no being a fact oh no in order to please him okay no and i think i've
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.040]  you know what i've wasted enough of my viewers thank you as republicans lawmakers call for a
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.840]  change of sessions to resign in a major reversal democrats are now coming to his defense what
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:27.480]  changed we'll ask the top democrat so that was jake tapper panicking this weekend
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:35.400]  and cutting the white house communications officer
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:41.400]  steven miller off and i've watched the whole interview it was riveting to see him marching
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:50.520]  to the devil's palace right into hell and stand up against those guys and in the full clip he gets
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:57.960]  into hey you're the ones that put out the fake quote that trump directed uh general flin to meet
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:01.880]  months before he was even elected with the russians knowing it was fake you're the ones that reported
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:06.920]  on and on and on and on and on all this fake niche and tapper didn't want to discuss he said
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:10.920]  you're not answering our questions he'd already been there 20 minutes answering all the questions
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:16.280]  but they didn't want somebody to stand up for truth it was miller that could keep up with
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:22.040]  trump when trump was 70 now 71 it was miller 30 something years old when i researched miller
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.360]  and i remembered miller because it's not about miller even trump it's about their their path
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:31.560]  and who they are and this is a guy in high school that was anti-communist and it was against the
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:38.200]  left creating anti-white racism he's a jewish guy but he recognizes race-based stuff and he comes
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:44.200]  from a liberal family and you know from what i read and but he was like oh my god this is like
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.280]  nazi but it's against white people so they call him a white nationalist because he's a guy that's
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:52.200]  anti-racist he sounds like martin luther king the actualist of martin luther king but that's how
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:59.960]  far they've come he destroyed him and tapper went to break early and didn't know what to do
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:07.160]  because a 31 32 year old person who's actually immersed in things and researches everything
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:11.640]  had every angle of what they were about to try and what they were about to do and then i began to see
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:17.560]  it was miller would transcribe what the president said and say what about this sir and add a point
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:23.640]  or two and it was miller and what's crazy is that's what's crazy is i know trump isn't word for word
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:29.960]  copying my talking points they're just truth i'm so synced up it's miller i've been synced up with
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:34.920]  because i can say stuff at the same time i found miller giving a press conference i'm so excited
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:41.960]  the new product at info warslife.com in a glass bottle two month servings filled to the brim filled
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:49.240]  to the absolute top the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill a new tropic but it doesn't
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:55.560]  have any stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that quite frankly uh i just
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:01.480]  went off what i saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:07.000]  they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and i came up with our
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.360]  own formulae working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in america
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:19.400]  120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglonone to it which is the precursor
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:25.400]  to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands it is amazing
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:31.800]  red pill now available at info wars store dot com and your purchase fuzz the operation
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:44.200]  there's a need for new world order but it has different characteristics in different parts
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:54.120]  of the world live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.200]  you know we had a great guest on earlier
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:07.800]  michael malis about north korea and he's written a whole bunch of books and goes written even more
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:14.760]  he's very prolific and i kept saying isn't it genius that trump got north korea for 20 something
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:23.560]  years to finally call it'd been two years since they used the hotline but it'd been 22 years
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:28.120]  since they had decided they wanted to have peace talks and talk about how they wanted to work on
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:36.680]  the olympics coming up and he didn't want to say it was genius because nobody wants to completely
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.840]  wait in and just say trump's doing a great job everybody kind of wants to hedge their bets
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:48.040]  and and i get that and understand that but trump isn't hedging his bets for us and so because he is
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.760]  so attacked he is so viciously lied about i want to really stand with the president
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.400]  i want my john hancock when i walk up and i see george washington's signature on that
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:05.640]  putting his life on the line i want to sign big alex jones big and i'm not doing it
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:10.120]  to be the big man on the paper i'm doing it because everybody else is putting a risk on
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:17.000]  themselves so i'm not going to hide we're going to do this we're going to put ourselves right in
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.640]  the enemy's way and so that's what i want is i'm looking for the enemy i'm looking for the fire
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.840]  i'm looking for their attack i'm like a heat seeking missile that as they fire on me that's
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:43.640]  where i know to go but let me tell you i am shaken by how consciously evil hollywood
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.480]  and mainstream media are i mean i i used to think that only the top was evil
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:54.360]  and i think you know decades ago when i was first researching that was the truth to a
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:04:00.920]  certain extent but now the evil as everyone recognizes that's that's a wake he's growing
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.080]  and that's why we finally see an awakening all over the world i am so proud of the check
[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:11.080]  republic and hungry and romania and poland and other areas where europe's saying you're all
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:17.080]  going to take a millions of islamicist men every year and you're going to put full grown men
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.320]  calling them children in your high schools and your middle schools and you're going to let them
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:27.800]  do all this or we're going to find you a hundred thousand euros per person that you don't let in
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:33.400]  and so these countries are all saying go ahead and do it we're leaving the eu and you read what
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:40.040]  these leaders are saying i mean i spent hours the last few weeks just reading what the hungarian
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:46.360]  and the romanian and the polish and the check president and now the austrian president and now
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.200]  what the now the northern european countries are weighing in saying we're going to be
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.960]  first for our country we're not going to be this isn't like diversity where you let some people in
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:03.160]  for the melting pot that america is this is where the globalists bring in people they know will not
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.640]  assimilate any
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:17.160]  army and who are there to take you over so they can be used as the proxy army to take control
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:23.240]  that's what this is and my greatest frustration is that in every case
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:35.640]  they are completely and totally out in the open about it
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:45.000]  but there was an austrian prince who over a hundred years ago developed a plan to repopulate europe
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:51.800]  with the middle east and they've got that plan and it's way beyond that now and it's just incredible
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:58.680]  when you realize that it's a cult that's anti christian and you read the writings from a hundred
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:03.000]  years ago and they say we don't want to be christian anymore we want to get rid of that
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:11.880]  and then you go and you read what the un says today and you read the universities and it's the
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:18.440]  wildest stuff all whites are bad all christians are bad white women should abort their white babies
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:24.520]  uh and then i saw a photo it's in the twitter i tweeted it like saturday if you guys can pull it
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:32.680]  up or sunday i saw a mural on the wall at a place called waterloo ice house it's a pretty good little
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:38.920]  diner and i'd been going in there for years i never really noticed it just because it was just
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:45.880]  nostalgic americana i guess an ad for red x beer red cross they'll pull up a minute and it's a man
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:53.880]  who's been playing golf and a woman with his golf card his his t card is handing him a beer
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.640]  and he's handing in his card and then his wife is kissing him so it's the image of a woman bringing
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:04.440]  you a glass of beer you just played golf and your beautiful wife or girlfriend's kissing you and
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:11.160]  it's sexist it's racist it's everything and then i knew when i tweeted it of course it isn't sexist
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:17.480]  or racist it says it's lucky when you live in america it's also nationalistic and because
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:24.120]  they're white it's white nationalist and now i noticed in the comments leftist said oh yeah
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:32.040]  you're crazy lucky loggers not even around anymore as if that even mattered and no one's trying to
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:35.720]  take stuff down like this and you could pull up a thousand articles where they're saying we don't
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:40.280]  want ads with only white people in it or there's too many white people in hollywood or and it's
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:46.200]  the white saying that's creating your racial division or you know we don't want to see images
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:51.320]  of women wearing dresses you'll go see the new star wars movie women are in charge 100% of the
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:56.760]  rebel forces and again i don't mind seeing women in charge of something it's force fed as an agenda
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:03.560]  to get women out of the home having children having a base having a family so everybody's
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:07.960]  in the factory and the state raises the kids and the children don't thrive living in these little
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:12.600]  cradles and getting all their vaccines and getting their getting their formula that the scientists
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:18.280]  came up with so women wouldn't be needed anymore they're getting rid of women they're getting rid
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:26.120]  of the species it's their stated plan but i love how the left you could pull up thousands of
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:31.640]  examples of them saying take down martin luther king he didn't mention gay children in all god's
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:38.680]  children up on the mountain together and i have a dream or take down the mural of football players
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:44.440]  it's it's too masculine it's toxic they're taking or or lynch hall the word lynch scares us so get
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:51.720]  rid of it it's all an exercise of power or the white kids got her elbow on the black girl
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:59.080]  in the ad so that means she's subservient so take out that and they're just creating mass
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.840]  mental illness saying we don't want to get rid of christmas even though they're saying happy
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:06.840]  holidays everywhere and telling kids don't call it christmas and don't hand out christmas cards
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:10.600]  but then every time i say look the war on christmas all these leptis go it's not happening it's
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:18.840]  not happening but they know it's a formulae i learned the average leptis isn't conned they
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.280]  know they're doing it but they're there to make you feel alone and to ridicule you it's in the
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.320]  facebook documents the twitter documents these brigade trolls they are they go out you could say
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.640]  the sun came up this morning and they'd say no it didn't and they're just all there because they're
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:40.840]  all peer pressure driven so they think you're peer pressure driven they think i'm peer pressure
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:46.040]  driven and so they're there to make us feel alone oh nobody's trying to take down nostalgic stuff
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.000]  nobody's trying to get rid of culture nobody's trying to do this or that when you go to those
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:58.840]  universities across the board it is the most virile racist anti-family anti-human crap you
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:05.000]  ever heard and i'm not given the quote minorities a pass on this just to be a virtue signaler it's
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:15.320]  true they're 90 led by rich white kids whose parents are corporate chiefs we've done the
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:21.720]  math on them and they're there controlling the next generation and getting in place and they
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:29.160]  know exactly what they're doing and it's a scientific operation and that's the scary revelation
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:36.040]  is that just like i went 18 years ago to a smart growth conference i kept saying hey here's the
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:39.640]  documents it's meant to take land away and put people in small apartments and charge a more
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.200]  property tax and take control and shut down other people's land to make this land worth more and
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:50.920]  they would go get out of my way of course we know that idiot it was such a joke this this group of
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:58.840]  ravenous sociopathic psychopathic control freaks that they were all there just battling to get a
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:04.680]  seat at the table robbing everybody robbing the farmland robbing the ranches raising the property
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:10.280]  taxes being exempt and i was just like oh my god they're they're most of them are totally conscious
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:15.720]  and evil they all run their cities and counties and states and they are criminals and off the
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:23.000]  record they go of course for criminals you moron get out of my way and now the average leftist
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.280]  is a criminal just like when gruber would have those meetings and they're there at the meetings
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:30.760]  when he just had a lie the average person is trying to join them and just begging holding
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.080]  out a sign saying i want to be evil are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals

[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:54.120]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.520]  this just ended it ties into what we were just breaking down james demore just
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:05.720]  filed a class action lawsuit against google saying it discriminates against white male conservatives
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:11.720]  well they teach that white males are inherently evil uh and that's taught at every major university
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:18.440]  in the country i have a good friend uh who uh was a hollywood editor for a while and then came back
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:27.960]  to get another degree i've known him since college uh in uh psychology and he's a liberal jew and
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:33.960]  and they told him in there inherently you need to leave and all white males need to leave and
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:39.080]  these were mainly white women saying this because you are inherently evil and so there's some
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:46.120]  lawsuit going on with that now and they will straight up tell you uh that you are inherently
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:55.400]  bad and so that's the way this stuff works google fires diversity or manifesto author
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:00.360]  james demore for wrong think i want to get him on i really want to push to get him on
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:03.400]  i guess google needs to keep up the left wing's ideological reign of terror
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:12.200]  and expanding on that when i went and saw star wars the last jedi it wasn't that every woman was
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:18.680]  a commander and then seven eight nine ten deep it was just all women it was like a cast system it
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:25.080]  was reversing roles if you think men in the military you know uh is wrong uh only and now
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:29.720]  you've reversed it there's this thing well well you know we got to go out and kill some white people
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:35.160]  because we got to get paid back most white people their ancestors came here after slavery
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:41.320]  and most people that had had family here before slavery was ended two percent of the population
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.320]  had slaves and then it goes into whites being slaves as sharecroppers on and on
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:54.680]  so again it's not about including a black guy as a hero it's not about including a woman as a
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.320]  hero it's about a complete forced message but here's the most important thing
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:04.360]  the men are wrong about their strategy the women are right
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:13.400]  and this is the most important thing you're treated to women being blown up and killed over
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:19.960]  and over and over again and what they're saying is women are expendable well here's the thing and
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:25.240]  all of human development and all other development whoever's home taken care of the babies needs to
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:31.400]  be protected and if you're not taking care of the fortress the base the home the village then
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:38.680]  as a species you don't survive and this is an attack on our biology first and foremost and
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:44.520]  it's an admitted program it's in the facebook documents it's in the wiki leaks that there's
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:51.080]  an attack on the family not just a nuclear family there's an attack on the species and i can't keep
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:58.520]  saying that enough and so they're building a world where women and men are all alone
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:05.000]  where my daughters have no future three daughters where my son has no future together we're one
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.240]  species and that's why shank uger of the young turds saying you know i understand as an islamist
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:15.240]  and a muslim and a you know guy from turkey some folks are nice from turkey that you know that they
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:20.280]  believe women are subhuman and stuff but uh you know he's come out you know and said he's sorry for
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:28.520]  the comments uh but women have an extra chromosome and women have extra set of dna and i want to just
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:35.000]  it's not a patronizing women it's a fact that all of us are women at the first stages of embryo
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:40.280]  embryonic behavior sure shank uger would have been a very ugly woman but he's a man and the
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:45.160]  point is is that embryonically he changed into a man from a woman so again the idea
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:53.480]  ladies and gentlemen the idea that this guy funded by the gulf states and all the rest of it
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:01.160]  the idea that these people are going to sell you on how to be virtuous and how to be good
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:07.000]  and how to be a wonderful person is a complete fraud they're only there to so to see by the way
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.360]  since they pulled it up on screen for tv viewers i might as well play this um they said alex jones
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:16.600]  is mentally ill just like they declared the president mentally ill and just sit there shaking
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:23.080]  their heads about what are we going to do i don't know you blew up at me and spit ice tea on me and
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:28.600]  screamed and yelled and called me fat and ugly and everything else fat shamed me which you say
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:32.760]  you know it's criminal basically whenever you were in public and waved me up to the stage and then
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:37.480]  said you hadn't done it uh and said i was behind the stage like in your own building when you were
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:43.080]  in a public area where the press was and five feet away there were other booths you claim roger stone
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:49.080]  ran up on the stage when he says no i'm not coming on your show and leaves just all lies they don't
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:55.080]  understand satire when i go stelter is literally the face of evil he runs your life he runs your
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:21:00.440]  culture he wants to control you i'm saying the media stelter is the archetype and he looks like the
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:05.720]  subway guy and i just said why does the subway guy looks so evil why does stelter looks so evil
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:10.840]  why does michael wolf looks so evil okay and then they turn this into this whole thing you deceive
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:18.840]  their viewers to not know what happened some fun is ladies and gentlemen yes i believe stelter is
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:22.280]  evil yes i said culturally they're bleeding is dry so they're drunk on the blood of our
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:29.320]  children's future and they go oh you're being an actor no i have fun when i'm being a hundred percent
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:35.800]  clear i'm a hundred percent clear when i let myself off the chain i'm having fun saying that photo of
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:42.440]  him with that crazy looking smile not knowing how creepy it looks and stelter even tweeted and said
[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:48.360]  thanks for using a nice photo of me nice photo that could be the cover of american psycho too i mean
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:54.760]  it's creepy and it really triggers me but these folks can't even tell the difference so if i'm
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:22:00.040]  crazy and trumps crazy thank god we built our own operations we didn't get money from katar or from
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:05.160]  gulf state dictatorships bro self-made so remember that and you know al gore gave you money so
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:09.080]  in between writing stuff about how women are genetically inferior i understand
[02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:13.800]  derricka derricka mohammed jihad let's go ahead and play them freaking out here it is i used to kind
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:22.760]  of laugh at alex jones and his ludicy because i thought you know it's partly an act um but the

[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:14.600]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and it got picked up all over the news
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:19.480]  and we just watched our audience swelled even though they tried to censor us on facebook youtube
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:24.120]  twitter uh our actual streams our podcast our radio stations the ratings are just
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:31.960]  is what we do is we go out punch the globalists in the nose and say stuff like wow brian stelter
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:38.680]  looks like the former subway guy just saying and why do they all have that same fake crazy
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:49.880]  looking smile him wolf all of them so how did uh the young turds leader uh sink uger uh the uh
[02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:54.680]  young turks islamicist i mean it's a fact the young turks were like the hitler youth of turkey
[02:29:54.680 --> 02:30:00.600]  that rounded up and killed the christians and then he plays dumb about the name of it and then he
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:06.840]  says it's anti-semitic brian stelter isn't even jewish and i don't even know about the subway
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:13.800]  guy or the other guy i'm not the one that's anti-israel like sink uger uger at her sinker jinker
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:20.360]  mooger booger whatever his name is and again this guy funded by al gore funded by george
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:28.760]  soros funded by gulf state dictatorships remember when they were funded by al jazeera i mean it's
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:40.200]  just got bought by al jazeera and then they sit there pushing their garbage force fed by youtube
[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:45.560]  force fed by google that's going to be in the whole antitrust investigation their whole thing's
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:51.640]  falling apart now that videos and also audio has come up with them fat shaming shaying horrible
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:31:00.680]  things shaying women are subhuman i mean jink uger i think that's how you actually say his name i mean
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:07.880]  he literally wrote look at these 15 year old slut whores yeah yeah i'm gonna pull up the article so
[02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:16.040]  women are subhuman something wrong with them well move to saudi arabia then jack or something great
[02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:23.160]  about women that's why you'll find me hanging out with women not with men you don't like women
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:28.520]  because you're a big fat ugly slob just like r.v. Weinstein you just want to flop around like a big
[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:35.320]  demonic porpoise and and run our lives and come here with your whole islamic takeover oh just like
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:40.680]  turkey wasn't islamic until they uncloked and then rodgy hot ass and other but he tells you his name
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:47.400]  right up front there's a quote obviously the genes of women are flawed they're poorly designed
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:54.680]  creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along
[02:31:54.680 --> 02:32:01.640]  peacefully and fruitfully uh no they just don't want to have sex with you bro women don't worry
[02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:08.280]  want to have sex with good guys you're not it bro anyways he's a pig his wife's a cps worker
[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:16.200]  i mean he is just he is he is he is the literal example of an islamic hog uh a radical hog that
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:21.000]  just thinks he's going to run everybody and take our openness and rub our faces in it
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.880]  by the way i got stacks of news about samalis and mohammed being the number one name in minnesota
[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:31.880]  and the stabbing and the murders and the death and they won't even arrest the samalis now when they
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:38.760]  stab people screaming a la akbar and it's almost always a woman walking a dog or a woman that won't
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:43.320]  date them and then they're like you may go free you're allowed to kill us because that's your culture
[02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:52.120]  hey why don't you go to samalia buddy they believe women are subhuman too there so again
[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:58.040]  he's triggering as well but he's more of like a stupid
[02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:07.320]  electric shock therapy victim okay i mean this is the best the enemy can offer up in force fetus
[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:10.200]  the young turd and so
[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:17.800]  brian stelter this known liar this known yellow journalist this the guy that calls me a virus
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:22.200]  that says i should be taken off the air see did i say stelter should be taken off the air and i
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:28.440]  said stelter has the look in criminology known as the joker when a psychopath doesn't know how
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:34.280]  they look and they're trying to smile they always have that smile and i'm not a psychopath so i can't
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:41.960]  do it i am a maniac i'm a berserker i love liberty i'm ready to fight intellectually but let me just
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:53.800]  try it you can't even do it it's like a
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:34:01.320]  is he gonna i can't even do it i mean i'm just i just can't do it i mean if you imagine if that
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:07.400]  guy came to your door wanting to date your daughter and so how do they counter me saying i know you
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:12.040]  don't like me i know you hate me the globalists say they hate flyover country they say they hate
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:16.760]  christians they say they hate conservatives they say they hate everything we stand for all these
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:21.320]  people do they're hired by the globalists to take over and destroy it so of course they got a higher
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.560]  scum that's into this stuff they already had some chip on their shoulder and wanted to pull down
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:33.080]  something that they have class envy of i mean i get the islamists just want to burn down the
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:37.640]  west and take it over and put the women back with hoods on their heads and sell them on slave blocks
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:43.560]  because they're genetically inferior according to you and your master male race theory and that's
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:48.280]  why lindus for sure and the islamists are force fed by your network and by the left because they
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.360]  they're going to bring women into total bondage and and and you know out of the west out of freedom
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:57.320]  where the west is all about the goddess you want to get really a cultic you i mean what you have is
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:05.240]  a satanic monotheistic anti-female system coming into the west that's christian and judaeo but
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:10.440]  also in its base ethos goddess worship that's what our country is named after it's what europe's
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:15.000]  named after it's what's on top of all the buildings it's what it's all really about is chivalry and
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:25.320]  women and you come in a big bloated jihadi and you tell us how you're going to take care of the
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.160]  you're going to take care of the women you spiritually ugly creature
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:40.040]  because you're a stunted demonic blob you know you're falling now let's continue uh back uh

[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:05.080]  and then back that up again broke back back up when they start talking after i talk broke back
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:14.760]  broke back means weak broke back means no will broke back means other controlled by other people
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.480]  let's look at the definition of broke back not from the urban dictionary because you know gay
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:26.280]  used to mean a gay day he was a gay lad we had a gay time until it became a new word a fag used to
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.040]  be a burning ember or cigarette you they still call it that in england people walk by here hey
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:38.760]  i guess a box a box of fags but again if i wanted to call him gay i would call him gay i called

[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:52.200]  to do this so that to distract you from that book yeah wow that sounds personal though he said he
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:58.200]  said broke back which was calling him gay yes and then he said i know what you think about my family
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:03.400]  like it sounds really personal right that's right it sounds very passionate maybe they had a little
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:09.000]  romantic rendezvous and he's upset about it because he was again the left all came hundreds of
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.960]  reporters trying to move the jury to take my children away from me they failed and they said i

[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:33.560]  back they're so alive but they're broke back they're no good but again the globalists expropriate
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:39.080]  all terms and then make them politically incorrect then i talk about how the media and the globalists
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:48.440]  run our system and they go oh he said bank doesn't he know stelter isn't a jew they're the ones
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:53.400]  bringing jews into this and again it's the left that doesn't even want israel to exist

[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:11.560]  street journal but that's okay because she's the black hillary she's the high priestess of death

[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:32.280]  during the middle of the roman plan scheme thing trying to get his conviction overturned
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:37.800]  for kidnapping and raping a 13-year-old girl of course under islam turkey's making it legal
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:46.120]  to have sex with nine-year-old girls and make them pregnant turkey turkey turkey is moving to
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:53.240]  legalize it their high court just opened it up because mohammed had a a wife that was nine years
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:45:01.160]  old she had a baby when she was 10 but isha and so sink's gonna teach us all about how to take care
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:08.840]  of the women when he writes in these articles about how there's deficient genetically no i think uh
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:14.760]  i don't know buddy i don't know if you can have a baby or got a second set of dna or any of that i
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.760]  don't think so but anyways let's get back to him because i spent too much time on it with some other
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:23.400]  news i want to hit it just that looking at the level of baloney is is entertaining and how scared
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:28.200]  they are because i'm invoking the name of jesus christ i'm talking about god and a god that's
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:32.200]  going to stand up against them and they don't want us to have that they want us to be godless so
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:37.000]  their islamic power that's what the young turk says is an islamic leftist program can take us over
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:42.920]  and of course they try to hide it oh we're really liberals oh yeah no you know we talk about that all
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:50.280]  the time saudi arabia reasonable discussion they're a pack of cowards and they hate it because
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:57.640]  they're declining they're falling apart they're done they're done and they know it all that
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.440]  soros money all that foreign Gulf state money dried up all the islamic money got dried up
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:10.200]  like what's like what just happened with trump saudi arabia bye bye money oh oh no leftist
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.400]  programs ever survived that wasn't funded by some big foundation or some slick eye outfit and you
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:20.040]  can't deliver you can't win sink that's why your own little leftist foundation is throwing you off
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:26.520]  the board and you're seeking like a young turd a young turd who says the armenian genocide
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:31.480]  didn't happen here let's finish up that clip he had a little romantic rendezvous and he's upset
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:36.440]  about it because he was like or or maybe that's what alex was i'm up the back of him i'm upset by
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:41.480]  the face of a psychopath in my view that look not knowing that you look like a total demon
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:46.120]  when there's no humanity not a real smile it's totally fake it's a smile of a narcissist praying
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:56.040]  on you that face that he has that wolf has that the subway guy has that look i know it well i've
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:02.760]  learned it to be the enemy but i bit theatrical about my spazzing out about it you bet that's
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:10.120]  what i do son it's how trump controls the news cycle son you were just giving your stuff by
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:15.720]  gulf states and propped up force fed by google everybody you're not you know you weren't successful
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.120]  in the world to talk radio with high ratings the highest number one in austin to get launched and
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:26.200]  syndicated when i was 22 you don't you don't understand running your own company you understand
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:33.160]  how to be a minion of the nazi collaborator george soros who again they have these shows saying i'm
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:37.720]  crazy uh can we pull that up with the anti-semitic things coming up it was in newsweek about two
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:43.720]  weeks ago it said jones has new anti-semitic attack on george soros because george soros happens to be
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:49.000]  jewish i say he's a nazi collaborator so talking about about a nazi collaborator is now anti-semitic
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.320]  and you read the article even the commenters went he didn't say anything about jews in here
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:59.720]  he said george soros was a nazi collaborator alex jones spends anti-semitic conspiracy theory that
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:05.800]  george soros created sexual misconduct allegations to hurt trump so i'll come out in the wiki leaks
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:11.240]  okay let's go ahead and go back to them sorry he had a little romantic rendezvous when he's upset
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.440]  about it because he was like or or maybe that's what alex was expecting yeah because he said he
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:24.280]  tried very there's a very scary and concerning level of paranoia there that um it's just i
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:29.560]  i don't know why people don't question that they don't want us to mark them as the plague
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.720]  they don't want us to finally not just think they're funny or dumb or liars but to really
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:39.800]  recognize they want to run our lives let's continue more right like at first i was like oh it's an act
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:44.760]  he's just trying to you know but that that video that part of his video was what stood out to me
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:49.160]  most because it went from kind of being entertaining to now this is not funny yeah no no that's the
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.240]  plus i don't mean when you were spitting fluids on me and calling me fat and ugly and saying get
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.880]  the f out of here and saying roger stone get out of here when he's 30 feet away standing in the walk
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:02.520]  way at the at the at the media center with boobs everywhere and then you lied and said he storms
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:11.240]  your stage i mean should we play all that again continue mental breakdown i don't know if he's on
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:16.840]  some sort of like some serious strike i don't know right but there's something what i do know
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:21.320]  is there's something deeply wrong with that guy that is not a normal rant that's not somebody
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.800]  getting impassioned that is that man has lost his mind and it's the most obvious thing anybody's
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.840]  ever seen yes just like the president trumps lost his mind and doesn't know what he's doing that's
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:35.960]  why he's got massive tax cuts north korea came to the table giant stock market millions of new
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:42.120]  jobs incredible all these giant bonuses oh it's so horrible best black unemployment ever

[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:45.560]  thousand times and we've seen them in history so he's the litter and he said literal literal
[02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:50.440]  demon spawn of the pit of hell and he said right before that before my heavenly father so i'm a
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.880]  christian and what is he right and then he talks about he runs your kids he runs the schools that's
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:00.840]  super weird i don't know what that means but earlier i said he art type of the media i said
[02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:06.120]  this is the art type this is the poster boy for the enemy for the globalist clear it lying to his
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:12.680]  audience showing a selective clip to deceive his prey remember the women are subhuman it's his
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:18.440]  it's his him i'm women are incredible women are better than me women are subhuman here here you
[02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:24.520]  he runs the banks yeah why would brian stelter who's a journalist run the banks the second
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:31.720]  time the banks according to our structure extreme right wing ideology the jews brian stelter
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:36.280]  stelter so he said he looks like michael wolf now why are you talking about how he looks like
[02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:41.160]  michael wolf right and he says you're the enemy you're devil worshiping phil's these are the most
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:45.960]  common stereotypes there is now i looked it up because i don't know okay i don't i don't think
[02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:51.160]  about those things right and turns out brian stelter is not jewish she was well raised
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:57.720]  methodist he he married someone who's jewish but does alishone know that no okay my guess is he thought
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:04.520]  those guys right and so oh oh those guys the islamists you want to take over israel and the
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:10.200]  george soros wants to overthrow and then we're not for blowing up israel oh oh but see you can
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:17.240]  just portend everything now and you understand when you are the islamist oh you act like you

[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:25.800]  in a second and they're the enemy you know they want to get us christians and his group is the
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:32.280]  young turks that killed over a million and a half christians by the way we're brown
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:37.080]  and they're great people just like the turkish people but an evil ideology let's continue
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:45.400]  okay my guess is he thought those guys right and so so you we're gonna get more here in a second
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:50.040]  and there's going to be more stereotypes more of these tropes that you've seen in history

[02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:00.440]  brand of strike on opro 2020 and the fact that she's part of the rockefeller eugenics operation is not
[02:54:00.440 --> 02:54:05.000]  going to bode too well for her wait till the black voters find out that she's running a depopulation
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:10.600]  operation in africa you know me the evil white supremacist trying to keep the black folks from
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:14.680]  getting aborted and everything else it's not because i'm a savior or anything i just you know
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:20.280]  anything i do to somebody else is going to come back on it so even though i might not like what
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:25.960]  some groups are doing in general or hating me or whatever i can't get on the level plus some
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:31.160]  our biggest fans are black folks some of the most woke people hispanics predominantly on the street all
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:36.520]  over the country are bigger fans than white people our biggest problem is all these little snot nose
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:42.120]  white people i tell you i don't mean that in a racist way i just mean it this is it so it is who's
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:47.480]  running a lot of it it's all about control though because they understand it's a way to manipulate
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:53.000]  it and so many people don't want to produce they want to just manipulate now there's a bunch of
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.680]  clips i haven't gotten to they got me a lot of good clips today and i've been a bad bad boy and
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:02.760]  jack wasovic's coming up and we should play a lot of these clips today i did play some of it though
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:13.640]  but uh we're to begin wolf police book will take down the president why don't we play that i mean
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:21.560]  again talk about the arrogance of these people he puts out this shoddy fable that he admits
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:25.240]  almost all of it he doesn't know if it's true or not he doesn't know if he quoted people right
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:31.000]  steven badan of course five days after comes out and says i'm sorry never denies the quotes just says
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:38.040]  i'm sorry i'm sorry that my blow didn't work i'm sorry i was an egomaniac i'm sorry that i
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:45.000]  brought the wolf into the white house i'm sorry i did that but doesn't matter wolf still thinks he
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:50.360]  perched up there in mainstream media that he will rule the day he thinks it's the old days back
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:55.000]  when he was still prey on people as a famous yellow journalist but those days are coming to an end
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:00.520]  they're already over and the wolves of the world though they celebrate each new lie they launch
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:09.240]  each new lie falls on deffer and deffer ears the future is ours the future is solved
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:15.800]  if we simply embrace god's plan and be good decent honorable people it doesn't mean going to church
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:20.360]  and telling people how good you are and listen to some little glitterbug preacher up there
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:25.800]  but it really does mean not being a scumbag and not being jealous of people for no reason
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:31.880]  and not trying to scam people and treating people like you want to be treated that's what it really
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:38.200]  comes down to but it just shows the delusion of the sinking young turds and mainstream media and
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:43.160]  their whole broke back system we're rising despite all the censorship they're falling
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:48.120]  no one's reporting on them they're reporting on us they're not having congressional hearings about
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:54.040]  them they're having about us because we carry the light in the dark of the night and we're
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:59.400]  willing to execute and not give up and not give in and not falter and not waver and not
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:07.640]  cower because i'll live on my feet even if i die on my feet then licking your
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:16.520]  big fat islamic rear end and the poor muslims are the biggest slaves of it all but there's
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:22.520]  always controller bees that's why the left and islam are merging so well uh that are in control
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:28.440]  and and and it's just sickening uh i've got this clip we're going to come back and play here in a
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:34.680]  minute wolf believes book will take down the president no it'll be just on time when you're
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:40.200]  rushing a blue out comes your new attack and now the president's going to have the fake news awards
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:45.960]  the 17th it's you got so exciting and so huge and so amazing and literally uh they're so triggered
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:50.920]  by the down he wants to up the production value and just have an extravaganza and they're going to
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:56.200]  convulse and flip out and have oprah say how dare you attack our media why it's fascism to not take
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:01.800]  the lies you've got to take it you can't fight back censorship is having your own speech liberalism
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:08.680]  means you have no speech and harvey weinstein's gets licked on that's right it's on twitter real
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:15.000]  all it's shown it's a mainstream photo it's real Oprah Winfrey and her lust her ravenous lust to
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:21.800]  lick the flakes of dandruff out of harvey weinstein's big giant ugly ears introducing cell force by
[02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:28.600]  info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:34.920]  over 95 percent of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:40.840]  cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when
[02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:45.800]  your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency then they start producing reactive
[02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:52.600]  oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:59.160]  from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful
[02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:04.600]  available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these

[02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:42.280]  nine well i won't back down no i won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell
[02:59:42.280 --> 02:59:51.400]  but i won't back down gonna stand my grind all right jack wassup it's taken over in this fourth
[02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:57.320]  hour today great journalist researcher firebrand i'm gonna host a little bit of this segment
[02:59:57.320 --> 03:00:02.200]  when there's a few clips i haven't got too and i want to get his his take on things uh but first
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:08.520]  off let's play this clip of wolf michael wolf believes book will take down the president
[03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:15.080]  like all the other i'm sorry to use a gross analogy but have you ever been to the zoo and monkeys
[03:00:15.080 --> 03:00:19.480]  are literally crapping and throwing it at you and the whole russia gate thing didn't work and all
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:24.760]  the other oh trump's not real he's not going to deliver that didn't work and so now michael wolf
[03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:30.680]  has reached back there and gotten a big old you know what and he's throwing that uh and he's
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:34.520]  finger painting with it on the walls and he thinks he's really done something pretty but i think all
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.040]  the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to put this back together again and been
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:43.640]  proven to be a total fraud but to see how this is the best they've got and to see steed man trying
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:50.440]  to apologize now uh it's it's just a true greek tragedy uh let's go ahead and play that clip of
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:01:01.240]  wolfie you know i think one of the interesting effects of the book so far is a very clear emperor
[03:01:01.240 --> 03:01:09.240]  has no clothes effect that the story that i've told seems to present this presidency in such a way
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:18.280]  that it says he can't do this job the emperor has no clothes and suddenly everywhere people are going
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:27.320]  oh my god it's true he has no clothes that's the background to the perception and the understanding
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:35.640]  that will finally end this that will end this this this presidency okay this is the known
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:40.920]  yellow journalist charlatan i mean he's like one of the big names in in in disinfo and fake quotes
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:46.920]  and lies he won't even stand by the book he says trump in earlier interviews you know is the most
[03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:52.840]  the dishonest person ever but that he fulfills all of his big pledges tax cuts trying to secure the
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:59.400]  border massive new jobs killing tpp i'm not going to list it all record low black unemployment record
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:06.520]  low unemployment record new factory small business startups record stock market and this guy just said
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:13.640]  he's the emperor has no clothes good lord it's like saying led has no atomic weight but but the air
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:20.040]  does i mean this guy is empty air trump if he fell on top of he's like an anvil with wiley coyote falls
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:26.040]  on your head i mean it's hit him right between the eyes they are the broke back mainstream media
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:31.080]  and then he just says this is the catalyst this will bring down the emperor that has no clothes
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:37.880]  he's meanwhile the the trump knows his destiny is tied to delivering and he is delivering jack
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:44.680]  besovik great to be back alex thanks for having me on again one thing i would really say about
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:49.480]  his book in fact two major points i take away from how this book is being spun so first michael
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:54.360]  wolf the fact that he's saying my book is designed to end a presidency there are never books written
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:58.600]  about barack obama like this there are never books really written about george w bush like this
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:03.720]  as much as the left hated him what really what they're trying to do is to further that doubt to
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:09.720]  further that deceit that trump's presidency needs to be ended it's a normalization of what's what
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.840]  they're looking for in terms of an impeachment process or possibly the 25th amendment i think
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:20.360]  what molt what wolf is more directly referring to is actually more of this 25th amendment push
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:24.520]  that we've started to hear being talked about now that's the one that has to do with uh the president
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:30.280]  being unfit for office and having to do with this these mental instability attacks that we're now
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:33.960]  seeing from all throughout the mainstream media and all throughout people that are reading this
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:39.560]  book saying oh trump doesn't come out of the uh the executive residence until 11 o'clock that
[03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:43.480]  trump doesn't know what he's doing he's just firing off tv he's watching a gorilla channel
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:48.920]  which of course turned out to be fake but people thought was real this is their new line of attack
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:53.800]  on the president they're saying he's not mentally stable enough to do that president of course responding
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:58.200]  saying that he was a top business man then a television star then president of the united
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:01.880]  states on his first try it doesn't exactly sound like someone who's mentally unstable
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:06.520]  but also the 25th amendment here's the thing they would need to get the president's cabinet
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:10.360]  and the vice president all to vote on this that doesn't go through congress and roger's
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:15.240]  house broke back in march april and may that they were planning this from newspaper editors he talked
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:20.040]  to they said the next thing will be 25th amendment mental instability but but you know a lot of
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:24.600]  people ask me they say are you funded by some big group and i go no i'm part of the super deep state
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:29.560]  that's the american people american of the silent majority that's coming back even though you were
[03:04:29.560 --> 03:04:33.640]  enable intelligence you weren't involved in the trump campaign via naval intelligence you were
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:39.240]  involved as a citizens but the whole point is we're awake now and no amount of their remnant
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:44.040]  criminal groups in the government which is the deep state the corrupt deep state are going to
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:51.240]  defeat the real deep state that is texas and uh you know new york and alabama and indiana and
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:56.520]  oklahoma and all the other states and on the people and folks that are awake now understanding
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:05:01.720]  what's happened and seeing prosperity come back i mean i we still have a lot of problems they still
[03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:06.680]  want to kill the president but jack looking at the prosperity look at trump delivering look at them
[03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:12.200]  lying in gallant polls and others taking 1015 points out over sampling democrats despite that
[03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:18.520]  he's 45 46 47 points that means he's like 55 60 points that's why they're really panicking
[03:05:18.520 --> 03:05:25.240]  and i saw oprah hollywood looks so desperate they look so pathetic i mean they are just
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:32.360]  they're apoplectic what are they going to do next alex they're clearly positioning oprah
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:39.000]  uh for some sort of a queenmaker role for 2020 i don't actually currently buy the talk that they
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:44.840]  want her to run or that she will run of course we saw this uh this nbc report uh tweet last night
[03:05:44.840 --> 03:05:50.920]  here's the queenmaker for elizabeth warren or i guess this is breaking now i'm saying that that he
[03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:56.280]  wants to run and uh brian uh i don't know what his sources are but i actually don't think winfrey runs
[03:05:56.280 --> 03:06:00.840]  i think they're going to position her to endorse one of their already anointed candidates i think
[03:06:00.840 --> 03:06:05.320]  they're going to use her to endorse someone like a kamala harris or an elizabeth warren
[03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:09.640]  or possibly involved even with even with mark cuban i keep hearing his name bandied about
[03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:14.440]  i don't think oprah runs because of two things one number one she doesn't need it she's already
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:19.960]  got all the money in the world she's already got all the accolades and she knows that the people that
[03:06:19.960 --> 03:06:24.280]  reach her are going to bring out the questions about what her activities her schools and her
[03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:29.000]  operations in africa what's going on over there and her ties her deep ties to harvey winestein
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:33.320]  that was my next question and we have my audio turned down to you what about all the skeletons
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:38.520]  in her closet and is she positioning also maybe for michelle obama they've been talking about joe
[03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:44.680]  obama yeah michelle obama would be another one that would potentially work out i mean you can
[03:06:44.680 --> 03:06:48.520]  you could just see them they i believe they've actually done events together in the past i'd
[03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:52.920]  have to look that up very quickly but i know she of course she endorsed obama 2008 that carried a
[03:06:52.920 --> 03:06:57.960]  lot of weight with the democrat primaries uh her and michelle it would be a natural pair for them to
[03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:03.320]  come out for them to run out and the democrats would absolutely love it we've also seen a lot
[03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:08.280]  if we remember the alabama race one of the big takeaways from the special election was the media
[03:07:08.280 --> 03:07:14.120]  talking about the power of black women the ability of black women to swing any race and they repeated
[03:07:14.120 --> 03:07:18.760]  that over and over and over that narrative and that's the beta test for the next big run exactly
[03:07:19.560 --> 03:07:24.280]  correct so they're they're primarily called it's called pre-selling uh it's called pre-selling or
[03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:29.080]  robert schildini wrote a book on it called pre-suasion it's it's putting your audience into a mode
[03:07:29.080 --> 03:07:33.400]  or into a sense in this case the democrat primary voters to say this is the type of person that you
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:37.640]  want this is the type of person that we need this is the type of person that we ought to have uh
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:42.040]  there's even there's even democrats out there running that say we shouldn't even think about
[03:07:42.040 --> 03:07:46.760]  electing or nominating someone who isn't a black woman or a minority woman in some way which
[03:07:46.760 --> 03:07:51.080]  honestly to me uh sparks a lot of interest to say why don't we just vote for the you know the
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:55.240]  qualified candidate but we know that at this point the democrats have forgotten about all of that
[03:07:55.240 --> 03:07:59.880]  they're only caring about identity politics they're trying to check boxes off so they had the first
[03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:03.000]  black president then they tried to have the first woman president that's right they're only going to
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:07.800]  try to have the first black woman the opposite of martin Luther king total identity-based politics
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:11.240]  all right we're going to go to break and jack was up is going to take over the rest of transmission

[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:33.880]  as the left and the media work together to try to push president trump out of office now talking
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:38.760]  about who's going to be running against him will it be oprah winfrey will it be one of the democrat
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:45.720]  successors michelle obama joe biden will it be some other billionaire like mark cuban let's
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:51.160]  all break everything down let's see what's going on there's a ton of news today and so i want to
[03:14:51.160 --> 03:14:57.080]  get right to it but one story that really jumped my attention late last night as i was doing my
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:01.400]  research doing my show prep knowing that i was going to be coming back today for hosting fourth
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:08.600]  hour was this story out of dallas texas huge story huge news and of course the mainstream media
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:13.240]  is completely silent on it well we've got the fbi federal bureau of investigation
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:18.840]  for once they're not investigating trump what who they're actually investigating is these far
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:24.200]  left domestic terrorist groups and they've made an arrest they've actually made an arrest of one
[03:15:24.200 --> 03:15:30.120]  of the leaders they've they see are one of the higher ups in a number of these groups operating
[03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:35.320]  in the dallas area so the fbi and we've talked about this in the past before how it's really the
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:39.960]  higher levels that have gotten into the political chicanery getting into the wiretapping of the
[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:43.640]  president whether or not they use the fice award and we can talk about that a little later in the
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:50.360]  show but at the lower levels at the field levels it's the honest fbi agents that are actually
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:58.200]  going and working to bring threats off the streets to actually go and make sure that americans are
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:05.240]  safe and person who has now just been arrested uh about a few weeks ago is this guy by the name of
[03:16:05.240 --> 03:16:11.400]  rakeen balugin uh i think the producers can get the picture up here of rakeem so he's been arrested
[03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:19.880]  on charges they said of illegal firearms illegal gun ownership now this guy has been involved in a
[03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:26.760]  number of far left militant movements and actually they were uh refer to themselves as militant
[03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:31.880]  movements right in their own statements so for other people that come around and say well these
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:36.040]  guys are just peaceful they're just protecting their second amendment rights they're actually
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:41.720]  describing themselves as militant groups they're describing themselves as militant activists uh
[03:16:41.720 --> 03:16:47.960]  militant members of a left-wing armed group that aims at uh revolution they call it revolution in
[03:16:47.960 --> 03:16:54.840]  the united states so he's a member of a number of groups one of which is called the guerrilla uh pull
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:06.200]  it up here one guerrilla one guerrilla group another one that is called the hui p law excuse me
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:11.880]  guerrilla mainframe another one which is called the hui p long gun club and here's a training video
[03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:15.240]  i'm going to play it without the audio because there's a lot of profanity in this thing but you
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:21.000]  can actually see a training video of this group this is the hui p long gun club and rakeem balugin
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:28.120]  who is training uh these these uh when they as they refer to themselves as militants revolutionaries
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:33.160]  hui p long for anyone who doesn't know he was the founder of the black panthers so these are
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:39.800]  basically uh an arm or a self-proclaimed arm of the new black panther party and they're definitely
[03:17:39.800 --> 03:17:45.720]  espousing the groups of the new black panthers they've talked about uh about operations that
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:49.400]  they'd like to perform and they've they've constantly i can't tell that might be actually
[03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:55.000]  be rakeem there addressing uh the assembled troops or that might be him standing in in line
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:01.640]  that's hard to tell from the grainy footage but he was arrested on december 11th by fbi agents
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:08.200]  on firearms charges now they these groups operate throughout the dalis area they are growing they
[03:18:08.200 --> 03:18:12.600]  have an extreme and here's their website guerrilla mainframe because i want to make sure that that
[03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:17.000]  we put this out because every time i go and do a report on one of these things here's what i do
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:20.360]  and people say jack what are your sources on these left things i just go to their websites
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:25.560]  i go to their websites and i tell you who they are and i tell you what they are saying
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:30.440]  and then the and then fake news media like newsweek or uh buzzfeed comes out and says
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:35.640]  passovic was smearing uh the these activists and he was making up all this stuff and he's
[03:18:35.640 --> 03:18:40.840]  making all these unsubstantiated claims when every time i go and focus on one of these groups
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:44.920]  and i've always tried to do that very strictly and i've always been trying to make out a big
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:49.480]  focus of my journalism i'm just going to their websites i'm going to their websites and i'm
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:54.280]  telling you what they are putting out i'm playing you videos that they have made i'm telling you
[03:18:54.280 --> 03:19:00.120]  their information so they they talk about revolutionary marxism all over their website
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:06.920]  they have weapons pictures people in you know guns and and dog tags and barbed wire all over
[03:19:06.920 --> 03:19:11.800]  the place and imagine right imagine if this were trump supporters and that was on their website
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:19.640]  uh going to firing ranges standing in paramilitary uniforms putting out propaganda videos like that
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:23.560]  people would be called and trump supporters would if this were trump supporters doing this
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:27.400]  with we know wearing maga hats this is actually how trump supporters are portrayed by
[03:19:27.400 --> 03:19:32.760]  by the left wing media this is how trump supporters are told we are told by the media that trump
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:39.080]  supporters are the militants and trump supporters are the gun toting uh political extremists out
[03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:45.400]  there when i have never seen trump supporters standing in paramilitary uniforms holding guns now
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:50.440]  again they're not necessarily breaking the law here and i want to make that clear but what these
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:55.800]  videos are to me they look like isis videos to me they look like isis recruitment videos
[03:19:55.800 --> 03:20:00.840]  or other extremist videos you might see from the middle east that is what they are attempting to
[03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:06.040]  do with this this is a recruitment video they're trying to raise people to their ranks they're
[03:20:06.040 --> 03:20:15.080]  trying to increase their ranks and as in their own words they're arming up to export and to extend
[03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:21.080]  revolutionary militant movement in the united states so they're saying that the arrest of their
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:24.760]  leader was politically motivated they're saying that he hadn't broken any laws and here's the
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:30.120]  thing with the fbi when they go to arrest someone if they go to perform a raid they can't actually
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:35.160]  arrest someone only for being the leader of a political group because after everything that
[03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:40.040]  happened in the 1970s uh after everything that was going on with a lot of these groups new
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:45.800]  legislation was passed that placed restrictions on what the fbi could do when it came to terms of
[03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:50.600]  political movements so they can't actually just go after you for your politics you have to commit
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:55.560]  a crime and so while they may place them under surveillance or they may place them under investigation
[03:20:55.560 --> 03:21:00.520]  it looks like that's what the fbi did here and we saw some indications earlier this year out of
[03:21:00.520 --> 03:21:07.560]  sessions department of justice that the fbi created a new entity of classification for investigation
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:13.640]  and on their website they described themselves as black identity extremists so black identity
[03:21:13.640 --> 03:21:20.440]  extremists is the classification the fbi may have used to surveil these this group and during that
[03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:24.440]  the course of that surveillance they may have found out that not all of their gun laws were
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:30.120]  compliant with actual stated federal law and that is for the reason for the arrest of their
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:36.840]  leader so they're currently championing to get him out again folks imagine if you will that this
[03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:41.960]  was the right wing imagine if this were trump supporters that were running around putting on
[03:21:41.960 --> 03:21:48.040]  paramilitary garb wearing sunglasses and toting rifles in parking lots of schools parking lots of
[03:21:48.040 --> 03:21:53.800]  playgrounds waving revolutionary flags okay they'd be pillared we would be told they are
[03:21:53.800 --> 03:21:58.600]  arming to take over the country they would be called extremists they would be caught there
[03:21:58.600 --> 03:22:04.280]  would be calls for their arrest and deportation but when it's the left they don't even tell you

[03:29:20.840 --> 03:29:27.720]  of the news today we were talking with alex just recently about uh steve bannon and his current
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:32.440]  situation with the white house what's going on with his relationship with the president i've
[03:29:32.440 --> 03:29:39.080]  spoken to one of my sources earlier today about steve bannon's situation i've spoken to a number
[03:29:39.080 --> 03:29:44.440]  of people over the weekend about that there were some talks about possibly patching things up there
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:50.840]  were some talks about uh basically the reason bannon put out his statement uh yesterday on
[03:29:50.840 --> 03:29:57.240]  sunday basically apologizing this statement was drafted prior to uh the right when the book came
[03:29:57.240 --> 03:30:01.720]  out bannon had a statement drafted up and said this was going to be it and he was going to get
[03:30:01.720 --> 03:30:05.560]  it out and push it and say he was sorry as it for that the whole thing happened and he was going to
[03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:12.360]  slam the book and say it was completely discredited well as it turns out that statement didn't get
[03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:16.920]  out originally um he didn't want to after the president kind of went nuclear in his own statement
[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:22.360]  then bannon decided on sunday to put it out and said all right well what's let's cause a truce
[03:30:22.360 --> 03:30:27.720]  let's put the statement out the breaking news and this is out of the hill so uh jordan fabian has the
[03:30:27.720 --> 03:30:33.960]  story it's the white house rejecting bannon's apology the white house staying in a statement
[03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:38.440]  that bannon had that they're standing by the president's comments that bannon has lost it
[03:30:38.440 --> 03:30:44.040]  that he's only in it for himself and that is this is just a way to further his own political ambitions
[03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:51.240]  and his political career uh basically saying that everything that bannon said in his apology
[03:30:51.240 --> 03:30:55.800]  doesn't matter and that they're going to be going against him period and now this is going to hurt
[03:30:55.800 --> 03:31:02.920]  bannon in terms of put trying to put together his operation for 2018 i've asked folks uh throughout
[03:31:02.920 --> 03:31:07.960]  dc what's going on with that whether his operations are going to be funded whether other people are
[03:31:07.960 --> 03:31:13.880]  trying to come out and it looks like a lot some of his funders may also be dropping if what my sources
[03:31:13.880 --> 03:31:19.320]  tell me are is correct that some of those people might be pulling out of the pack uh his essentially
[03:31:19.320 --> 03:31:24.440]  501c4 organization they was going to use a dark money organization to get involved with different
[03:31:24.440 --> 03:31:31.800]  candidates and different races around the country instead this really seems to be like the purge
[03:31:31.800 --> 03:31:38.040]  of steve bannon both politically and in terms of his stature over at bright barton news where a lot
[03:31:38.040 --> 03:31:42.840]  of people are talking about uh because of his fall from grace with the mercers who are essentially
[03:31:42.840 --> 03:31:47.720]  the main uh donors behind that organization he has fallen out of favor with them that they are
[03:31:47.720 --> 03:31:52.840]  looking at potentially removing him as chairman of bright barton news this would be a huge blow
[03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:57.960]  for bannon and and one that a lot of people are scratching their heads over because they're saying
[03:31:57.960 --> 03:32:02.600]  does this all go back to the book does this all go back to michael wolf no it did not start with
[03:32:02.600 --> 03:32:07.880]  michael wolf this did not start with just one book this is something that has been brewing for
[03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:14.200]  quite some time remember steve bannon was fired by president trump months ago actually it was in
[03:32:14.200 --> 03:32:18.760]  the aftermath of the charlotte'sville rally that steve bannon was let go from the white house that
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:24.200]  happening all the way back in august so for to say that this was just happening because of the book
[03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:30.360]  it's really not that it's more that that is just a catalyst to um to push through the
[03:32:30.360 --> 03:32:35.960]  furthering descent the furthering rift between bannon and now not only trump in the white house
[03:32:35.960 --> 03:32:42.040]  but the entire trump family uh specifically the targets of a lot of the comments in that book
[03:32:42.040 --> 03:32:48.200]  was don jr don jr then came back and beat bannon over the head with those on twitter verbally of
[03:32:48.200 --> 03:32:53.960]  course talking about uh how could he say things like that why would he say things like that
[03:32:53.960 --> 03:32:58.760]  and then later why meet with somebody who is so discredited a lot of questions and essentially
[03:32:58.760 --> 03:33:04.600]  sources were then saying that the reason that bannon didn't immediately deny any of the statements
[03:33:04.600 --> 03:33:09.000]  and the reason that he has yet to deny any of the statements that many of them may have been
[03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:14.040]  on tape and that michael wolf may actually have a recording of the statements that were made
[03:33:14.040 --> 03:33:18.840]  whether in the white house or the hey adam's hotel where wolf was staying just across the street
[03:33:18.840 --> 03:33:23.400]  there uh i've had dinner there a few times with roger stone there a number of times it is a very
[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:28.360]  nice hotel but one that is extremely expensive so i don't know exactly who is paying wolf spills
[03:33:28.360 --> 03:33:33.080]  while he was in town but someone definitely gave him access to the white house of president
[03:33:33.080 --> 03:33:37.960]  saying that it was not president trump that gave him access now this guy this guy wolf what he's
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:43.480]  done is he's saying that he's trying to take down the president but it really seems like the only
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:48.120]  person that he's taken down is steve bannon now president trump and i was going to get to the story
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:55.240]  a little bit later he's now meeting with bob corker of the of the establishment and a lot of
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:34:00.120]  people are juxtaposing this and saying that trump is now moving away from steve bannon
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:06.360]  that trump is now using this as an opening to sort of renegotiate or reinvigorate some of
[03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:12.120]  his ties with the gop establishment the fact that he has been with bob corker on air force one
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:17.080]  the fact that they've been holding events together holding discussions together is a huge indication
[03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:23.480]  that their relationship has been mended as opposed to back in last october when there was a huge war
[03:34:23.480 --> 03:34:28.600]  of wards between the two of them it seems like bob corker was about to become the next uh jeff flake
[03:34:28.600 --> 03:34:34.440]  in terms of his never trump status seemed like he was going to use his remaining time in in office
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:39.960]  he's not scheduled to run for reelection this year that in only doing to attack the president to bash
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:45.160]  the president him of course the senator from tennessee but it seems that in the wake of all
[03:34:45.160 --> 03:34:52.200]  of this that trump may be looking at his past ties with bannon and seeing as how he's been burned by
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:57.720]  it how he's been burned by that situation and is now moving back towards other folks in the
[03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:03.320]  establishment looking towards people to say you know what i may not and i can understand that from
[03:35:03.320 --> 03:35:07.560]  political standpoint because he might be saying that you know what i thought these guys were on
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.600]  my side they came to me they said they were on my team they said they stabbed me in the back
[03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:16.680]  whereas somebody like bob corker somebody like who is of course very closely aligned with jeff
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:22.760]  flake and mitch mcconnell he knows that they are gop establishment he knows where they're coming
[03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:27.880]  from and regardless of disagreements that they have and certainly there's lots to disagree
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:31.720]  with them there he knows who they are he knows where they're coming from and they're not being
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:37.160]  deceitful with the president so from that honest standpoint because again they're being open and
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:42.200]  honest about disagreeing on policies that creates a situation where at least they can start to make a
[03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:47.720]  deal and if there's anything we know about donald j trump is that we know that he likes to write
[03:35:47.720 --> 03:35:53.400]  to make deals in fact the man wrote an entire book about it's called art of the deal so that's
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:57.640]  what trump is looking to do now he's looking to make deals with the establishment it looks like
[03:35:57.640 --> 03:36:02.520]  instead of going into an all out war with the establishment it looks that he wants to have
[03:36:02.520 --> 03:36:07.320]  some kind of deal to get things going like the tax cuts bill that we got in just before the end
[03:36:07.320 --> 03:36:11.320]  of the year he's going to make a big deal out of that instead of union address coming up here pretty

[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:09.560]  actually coming to you from the heart if there is a heart of the swamp here in the dc beltway
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:16.680]  directly live from our nation's capital where president trump valiantly has established a
[03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:22.280]  beachhead in the sea of corruption amidst the corruption here in washington dc he has established
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:30.040]  a beachhead for the real deep state the real silent deep state the american people the american
[03:41:30.040 --> 03:41:35.720]  majority which swept him to power which swept him to come to excuse me to the white house
[03:41:36.520 --> 03:41:43.320]  in 2016 we are now just about one year away we're coming up we're 12 days away from the one year
[03:41:43.320 --> 03:41:49.640]  anniversary of trump's inauguration and just think about that for for a second folks remember
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:56.200]  all the doom and gloom the apocalyptic scandals we were told the tall tales the fables everything
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:42:01.800]  that was said by the left by the media that would happen if trump was uh to take office
[03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:05.000]  everything they said the stock market was going to crash they were going to say that
[03:42:05.640 --> 03:42:10.360]  racism would be rampant in the united states they said that uh war world war three was
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:14.600]  going to happen that we were going to break out into nuclear war with with russia with china with
[03:42:14.600 --> 03:42:20.760]  north korea all over the place that isis would be widespread well actually the opposites happened
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:28.120]  jobs are breaking records unemployment rates are breaking records in terms of our record low
[03:42:28.120 --> 03:42:34.200]  unemployment for african americans african america or excuse me unemployment for hispanics dropping
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:40.760]  to uh to to a point from last year all of these things that they said couldn't possibly happen
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:46.040]  they're all happening jobs coming back manufacturing jobs and see here's one thing that obama used to
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:50.280]  always talk about i do always play these games with the jobs numbers and i'm sure they're going
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:54.680]  to talk about it now because this always comes up around the one year mark or the end of the year
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:58.440]  started the new year those are jobs numbers jobs numbers as if everybody always gets into
[03:42:58.440 --> 03:43:03.240]  well one thing that the obama administration used to love to do was they would talk about seasonal
[03:43:03.240 --> 03:43:08.920]  jobs and part-time jobs and things that weren't full-time jobs and they would refer to them
[03:43:08.920 --> 03:43:13.880]  as the same types of jobs and so they would say well unemployment's low because look at all these
[03:43:13.880 --> 03:43:17.320]  jobs and look at all these jobs we created but you would go in and you'd find a lot of them
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:22.200]  were part-time jobs a lot of them were not manufacturing jobs a lot of them didn't weren't
[03:43:22.200 --> 03:43:27.720]  good-paying jobs and so when you crunch the numbers and you look at some of the numbers and
[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:34.120]  industry that's actually coming back to united states that and in terms of how much uh capital
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:39.640]  is flowing back into the united states that's why the record high stock market numbers 25,000 in the
[03:43:39.640 --> 03:43:46.680]  dow makes so much sense because that means that those companies that the big companies are now
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:52.840]  investing reinvesting their money back into the united states that is the major difference
[03:43:52.840 --> 03:43:59.160]  between the trump economy and the obama economy so to compare uh numbers and just say oh we have
[03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:03.720]  this number we have this number you're not actually telling the full story because you
[03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:09.240]  need to be qualitative not just quantitative in terms of the success story it's only been a year
[03:44:10.040 --> 03:44:15.560]  it's only been a year in that case so the fact that our president has been able to take out ices
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:20.920]  in just one year has been able to push back on the unemployment numbers has been able to bring
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:26.200]  so many businesses back in just one year to reinvigorate the stock market in just one year
[03:44:26.200 --> 03:44:31.560]  that is the real story of this presidency and you know we actually were talking about Oprah earlier
[03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:37.720]  and i played a clip i played a clip from oprah in 1988 i've got it up on my twitter account i've
[03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:42.280]  got a pin there at twitter.com backslash jack prosopic you guys can see it where it's oprah
[03:44:42.280 --> 03:44:47.480]  talking to donald trump in 1988 asking if he's going to run for president and he says he's not
[03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:52.360]  saying he's not sure but he said the reason that he would run if he meant to and i know that clip
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:56.200]  that alex has played it many times on this show and he said the reason that he wanted to run was
[03:44:56.200 --> 03:45:02.920]  that he doesn't like how our country is getting beaten by all the other countries out there how
[03:45:02.920 --> 03:45:09.800]  our companies are getting lost in the international marketplace how they're losing out to all of
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:15.320]  these international companies that come in and he was talking about japan and kawait that was such a
[03:45:15.320 --> 03:45:21.640]  big issue back at that turn of the decade going from 1980s into 1990s today you could probably
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:28.200]  say the same in terms of china right china would be a huge sort of stand-in for japan in terms of
[03:45:28.200 --> 03:45:33.240]  where they were and so oprah you know i would basically like to thank oprah in terms of this
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:38.840]  because she's given us the opportunity to show that donald trump for everything that
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:44.040]  when people want to say about him he's consistent and he's been consistent for almost 30 years
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:49.640]  or it will be 30 years this year since that clip of saying the exact same things that he would do
[03:45:49.640 --> 03:45:54.280]  if he ran for president that he would want to fix in this country and actually now that he's been
[03:45:54.280 --> 03:46:00.760]  in office getting them done well now the left and their associates in the deep state want to get him
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:05.240]  out of office and that is where the Mueller investigation comes in this things that's been
[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:11.960]  discredited from a left and right we've heard about the fbi's investigation their attempts to
[03:46:11.960 --> 03:46:19.960]  parallel reconstruct the the unmasking the wiretapping these meetings with people that have ties to
[03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:25.880]  fusion gps this dossier that was getting thrown around all over the place what the heck was going
[03:46:25.880 --> 03:46:31.720]  on what the heck is going on and what is Mueller going to make of it well now the latest is that
[03:46:31.720 --> 03:46:38.600]  Mueller's special counsel is in talks with the white house and the president's lawyers
[03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:45.720]  tie cob and jaseculo about potentially interviewing the president of the united states under oath
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:53.320]  so this would be monumental this would be huge for the left if they could make this happen this
[03:46:53.320 --> 03:46:58.760]  everyone remembers going back to 1998 the last time this happened to a sitting president bill
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:06.280]  clinton when he was put under under oath and was asked to was asked questions essentially about his
[03:47:06.280 --> 03:47:13.320]  past relationships with with women other than hillary clinton and his relationship with monica
[03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:19.720]  lawinsky that was a devastating interview for president clinton and it led to possibly the
[03:47:19.720 --> 03:47:25.400]  huge scandal that kept hillary out of office because finally after that we were able to learn
[03:47:25.400 --> 03:47:32.520]  what was going on with wanita broadrick etc so they want to put trump through the same situation
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:38.120]  they saw how that interview was devastating for bill clinton they want to put trump under that
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:42.680]  same thing because here's what it comes down to folks there's two outcomes of this number one
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:48.760]  and the most likely outcome is that they have the interview it goes on for several
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:53.960]  hours it's either live or it's not and they have nothing they find nothing they get no
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:58.440]  false statements from the president they have nothing to go on and they get absolutely nothing
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:48:02.440]  out of it keep in mind that this also would happen while hillary clinton who was under
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:08.520]  investigation was never once interviewed under oath was never put under oath and and papers to
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:13.880]  write up her exoneration in the investigation were done well before any interviews even took place
[03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:20.360]  so the fact that it's under oath though creates a possibility for them going for a perjury charge
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:25.800]  in which case they would call this a lying to an fbi or lying to a doj prosecutor because
[03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:30.360]  that's essentially where they got flin on right and they and they ask him they'll say something like
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:35.320]  oh uh you know who did you have in the meeting did you and he'll say well i had paul mattifort
[03:48:35.320 --> 03:48:40.520]  i had jared kushner and i had uh michael flin in the meeting they say okay fine and they'll say
[03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:44.040]  wait a minute was steve badden there and then afterwards he can say oh yeah you know what
[03:48:44.040 --> 03:48:47.960]  steve was there too aha well you lied because you didn't tell us that steve was there he said no i
[03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:51.720]  just forgot i didn't remember steve was at that meeting specifically and they say no it doesn't
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:55.880]  matter you lied and we have it on tape we have you and we have you and now it's perjury right
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:49:01.240]  so that's we call it process crime so they got flin on and but we're all hoping that the president
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:06.760]  of course will be able to go forward and conduct that interview not have any issues with it if he
[03:49:06.760 --> 03:49:14.600]  has to though honestly i don't see the pressing need for it because to have trump on tv for something
[03:49:14.600 --> 03:49:23.080]  where there is no evidence there is no fire there's no there there there's barely even any smoke
[03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:26.760]  the media just wants you to think that there is you know where there's smoke there's fire
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:31.800]  they want you to think there's smoke there they want you to think that there's all of this speculation
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:36.680]  going on which meet russians that those russians these uh you know some people even if they were
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:41.800]  russian they're now trying to go after avonka they want now to investigate her because she may have
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:45.720]  written in and i'm really not making this up people are going to think i'm making this up i'm
[03:49:45.720 --> 03:49:51.960]  sorry i'm not making it up they want to investigate avonka because she may have written in an elevator
[03:49:51.960 --> 03:50:00.120]  with russians and she may have said hello to them in the elevator at trump tower and this this this
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:05.320]  is the length of ridiculousness that they're going to remember this is all supposed to be about the
[03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:09.640]  president colluding with russia to win the election well they have no investigation they have no
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:15.240]  evidence of that the investigation has shown no proof despite the fact that it's been gone on for
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:21.320]  almost two years now according to james comey this thing started in mid 2016 they applied for a
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:26.680]  feiser warrant then they didn't get it they applied for it later 20 october they got it so the real
[03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:31.320]  question that i have is from euler and for anyone else on this of this trump russia conspiracy theory
[03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:36.440]  is show me the evidence if you've had them under investigation where's the evidence of any of this
[03:50:36.440 --> 03:50:40.680]  where is the evidence because you don't have any so why are you pushing forward you don't get to
[03:50:40.680 --> 03:50:45.880]  interview the president under oath if you have no evidence send a statement it never happened the
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:50.440]  president should send a letter and then he should open another investigation into iranium one which
[03:50:50.440 --> 03:50:56.760]  apparently all of these same players stersak mcabe rosinstein the rest of euler are tied into
[03:50:56.760 --> 03:51:02.040]  that's where i'm coming from on info wars thank you so much for tuning in listening to me fourth hour
