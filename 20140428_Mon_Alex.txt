[00:00.000 --> 00:11.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.100 --> 00:18.640]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.640 --> 00:35.320]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen all hell is breaking loose in Ukraine as
[00:35.320 --> 00:41.720]  pro-russian forces battle in cities across the eastern area of that nation
[00:41.720 --> 00:48.120]  with the NATO EU backed government forces who were freedom fighters a few
[00:48.120 --> 00:52.760]  months ago when they were overthrowing the elected government now anyone not
[00:52.760 --> 00:58.040]  rolling over and being enslaved by them is being called a terrorist by the US
[00:58.040 --> 01:05.280]  and European media and I've weighed things very judiciously here looking at
[01:05.280 --> 01:10.200]  it I have to say the West started the conflict because they wouldn't join the
[01:10.200 --> 01:17.000]  EU and now they're purposely trying to manipulate Russia into invading eastern
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.940]  Ukraine to protect their interests there and it is a very dangerous dangerous
[01:22.940 --> 01:27.080]  game there's a whole another facet that this haven't talked a lot about they're
[01:27.080 --> 01:31.160]  talking about Putin having secret slush funds which undoubtedly I'm sure he does
[01:31.160 --> 01:36.560]  and when they go after Swiss bank accounts in the last decade or so they're
[01:36.560 --> 01:39.760]  usually going after Nouveau reach people with five ten twenty million dollars
[01:39.760 --> 01:43.840]  sounds like a lot it's not they're leaving alone the billionaires and the
[01:43.840 --> 01:51.400]  globalist you know it came out last year that the French socialists across the
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.480]  board the most the government got caught with giant Swiss and Luxembourg and
[01:55.480 --> 02:00.480]  Bahamas accounts and that they're the ones pushing a 100 plus percent tax I'm
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.920]  not joking on the middle class to destroy any savings they had accrued over
[02:04.920 --> 02:11.140]  the years but of course they support a hundred percent tax like a hundred one
[02:11.140 --> 02:17.080]  percent because they are above the law and don't pay those taxes like EU
[02:17.080 --> 02:23.200]  bureaucrats under law don't pay EU tax it is incredible the level of open evil
[02:23.200 --> 02:29.800]  and hypocrisy they get away with and so now that they're so above the law they're
[02:29.800 --> 02:36.960]  going to go after basically other countries leaders who've been funneling
[02:36.960 --> 02:40.920]  some of the state-run company money into themselves and Putin is reportedly
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.360]  from back when he was vice president under Yeltsin owns a share of this
[02:46.360 --> 02:50.520]  particular energy company and the media tries to say you know we bet it's 40
[02:50.520 --> 02:53.960]  billion it might be a billion it might be a hundred million who knows they're
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.640]  using it as propaganda against him going we're going to take your private
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.520]  money your your getaway money your gangster money buried under the dog
[03:04.520 --> 03:11.160]  house or wherever it's at we're coming after you if you don't back off and
[03:11.160 --> 03:14.720]  join the New World Order and they had a big diplomat come out last week and say
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.840]  Putin's not joining the New World Order this looks personal this does not look
[03:19.840 --> 03:26.200]  like some deal behind the scenes where Russia and the West divide Ukraine but
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.080]  then politically act like they're fighting and get some new multi trillion
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.440]  dollar Marshall plan for Europe that's bare minimum that they want to claim
[03:34.440 --> 03:38.120]  the crisis in Europe is being caused by what's happening in Russia as a new bail
[03:38.120 --> 03:42.320]  out for the bankers a new wealth transfer to them but when you look at
[03:42.320 --> 03:46.560]  what's happening with this Putin situation and trying to get his money
[03:46.560 --> 03:54.160]  and trying to end private bank accounts globally that's a global mafia not
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.280]  letting you hide your money let's say you want to leave the US let's say you
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.720]  sell a restaurant chain you've got her car dealerships or whatever and you you
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.880]  have got 50 million dollars it's all post tax you've paid tax on it it took you
[04:07.880 --> 04:13.000]  decades to make you put it in the Swiss bank account it's after tax money and you
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.960]  leave the US well they're clawing that back saying no we retroactively want
[04:17.960 --> 04:25.240]  that money and they're really creating currency controls and that's what the
[04:25.240 --> 04:28.680]  TSA is is a currency control to go through your bags and they now admit
[04:28.680 --> 04:33.800]  that's what their job is well I don't want to live in your planet dungeon I
[04:33.800 --> 04:37.920]  don't want to live in the prison plan and that's the whole point is the
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.080]  globalist or autocratic authoritarian anti-humans who are getting rid of any
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.400]  wiggle room to get out from under their tyranny normally they wouldn't do that
[04:47.400 --> 04:50.320]  because they weren't above the law completely now when they're above the law
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.720]  welcome to tyranny because they'll get rid of every check and balance because
[04:53.720 --> 05:01.280]  they're exempt well they're right back the globalist social engineers are not
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.760]  just targeting us with propaganda they are manipulating our genetics we are
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.680]  being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our

[08:44.640 --> 08:52.400]  April 2014 I am your host Alex Jones and we're going to have Joseph Farah who
[08:52.400 --> 08:57.440]  joined us Friday he's here working on a film in Austin he's gonna be joining us
[08:57.440 --> 09:03.480]  in studio in the third hour today and that is our only guest Joseph Farah of
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.480]  worldnet daily comm and of course the western journalism center there's the
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.360]  headline irs bombshell most audacious power play yet in fact give me give me
[09:14.360 --> 09:18.880]  that story because we have another report out today on media matters run by
[09:18.880 --> 09:27.920]  the White House funded by George Soros and they are openly saying that I get
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.440]  this that of course we influence the media and of course we're trying to
[09:31.440 --> 09:38.280]  influence politics but then you've got the irs revoking tax exempt status for
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.040]  mainline libertarian conservative and christian pro-life groups saying well
[09:43.040 --> 09:46.640]  you can't have a view on anything telling pro-life groups you can't be
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.640]  anti-abortion because that's a political issue absolutely over the top
[09:52.640 --> 09:56.880]  insane number one Congress will make no law respecting an establishment of
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.440]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and then it goes into
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.320]  the freedom of the press and the right of the people to petition their
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.160]  government for redress of grievances so it's all there the right to assembly the
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.600]  right to expression the right to religion the right to a free press in
[10:11.600 --> 10:19.920]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the
[10:19.920 --> 10:26.200]  free exercise that there of or of the press or the people's right to assemble
[10:26.200 --> 10:32.520]  and petition the government for redress of grievances government has no
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.400]  jurisdiction over religion government has no jurisdiction over the press
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.400]  government has no jurisdiction over the right of assembly government has no
[10:40.400 --> 10:49.760]  jurisdiction over the right to petition it has no jurisdiction I'm gonna say that
[10:49.760 --> 10:57.560]  again you have no jurisdiction I don't care what your power grabbing FCC says I
[10:57.560 --> 11:06.640]  don't care what the power grabbing federal courts say I don't care now the
[11:06.640 --> 11:13.480]  Ukraine situation is off the charts okay it's off the charts bad the mayor of
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.640]  Krakow has been shot in the back while bicycling because he wasn't going along
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.960]  with the West there are helicopters attacking multiple cities and tanks
[11:21.960 --> 11:28.520]  explosions death people being shot at checkpoints by the supposed government
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.680]  forces and their militias and again they knew that when they started taking
[11:32.680 --> 11:40.040]  areas that were traditionally Russian Russian ethnic enclaves and removing
[11:40.040 --> 11:43.760]  those elected governments and things like that that there would be backlash
[11:43.760 --> 11:49.120]  against it so you've now got just like in Germany before Hitler came to power
[11:49.120 --> 11:56.440]  you've got the pro Russian street thugs you've got the pro EU street thugs you've
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.920]  got people whose granddaddy got killed by Stalin you got people whose granddaddy
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.160]  got killed by the Nazis and so both sides hate each other going back to
[12:05.160 --> 12:13.080]  World War two and before that and it is a disaster and the globalist are playing
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.280]  that off against each other just like they'll play one African tribe off
[12:17.280 --> 12:20.640]  against another tribe because one's Christian and one's animus or one's a
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.800]  Muslim and one's Christian or one's Catholic and or one's Protestant or
[12:24.800 --> 12:32.800]  sometimes it's just an African tribe that is just across the river and your
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.840]  great-great-granddaddy killed my great-great-granddaddy so we're gonna
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.240]  get you back that's how tribalism works and the globalist call it the great
[12:41.240 --> 12:46.280]  game they look at the different fissures using sociologists anthropologists
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.080]  Peace Corps front people CIA about half of them on average nothing against the
[12:51.080 --> 12:54.200]  so-called Peace Corps set up by Kennedy but it's a front they send in good
[12:54.200 --> 12:57.640]  well-meaning people to get everybody's trust study the tribal divisions the
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.880]  tribal beefs they then go back and write reports up and then that's given to the
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.480]  different intelligence agencies to give to private jackals corporations as
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.840]  they're known private operators political operators are known as jackals
[13:10.840 --> 13:15.480]  economic hitmen and then they send them in to play the groups off against each
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.680]  other and then act like the mediators to fix it that's why the Southern Poverty
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.640]  Law Center and ADL and different federal FBI groups have been caught
[13:25.640 --> 13:30.520]  financing the radical left groups and financing the radical white supremacist
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.160]  groups you'll have a leader of one of the white supremacist groups that's an
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.400]  actual federal agent Elohim City McVay the rest of that came out in federal
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.120]  court and the people under them running around Highland Hitler don't even know
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.600]  they're being handled by the Southern Poverty Law Center that came out in
[13:47.600 --> 13:53.160]  federal court I mean I've gone out and protested the Klan and you could take one
[13:53.160 --> 13:56.320]  look at the leader of the groups and I'll say you're a big fat federal agent
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.080]  and the guy says I'll kill you and didn't get in trouble that happened up in
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.600]  Waco there's video that the second amendment means I can kill whoever I
[14:04.600 --> 14:08.480]  want that's a fad to demonize the second amendment that ended up being in the
[14:08.480 --> 14:14.480]  newspaper the Waco paper at the time I told you how Turner was an FBI operative
[14:14.480 --> 14:19.200]  crowd he was above FBI a sign of the FBI as they quote national security asset
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.960]  and the federal court in Chicago shield what federal agency he works for CIA
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.720]  probably and by the way when Anonymous blew his cover and released all his
[14:29.720 --> 14:36.160]  info they burned him you notice that so what am I getting at here this is the
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.160]  divide in Congress it's not that the Russians are good it's not that Putin's
[14:39.160 --> 14:44.440]  good it's that the West George Soros NATO initiated this three and a half months
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.360]  ago when they didn't vote to join the EU over through the country because Russia
[14:49.360 --> 14:55.200]  was coming in with 40 plus billion dollars just here here's 40 plus billion
[14:56.200 --> 15:02.400]  NATO's gave them five billion and they decided you know what you spent five
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.600]  billion trying to overthrow us politically we're gonna take the 40 was
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.920]  it 44 billion or whatever from Vladimir and we're gonna go ahead and get out of
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.080]  debt that way and the banks for said you're not gonna get out of debt we're
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.040]  gonna take down your country and that's what they're now doing it just like
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.640]  Greece just like Spain so now in Krakow and in a bunch of other cities it is
[15:22.640 --> 15:28.480]  just asymmetrical warfare checkpoints snipers killing people the Russians
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.200]  are gonna start fighting back they've already been doing that and they are
[15:34.200 --> 15:37.960]  firing now grenade launchers at helicopters and shooting them down I
[15:37.960 --> 15:43.240]  mean it is getting crazier and crazier pro-russian forces are taking over TV
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.840]  stations is deteriorating very very quickly so I'll be breaking that down
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.720]  meanwhile while all this serious stuff's going on in the world derivatives
[15:52.720 --> 15:56.520]  market is being ready to go belly up again like in 2008 we're undoubtedly all
[15:56.520 --> 16:02.760]  the charts show it entering that same zone this time it's gonna be much bigger
[16:02.760 --> 16:12.600]  as all of this is unfolding what are we talking about yesterday afternoon I see
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.880]  on drudge and everywhere else the coverage of racist Clippers owner
[16:16.880 --> 16:22.000]  Donald Sterling quote as a Democrat and I go and I turn on the television and I
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.120]  just do it be on ESPN I go to ESPN and I see Magic Johnson talking about it and
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.080]  I agree with what Magic Johnson was saying but I just saw what he allegedly
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.120]  said I guess they were whitewashing it on ESPN while acting like they were
[16:33.120 --> 16:36.800]  going after Sterling so I thought hey don't hang out with these players you
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.920]  know it doesn't look good and you know my elite culture you know you need to be
[16:39.920 --> 16:43.760]  with me the owner whatever and I thought oh that's just more race baiting you know
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.720]  more media diversions this is all because I'm sick of all the Catholic
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.720]  against Orthodox and Ukraine and this African tribe against that I'm sick of
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.960]  the Balkanization so I came on air and I said you know I'm sick of the decadent
[16:56.960 --> 16:59.840]  sports culture I'm sick of the owners having to pay for all their stadiums
[16:59.840 --> 17:04.680]  that just everyone's degenerate I'm just sick of it until a caller called in and
[17:04.680 --> 17:07.960]  said if you listen to the whole thing so I got home last night and listen to 15
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.280]  minutes the whole tape I don't like I don't like people recording folks
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.480]  secretly I'm sick of it and then editing it so I said you know I don't like what
[17:17.480 --> 17:20.640]  he did but I don't like what she did either but then once I really heard it
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.280]  started thinking about it it is some of the most outrageous stuff I've ever
[17:24.280 --> 17:34.000]  heard I mean because this guy is a big Democrat this guy makes money off
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.120]  predominantly black basketball players it turns out he rents them a lot of their
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.440]  houses and apartments at loan sharking rates the new players aren't making that
[17:41.440 --> 17:48.160]  much money and he literally sees them as slaves and it's literally beyond ten
[17:48.160 --> 17:52.000]  times what Bundy said about you know where they better off as slaves because
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.400]  they're slaves now take out a context this guy literally says there that in
[17:59.400 --> 18:05.320]  Israel black people are lower than dogs and that I mean I listened the whole
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.480]  thing and was blown away and then realized again I say I don't believe
[18:10.480 --> 18:17.000]  mainstream media but still when you're in a hurry you you know you you hear them
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.520]  quoted you hear him play a clip of it on ESPN and you hear Magic Johnson to cry
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.960]  and they were playing the whitewash but acting like they had shown we really
[18:25.960 --> 18:30.760]  said oh honey it just doesn't look good you know I'm the owner and you know
[18:30.760 --> 18:33.440]  blah blah blah and I just don't want you dating these guys that sounded to me
[18:33.440 --> 18:38.680]  like jealousy so I'm like you know I am so sick of gold diggers recording people
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.280]  and just all the Treasury and just all the stuff that goes on and but then I
[18:43.280 --> 18:45.840]  really started thinking about it how could you be friends with these people
[18:45.840 --> 18:48.800]  that's what Magic Johnson talked about and go out to dinner and play golf with
[18:48.800 --> 18:52.700]  people and then be secretly sitting there hating them and then it all started
[18:52.700 --> 18:57.560]  clicking that's why Democrats are always saying that conservatives and
[18:57.560 --> 19:03.520]  libertarians are secretly racist folks I don't sit around secretly saying racist
[19:03.520 --> 19:10.240]  stuff I mean I might sit there every once in a while and talk about Richard
[19:10.240 --> 19:13.400]  Pryor when he would make jokes about white people and black people and you
[19:13.400 --> 19:17.600]  even feel guilty repeating a Richard Pryor joke about black people or an Eddie
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.840]  Murphy joke about you know his mom and the hamburger that had all the onions
[19:20.840 --> 19:24.880]  in it because I mean let's face it it's fun to tell redneck jokes too and I'm
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.520]  pretty I'm redneck stock if you want to say I mean it's fun to make fun of Bundy
[19:28.520 --> 19:34.160]  going but I'm not against Bundy I mean it's like I'm not racist I got one right
[19:34.160 --> 19:39.960]  here I'm bring them in the house you know I tell that it's hilarious but it's
[19:39.960 --> 19:43.920]  also very sad it's Bundy's just a hillbilly he's not racist he actually
[19:43.920 --> 19:47.760]  doesn't want to abort all the black people that's the real litmus test but
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.600]  man I heard this clip and here we are in the verge of World War 3 and we're
[19:51.600 --> 19:54.960]  talking about this but it's very interesting so I'm gonna be breaking

[24:17.960 --> 24:34.640]  so we have the mega massive banks that are basically running the planet they
[24:34.640 --> 24:40.560]  want to make us poor so they can control us obviously and they will demonize
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.440]  any group they can so they can dehumanize them demonize the Native
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.920]  Americans so you can take their land and kill them demonize the Russian
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.680]  Ukrainians so you can demonize and attack them or if it was in a Soviet time
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.240]  demonize the Western Ukrainians it's the same thing you say that your enemy
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.800]  isn't human the Japanese to humanize the Americans before they attacked us we
[25:03.800 --> 25:12.360]  then dehumanize them we dehumanize the Iraqis vice versa and that's what you
[25:12.360 --> 25:16.320]  see in the divide and conquer system is that we say the Russians aren't human
[25:16.320 --> 25:20.720]  and then they become our enemy and say we're not human and we're evil or you
[25:20.720 --> 25:27.280]  get the attitude of this racist I mean really hardcore serious racist from the
[25:27.280 --> 25:34.320]  Clippers Donald Sterling making his living off of people and then basically
[25:34.320 --> 25:38.440]  talking about them like they're not even people but this is what elites do this
[25:38.440 --> 25:44.560]  is what elitism is all about most people go join elite country clubs so in
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.960]  their town they can feel like they're better than everybody it's like cliques
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.560]  in high school instead of what does somebody stand for what does somebody
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.200]  think what art do they produce it's what religion are you where do you come
[25:58.200 --> 26:05.680]  from who was your daddy and and obviously in culture and society that's
[26:05.680 --> 26:09.760]  important to a certain level but then you get people who literally only care
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.520]  about that because it lets them be on a power trip feeling like they're better
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.800]  than somebody else when they themselves have never really accomplished anything
[26:17.800 --> 26:22.400]  and that's why these globalist elitists are the way they are most of them got
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.680]  their money out of swindles or hereditary money that has been passed down
[26:26.680 --> 26:35.280]  through their families and what's really disgusting about it is all this race
[26:35.280 --> 26:40.400]  stuff gets promotes gets promoted and gets pushed and then we have all these
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.600]  serious issues going on and we can't ever even deal with any of that because
[26:44.600 --> 26:51.040]  we're being taught to constantly just obsess over all of this but think about
[26:51.040 --> 26:57.800]  how hypocritical it is that this guy's a big democrat a big democratic donor and
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.040]  I haven't looked into his stadiums but in most cases the big basketball
[27:02.040 --> 27:05.880]  stadiums the big football stadiums and hockey stadiums and all of them baseball
[27:05.880 --> 27:12.480]  stadiums are taxpayer funded and that discriminates against everybody it's
[27:12.480 --> 27:18.960]  like the formula one owner all over the world he gets Eccleston or Eccleston
[27:18.960 --> 27:23.640]  whatever his name is he gets the multi-billion dollar tracks paid for by
[27:23.640 --> 27:32.760]  the taxpayers Austin taxpayers paid to build his formula one track and the
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.280]  guy as I've said many times just last year gave three billion dollars as a
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.560]  gift to his two daughters hey great buddy I'm not envious of your three
[27:41.560 --> 27:48.320]  billion dollars or your helicopters or your palaces or they like to hotel
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.960]  downtown and couldn't run all the room so they just bought it my issue is I don't
[27:53.960 --> 27:56.240]  want to go eat in that hotel now because I know the money goes to you and
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.400]  you're already getting my money multiple ways you're robbing it from me and
[28:00.400 --> 28:03.560]  you're robbing it from all the poor people and see that's the real
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.280]  discrimination is that I shouldn't be paying for not one but two stadiums for
[28:09.280 --> 28:14.280]  Jerry Jones and the Dallas Cowboys at a cost of two and a half billion dollars
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.200]  and you count both of them I shouldn't be paying you shouldn't be paying for the
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.840]  formula one track it's incredibly profitable I've done the math on top of
[28:23.840 --> 28:27.120]  it all being paid for of course this guy's got tens of billions of dollars
[28:27.120 --> 28:33.160]  he's had scores of tracks all over the world built for him and they use fake
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.720]  celebrity with all the mayors and locals clamoring to be in the box seats to be
[28:37.720 --> 28:44.260]  around the movie stars who come to these formula one races so we can all sit
[28:44.260 --> 28:49.560]  there and fit the bill for everything they're doing I like auto racing I like
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.840]  motorcycle racing the point is is that I'm being discriminated against so see
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.480]  that's why I hate professional sports because it's all part of the Roman
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.680]  gladiatorial diversion and then you've got a cherry on top of this totally
[29:03.680 --> 29:14.600]  disconnected billionaire and it makes me want to throw up it makes me want to
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.400]  throw up because I guarantee all these stadiums are taxpayer paid for I haven't
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.680]  looked it up yet about the Clepper Stadium I bet you money that the stadium
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.280]  there and was taxpayer paid for and so it's not just he's not just he doesn't
[29:27.280 --> 29:30.600]  just think the black players on his team are slaves they think we're all slaves
[29:30.600 --> 29:34.740]  and you know what we act like slaves I don't care what color you are stop acting
[29:34.740 --> 29:39.520]  like a slave for the scumbag globalist who are literally feeding off of us
[29:39.520 --> 29:46.080]  okay I mean quite frankly we are their slaves I mean it isn't a view of
[29:46.080 --> 29:51.560]  Sterling and people that were slaves we are we're on the March the Empire's on

[32:08.840 --> 32:14.040]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[32:14.040 --> 32:18.480]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC

[32:22.040 --> 32:25.800]  of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.800]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[32:28.800 --> 32:33.360]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the

[33:52.040 --> 33:56.880]  how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.760]  responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told
[34:01.760 --> 34:07.760]  if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror I know why
[34:07.760 --> 34:14.760]  you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there
[34:14.760 --> 34:19.400]  were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of
[34:19.400 --> 34:24.240]  your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.120]  now high chancellor Adam Sattler he promised you order he promised you
[34:29.120 --> 34:35.400]  peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to be didn't consent
[34:39.520 --> 34:46.320]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[34:46.320 --> 34:54.960]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war and if
[34:54.960 --> 35:01.240]  you just joined us it is Monday the 28th day of April 2014 and the reason I'm
[35:01.240 --> 35:04.600]  getting into the whole clippers controversy up front is that in and of
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.280]  itself all the racial division distractions divergence is a divide and
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.720]  conquer distraction but we have to analyze it to understand that and learn
[35:14.720 --> 35:21.000]  to deal with it and within what they call racism it's really just tribalism
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.560]  we see a human survival trait to demonize the tribe over the hill so that
[35:27.560 --> 35:31.880]  you can fight against them and kill them and not feel bad about what you're
[35:31.880 --> 35:37.920]  doing and that's really what all this is about and that's why you keep seeing so
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.600]  many billionaires and so many globalist including billionaires that are quote
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.600]  minorities having a bad view towards other minorities and poor white people
[35:49.600 --> 35:55.560]  or anybody else for that matter it's an elitism to demonize the people that
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.200]  you're feeding on you know we have a lot of different sources and leaks inside
[36:00.200 --> 36:04.240]  Bilderberg every year mainly from the workers at the hotels but also some
[36:04.240 --> 36:07.760]  connections to some of the people involved in and around Bilderberg I'll
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.200]  just leave it at that because not all people attending are actually bad they're
[36:12.200 --> 36:15.920]  they're playing along with it you call them double agents I guess or they have
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.320]  a conscience and we always get into the hotel about four or five days before
[36:20.320 --> 36:23.720]  it's gonna be in Copenhagen Denmark this year I'm gonna send Paul Watson
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.720]  probably some of the other crew I might even go I probably should go I just
[36:28.720 --> 36:31.520]  really want to spend time with my children quite frankly there's so much
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.560]  work to be done here with a new studio and all the things we're launching but
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.080]  we always go and talk to the people at the hotel and tell them listen they're
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.280]  gonna be super mean to you if you look them in the eyes you're gonna get fired
[36:46.280 --> 36:52.280]  they're gonna be screamed at and they're not gonna give you tips and you know
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.320]  any any documents any information anything you over here the day after
[36:58.320 --> 37:08.480]  this is over you can come meet us at the local pub at such and such and then we
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.320]  go the day after Builderburg ends and there are the people there at the pub
[37:14.320 --> 37:19.320]  or there at the shopping center there at the train station the problem is for a
[37:19.320 --> 37:25.600]  long time and this happened at the 2008 Builderburg I would go into the bar the
[37:25.600 --> 37:31.200]  Lord Wellington bar there at that particular hotel that Marriott Convention
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.160]  Center five-star hotel right next to the defense contractor complexes in
[37:37.160 --> 37:43.800]  Virginia and they would send in the head of security with plain clothes State
[37:43.800 --> 37:46.720]  Department people they look like and walk right over me while I'm eating a
[37:46.720 --> 37:51.800]  hamburger and go we hope no one steals stuff from the hotel there's been a lot
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.480]  of problems with theft you better not steal anything I'm like are you
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.000]  accusing me of stealing oh I didn't mean you I meant people better not steal
[37:59.000 --> 38:06.080]  they like to pull fire alarms and then steal vases and so I go up to go on the
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.920]  radio at midnight so I ate that hamburger about 1130 and I have people
[38:10.920 --> 38:14.640]  there with me that saw this happen and as soon as I go on George Norris coast
[38:14.640 --> 38:18.520]  to coast the fire alarm gets pulled well the New York Times made jokes about it
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.160]  and said that I thought a fire alarm was to go after me and I was basically like
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.960]  schizophrenic and they went on to say there was no black sedans no one
[38:25.960 --> 38:29.320]  meeting there and then I made it all up they wrote a New York Times article we've
[38:29.320 --> 38:33.560]  shown it on there saying there was no meeting there and I was having a full
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.800]  on total break hallucinations okay the secret service that showed up the next
[38:39.800 --> 38:45.280]  day you know the limos the helicopters the video we have of all of it it didn't
[38:45.280 --> 38:52.280]  happen talk about gaslighting so I was sitting there witnessing all this I'm
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.440]  a college in the racism in a minute
[38:55.440 --> 39:03.960]  and it clicked that they were planning to I guess steal something and then say
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.960]  I'd done it but I got out of the building and they had the police there
[39:09.960 --> 39:12.360]  and the fire trucks everything everybody had to come out and they had a
[39:12.360 --> 39:21.400]  security walks over with the goons and to my face in front of my crew he said
[39:21.400 --> 39:28.080]  F you Alex you you better watch it I'm gonna have you arrested and people say
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.240]  well I get in his face there's cops there they're trying to set me up I don't
[39:31.240 --> 39:34.600]  know how they're trying to set me up I don't think they had a security there
[39:34.600 --> 39:38.360]  was even in on all of it he looked completely freaked out he may have
[39:38.360 --> 39:42.000]  believed the State Department people and the plainclothes Marines that were
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.320]  there that I was really trying to steal something I still don't know but this is
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.720]  the kind of stuff the CIA and the State Department pulls on you he walked up
[39:52.720 --> 40:02.000]  it's going Alex but the thing is I still smoke cigarettes six seven years ago
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.760]  off and on when I got nervous I didn't smoke all the time but I went on trips
[40:04.760 --> 40:10.480]  I'd buy buy cigarettes parliaments is what I like to smoke and I was outside
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.960]  after the hamburger chain smoking cigarettes because you can't smoke in
[40:14.960 --> 40:22.560]  the room by myself I sent the guys up to get ready for the radio interview and
[40:22.560 --> 40:28.640]  to film it and I'm out there chain smoking cigarettes and they've got these
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.080]  engineers out there with their caps and their big white trucks and they're
[40:32.080 --> 40:36.040]  obviously work for the government they're all looking at me and I'm just like
[40:36.040 --> 40:39.600]  little secret agents are walking around this is like a day and a half for all
[40:39.600 --> 40:42.920]  the people arrive they're playing national anthems as the president of
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.960]  Spain arrives I mean this is what's happening 24 hours later so I'm standing
[40:47.960 --> 40:50.880]  there at the front porch where presidents are gonna be secretly arriving
[40:50.880 --> 40:54.280]  Hillary and Obama are secretly arriving in the middle of the campaign this is a
[40:54.280 --> 40:57.640]  big deal it's crawling with spooks everywhere crawling with you know
[40:57.640 --> 41:06.320]  government agents and I'm standing out there and they're going yep we're
[41:06.320 --> 41:11.800]  getting ready to run the test all right we're gonna do that in about 10 minutes
[41:11.800 --> 41:15.520]  and they're on their walkie-talkies you know 20 30 feet away from me saying
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.680]  this and I remember thinking they're gonna pull a fire alarm and kick everybody
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.600]  out of the building I mean I've been around this so much that I knew what
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.560]  they were gonna do before they did it and I don't think those guys were in on
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.240]  it either it shows departmentalization and in that hotel you it was like a
[41:31.240 --> 41:35.280]  microcosm of a whole secret state because we're all living in the same hotel
[41:35.280 --> 41:40.440]  for a few days I get up the next morning they've suddenly taken over all the
[41:40.440 --> 41:43.480]  conference rooms there's people on walkie-talkies and earpieces everywhere
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.560]  coming over saying you know we don't want you to have your camera here you
[41:49.560 --> 41:53.780]  got to get out of the hotel I would walk into the conference rooms there'd be
[41:53.780 --> 41:58.020]  piles of communication equipment with with different agencies right there
[41:58.020 --> 42:02.680]  going we've got him the satellites overhead good move in I told you no it's
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.880]  a CM 743 with the Navy if you use the Air Force system I'm telling you the
[42:07.880 --> 42:13.920]  patch is a QR 9 listen I told what do you get him out of here then I go down
[42:13.920 --> 42:18.520]  I'm buying Gatorade and cigarettes and stuff to go out for the whole hot day
[42:18.520 --> 42:21.360]  we're about to be kicked out of the hotel I'm staked out already supposed to
[42:21.360 --> 42:24.640]  be out of there at noon I'm broadcasting live out of it with cameras out the
[42:24.640 --> 42:29.440]  window as world leaders are arriving playing national anthems and I'm
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.520]  videotaping all this and I go all right that's it I'm gonna go down and see if
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.120]  I can get video of that what looks like the Spanish president it was that just
[42:37.120 --> 42:42.040]  arrived I'm gonna go down there and you know get some Gatorade stuff so I go in
[42:42.040 --> 42:51.360]  and the doors open to the office in the the gift shop and they've got piles of
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.560]  equipment again tracking and spying on world leaders and listening to their
[42:55.560 --> 43:02.040]  phones and their staff's phones every room was packed with NSA type people
[43:02.040 --> 43:07.080]  different agencies arguing with each other and so then I creep around the
[43:07.080 --> 43:11.360]  hotel some more they flip out throw me out now fast forward four more years
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.120]  every four years they come back to the US they come back to the same hotel four
[43:15.120 --> 43:19.280]  years later and you saw the video of it live feeds you heard the audio on the
[43:19.280 --> 43:29.960]  radio this is a year ago I'm there and we check in two days early they throw us
[43:29.960 --> 43:38.600]  out net right after we check in cancel our sign up and have the police there
[43:38.600 --> 43:43.880]  sticking their chest out ready for a confrontation throwing us off the hotel
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.120]  then the police start saying we're not allowed to park anywhere even try to pay
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.240]  for parking spaces then we catch him in our other hotel two miles away going in
[43:52.240 --> 43:55.840]  saying is that I have to be coming down out of the elevator right when the head
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.920]  cops going Alex Jones as people aren't giving any trouble you know you can
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.320]  throw him out of the hotel if you want there are the police trying to stop
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.080]  American media from being able to even stay in a hotel and walk the mile and
[44:09.080 --> 44:12.880]  a half or whatever it was down to the event we start paying the shuttle guy
[44:12.880 --> 44:19.360]  $20 $30 tips to drive us he goes yeah I just sit here all day so people need to
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.920]  go to the airport there's three shuttles here at this hotel here at this
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.480]  Hyatt yeah I'll take you back and forth and if I can't I'll pick you up at 5 the
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.280]  cops go to his boss they threaten to firing and then all the shuttle people
[44:31.280 --> 44:36.040]  get mad and start rebelling even more giving us rides so now I take you full
[44:36.040 --> 44:41.720]  circle the human spirit they're so mean to the people inside the Bilderberg
[44:41.720 --> 44:45.440]  group meetings that suddenly they give us all the intel suddenly they're spying
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.080]  on them for us because they're so mean to them these billionaires do not give
[44:50.080 --> 44:55.360]  people tips when they get bottles of wine or food they treat people like crap
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.480]  they yell at them constantly and they tell them that they're worthless and
[44:59.480 --> 45:07.360]  and and they do this to white waiters black waiters they don't care is my
[45:07.360 --> 45:13.120]  point about these elites and again I don't tell those stories that's of that
[45:13.120 --> 45:17.840]  good it's because I'm really going back to my memory and exactly what transpired
[45:17.840 --> 45:22.360]  there and just basically having flashbacks of it all and how it's all an
[45:22.360 --> 45:27.040]  allegory what you see at the microcosm level is also the same at the higher
[45:27.040 --> 45:34.440]  level as the old alchemists would say but it's true as above so below and at
[45:34.440 --> 45:38.880]  every level you see the same things happening that everyone could be white
[45:38.880 --> 45:42.520]  or everyone could be black people would find reasons to say they're different
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.080]  they're bad to demonize them and and dehumanize them so you can abuse them
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.520]  it's like the Star Trek episode where genetically this alien race of humanoids
[45:51.520 --> 45:56.080]  are exactly the same except one has the black on the left side of the face and
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.320]  the other has the black on the right side of the face and they've already
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.480]  killed almost all their species in wars and there's only a few of them left and
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.400]  they're still trying to kill each other even though genetically they have the
[46:09.400 --> 46:14.040]  same IQ and are basically the same people and and this is exactly what we're
[46:14.040 --> 46:17.880]  dealing with here but it doesn't mean that the racism isn't real because the
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.560]  ball's already rolling and so there's real beefs there's real tribal conflicts
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.880]  that's why you only beat real tribalism by creating a new tribe of liberty and
[46:29.880 --> 46:35.640]  renaissance and ideas and literature and art and music to admire the
[46:35.640 --> 46:41.880]  creativity of humanity to lift us up out of this but then to realize it's not
[46:41.880 --> 46:47.400]  just the old-timers who aren't really racist but are set in their ways and
[46:47.400 --> 46:53.960]  who are scared of white people are scared of black people it's not just
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.640]  people like that that are the issue that's what the media focuses on the
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.440]  issue is the real elites that are tax exempt and that live off of us and are
[47:03.440 --> 47:07.520]  enslaving all of us and who are attacking our due process and our
[47:07.520 --> 47:12.040]  checks and balances and our free speech and our ancient rights of liberty that
[47:12.040 --> 47:17.200]  were so hard fought and so hard won they are attacking all of us I don't care
[47:17.200 --> 47:23.480]  if you're an atheist a Catholic a Protestant a Buddhist a Muslim a Jew an
[47:23.480 --> 47:30.600]  animist whatever you are you are under attack by the technotronic age by the
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.160]  globalist by the technocracy in their own words you are being targeted with
[47:34.160 --> 47:39.000]  GMO that's changing your genetics towards the bad you are being targeted
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.520]  with deadly chemicals in the water on record to dump you down and reduce
[47:41.520 --> 47:48.400]  fertility they've stunned humanity just like a swordfish will you know stun
[47:48.400 --> 47:54.760]  fish and cut fish up that it wants to then you know come back and eat you've
[47:54.760 --> 47:59.560]  been basically bitten by the spider only to weaken you so you can be emaciated
[47:59.560 --> 48:04.760]  and tied up in a web to be fed on later and I'm sitting here watching all of
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.760]  this happen there is power and ratings and everything in playing along and
[48:10.760 --> 48:14.640]  playing both sides of the racial division and the religious division but in
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.720]  the end I would screw myself and my family out of a future and you out of a
[48:18.720 --> 48:22.680]  future if I didn't tell you the rules of the game how these tricks work and I
[48:22.680 --> 48:34.080]  know you know all of this but all of this gets sucked back into it at some
[48:34.080 --> 48:37.520]  point or some level when someone does us wrong because they've already got
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.720]  preconceived notions about you in a stereotype so the best thing to do is
[48:41.720 --> 48:46.520]  just forgive everybody on a day-to-day basis realize it's all manipulation and
[48:46.520 --> 48:55.360]  transcend it I mean I was making jokes just last night out with friends at
[48:55.360 --> 49:03.280]  dinner about all these old racist and how ridiculous they are laughing at them
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.640]  and I saw some politically correct people sitting next to me who were
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.040]  horrified at us that that we were the racist because to them it's a religion
[49:12.040 --> 49:16.800]  they're they're racist themselves you know they were just white people because
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.080]  they live in the race issue as well and to them the fact that they say they're
[49:21.080 --> 49:27.160]  not racist is what makes them good and so they then want to make everybody else
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.440]  racist because it's the way that they make themselves more powerful you see
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.240]  MSNBC is always invoking race and claiming everything's racist that isn't
[49:37.240 --> 49:43.400]  or that it's anti-woman to use the word bossy to expand their power to then make
[49:43.400 --> 49:48.480]  everything about not being racist or not being sexist when that's just simply a
[49:48.480 --> 49:54.800]  new form of tyranny the truth is we have to disempower all these terms we have to
[49:54.800 --> 49:59.720]  stop caring what people say about us and make it about individuals and make it
[49:59.720 --> 50:03.120]  about what people stand for and what people produce and who they are as
[50:03.120 --> 50:10.880]  individuals and laugh at the stupid racist on all sides and also disempower
[50:10.880 --> 50:15.160]  the politically correct people that are using it as a tool of social control to
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.300]  accuse you of being sexist or racist if you want to have traditional male female
[50:21.300 --> 50:25.600]  roles in your relationships or if you want to have traditional family roles

[54:14.000 --> 54:20.880]  here's another issue about tribalism and racial politics humans brains and
[54:20.880 --> 54:26.160]  their basic wiring are all the same the idea that only white people are racist
[54:26.160 --> 54:33.080]  is one of the biggest frauds of the 20th and 21st century and it's only done to
[54:33.080 --> 54:38.360]  then guilt what is seen and phrased as the dominant culture show that all the
[54:38.360 --> 54:45.080]  other quote minorities that are 97% 93% of world population people that have
[54:45.080 --> 54:51.280]  more melon in their skin or 93% of the world population so that they then think
[54:51.280 --> 54:58.160]  of overcoming being something that's only tribal and racial instead of it
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.680]  being overcoming the fact that the big megabanks for tax exempt and are taking
[55:02.680 --> 55:09.280]  over our entire infrastructure see how masterful that is that we've got rich
[55:09.280 --> 55:13.800]  sports team owners who are having everyone pay for their stadiums pay for
[55:13.800 --> 55:22.320]  security in a rigged deal and then no one's upset about that they get away
[55:22.320 --> 55:26.640]  with that but then he basically talks about black people and says they're as
[55:26.640 --> 55:34.360]  low as dogs that guy thinks everybody is low as dogs and the truth is he hates
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.240]  having to pay people money of course those those those those globalist owners
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.600]  hate their players and that's why magic Johnson everybody's freaked out because
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.920]  they hang out with these guys and go golfing with them and these predators
[55:46.920 --> 55:51.240]  are psychopaths and sociopaths and they're sitting there looking at you
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.880]  like you literally are a piece of trash and that's what's so bad about
[55:56.880 --> 56:05.360]  globalist is they have no honor ladies and gentlemen they have no honor I mean
[56:05.360 --> 56:11.240]  I would never go hang around with someone I didn't like and sit there and act
[56:11.240 --> 56:18.280]  like I was their friend I would never do that in fact if I got an issue with
[56:18.280 --> 56:23.640]  somebody I tell them about it I bring it up up front and so this is the type of
[56:23.640 --> 56:30.400]  garbage and we've now looked it up the stadium that this racist the Staple
[56:30.400 --> 56:45.240]  Center owns was 70 million dollars of public money was put into it there you
[56:45.240 --> 56:57.120]  go a total of 400 million dollars 400 million dollars 70 million of it paid
[56:57.120 --> 57:04.360]  for by taxpayers at least cost of construction 400 million and that sounds
[57:04.360 --> 57:08.280]  like not even too bad of a deal compared to Jerry Jones gets it all paid for I
[57:08.280 --> 57:12.640]  mean I every time I hear the name Jerry Jones it freaks me out my
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.280]  grandfather's name was Jerry Jones and it's just people like why don't you like
[57:17.280 --> 57:23.160]  Jerry Jones the guy literally is sticking his hand in my pocket he got
[57:23.160 --> 57:27.080]  state and and city funds for that and and that and meanwhile of an old lady
[57:27.080 --> 57:32.600]  doesn't pay her taxes they take her house and go hey pay your taxes but then

[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.240]  world government and then a story that I'm gonna play a clip of his admission
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.920]  media matters chief David Brock admits to working with media outlets on stories
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:48.800]  we have political stuff and it's tax exempt folks but you've got pro-life
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.800]  groups having their tax exemption taken by the government right now it is
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:59.560]  absolutely over the top in saying in everyone's face so we're gonna break
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.480]  that down coming up in the next segment as well I saw a report last Thursday and
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.560]  tracked it down just to a blog and I told my crew not to do a report on it and
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.600]  they all agreed that there's just no evidence of it and also the last thing
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.240]  the government would want to do would be drone strike the Bundy Ranch in cold
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:29.640]  blooded murder exposing their NDAA exposing everything they've done and
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.840]  becoming cold-blooded murderers they need to stage something to look like the
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:41.240]  heroes not the killers of a family but I continue to get calls and continue to
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.880]  get reports of that and there's so many reasons that I don't think that that's
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.280]  the case that I'm not even gonna state them here it's so asinine and I
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.200]  understand people are running around hysterically talking about that saying
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.520]  that and it just sounds like a sigh up to me and of course there won't be a drone
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:09.040]  strike and I'll be discredited I'll be the bad person for being right again now
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.760]  they could do something like have a helicopter show up in the middle of the
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.720]  night sometime and dump gasoline down the chimney they did try that at Ruby
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.920]  Ridge but they would just say a fire happened and then they would know that
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:30.040]  the libertarian right wing would know it was an attack and would then go out and
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.560]  maybe retaliate and the feds would say we didn't do anything maybe maybe maybe
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.960]  that's the only way because I've known them to do that at Ruby Ridge they had
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:44.280]  the helicopter caught on video by news crew that had a bladder of gasoline they
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:50.760]  were going to dump it down the chimney and burn the place down so indeed that
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:59.400]  is a long time governmental operation is to burn people out so I would give it
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.720]  one chance out of 20 and it would not be a drone strike because they would not
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.120]  use assets like that where there'd be a chain and a report they'd use private
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:15.720]  contractors with a helicopter low coming in fast and then dumping gasoline
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.600]  over the house and because they've got so many people there with cameras that
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.360]  wouldn't happen there is in fact I gotta say one chance in a hundred maybe I
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.240]  just it's a side issue and I'm not mad at anybody that's putting that out I'm
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.720]  not judging you I'm allowed to have my opinion that I think that's the kind of
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.040]  stuff that the establishment would put out there to create hysteria and to kind
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.480]  of rehype things and to create kind of a paramilitary paranoia out there and I
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.800]  think it leads towards cooler minds not prevailing so that's my bottom line on
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.600]  report holder authorizes drone strike on Bundy Ranch
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.880]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world

[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:27.440]  well I don't have to tell you that the ukraine situation is deteriorating with
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.840]  Russian paramilitary engaging an asymmetrical warfare in different areas
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.840]  you've got the ukrainian western back is definitely starting it both sides have
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.400]  the room problems obviously and that's deteriorating very quickly I'm gonna
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.120]  break down the latest on that at the bottom of the hour I want to open the
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.480]  phones up and get into free speech first and the fact that there was an
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:56.840]  attempt to extinct free speech right now taking place across the board not
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.480]  just here but worldwide attacks on the internet attacks on Christian churches
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:07.280]  that our government's turning a blind eye to in China attacks on tax exemption
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.880]  of libertarian conservative Christian groups taking the authorizations away
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.760]  from pro-life groups saying you can't be pro-life because that's political it's
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.200]  incredible and we have an article that's up on info wars calm and we have some
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.480]  video as well media matters chief David Brock admits to working with media
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.200]  outlets on stories CNN Gateway pundit has a CNN video we have a what is it a
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:41.080]  Fox video we're gonna play them talking about that but the issue here isn't that
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.760]  a White House directed George Sorrell's funded group is telling media what to
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.200]  write and what to do and putting out the talking points it's that they're
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:56.000]  involved politically directly for the White House and their tax exempt that is
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.360]  unprecedented that's like let's not exaggerate 200 times worse than the
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.800]  Patrick Henry Center run by a former FBI agent that exposed Clinton
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:14.080]  corruption promoting patriotic ideas and criticizing policies of Obama and so
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.080]  they take away his tax exemption imagine you criticize Obama they take away your
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:26.640]  tax exemption Patrick Henry would criticize Obama Patrick Henry is the opposite
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.240]  of somebody like Obama they take away that tax exemption but a group run by the
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.800]  White House on record funded by George Sorrell's is tax exempt you understand
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:44.600]  that and it just shows how they're above the law the Democrats are getting rid of
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.440]  the Republicans the Democrats are getting rid of their competition if the
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.200]  Republicans were doing this I would be for the Democrats we want at least two
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.120]  parties we need three or four in this country the party system is destroying
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.800]  this nation but you have the libertarians trying to take it over trying to fix
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.200]  the Republican Party if there was a big libertarian strain of the Democrats I'd
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.080]  be for them we need to prop up the libertarian takeover and not let the
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:26.720]  White House politically persecute across the board any political opposition
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.800]  they can't beat us politically with all their race labels and all the rest of
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.060]  the garbage so they're going to go to censoring us and that's what the White
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:43.640]  House memos from 93 94 95 show me media bypass might have had a hundred thousand
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:50.240]  subscribers back then I wrote for them in 96 in 95 the White House was talking
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.400]  about how could they shut them down they were scared of people reading about
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.000]  basic stuff if you read media bypass articles from back then today you would
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.640]  think this is a mainline libertarian site isn't hardcore enough they got
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.160]  audited they got visited by the government they got harassed they got all
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.800]  sorts of horrible stuff we should get the head of media bypass on they were out
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:23.680]  of Dallas and it is just simply incredible the hell that that those type
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.040]  of publications went through I mean folks they tried to put Joe Bannister a
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:32.000]  treasury agent who went public about it all being a scam and a fraud in jail for
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.560]  his free speech and the jury found him not guilty so that's what I'm saying
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:46.120]  they're authoritarians even if I disagreed with the groups that media
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.880]  matters is targeting I would be against media matters targeting them three years
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.400]  ago it came out in Politico and they hit it in plain view like it was a good
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.800]  idea
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:06.640]  Politico basically wrote an article
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.320]  they basically wrote an article saying hey yeah their plan their memo is to
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.040]  infiltrate alternative media and conservative media and destroy it from
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.440]  within it was like a racketeering document of what an intelligence agency
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.080]  would do it was not a document about we're gonna go out and fight our
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.480]  political enemies it was we're gonna go out and infiltrate and get hired and get
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:39.240]  into their organizations and who are they targeting they're targeting yours
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.600]  truly Matt drudge world net daily but they're also targeting Fox News and Fox
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.760]  News is establishment but it doesn't matter they've now gotten down to the end
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.400]  game where they want to get rid of the vestigial alternative old conservative
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.960]  movement that's now to be completely destroyed and if people go along with
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:12.400]  this it will be that's what it comes down to and I just cannot state how big
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.800]  a deal this is how horrible this is how serious this is how over the top this
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:31.400]  is because this is open Soviet slash fascist communist authoritarian whatever
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.240]  you want to call it this is the stuff of authoritarianism they're only one step
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.840]  away after this of a of just arresting everybody they're already charging
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:45.040]  Republican congressmen and governors and people this former FBI agent who they
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.480]  have indicted today in New York where the governor has said no Republicans are
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.000]  welcome in this state Cuomo total gangster I went and looked at the
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.040]  indictment this morning they say before he even ran for office he sold his
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:06.520]  interest in a restaurant a health food restaurant and that his buddy later
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.400]  gave him campaign money got friends and family to give ten thousand dollars
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.320]  that's nothing they've indicted congressman grim and I'm not saying
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:24.440]  grim's perfect but the point is compared to the real criminals he's nothing
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.320]  people say well he threatened to you know basically kicker reporters but well
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.840]  that's what real people do real people get mad real people get sick of being
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.400]  pushed around and again I'm not endorsing grim the point is his lawyer
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.200]  says this is clearly part of political witch hunt and persecution and that's
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:48.920]  what it is last year the federal government repealed the law banning
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.520]  lies and propaganda I want to go to this media matters piece breaking it down
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:02.600]  and this itself from Fox is a whitewash this is so criminal now Obama's
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:14.960]  political star is falling and falling fast and they think if they don't keep
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.720]  power they're never gonna be in power again and they've done so much for the
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.560]  globalists the globalists are backing them and they mean for the Democratic
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.240]  Party and Barack Obama to be the closing pitcher in the ninth inning and they
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.600]  mean to shut the door in America forever that's why all the neocons have lined up
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.560]  and said we'll do whatever you say and arrest anybody that protests and free
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.400]  speech zones are good and Bundy's a terrorist and everybody's racist and
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.080]  Alex wants a violent overthrow because you're finding out who everybody is
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:48.920]  right now because I'm telling you I'm seeing all the signs that the
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.920]  establishment is intending to stage false flag terror blame the true
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.480]  libertarian conservative movement and try to shut down the internet as we know
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.400]  it bring out the new internet the new net neutrality systems start persecuting
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.800]  everyone and then they know a physical civil war will start and they want that
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.400]  to happen because then that will be the distraction for the economic
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:17.880]  implosion and they will blame the economic implosion on that so I'm
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:25.400]  gonna go out to break with this media matters piece and you can take away
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.440]  from it what you will then I'm gonna come back and open the phones up for
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:32.840]  first-time callers on Ukraine on the First Amendment on everything that's
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.400]  happening on this clipper situation you know at first I was like they want to
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.240]  violate free speech and and he can't own a team soon they'll say if they accuse
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.560]  you of being racist you can't have a job or own a company but quite frankly I
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.280]  don't see how he can continue to own the team when he said the things he said
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.160]  because I hadn't seen the full quotes until last night so I'd like to get your
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:03.680]  take on that 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 will take you out to break with media
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:09.600]  matters for years we've been telling you about this this organization based
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.040]  down in Washington DC called media matters their intent is to destroy Fox
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.040]  News among other things clearly they've got a political agenda what's
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.720]  interesting is it was about a week or two ago Cheryl Ackerson who for years
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:28.280]  worked at CBS she said on one of the chat shows she said the media matters had
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:33.920]  actually contacted her and helped her produce some of her segments on CBS
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.640]  which is extraordinary for CBS to be taking the stuff for propaganda from
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:45.280]  this so way lefty outfit media matters founder David Brock was on CNN yesterday
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.000]  was asked about whether or not they do indeed work with media outlets here's
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.200]  what he had to say so what you're saying that you have a diverse number of
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.800]  donors but they all have the same interest don't they same liberal politics
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:03.040]  at heart sure I mean I think their interest is in honest journalism and
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.400]  a fair debate and I think we think and I think our donors believe that in the
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.800]  vast majority of cases if people get accurate information rather than
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.920]  misinformation that's going to serve the progressive cause sure and we're open
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.240]  about the fact that we are a liberal organization that doesn't mean our facts
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.440]  are wrong so they do coordinate and get the information to mainstream media
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.400]  outlets right and I remember a Daily Caller story a year or two ago that said
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.360]  they also coordinated with the White House I you know I really think that you
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.560]  know given the fact that Cheryl Ackerson has said that she she worked with media
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.120]  matters CBS really should come out and tell us how many stories on CBS's air
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.960]  and NBC and ABC did media matters have their political fingerprints on that
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.680]  would be fair go through one by one because she just said they quote did
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.200]  try to help me produce my stories at some point where that point begins it
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:03.000]  ends and keep in mind also and more people are discovering the incredible

[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:19.080]  to the very best part at the end of that clip from Fox News far left Soros
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:26.520]  funded media matters helped produce CBS news reports folks they run it they run
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:32.560]  it and who do they hate yours truly and now you see more and more libertarian
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:39.160]  talk show host and attacking this show with their talking points and I guess
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.080]  Benedict Arnold is joined the King George III aka media matters in the White
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:51.000]  House let's go ahead and go to that last 30 seconds where he talks about the
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.160]  persecution I you know I really think that you know given the fact that
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.880]  Cheryl Akison has said that she she worked with media matters CBS really
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:07.960]  should come out and tell us how many stories on CBS's air and NBC and ABC did
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.800]  media matters have their political fingerprints I think that that would be
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.840]  fair go through one by one because she just said they quote did try to help me
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.360]  produce my stories at some point where that point begins it ends
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.680]  America deserves sure and keep in mind also media matters gets tax exempt
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.600]  status to try to run us out of business interesting they say they're a watch
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.680]  dog they're really an attack dog just saying and by the way what he said is a
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.160]  hundred percent true if you were watching that doesn't probably doesn't know three
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.920]  years ago the memo came out that said we're going to infiltrate any media that
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.240]  doesn't agree with us from inside and destroy them so we have to ask people
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.360]  when they come to work here and have them sign an NDAA do you work for the
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.520]  White House or media matters and obviously somebody could lie but it's
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:07.480]  frightening to know we're dealing with that type of stuff see you don't have
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.140]  people sign a non-disclosure agreement so they don't disclose bad stuff you're
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:15.480]  doing you have people sign an NDAA because they will get people in your
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.800]  organization and then they will use the fact they've been your organization for
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.520]  credibility sake to then claim that you've done something wrong or to tape
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.000]  things and then edit it to then claim that I mean this is serious business
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:37.040]  folks and it's a big deal and so I want to know from you the listeners are they
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.640]  going to get in trouble because if they can ship guns into Mexico when the memo
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.600]  comes out to blame the second amendment a false flag if they can steal 500
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.840]  million for Cylindra and then put it back into campaign money for themselves if
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:53.640]  they can arrest Republican members of the House and indict them and indict and
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:59.440]  arrest filmmakers and Esha Susan and indict governors they can come after
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.600]  everybody I mean it's every week now they're indicted some Republican leader
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.360]  and it's a Justice Department that is so corrupt I mean if Bush had his Justice
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.760]  Department indicted a bunch of Democrats I would have been freaking out even if
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.840]  the Democrats weren't perfect it's clearly political persecution and I've
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.160]  been looking at these Republicans are going after these people are clean for
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.320]  politics sake you know I've had friends and stuff
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.200]  Steve Lane my friend up in Tennessee looking to run for Congress but he's
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.640]  got an exploratory committee has to raise enough money to do it he's a great
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.920]  contractor you know building contractor he's an engineer teaches college he
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.000]  co-hosted TV shows with me a few years I know he's a great guy I know his family
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.080]  and he said hey will you give me a $3,000 donation the maximum amount from
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.480]  exploratory committee and I just said you know I yeah I'll give that to you and
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.200]  then I I said but I got to talk to a campaign finance lawyer and I'm gonna
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:05.440]  have my lawyer sit there with me when I give the money because hell they'll
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.920]  arrest me for totally legal money and so now he's been asking me saying hey
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.080]  Alex where's the $3,000 I need that and I'm just like wow I've been chilled it's
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.760]  not even that I'm just so busy and the campaign finance laws are so vague
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.640]  ladies and gentlemen I mean if you're George Soros you can run around and
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.440]  spend billions of dollars in the last 20 years funding anti-gun anti-free
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.960]  speech initiatives funding the overthrow of governments you can be a
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.640]  Nazi collaborator you know I love the fact that he's Jewish and is a famous
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:41.400]  living Nazi collaborator I mean they arrest people in Germany old 90 year old
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:50.280]  men for much less but then George Soros is a real Nazi collaborator the real
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:57.160]  deal and so he gets 80 yellow wards it's just crazy if you're an insider you
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.520]  can do whatever you want billions of dollars to manipulate the political
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.200]  process and I ran for Congress for one week not Congress state rep because
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.800]  people convinced me of it as a Republican and I went with the lawyers
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.880]  and checked all the laws and I said you mean if I follow the book they could
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.520]  still indict me later and they said yeah but you're just running for the state
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.800]  so the feds probably won't come after you but the laws are written to where
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.880]  there's no way to follow them and I said that's it I'm dropping out here's the
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.800]  $10,000 whatever I've raised back to the donors little old ladies I'm not
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:40.360]  running because there's no way to run and not to commit a crime and now they've
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:45.440]  done a chilling effect across the board this is so criminal and if they get away
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.000]  with this it's over this is a authoritarian takeover we're on the

[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.800]  authoritarian attack group how they're coordinating the press and and putting
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.160]  out fake news stories while trying to destroy the alternative media that
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.360]  Kurt Nemo's doing a story that shows the head of media matters admitting it on
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:54.400]  CNN this weekend and then Fox responding so we're gonna both those posted in the
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.640]  article that Kurt Nemo's doing it's gonna be a very important article at
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:03.480]  info wars.com very important to get that out there buddy you know because I don't
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:08.480]  want to just cover this in a vacuum hey the White House run George Soros media
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.120]  matters works with the media on stories and then have David Brock sit there and
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:20.960]  hide it in plain view on CNN like yeah we hope with some stories while the very
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.800]  same White House and Justice Department persecutes people for their free speech
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.840]  Hertz articles gonna point out they're persecuting 501c3 Christian groups
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.360]  pro-life groups conservative groups revoking them while their White House
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:41.920]  run and are tax exempt this is the height of criminal hypocrisy but the Fox
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.640]  pundit points out the final point that they've said they want to destroy Fox
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:54.440]  news and other media they see as alternative just like the White House memos
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.920]  from the Bill Clinton library that just came out and by the way Farah is gonna be
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.360]  in studio I don't know if he's gonna release the full document they were
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.480]  able to get what Clinton had released the 30 pages they have the rest of the
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:16.160]  270 pages or so they have the rest of the information so he'll be in studio this
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.560]  is the kind of stuff that should bring Obama down scare the rest of the
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:25.240]  criminal government to stop being so rampant and arrogant they're like
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.120]  criminals at the White House robbing banks in plain view and no one's going
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:37.400]  after them they've been emboldened they have to be dealt with they have to be
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.840]  stood up against and let me tell you a Republican gets into office it does
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.480]  anything like this I'm gonna come after them I mean I thought Bush was
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:54.720]  horrible and I had no idea that when Obama got in it was gonna be like an F-18
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:06.280]  putting its afterburners on I mean they are just accelerating everything they
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:12.200]  are doing and they're normalizing that oh yeah the White House runs a tax exempt
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.880]  group that wants to shut down other media and yeah we are shutting down other
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.960]  media and we're going after Christian groups and we're persecuting you I mean
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:24.240]  Nixon had to step down because of a hundred and something names in a safe
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:28.600]  that he was planning to use to persecute people and then now they're just
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:35.040]  doing this out in the open and MSNBC gets up there on television and says hey
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:46.040]  we're basically allowed to do whatever we want so I'm gonna go to your phone
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:54.760]  calls I'm gonna stop belaboring this until Farrah joins us in studio but we've
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.680]  got a circle the wagons around the Bill of Rights the Constitution the
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.200]  Declaration of Independence state government local government and the
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.640]  libertarian movement the Republican Party because it's all we've got that
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.680]  isn't completely captured by the globalist the federal government isn't
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.320]  occupied globalist system in their own words the Pentagon has now talked out of
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.440]  the highest levels the government is openly training for war against the
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.880]  people it is illegitimate is a fraud and everyone who knowingly works with this
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:31.200]  system and who aggressively empowers it is a collaborating treasonous enemy
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:36.080]  if you go along with the system as you're a coward but don't energetically
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.720]  help it and kind of drag your feet you're a disgraced person and you're
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:48.680]  helping destroy your own future and shame on you if you're ignorant didn't know
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.680]  about this information it's shocking to you research what I'm saying find out
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.640]  it's true and then decide what you're going to do about it but if you're
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.200]  hearing this information and you work for corporations or government and you
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:04.000]  know what I'm saying is true because you're living it why are the the
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.560]  military our number one listeners why are the police probably the second
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.880]  largest group of listeners and then corporate henchmen and people because
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.520]  who do you think runs things folks the police the military the intelligence
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.640]  operatives the corporate chiefs they have to know how stuff really works to be
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.640]  able to navigate it themselves they want to know how it works and they know
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.400]  I've decompartmentalized this from my perspective I don't have all the answers
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.360]  but I know what I'm talking about and I'm here to tell you if you work for
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.600]  this system and you help them start this civil war or you help them prosecute
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:48.840]  this war against patriots to the devil with you
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:56.400]  because this evil being born this tyranny that's coming in is is like
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.280]  nothing the world has ever seen I just got chills you know I might go a month
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.280]  without saying I'm getting chills and I say them like every day and Joseph Fair
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.440]  on Friday I was like I was getting chills because my body realizes my mind my
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:15.120]  nervous system realizes how serious this is and how I have it taken it
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.960]  seriously enough you ever come home and you see your front door open and you see
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.640]  somebody run by the windows I've only come home once when I was about 11
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.040]  years old my parents while somebody was in the house stealing stuff and they
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:35.080]  ran out the back door and literally the back sliding glass door curtains were
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:39.080]  swinging in the wind and then stopped as we ran in the person had just run out
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:45.520]  stealing our stereo and some of my mom's jewelry and I remember when we pulled
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.720]  up you pulled up the car up at the front door there in the garage and seeing
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:54.560]  the door jar my dad saying the door is open hope the dog didn't get out as we
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.960]  turn seeing somebody run out of the front window and that chill that's that's
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.240]  your body going get ready to fight somebody get ready for an enemy
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.160]  they've been walking like to put the garbage out you live in the city and
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.320]  somebody's dogs out and runs out marketing you get that chill that's your
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.280]  body putting hormones out putting adrenaline out to fight ladies and
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.440]  gentlemen and when I look at this information I start getting chills
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:25.920]  because my body's going enemies I mean they're arresting people all over the
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:30.680]  place they're persecuting people all over the place they are openly using the
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:36.160]  IRS against Christians they're openly sending out media groups to tell
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:42.760]  ABC CBS NBC what to do and that's not enough for them so now they're actually
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:50.120]  putting all the White House people in as the anchors of ABC CBS NBC
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:57.520]  and you notice none of them are Republicans other than like Newt
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:04.320]  Enrich on CNN and he's a CFR globalist they're all Democrats because let me
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.440]  explain something there is not going to be a Republican Party anymore in 20
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:18.080]  years in 10 years they don't even intend for it to be there you're like good
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.320]  the Republicans are horrible you don't get it it's just a shell ladies and
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  gentlemen they don't want any opposition we're going to a one-party state
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:35.120]  again media matters head coordinates of the White House build super PACs to spend
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:41.280]  unlimited George Soros money to shut down free speech past anti-hate laws that
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:48.120]  even the Boston Herald called chilling speech ending they're coming for
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.080]  everything and it has nothing to do in the final equation we're getting rid of
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.160]  the Republican Party that's just a stepping stone it's about getting your
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:00.400]  pension it's about racially dividing the country more it's about gutting this
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.600]  nation they want free speech shut down they want to be able to arrest anybody
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:12.360]  they want filmmakers governors congressmen former FBI agents you name it
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:19.200]  they're arresting them right now they could come arrest me next week they're
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:23.760]  getting that bold they're that criminal and let me explain something to people
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.760]  they're now moving into this mode okay things are getting very dangerous as Matt
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.040]  drudge said again I quote drudge so much because what he says is so accurate he
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.440]  put out his tweet he said it's now time to have an exit plan from the US and it
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.000]  really is time to have an exit plan because what are you going to do if
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  they just make something up and throw you in jail and they'll have a federal
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.880]  jurisdiction that they control come after you or they'll have a state
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.680]  jurisdiction that they control listen I want to reach out to the Democrats out
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:05.760]  there do you really want to support this the Democratic operatives say in
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.600]  Travis County who've used the district attorneys over and over again to indict
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:19.960]  Republicans that hadn't done anything do you really want to go down this road are
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.040]  you really in a gang and you think you're going to win and again if the
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.240]  Republicans had this much power they'd probably be acting like this too that's
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.280]  what I'm saying power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and we've now
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.040]  reached this point I know I said I go to your calls and I'm now
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:40.120]  perseverating on this it's just that it's really hitting me that I have become
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.160]  comfortable myself with the level of persecution they're involved in if I
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.280]  comfortable I don't support it I'd decry it and loathe and hate it it's that I've
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.440]  become comfortable learned helplessness normalcy bias Stockholm syndrome
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:12.080]  the tyranny isn't coming it's here the police state isn't coming it's here
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:21.080]  racism racism racism is a low-level issue it's huge but it's low level
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.240]  compared to the ultra-rich or tax exempt and we pay for everything for them and
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.480]  then they lobby to raise our taxes they're discriminating against every one
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.200]  of us that isn't tax exempt I don't know about you but I'm not tax exempt like
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:38.600]  the rich people I wonder if I could go get a tax exemption because I'm truly
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:46.480]  nonpartisan could I go get a tax exemption
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.680]  could I go get a tax exemption and then do what I'm doing no they would never
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.480]  give me a tax exemption but see how they buy everybody off is politically
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.680]  involved we'll give you a tax exemption the last 50 years if you won't say bad
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:10.320]  things about the government well that well what does that mean and so most
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.680]  people churches you name it won't say anything political because they want
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.920]  their 501c3 well churches were already tax exempt under the first
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.200]  amendment but you got directed by your denominational heads to do that and you
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.040]  sold yourselves out you're no longer a church you're now a government operation
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:31.520]  you're now state-run church you're not independent you're not a sovereign
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.600]  church you don't have your own land every church in this country whether it
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.080]  was a giant denomination or a little country church was its own country that's
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:47.640]  what sovereignty means the four corners of that church in Alabama or in upstate
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:55.360]  New York was sovereign Congress could make no law respecting the establishment
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.640]  religion and the states couldn't do it either and now look what we've turned

[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:22.040]  ahead sir Alex Jones this is Frank thank you for bringing up this topic it
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:28.800]  is monumental because in today's money if you look in Wikipedia the Federal
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:36.760]  Reserve has it at 530 million dollars at today's 214 calendar money the huge
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:42.640]  expense that was done in Staples Center is related to a lot of topics that I've
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:49.120]  kind of fall through the news because the construction is a little bit sparse
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.760]  in Los Angeles but I was about to say the media just looks like it's no big
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.360]  deal oh you're gonna pay for Jerry Jones's deal you're gonna pay for the
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.560]  formula one track you're gonna just pay for everything that's the real
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.360]  discrimination that's why they want is fighting over what color we are because
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.000]  we're all being screwed together you see what I'm saying yes I do and we're
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.520]  having record concrete pores and arsenic spills in the same city and this
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:19.080]  spending is not preventing any any justice to the people and it's only
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.400]  going towards this corporate media sponsorship when you go and buy a hot
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.120]  bug watching the Clippers versus the Lakers one yeah about your $10 hot dog
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:33.160]  your $10 lemonade that's exactly what's going on is propping up these rich
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.960]  gross old sports team owners nothing I'm saying all people are gross these old
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.360]  corrupt men are gross and I mean that's who I don't want to hang out with I
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.440]  mean it is just a it's a joke how they hate everybody it's like Bilderberg you

[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:59.200]  looked at this owner of the San Diego Clippers because he's obviously been
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.960]  clipped and he needs to get back in line with the truth and God came for him
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.400]  you know Jesus Christ came for him too and so right now I'm just excited and

[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:18.680]  Spirit of Living God and I just ask that he would touch you and empower you in a
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.920]  greater way and that that the Spirit of Living God would just use you and
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.240]  protect you and your family and that we cancel every satanic plan in the name of

[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:52.160]  levels of the there's no doubt and my biggest issue is I need to try to not
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:57.320]  be angry all the time I have a lot of anger issues I control my anger issues
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.800]  most the time but it's my frustration on not being able to make the films I
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.520]  want to make not been able to finish the projects I want to finish having to
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:11.520]  spend most my time on the minutiae of paying bills and messing with stuff and
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.840]  keeping equipment going we got a great crew and I shouldn't complain we've
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:22.400]  gotten so much done but I'm all in on this and so I realized that this is not

[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.400]  Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:33.720]  look at this headline I want to get into this with Joseph Farah from Reuters as
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:40.160]  Iraq violence grows us sends more intel officers the West just funded al-qaeda in
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.760]  Iraq and so of course they're not just attacking Syria they're attacking the
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.680]  Iraqi government you go that doesn't make any sense it makes total sense the
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:52.280]  defense contractors owned by the big banks are making money both ways folks
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:58.120]  it's like you dump out a bunch of al-qaeda rats in a country and then you open
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.560]  the door for the zombies to come in and then you come in selling zombie killer
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:05.800]  spray basically I mean it's real elementary everybody cannot figure this
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:11.520]  out why would criminal elements of the government want to work with al-qaeda
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.440]  what are you saying the inside job yes a criminal inside job criminal networks
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:20.840]  worldwide don't care about any country or freedom they'll work with any criminal
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.760]  group we're fighting organized crime just like in the James Bond movies like
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:29.800]  specter that's based on real groups Ian Fleming gave interviews he worked for
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:35.560]  OSS that's how this stuff really works folks so you can't be held hostage by
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.680]  the threat of terrorism because it's only going to be used to take your freedom
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.000]  Eric in Oregon thanks for calling thanks for holding here on the year worldwide
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.520]  yes hello Alex nice to talk to you a relatively new listener first-time
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:54.280]  caller I had actually seen you on the America's Book of Secrets on H2 I'm a
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.520]  former credit card banker for Wells Fargo and I've taught you on the episode
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.800]  about the Federal Reserve and a lot of these things are making sense to me so
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:07.520]  I'm starting to wake up to a lot of things but let me say this I'm on like two
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.560]  or three discovery channel history channel shows at any one time I do the
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.400]  interviews I don't ever watch it are the shows good oh well I gotta tell you you
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.400]  know your your perspective on things definitely nails it way better than
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.040]  anybody else a lot of their shows on those channels you know they have people
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.680]  at Newt Gingrich you know people you can't really trust you and for me you
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:31.400]  know you're listening to the talking heads talk about talking head stuff but
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.280]  yeah that's why I you know look into you more and that's another question I say
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.560]  I haven't watched this stuff I'm the opposite of a narcissist I can't stand
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.320]  watching myself literally it's like nails on a chalkboard sorry to be honest
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:49.800]  folks but I really should be watching the TV shows I'm on so so let me ask you
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:55.560]  a are they not editing me too bad and b why are they letting me on air to tell
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.400]  the truth that's really weird that you know what that's that's throwing me for
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.160]  a loop because you're talking about stuff on on these shows that no one else
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:08.200]  is talking about and you're on these episodes that have to do with these you
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.080]  know a topic like the Federal Reserve and you know other things the America's
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.800]  black budget I noticed that you're on that episode as well and you're the only
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.560]  one that's really talking about this stuff you know the American prison
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.840]  complex and you know it's just amazing that's why I picked you up and your
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.760]  information is is way out there especially financially being a former
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.920]  credit card banker for Wells Fargo you wouldn't believe the stuff that that that
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.360]  I went through you know the stuff that you see in the financial area like that
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.840]  it's a totally corrupt system and it's awful and the fact that you're out
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:46.160]  there in the mainstream people like you now I think that it's really gonna start
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.240]  waking people up to you know there's a real financial problem here in America
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:53.600]  and you'd be you'd be surprised to what you'd probably somebody like you
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.360]  wouldn't be so surprised but how much Wells Fargo and people like JPMorgan
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:04.680]  Chase you know that company have to do with the situation the Ukraine it is
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.200]  incredible they're using the global banking system they have to put pressure
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.920]  on Russia right now and they're poking the bear why do you think they're doing
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:17.200]  that oh well of course it's all for their own interests I mean they have to
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:22.000]  cause problems in order to to bring their own solutions to it and you know
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.840]  come to find out you you believe the same thing I've known for a long time you
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:29.960]  know like I said I'm a rather new listener to your show but yeah these
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.240]  things are going on you know the financial system it doesn't have any of
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:38.560]  our interests at heart at all it's also above the law speaking of Wells Fargo
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.560]  they were caught with Wachovia laundering 378 billion dollars over two
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.320]  years of money connected to drugs even running the aircraft no one got in
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:53.560]  trouble but the cops will pull me over and say got any drugs I mean I want to
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:59.840]  laugh at them I mean it's ridiculous thank you for the call great points
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:05.120]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.680]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:12.520]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.400]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.840]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there

[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.040]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.440]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.200]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:40.640]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:44.520]  cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild

[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:21.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's Alex Jones on
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:30.200]  the GCN radio network. Joseph Farah who founded the Western Journalism Center
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:34.600]  ran some of the biggest newspapers as a national editor before that is in
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:38.140]  studio with us in Austin Texas I heard that he was going to be in town for
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:43.440]  filming on an not yet announced project it's gonna be a big national film in
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.960]  theaters I heard he was gonna be here so I said oh my goodness well let's try to
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:50.520]  get him to double down and come into studio with us and I said listen I want
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.400]  to get into the attacks on free speech like we did Friday how they're
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:56.040]  indicting all these Republican congressmen for crooked toenails I
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:00.280]  mean stuff that's one one thousandth of what the Democrats are doing probably
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:05.480]  nothing even mildly illegal I want to get into the funding of Al Qaeda worldwide
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.160]  by the West what does he think of that being mainstream news now with a new
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:13.560]  headline as Iraq violence grows us since more intelligence officers because
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:19.280]  they gave Al Qaeda type groups bases in Western Iraq to attack Syria now they've
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:23.120]  been taking Fallujah attacking everybody I mean this is crazy I wanted to talk
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:27.480]  about that I wanted to get into where's Obama going can he be stopped and I
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.480]  said but what do you want to talk about first he said I want to talk about this
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:38.520]  is just seconds ago for went live he goes I want to talk about my flight down
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:42.760]  here from Virginia with Carl Rove who lives in Austin you know he's the guy
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:46.240]  trying to make sure the Republican Party stays blue blood and doesn't become
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:49.600]  libertarian and save the country in my view I don't know what Joseph Farah is
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:52.720]  gonna tell us here but he said it was wild mr. Farah good to have you here
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.400]  with us good great to be with you Alex no wait a minute you're misquoting me I
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:02.560]  didn't say I'm just want I want to interject a little entertainment into
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:07.000]  the program I mean how did I miss quote I you said it was say I want to talk
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.680]  about this it I will be happy to talk about no no no I mean to be specific
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:14.400]  though I said what do you want to get into first you said well I can talk
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.560]  about Carl Rove right yeah and so I take my trip starts at Dallas Airport and
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:26.080]  you know I'm flying to Texas and you know I'm sitting there waiting for my
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.200]  flight and I see Carl Rove is walking around obviously gonna be on my flight
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:34.040]  he's looking at me he's checking me out every once in a while like there's some
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.880]  recognition there but I'm not sure probably figures I know this guy but
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:45.640]  I'm not sure who he is anyway we start boarding he goes in before me and we're
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.200]  both in first class it's a small plane you know how it is and there's not much
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:55.920]  of a first class but I'm in 1a he's in 1b and I go wow this is gonna be a long
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:02.880]  flight that's a three hour flight so you know shortly after we take off this
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.400]  little bit of chit chat as there normally is between passengers on an
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.800]  airplane sitting next to each other and he comments on the fact that I ordered
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:16.400]  ginger ale and then after I ordered ginger ale everybody ordered ginger ale
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.920]  on the whole plane and he said my you really started a trend and so that is
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.960]  the icebreaker and so I start asking him and you probably saw the story in
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:31.560]  WorldNet Daily today on Drudge today I asked him what was it about what was in
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:36.680]  the news at the top of Drudge yesterday and I think it's still there today is
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:46.520]  this story out of the spokesman review out of Spokane Washington and it's a
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.200]  congresswoman and bear with me I don't have any notes in front of me I cannot
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.040]  remember her name it's like Rogers Brown but she's a member of the Republican
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:59.640]  leadership you know I'm talking about Eastern Washington and Drudge has this
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.680]  headline you know linked to this Spokane newspaper by the way nobody can get to
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:09.560]  the link because Drudge is linked to it and he probably melted down the
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.400]  servers in Spokane I had read it just before getting on the plane and so it's
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.520]  still fresh in my mind so I asked Rove what is the deal with this congresswoman
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:25.520]  this member of the Republican House leadership who is saying Obamacare is
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:33.600]  here to stay that's what she said and he had not read the article yet so I sort
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:38.680]  of summarized it for him and got him to comment on it and the roves that response
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:42.080]  was you know I said did you think this is gonna help the Republican cause it
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.160]  you've got a member of the House Republican leadership was saying Obamacare is
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.680]  here to stay we're gonna be tweaking it a little bit here and there but Obamacare
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:56.120]  is here to stay and so Carl Rove said no I don't think that's gonna help us
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.240]  that's very very bad idea and we turn that into a story but mostly the flight
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:08.000]  was sort of innocuous I never formally introduced myself Alex I think he
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.160]  probably knew who I was because he was a little bit reticent to say you know too
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.120]  much but that was it what are the odds you get on a plane well you you know you
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:23.320]  probably make that flight more than I do I think your story illustrates as a
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:28.120]  microcosm all the problems in this country then the affordable care scam is
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.160]  unpopular with Democrats in the polls it's unpopular with libertarian
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.240]  conservatives some numbers are as high as 80% but it's definitely unpopular as
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.800]  people learn how bad it is it's a total screw job and the same special interest
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:47.720]  that wrote it have their hand in the sock puppet Democrats and the Republicans
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.440]  and so they plan to keep it in place I've always believed that Republicans had
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:57.920]  even with control of one house that they had the power to kill Obamacare and I
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:02.720]  wrote about it and and came to the conclusion quite honestly that they
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:07.640]  either just didn't have the guts to to take the steps necessary or they didn't
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:13.040]  want to get rid of it and now on the verge of them taking the majority in
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:16.880]  both the House and Senate the fact that you have members of the leadership
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:22.480]  telling you it ain't going away now think about this Alex I mean this
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.840]  suggests in one respect they don't even want to win because they have to be
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:33.160]  able to look at the polls and understand that this is critical to their
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.600]  victory in November they could sweep and have the biggest landslide in modern
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:42.240]  history it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that it's a giant
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.960]  victory run on repealing it right but they're saying no no Banner saying we'll
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:50.080]  tweak it and fix some stuff right because the truth is they want big
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.400]  government to they want their hands in one-seventh of the US economy I'm
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:58.720]  afraid you're absolutely right now think about this there are some things that
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:04.960]  probably would be okay to keep but is it easier to take this monstrosity that
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:09.080]  Obamacare represents how many pages is this thousands of pages long 13,000
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.280]  pages of writers and and to put that in place and start dissecting it or does it
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.440]  is it easier to kill the whole thing and then put some pieces back that you
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:22.080]  think are appropriate it makes no sense I agree I mean if you were cooking dinner
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.960]  and a rat climbed up on the table and swim around the punch bowl you just
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:30.960]  throw the whole punch bowl out but instead Obamacare is like a punch bowl
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.640]  with 55 dead rats in it right rotten floating rats and they're saying let's
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.640]  just ladle them out and then you still and then put it through a filter does a
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.680]  fair analogy are you gonna what would you do throw out the punch or or just take
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.360]  the dead rats up I would not only throw that punch out but there's a whole lot
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.280]  of other punch I'd like to throw out and we could have done that if the
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:57.680]  Republicans were true to what they claim to be all about limited government so
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.780]  how do we stop and we replace them with constitutional libertarian patriots
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:04.800]  which is what they know we're trying to do that's why both parties have circled
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:08.920]  the wagons spending money to kill the Tea Party which Karl Rove does he has his
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:13.920]  he has his fake Tea Party architect yeah and I got to sit next to the
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:18.040]  architect for three hours and I came I I wish I had thought you know if I knew
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:21.760]  ahead of time I'd have been able to come up with a whole bunch was he cackling
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:28.160]  and snorting the whole time no in fact he slept for a good hour so did I so and
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:37.120]  you didn't strangle him joking my best oh my gosh Joseph violent man I'm joking
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:40.840]  now they're gonna say Alex Jones wants to strangle Karl Rove it's a joke well
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:44.880]  remember it was Karl Rove who said he wanted to murder Todd Aiken remember
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:49.440]  that oh yeah well it was also Rahm Emanuel who would sit there talking
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:53.560]  about Republicans and Democrats at cabinet meetings screaming die die die
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:59.200]  remember stabbing the table so so I'm joking I want anything to happen to
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.880]  Karl Rove I just thought I'd like to cheer you up today you know I saw your
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:07.200]  previous segment you were so serious and I think you got a light map a little bit
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.040]  you know I was a fairer of the head of world that daily WND.com is there
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:15.360]  where the studio he's absolutely right I am too serious I'm freaked out you're

[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:27.240]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do you know what I like Obama no I mean I
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:30.720]  agree with MSNBC my kids belong to the government by the way I have to tell you

[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:36.200]  probably airways but you really are you know watching you just in the last
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:40.640]  segment in the studio I thought wow I'm getting I'm getting scared here you know

[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:49.120]  position I'm really sick of the tyranny growing I mean we've gotten
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:54.200]  comfortable Joseph like we said last week with them persecuting us I mean
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.600]  they really are persecuting people and you said it a year ago and I was like oh
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:03.400]  yeah or two years ago on my show you were right man Obama's going wild you know
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.840]  if I had thought of this I would have told you to look up a YouTube video that
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:10.520]  I just so you know I've hardly been on the computer at all because of you know
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:15.240]  traveling and all the obligations I have here but this morning I saw a brand
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:21.000]  new YouTube posted but it's from 1997 and it's Ron Paul they have seen this
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.880]  talking about the BLM and what a threat it poses to property rights in the West
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.480]  well we should play that tonight every Ron Paul the BLM no and guess who he
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:36.840]  quotes who Joseph Farrah he quotes an article that I wrote in the Houston
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:41.040]  Chronicle this is going back to 1997 the thing is Alex this stuff's been going
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:45.600]  on for a long time and I've been witnessing it and maybe I my immune
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:50.600]  system is built up no no no I agree that's our blind spot is that we've
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:54.320]  lived under the shadow of this dragon so long we may not notice it's getting
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:20:00.040]  ready to sit on us Joseph Farrah is our guest on Alex Jones stay with us
[02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:04.600]  silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows

[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  I want to get into Ukraine.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.960]  I want to get more into media matters with you and talk about the new book you guys put
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.960]  out.
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.640]  It's got to have the best cover I've ever seen.
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:34.520]  Police State, USA, we're going to talk about that.
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:40.140]  But you know, you've got a publishing empire, radio operations, TV news, one of the biggest
[02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:42.440]  news sites in the world.
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:46.560]  And as you just said, we found that Ron Paul video, we're going to post it on infowars.com
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.600]  of him sourcing an article he wrote in the Houston Chronicle back in 97 about the BLM.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.280]  There are the reverberations of the good you've done and others have done.
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:02.240]  There's also the reverberations of the bad, but why do you think they're launching such
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.520]  an unprecedented persecution of conservatives and libertarians right now?
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.080]  Because like you said here a couple of years ago, you said, when Obama gets reelected,
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:13.480]  he's going to try to kill us or arrest us.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:14.480]  And I'm an off air.
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:16.240]  I said, are you serious?
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.920]  You said, listen, I've been doing this 40 years.
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:22.320]  I used to be a communist when I was a teenager in college.
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.080]  They mean business guaranteed.
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:27.120]  I mean it.
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.120]  Expand on that now.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:31.480]  They don't have a sense of humor like we do.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.160]  They don't necessarily enjoy life the way we do.
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:36.200]  No, it's absolutely right.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.320]  I watched Bill Clinton.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:41.180]  Be careful what I say here now.
[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:42.680]  Get away with murder.
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:43.680]  Okay.
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.960]  Get away with murder.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:52.360]  Literally, including using the IRS to go after his political enemies.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:56.600]  Everything that you see Obama doing now, Clinton started it and got away with it.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:58.080]  There were no repercussions.
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:00.520]  There was no consequences.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:05.040]  And so thus I knew that when Obama had the chance, he was going to do it and he was going
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:08.480]  to do it bigger and better than Clinton did.
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:10.640]  And that's exactly what's been happening.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:16.920]  And you were citing earlier the communication stream of conspiracy going after the end.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.200]  Who are their enemies?
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:21.320]  Their enemies are law abiding Americans.
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:23.960]  It's our names who disagree with that.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.000]  And they say in memos, we're going to target them and then they come do it.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.360]  It's a criminal conspiracy.
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:29.360]  Right.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:32.320]  Now, why are they doing it now?
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.640]  Why is it on steroids now?
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:36.400]  Because they get away with it.
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.240]  How many congressional investigations can you have going on at one time?
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:46.640]  And Gazi and IRS and go down the list of all the Obama scandals and criminal activity.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:49.320]  There are no consequences for any of it.
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:51.280]  It never comes to resolution.
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:52.280]  They stonewall.
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.440]  And then you have to ask yourself, how serious is the other party about actually bringing
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:59.280]  justice for anybody?
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.920]  And I don't know the answer to that, but I do know we don't have a choice.
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:09.440]  We've got to put them to the test by throwing these rascals out because it is like I said,
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:14.000]  I did not enjoy eight years of the Bush administration as you said earlier.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:20.240]  I saw, you know, chaos and corrupt practices and, you know, crazy stuff, pushed the new
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:21.520]  world order the whole night.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.080]  And the bureaucracy power grabbing.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:24.080]  Right.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:28.120]  The one thing they didn't do is they didn't come and, you know, take my children away.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.760]  They didn't, they didn't try to put us in.
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:33.680]  MSNBC runs promos saying we're coming for your kids.
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:34.680]  Exactly.
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:36.880]  I mean, they are like body snatching aliens or something.
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.760]  Yeah, so I said to you, and it was hard for me to say it, as you know, as the guy who
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.440]  wrote, you know, don't vote for, you know, I mean, I was the guy who wrote none of the
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:47.440]  above, right?
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:54.240]  Never vote for somebody who is not truly supporting the Constitution, a minimal requirement.
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:28:01.000]  I knew Mitt Romney wasn't a constitutionalist, but I thought it's an act of self-defense.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.720]  And at times like this, you can see what's going on around us.
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:08.280]  We do need to act in our own self-interest sometimes.
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.800]  Otherwise, there won't be the voices of...
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:11.800]  No, I agree.
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.680]  I've always been such a purist politically, which is easy to do.
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:20.040]  But then you're on the enemy's list because you're promoting freedom and a bill of rights.
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:21.040]  Right.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.440]  And they, and they're talking about how they want to arrest all their enemies.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:25.360]  I mean, how do we act in self-defense then?
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.640]  What do we do, those of us that want to just preserve basic freedom?
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:32.400]  Well, the most important thing we can do, and I've said this before on your show, that
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.360]  is that we support one another.
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:39.440]  And I don't mean I have to agree with everything Alex Jones says, or he has to agree with everything
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.440]  I say.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:41.600]  Well, we don't backbite.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:44.120]  We keep the ammo going downstream at the enemy.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.640]  And when you get in trouble, I got your back.
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.360]  That's the way we have to be.
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.520]  Because we actually believe in freedom.
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.640]  We actually believe in the First Amendment.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.480]  We actually believe in liberty.
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:58.080]  And you have to fight for those things.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:03.400]  And if you get in trouble, even for saying something I might disagree with, I have to
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:04.880]  be there for you.
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.640]  And this is a very important concept I'm going to tell you.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:13.920]  Most people in our movement, in our profession, they do not practice this, Alex.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:14.920]  They don't.
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:15.920]  You know it.
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:16.920]  I don't have to tell you.
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:18.080]  It's, we're all lone rangers.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.600]  Have you ever gone crab fishing and you're dragging them up and you get like 20 crabs
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:22.600]  in a bucket?
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:24.680]  And one will try to climb out and they go over and grab him.
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:28.640]  But it's only when the crab tries to get out that they try to stop him.
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:32.640]  And then we're trying to get out of the crab bucket and then Glenn Beck reaches over and
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:33.640]  grabs you by the leg.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:37.440]  That's like, hey man, why are you doing that?
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:38.440]  Look down at his little.
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:39.440]  We're going to name names.
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:40.440]  Where are we?
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:41.440]  No, no, no, no.
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:42.440]  Good.
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:43.440]  Oh, no, no.
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:47.440]  I want to come back and get into the whole waterfront, take phone calls.
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.040]  But how do we defeat the New World Order?
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.040]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:51.240]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:53.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:57.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.080 --> 02:30:04.800]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:09.200]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:12.800]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:15.760]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.640]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:23.360]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:27.320]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:31.880]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:37.320]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:38.320]  All right.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:39.320]  It is in tea.
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:40.320]  It's in coffee.
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:41.320]  It's in water.
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:42.320]  It's in bread.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:43.320]  It's in toothpaste.
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:44.320]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:45.880]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.240]  It's time to take action.
[02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:49.240]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:01.960]  Hi, folks.
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:03.680]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:09.160]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:12.480]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:16.680]  direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:17.680]  buck.
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:21.560]  To take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:25.560]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:30.840]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:31.840]  and women.
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:36.840]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and that's why I stock MyPantry
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.080]  with high-quality, storable foods for MyPatriotSupply.

[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:04.640]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:09.760]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:13.800]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:18.160]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:23.480]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:29.880]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:35.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.120]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:41.320]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:44.000]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.840]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:51.920]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:56.800]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.600]  my favorite coffee.
[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:17.000]  At InfowarsLife.com.
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:23.720]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:30.600]  the Info War.
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:34.120]  That's Halloween music, John Carpenter's Halloween bringing us in.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:37.800]  You know who Joseph Farrell looks like?
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:38.800]  It just clicked.
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:39.800]  Tom Selleck.
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:40.800]  Lee Van Cleef.
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:41.800]  Angel Eyes.
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:42.800]  Look at those little Angel Eyes.
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:43.800]  They're green, but...
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:44.800]  Remember?
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:45.800]  Remember that's what Tuko calls him?
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:46.800]  Uh-huh.
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:47.800]  In the Good Event.
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:57.800]  But you're good, I'm just saying you look a little bit like Lee Van Cleef.
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:02.360]  Oh, look at those little Angel Eyes.
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:06.640]  Alright, I'm getting serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:08.000]  So much is going on.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.200]  Tell me about this new book.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  You guys, how many books do you publish a year?
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:14.400]  We do about 12 to 15 books a year.
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  You know, we keep it under control that way.
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.240]  Otherwise we don't have a marketing bandwidth to make them successful.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:24.880]  Now this one I thought of you, I had to bring it in because this is really inspired by what
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:27.800]  you talk about so much on the air.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:33.640]  Police State USA, this kind of tells it's very up to the moment right now and all the
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:39.320]  technology that's being used, surveillance, technology, drones, the whole nine yards.
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:42.840]  And as you say, you know, we're not heading toward a police state.
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:43.840]  We're there.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.280]  And that's what this book is all about.
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:50.840]  It's written by Cheryl Chumley, who works for the Washington Times, great reporter,
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:52.880]  and she did a great job with it.
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:56.480]  And you know, so it's not out yet officially.
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:34:59.360]  So don't try to buy this today at Amazon.
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:04.200]  Well, that's good because we saw a lot of your books at m4store.com because they're all so
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  good and I-
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:06.200]  This one you'll love.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:09.800]  I want to read it and I want to carry it, so I want to tell Weldon, I want to have this
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.240]  book and I want to- who is doing your covers?
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:14.720]  Man, that has got to be one of the best covers I've ever seen.
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:22.800]  Weldon is a very dear friend of mine, Mike Sunlaw, who is our creative director at the
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800]  WND.
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.560]  He's world class.
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:28.240]  I think so, but I'm a little bit biased.
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.760]  No, I mean, I look at book covers, if I was in a bookstore-
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  He's amazing.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:35.920]  I think our covers stand out, you know, in any trade show you go to or anything else.
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:37.920]  Well, you've had a lot of New York Times bestsellers.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.120]  The highest percentage of any publisher in the world, yeah.
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.520]  Ten percent of our books become New York Times bestsellers.
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.560]  That's like off the charts, okay?
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:49.920]  If you were publishing, like, Regnery has a very good-
[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.920]  You've also-
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:51.920]  Go's written a lot of number ones.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:53.920]  Yeah, but we don't want to talk about that.
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:54.920]  That's right.
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:55.920]  No, no, I'm lying.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:56.920]  It's not true.
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:59.120]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.120]  You're dangerous.
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:01.120]  No, no, no.
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:02.440]  You're not only dangerous to the astounding.
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.440]  No, you didn't tell-
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.120]  I've known that for years, but you didn't tell me shut up.
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.120]  Uh-huh.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.520]  Actually, Joseph Farron never wrote anything in his life.
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:11.520]  Right?
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:13.320]  I was- I collaborated on-
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:14.320]  That's right.
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:15.320]  Big projects.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:16.320]  Yeah.
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.320]  Big projects.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:19.080]  Well, you know why?
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:20.920]  Because you love freedom and freedom's popular.
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:26.320]  I mean, how could I, from access television, reach 15 million people a week one way or
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:32.000]  another, and fund a $10 million a year operation, literally self-taught?
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.840]  It's not that I'm even that good.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:36.320]  It's that people are hungry for the truth.
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.400]  Yes, and you bring a passion to these subjects that nobody else does.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:42.400]  I can't do it, Alex.
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:45.000]  I think that's what people need, though, is we're in deep crap.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  Yes.
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.960]  You deliver a wake-up call better than anybody else.
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.320]  There's no question about it.
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:53.560]  You're a very gifted communicator, and that, you know, hey, cream rises to the top.
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:54.560]  Oh, well, you're nice to say that.
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:56.040]  I mean, I just don't want these people to beat us.
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:01.640]  I remember, by the way, you know, I used to do radio for a few years, daily, three hours-
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:02.640]  Oh, I remember, yeah.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:07.880]  You remember when I retired, you people- the affiliates were asking me, you know, who are
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:09.600]  we gonna get to fill your spot?
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:10.920]  I go, hey, I don't know.
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:11.920]  I'm out of here.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:12.920]  Don't worry about that.
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:16.640]  You know who filled most of those?
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:17.640]  I remember.
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:18.640]  I got some of those affiliates.
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:19.640]  Thank you.
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:22.640]  And I had never really heard of you at that point, because they were telling me, Alex
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:29.400]  Jones, I go, Alex Jones, I don't know that guy, but see, it shows that we were somewhat
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.560]  compatible even back then.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.560]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.840]  World Net Daily and Drudge is where I went 10 times a day and still do, you know, every
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:37.840]  day.
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:43.360]  And it's good to know you guys are out there because we don't want to be picked off here.
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.280]  And plus, we need the echo chamber, okay?
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:47.280]  It's so important.
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:49.400]  I mean, you break a story.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.800]  If Drudge isn't there to amplify the story, it can die right on the vine, right?
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:56.440]  But that echo chamber is so important.
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:00.160]  We don't get the echo chamber from ABC, CNN, and the rest of them.
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:01.600]  We have to be our own echo chamber.
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:03.880]  This is something I've tried to tell.
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.600]  You know, our friends out there in the media, and it's a hard thing.
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:10.600]  Well, it's hard.
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:14.240]  Listeners need to know you are the amplifiers because, you know, even if Drudge or World
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:19.360]  Net Daily doesn't link to one of our stories, if you promote it, it ends up then usually
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.360]  the enemy attacks it.
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:24.040]  And then that echo chambers, that's a good echo chamber because they're so discredited.
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:29.240]  I remember when Rand Paul had just finally won the Senate, a Politico called me and they
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:31.200]  said, you know, why can't he be defeated?
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:32.200]  Everything was thrown at him.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.560]  And the underdog won, and I said, it's because you attacked him.
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:37.240]  I said, if you want to destroy him, endorse him.
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:38.240]  That's right.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:41.720]  And what they don't understand is they're so discredited that when they have Nightline
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:44.360]  attack me or something, it only helps.
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  That's right.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:50.600]  I think the good evidence of this is what the New York Times did to Clive and Bundy.
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.040]  It was so obvious that a lot of people were able to just see through that.
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.520]  It was so predictable that the New York Times is going to go and try to do something to
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:08.120]  scandalize this, you know, small guy, this guy who lives very modestly.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.200]  I mean, if, if, if most people went there and saw the way he lives, they wouldn't believe
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:14.200]  it.
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  The caveman.
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:16.200]  Yeah.
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:17.200]  Okay.
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:18.200]  And that's what they did.
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:24.120]  And, but, you know, you read the story and you say, I've seen this movie before.
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:25.800]  This is what they're going to do.
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:32.160]  And it's actually a great compliment to Bundy that the New York Times saw him as such a
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:36.960]  threat that they had to kill him, you know, politically, yeah, political.
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.960]  What would have happened if the owner of the Clippers would have been a Republican?
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.120]  That's a great question.
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.920]  Every Republican in America would be asked on camera to denounce him.
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:52.560]  And of course, we see nothing like that.
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:57.640]  He's a big time Democrat, as you know, contributed to Gray Davis, who is the reason, by the
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:39:59.480]  way, I moved out of California.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:00.480]  Gray Davis is the problem.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:01.480]  Oh, it was horrible.
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:02.480]  Yeah.
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:03.480]  And a bunch of others.
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:05.560]  And so he's got a lifelong Democrat.
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.920]  But what else is interesting about this?
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:14.040]  The history of the Democratic Party and racism, it's well, listen, every time I've been around
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.640]  a high level Democrat privately, so then I'll never say anything because it's a private
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:22.120]  dinner or something, they start making racist jokes and I'm like, I've never heard this
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:26.360]  in my life from my family and I'm like, what did you just say what you just said to me?
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:28.080]  I mean, you know, I'm being honest.
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:32.240]  Have you not found that Democrats on average are the ones at the higher political level
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:33.240]  center racist?
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:34.240]  Absolutely.
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:40.200]  I mean, I'm trying to imagine, you know, what saying what this guy said, I mean, first
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:42.000]  of all, the circumstances are so seedy.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.440]  Anyway, he's telling his girlfriend, you know, don't bring this guy here.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:48.960]  But but the thing is, this is the NBA.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:54.680]  These are everybody's black that's playing and he's telling him not to bring a black
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:56.320]  to an NBA game.
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.320]  It's incomprehensible.
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.600]  I know, because I only heard like a minute of it yesterday and thought, oh, more race
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:01.600]  stuff.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:02.600]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:04.360]  And people go, no, you better listen to the whole thing.
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:07.760]  It is like it's bizarre.
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:14.480]  I mean, it sounds like it's scripted by a Saturday Night Live, you know, writer or something.
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:17.680]  Have you ever heard libertarians or Republicans talk like that?
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:18.680]  No.
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:23.920]  I've heard, I've heard, you know, when I was a kid, I've heard family members talk
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:24.920]  like that.
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:25.920]  And they were all liberals.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.680]  They were Democrats.
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:32.320]  So I think you're absolutely, you know, you go back.
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:34.680]  What was the Ku Klux Klan?
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:35.680]  Democratic Party.
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.680]  It was their military militia.
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:39.360]  Military arm of the Democratic Party.
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:41.760]  Why is that association gone for people today?
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:48.160]  It's not that long ago, you know, and who was fighting against the Voting Rights Act?
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:49.160]  The Democrats.
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:50.160]  Yeah.
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.720]  So, I mean, it was Eisenhower and the Republicans passing all that and putting the...
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:56.840]  What party was Martin Luther King's whole family in?
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:59.560]  The Republican Party.
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.680]  His dad himself, his family were all Republicans.
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:04.840]  It shows the victory of propaganda, though.
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:08.040]  Who were the first people that the Ku Klux Klan went after?
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.040]  Black people.
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:10.040]  Republicans.
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.040]  Exactly.
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:12.040]  We're trying to arm them.
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:14.320]  Well, no, the NRA was founded to arm blacks who are newly freed.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:15.320]  Right.
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:18.200]  And if you go on CNBC or MSNBC, they'll literally go.
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:20.240]  The NRA is the new Klan.
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:22.520]  It's literally the opposite of reality.
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:23.600]  Yes.
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:26.280]  And that's so much true of almost everything we see.
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:29.400]  By the way, since you raised that, I want to play this clip.
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:32.600]  This is the Milwaukee County Sheriff, who's black, by the way, but I don't see that.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:35.600]  I see a good law enforcement person, a good peace officer.
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:38.680]  He says, you have a duty to protect your family, campaign ad.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:42.840]  They played this at the NRA convention this weekend, and then Sheriff David Clark went
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:47.080]  on to say, I have a better way of clearing up any confusion.
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:49.240]  Keep your hands off our guns, damn it.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:50.680]  Let's play both those clips back to back.
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:51.680]  Here they are.
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.280]  I'm sure if David Clark, and I want to talk to you about something personal, your safety,
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:57.120]  it's no longer a spectator sport.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:42:58.560]  I need you in the game.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.640]  But are you ready?
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.800]  With officers laid off in furlough, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:05.000]  best option.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.400]  You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back.
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:10.880]  But are you prepared?
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:14.520]  You're taking a certified safety course and handling a firearm so you can defend yourself
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:15.520]  until we get there.
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:18.160]  You have a duty to protect yourself and your family.
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:19.320]  We're partners now.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:20.320]  Can I count on you?
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:23.520]  This safety message brought to you by the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:29.560]  I have a better way of clearing up any confusion that activist judges have about the meaning
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:31.600]  of the Second Amendment.
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:37.320]  I would add these seven words at the end of the clause, the right of the people to
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:43.480]  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, keep your hands off our guns, damn it.
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.200]  Now, see, I don't look at that as a black guy.
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.680]  I look at that as somebody who's a real American, loves freedom, who I admire and like.
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:58.360]  And I can't imagine being like this team owner hanging out with somebody and then talking
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:43:59.360]  bad about them on their back.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:02.400]  But I mean, my whole point is, that's the kind of leadership we need.
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:08.280]  We need a bunch of libertarian folks that are quote minorities to run to take this country
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:10.360]  back from the Democratic Party.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:11.360]  Totally with you.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:17.880]  I mean, you know, you, I believe in what Martin Luther King sought for, which was this color
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:23.080]  blind society, you know, and, you know, we, we look at people, we don't look at the color
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:24.080]  of the skin.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:27.560]  We look at their character, what, what, what they're, I'll go hear music.
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:28.560]  I don't care.
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:29.560]  The guys got blue skin.
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:31.680]  If I liked their music, I could care less.
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:32.680]  Blue skin.
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:33.680]  I have a problem.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:34.680]  They might be dead.
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:35.680]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.680]  Rainbow color.
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:37.680]  No.
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:38.680]  I mean, exactly.
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.680]  It's what somebody produces.
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:42.680]  If somebody was Chinese and wrote great science fiction books, I'd read it.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:44.680]  I'm not even going to care that their names Chinese.
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:45.680]  I don't, I don't get it.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.680]  That's what you're saying.
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:47.680]  Exactly.
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:54.800]  And it's, it's odd, but it, you know, I, I've know lots of conservative people and Republicans
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:00.400]  and except unless you get into sort of the Republican establishment country club Republicans,
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:02.640]  you just don't find racism there.
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:06.840]  And you know, maybe it's because of the party of Lincoln and it's a party that was literally
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:12.560]  founded fighting for the rights of black people when they were slaves.
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:15.640]  And thereafter, that's what the Republican party is all about.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:21.520]  Well, we look at bird, the grand dragon and the big liberal, all the Democrats knew was
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:25.640]  racial politics and they were losing it because of demographics.
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:27.960]  So they just flipped it.
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:34.520]  And yeah, let's use these guys as, as, and it was, it was, you know, if it was planned
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:37.120]  out, it was a master stroke.
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:38.560]  We have the old LBJ letters.
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:41.280]  It was and Margaret Sanger before him.
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:42.280]  Yeah.
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.400]  And LBJ is a great example because he was the guy straddling those two worlds there,
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:52.200]  you know, as a, how do you counter something that diabolical, that evil?
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:57.200]  I'll tell you, I always afraid you're going to ask me for a solution and, you know, the
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:00.680]  world I live in is a, you know, I hate to tell you this.
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:02.400]  I mean, I'm actually a journalist.
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.640]  I've always been a journalist and I always felt like my job was telling people the facts
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:08.280]  and the negative side.
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:09.280]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:14.680]  But, you know, I've done this a few times, I've written a few books where I've attempted
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:17.600]  to give people solutions.
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:22.120]  And honestly, Alex, things are so tough right now with all the things you've been talking
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:25.360]  about today and every day on the air.
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.200]  I mean, we are entering a dangerous new phase for this country from which there may be no
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:33.160]  return.
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:36.040]  And I have to tell you that there are lots of things we could do.
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:37.520]  There are lots of things we should do.
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:41.520]  There are lots of things we have to do and we could talk for hours about that.
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:46.720]  But there's one thing we better do that's a component of all of it in terms of if we
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:48.560]  really want to solve it.
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:57.440]  And that is to embrace the Creator, God of this universe, to repent of our sins individually
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.480]  and get right with God.
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:01.720]  Because without that, that's the only power.
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:02.720]  I agree.
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.720]  Now you're right.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:08.840]  If we don't have God on our side to make it simple, we're going to lose.
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:15.440]  And I think that's the missing dynamic that so many conservatives don't ever, you know,
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:20.240]  are public and whatever, people who are Liberty fighters, if we don't keep our eye on that
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:26.760]  ball and we are not, we don't come to God pure, you know, sanctified in the blood of
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:31.480]  Jesus Christ, then we're not going to be able to make the progress that we hope to make
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.480]  in the years ahead.
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:33.720]  No, you're right.
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.160]  We have become a decadent, wicked country and we're going to be judged.
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:38.160]  Right.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.160]  I mean, it is judgment.
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:40.720]  What we're experiencing now is judgment.
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:41.720]  The beginning.
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:44.760]  Yeah, for us, for our own sins.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:45.760]  I'm not.
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  I'm not pure.
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:49.520]  I'm not sitting here telling you, I'm holier than now.
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:50.880]  Alex, I'm not doing that.
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.520]  I'm saying, join me in repenting of, you know, I can feel it.
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:56.520]  You're moving my heart.
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:57.520]  Yeah.
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:00.520]  And I was thinking this morning, people call up, tell me how great I am.
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:02.840]  And I don't really, people know my life.
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:07.600]  They think that's a pretty moral, nice guy, but I feel evil.
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:08.800]  I feel like I'm not doing enough.
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.000]  I feel like I should repent.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.320]  And I think that's that overall spirit of knowing as a nation, we need to really get
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:16.320]  ourselves straight.
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:22.200]  And another thing is that I think a lot, there's a church today out there is so corrupt.
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:25.400]  The theology that is spread is ridiculous.
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:28.480]  I mean, repentance is not a one time thing.
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:34.720]  You don't say, you know, I accept Jesus Christ into my heart and that's, that changes you
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:36.640]  and forever.
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:39.120]  Repentance is a constant thing that you need to do throughout life.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:44.360]  Look at the, you know, King David, for instance, all the things this guy did wrong, right?
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.400]  Why was he still a man after God's own heart?
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:54.280]  Because he always repented heinous crimes, killing people, you know, all kinds of things
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:55.280]  that he did.
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:56.880]  He was also in crises.
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:48:58.120]  That's right.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:03.000]  But that's the model for us is that it's not a one time act.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.840]  Literally every day we've got to, you know, bear our soul.
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:11.280]  There's a verse in the Bible that of my people will second Chronicles seven, 14, if my people,
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:14.840]  which are called by my name, that's that he's only talking to believers here.
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.280]  See, I used to look at this verse and say, Alex, how are we going to get everybody in
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:22.840]  America or elsewhere to do this?
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:23.840]  That's not what it's about.
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:25.280]  It's only for believers.
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:31.600]  If my people, which are called by my name shall humble themselves, that's a key and humble
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.560]  themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways for things that we
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:37.640]  have to do.
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:39.080]  What does he say he'll do?
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:40.080]  He'll hear our prayers.
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:45.880]  In other words, if we don't do those things, he doesn't hear our prayers here, forgive
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.000]  our sins and heal our land.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  Wow.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.960]  That's a great prescription that God gave us.
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:53.520]  And I believe it's for us today.
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:57.480]  You know, some people say I was and our land is sick, it needs to be healed.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:02.000]  And when I say I feel evil to quantify that, I feel humble and dirty.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.560]  I feel like my best works are dirty rags with the Bible again.
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:10.960]  In the presence of God's spirit, I realize how broken I am.
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:16.040]  Then I see other people just running rampant in evil and using lies to manipulate and dumbing
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.040]  people down.
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:18.560]  I mean, that is just so evil.
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:19.560]  Right.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:20.720]  And that's precisely it.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:26.160]  I mean, like I said, if we did every single thing that we put down on our list, if you
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:30.280]  and I and a bunch of other people who think like us got together, we made a list of all
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:36.600]  the things we have to do to overcome the evil we see before us, it won't work unless we
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:40.080]  include that one spiritual dynamic as well.
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.080]  Guarantee.
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:42.080]  No, you're right.
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:47.640]  That's what it comes down to and the judgment's only beginning.
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:52.240]  I mean, I have a real feeling of dread in my spirit about what's coming.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.240]  I agree with you.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:56.960]  We'll be right back, we'll take a few segments, we'll just go five after, take a few phone
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  calls, folks.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:00.920]  Joseph Farrah is in studio.

[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:30.400]  Be unprepared or beprepared.com.
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:34.600]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:38.800]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:39.800]  to serve as debt.
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:43.320]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:46.640]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:50.240]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:53.720]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:55.160]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:56.160]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:56.160 --> 02:51:57.160]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:51:57.160 --> 02:52:04.240]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:08.560]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.080]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:15.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.840]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:22.440]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:26.360]  On average, the county said it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:30.840]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:35.720]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:36.720]  You're right.
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:40.120]  It is intense in coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:43.120]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:44.640]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:45.960]  It's time to take action.
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:47.720]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:15.840]  People in state and local officials saying help is on the way, will the folks here in
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:17.880]  Bell Harbor say show me?
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:20.360]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:24.200]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:09.680]  he's going to be on an airplane back to Virginia.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:11.640]  We're going to go to some of your phone calls.
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:15.800]  Jeffrey and Lance and Felicia and Dan, Carl.

[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:44.160]  sponsors.
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:47.160]  Thank you all for your support and support other real media.
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:48.160]  We're not the alternative now.
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:49.160]  We are the new media.
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:52.360]  I don't even get into that, how they want to censor the Internet, all of it.
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:56.960]  But Joseph Farah, I was bringing up to you during the break, as Iraq violence grows,
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:59.880]  U.S. sends more intelligence officers, Reuters.
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:04.720]  They admittedly under Obama put a bunch of al-Qaeda in Western Iraq to attack Syria.
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:08.040]  It's those same people that have now, with heavy weapons, come into Fallujah and other
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:12.880]  areas and they think we're so dumb that they're doing this out in the open.
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:19.320]  I've never seen them, anybody do something this bold and of course it ties into Benghazi.
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:21.120]  Why do you think this is happening?
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:23.760]  Is this because they think we're so stupid?
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:24.760]  Well, yes.
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:31.600]  I mean, al-Qaeda is actually serving the interests of this establishment right now, this political
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:36.160]  establishment, whoever it is that runs this country.
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:41.800]  To a certain extent, it's partially true that we helped create al-Qaeda.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.440]  I mean, that's no big secret, we've talked about that, I'm sure.
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:52.480]  And then the other thing is this, ultimately, the people in charge, this establishment,
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.840]  is not nearly as threatened by al-Qaeda as they are by Alex Jones.
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:00.000]  You are the enemy, al-Qaeda is not the enemy.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.160]  Well, the White House memos show that.
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:06.600]  Al-Qaeda might be an inconvenience sometimes, there might be a pain in the neck, but they're
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:11.520]  not the enemy and they never were, and that's the thing we have to understand.
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.320]  They'll use them because they're so vicious and evil.
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:14.320]  Right.
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:18.000]  And the atrocities they commit and the blowing up churches and eating hearts, it's something
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  like the kind of a comic book.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:20.720]  I mean, it doesn't sound real.
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:23.400]  These are truly evil people, don't get me wrong.
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:27.480]  What I'm saying is that the power structure in our country-
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:31.160]  No, no, it's so immoral, they're using them and then they can take our liberties because
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:32.160]  of the threat.
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:33.160]  Right.
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:35.520]  See, I never said al-Qaeda wasn't real and wasn't attacking people.
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:40.040]  I'm saying they're using it and letting them do what they do to enslave us.
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:41.040]  Right.
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:44.640]  When you go to the airport, you've got to go through all this song and dance and that's
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:45.640]  just conditioning.
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.800]  Do you remember, by the way, I was thinking about this just recently, how you were a straight
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:55.680]  on point on this issue when they started putting these new machines in, these intrusive scanners
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:00.840]  and so forth, and it was news and you managed to break it through and become a news story
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:02.240]  for every drug you did.
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:05.000]  We hammered it, drugged it, and it became the number one story for about six months
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  off and on.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:10.360]  And then what's happening today, everybody's accepted it.
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:15.640]  Everybody's marching through like good robots and you never hear any complaints about it
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:16.800]  anymore.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:20.400]  I was talking to a guy the other day that I've known from college and he goes, yeah,
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:24.080]  I hear your show sometimes, but I'm off and he goes, I hate those scanners like a prisoner
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:25.080]  and they still pat you down.
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:26.080]  I go, listen, you can opt out.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.880]  And he goes, no, no, you can't.
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:28.880]  Right.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:32.920]  He didn't believe me and I was like, very few people making an issue of it anymore when
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:34.280]  I go to the airport.
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:37.120]  And you know, I just think that was the purpose.
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:39.840]  This is programming for people.
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:42.680]  And for a while they quit groping the kids.
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:45.000]  Now that's back.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.760]  And that's why I don't like following my kids, letting some weird guy grab them.
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:52.000]  They want to grope the kids at school, so they might as well start at the airport.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  No, it's pure conditioning.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  Yeah.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  Pure conditioning.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:59.360]  We're going to go to break and take a couple calls, this little extra, you know, dessert
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:00.360]  segment coming up.
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:03.640]  But in one minute, other key points for folks.
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:04.880]  Wow.
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:07.360]  Key points.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:08.560]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:09.560]  Oh, stop it.
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:10.560]  Alex Jones.
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:15.240]  Go to that store, whatever he asked you to do.
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:16.240]  Do it.
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:19.040]  Well, the bigger thing is they do need to.
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:20.040]  People don't wake up by osmosis.
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.200]  They need to get the books, the films, the stuff that world that daily and really promote
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:27.040]  what we're doing because folks were in all the White House enemy list.
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:31.760]  You know, education is a prerequisite to action and doing the right thing.
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:32.760]  Yeah.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.560]  Wake one person up a month, folks.
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:36.080]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.680]  And then the next levels take action.
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:40.600]  Back in 70 seconds with Joseph Farah of WND.com.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:41.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:42.600]  You are listening to me again.
[02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:43.600]  Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:50.800]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:56.240]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[02:58:56.240 --> 02:59:00.560]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:04.480]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[02:59:04.480 --> 02:59:09.920]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:10.920]  within their homes.
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:14.400]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:18.480]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:22.000]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  to as well.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:27.200]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:32.280]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:37.640]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:42.080]  The new InfoWarsLive Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:44.240]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:59:44.240 --> 03:00:12.960]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3130.
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:21.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:25.600]  All right, taking a few final calls here with Joseph Farah, I had a great discussion last
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:26.600]  hour.
[03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:28.600]  Let's talk to Jeffrey in Michigan.
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:29.600]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  We'll go to Lance and others.
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:31.600]  You're on the air.
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:32.600]  What's your question or comment?
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:33.600]  Greetings, gentlemen.
[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:34.600]  Much love.
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:35.600]  I appreciate you taking the call.
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:44.880]  Hey, real quick, first things first, Mr. Farah, Mr. Jones, keep doing your thing.
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:53.960]  It's a wonderful part of life when you can hear from a grand stage such as broadcast,
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:59.040]  people proclaiming Christ and being real.
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:03.680]  On that note, Mr. Farah, I've got to say one thing, you are correct very much in saying
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:13.320]  that the people who run the show need to repent and be of a contrite heart and things of that
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:21.040]  such, but the one, I think, aspect we need to re-recognize or re-evaluate or realize
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:26.400]  is that these people not only need to do that, but they first need to acknowledge their
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:27.400]  existence.
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:29.400]  I think that's the major issue, denial.
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:30.400]  Well, I want to say this.
[03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:33.000]  I've been a Christian my whole life, but not the establishment church.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.400]  I have a spiritual relationship.
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:40.040]  But just as things get worse and worse, whatever reason, even if there is atheists out there
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:45.580]  listening, I need Christ, and I believe in Christ, and I believe in the ideas of Christ,
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:48.720]  and I couldn't do this and have the courage that I have, and I'm not bragging.
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:50.440]  I'm just saying, it's the opposite.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:51.440]  I'm weak.
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:52.440]  I need God.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:53.440]  Okay?
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:58.240]  And so, I just noticed the people fighting the evil are mainly true Christians.
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:01.560]  And so, all I know is evil is growing everywhere.
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:03.160]  You better do something.
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:04.160]  Right.
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:06.160]  And look, what we're talking about here is a sense of powerlessness.
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:12.480]  I mean, you've got this platform that you use, and it's a big platform, but there are
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:16.000]  a lot bigger platforms than this that we're not getting to.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:22.520]  And so, as we had some success with WND, I felt, everything I've been working for,
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:26.240]  I still have this sense of powerlessness at the end of the day.
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:32.160]  Well, you can't be paralyzed by that as long as you know that we serve this mighty God
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:34.680]  created, holds the universe together.
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:37.920]  Without him, if he went to sleep, you know.
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:42.120]  You know, the physicists have now proven what the Bible says that there is an invisible
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:46.560]  dimensional force holding everything together, or something outside of it.
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:53.120]  So, you know, as long as we're, we know that he's on our side, then, you know, we can never
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.280]  feel powerless again.
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:58.960]  The system wants us to feel powerless, but, but yeah, no, you constantly think, I've got
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:02:59.960]  to do more.
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:00.960]  I've got to beat him.
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:01.960]  I've got to beat him.
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:05.200]  You finally got to realize, no, just calm down, smooth out, do a good job.
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:09.480]  But don't, that's why I really used to blow up and jibber on air was because I was just
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:10.480]  so mad.
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:11.480]  There's a world government.
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:12.480]  They're tyrants.
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:13.480]  It's real.
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:14.480]  Stop denying it.
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:17.320]  I've noticed you've calmed down quite a bit.
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:19.080]  Yeah, I still get upset a lot.
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:22.840]  I just like, I mean, I'm reading documents, executive orders, people go, that's a conspiracy
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:23.840]  theory.
[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:25.760]  At a certain point, you're sick of it.
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:26.760]  Exactly.
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:29.800]  I've been hearing that for too long, the conspiracy thing.
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:36.480]  Meanwhile, the White House puts out the communication stream of conspiracy commerce report there
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:37.680]  in black and white.
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:41.800]  Nobody calls them conspiracy theorists because they're winding this.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:44.880]  And it's an open conspiracy to shut down free speech.
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:48.320]  I mean, anyone would figure any journalism professor would read that to say, this is
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:49.560]  the stuff of the Soviet Union.
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:50.560]  Yeah.
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:51.760]  I mean, this is their indictment.
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:55.040]  This is their concession of how evil they are.
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.040]  Exactly.
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.480]  I mean, can you imagine writing a memo of you were, how do we shut down Farah and shut
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:01.880]  down people investigating Vince Foster's death?
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:05.680]  They should be investigated for wanting to cover up investigations.
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:06.680]  Precisely.
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:09.600]  Thank you, caller.
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:10.600]  You know what?
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:11.600]  We just, I can't get to everybody else.
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:12.600]  I apologize to everybody else.
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:14.400]  If you call back tomorrow, I'll get to you.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:16.480]  Joseph Farah, WND.com.
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:19.880]  You guys just get better and better with all your coverage and everything you're doing.
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:23.560]  And I really appreciate all the work you're doing and that you also linked our stories.
[03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:25.720]  I'm the leader of the Alex Jones fan club.
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:26.720]  Oh my gosh.
[03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:28.840]  Joseph Farah, thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:32.120]  And are we allowed to say the film you're working on or should we just leave that secret?
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:33.120]  I think it's a secret.
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:34.120]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:36.440]  But it'll be exciting and a lot of great work.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:37.600]  I think that's the key.
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.280]  I know that Alex Jones is a major star of it.
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:42.280]  Oh, please.
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:43.280]  Oh yeah.
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:44.280]  I got my big pumpkin head.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:45.280]  You haven't seen it.
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:46.280]  I've seen it.
[03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:47.280]  Oh my goodness.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:48.280]  All right.
[03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:50.080]  Joseph Farah, thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:52.720]  We're going to go out and have a glass of water and then he's going to get on airplane
[03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:53.720]  and get out of here.
[03:04:53.720 --> 03:04:54.720]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:55.720]  Nightly news tonight.
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:56.720]  7 o'clock.
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:04:57.720]  Be a comment subscriber.
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:18.560]  That's it.
