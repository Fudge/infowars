[01:47.240 --> 01:51.680]  the park Rangers run over and go get back get back with guns because you're an American citizen

[02:10.240 --> 02:16.880]  went up so hit refresh on info wars if you're on the site sixth graders assignment destroy the
[02:16.880 --> 02:23.760]  Bill of Rights in the first assignment in the school year and he discovered this this is not
[02:23.760 --> 02:29.120]  broken anywhere in Arkansas under common core the folks that teach two plus two equals five you
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.760]  wanted to sabotage society that's how you roll well guess what ladies and gentlemen they they
[02:34.760 --> 02:44.160]  revise the old racist evil document so if you set foot and run down a sidewalk at Valley forage
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.720]  you're gonna get tickets are arrested or if you pull up in your travel bus at the hotel the

[02:53.720 --> 02:59.840]  gonna they're gonna draw down on you I agree I think they should execute everybody on board
[02:59.840 --> 03:04.000]  and just kill them they're Americans there might even be world war two that's on board I mean
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.160]  that's even worse I mean this is totally reasonable I agree by the way you know they've banned the
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.320]  word paper bag in places like Seattle because it's racist because they control the language now
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.520]  they're the bosses and you know the last decade they've banned dodgeball and stuff now most schools
[03:19.520 --> 03:26.040]  have banned jogging or running at recess or recess all together you've got to stay in the in the
[03:26.040 --> 03:33.120]  cafeteria well guess what Long Island Middle School has banned footballs and any other recreational
[03:33.120 --> 03:39.840]  devices because playing is dangerous and of course it is in fact my dad says we ought to do a joke
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.000]  PSA and I'm gonna do this I'm getting everybody else the idea right now I want to send our
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.040]  reporters out today let's just do it today or I'll go out and do it but we need to go out and say
[03:49.040 --> 03:56.160]  oh yes we have a petition to ban walking without a helmet for your safety so we're going to be
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.280]  going over that and the news CBS news comes out and acts like it's reasonable it's like is it a
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.520]  little too much to ban the word brown bag is it a little too much to ban footballs well it's for
[04:07.520 --> 04:12.560]  our safety did the school go too far when the neighbors saw the children playing with airsoft
[04:13.360 --> 04:18.640]  guns in a backyard for the child to be kicked out of school is it too much it's not their
[04:18.640 --> 04:23.520]  jurisdiction it's out of control it's a power grab but this is how they socially get us ready
[04:23.520 --> 04:30.640]  is it too much the new army manual says George Washington was Batman is it too much we are
[04:30.640 --> 04:38.320]  are hijacked by criminal control freaks if you understand they know it's ridiculous you understand
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.120]  I remember like 15 years ago I'd get a call when I caught bribery going on at the Capitol
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.120]  and one of the guys was black being paid off to the paper called and asked if I was racist
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.080]  and I had to explain I wasn't I wasn't smart then I wasn't informed I didn't understand the paper

[24:17.200 --> 24:25.440]  and the headline isn't even hardcore enough because reading the local news descriptions and
[24:25.440 --> 24:32.560]  then what we have in our article for days they had arm guards around the yellowstone lodges that
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.320]  i've actually stayed in in america destroyed by design that film i made 16 years ago
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.760]  and i was blown away by how rude the park rangers were there that was the first time i
[24:45.760 --> 24:50.800]  would just really experienced it and it was all like politically correct weirdos it was all women
[24:50.800 --> 24:56.960]  mainly like a bunch of janet reno rachel madow lookalikes uh you know big sis lookalikes they
[24:56.960 --> 25:04.160]  all looked like big sis meets rachel madow meets janet reno's lilias maximus and
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.520]  i'd be 20 feet away from an elk just walking out of the restaurant or wherever we'd be getting
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.240]  footage of it and they'd run over and say those are dangerous you don't need to be close to that
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.600]  i'm like i just walked up the front here and it was all just about hen pecking and and being the
[25:21.600 --> 25:25.280]  boss and oh then they threatened to arrest us i forgot that we have that on tape for walking
[25:25.280 --> 25:29.600]  in going hi we're here for the un sign we'd like to talk about this is under un control in your
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.400]  nesco and they're like turn that off we're going to arrest you it's all on footage i'm like hi
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.160]  i mean back then i was like a 180 pound guy looked like i was a calvin climb model or something
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.920]  and i'm totally polite being nice to the women and they just didn't didn't want me i mean imagine
[25:43.920 --> 25:49.280]  you can't be clean cut in a polo shirt and super polite they didn't even know who i was and they
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.360]  threatened to arrest me this is who's going to run america they're going to run everything
[25:53.360 --> 25:59.360]  ladies and gentlemen you understand that you understand that they will take your house they

[33:26.080 --> 33:32.880]  moment and i'm trying to not go into a rage here on air but reading these local newspaper descriptions
[33:32.880 --> 33:43.680]  of people locked for days inside the yellowstone hotel in lodges with armed police strutting
[33:43.680 --> 33:52.160]  around telling them they were prisoners which is totally illegal to to to let the people in
[33:52.160 --> 33:58.240]  take their money and then hold them in the hotel saying you're not even allowed to leave it just
[33:58.240 --> 34:07.520]  shows the ecstasy of the power trip it shows how they're trying to implement it it shows how any
[34:07.520 --> 34:13.200]  power they can grab they're going to do it just like the state police of texas for two years
[34:14.080 --> 34:23.280]  have officially backed police that pull you over no probable cause no nothing
[34:23.280 --> 34:29.360]  and bend you over a car and put their hand inside your body and is it and if that humiliation isn't
[34:29.360 --> 34:35.760]  enough they go over to another person and do it with the same glove one glove two women
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.840]  four insertions and i hate to have to talk like that on air but you need to understand
[34:41.840 --> 34:46.160]  we're animals to these people and they're here to exercise power over us and break our will
[34:46.800 --> 34:50.640]  now the average state trooper doesn't know why he's engaged in this psych warfare operation
[34:50.640 --> 34:54.960]  but i have the army training manuals from the 60s and i have their training films
[34:55.840 --> 34:58.880]  and this is what you do when you're terrorizing and breaking a population
[34:59.920 --> 35:04.880]  because if they can fully degrade us we will think they can do anything because they're getting
[35:04.880 --> 35:09.120]  us ready to start arresting us and taking us to force labor centers which they've built into the
[35:09.120 --> 35:16.240]  emergency centers establishment act rex 84 garden plot cable splicer the civilian inmate
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.280]  labor camp program by the way they have national geographic and people come out and say there's
[35:21.280 --> 35:29.040]  no fema camps yeah there's nothing called concentration camps it'd be like you know if you
[35:29.040 --> 35:35.520]  had a hotel it was really a crack house it's not going to say crack house you know hookers on the
[35:35.520 --> 35:42.080]  second floor you think the watergate hotel in dc tells you that they got whole floors of hookers
[35:42.080 --> 35:49.120]  and gambling and everything else going on there famously ongoing who was the ci director had to
[35:49.120 --> 35:55.760]  step down a few years ago up there at the party it's the same deal
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.560]  now that you know they label all this homeland security what it really is is total absolute
[36:02.560 --> 36:09.600]  evil and and i'm just realizing how over the top it is and and their federal minions are following
[36:09.600 --> 36:15.360]  orders they've had a few senior people with the park service who aren't criminals come out
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.640]  and say we've been ordered to make people miserable and it's disgusting that's a quote
[36:20.320 --> 36:27.280]  senior park service ranger we've been ordered to make people miserable and it's disgusting no no
[36:27.280 --> 36:34.160]  it's criminal because if you really had a government shutdown and they really had laid off
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.000]  most of the park rangers which they haven't that's on record they would say okay well this
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.040]  canyon's closed in this area because these are deemed to be dangerous you know areas
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.960]  or it's you know go into these areas at your own risk and that's how it'd be handled
[36:50.960 --> 36:55.040]  but see just like they banned dodgeball 10 years ago now they're banning bringing a football to
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.920]  school to play during recess or they're banning running or playing tag the nanny state is really
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.560]  a prison state and and they know it is it's not like they're they're misguided liberals
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.520]  these are not liberals these are social engineers who know full well what they're doing now their
[37:09.520 --> 37:17.040]  average minions just a typecast psychologically tested control free who wants to exercise power over
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.480]  people and doesn't want money or success or liberty or to be honorable i mean an honorable
[37:22.480 --> 37:27.600]  powerful person would be embarrassed to go around henpecking people even when you're in the right
[37:27.600 --> 37:33.600]  and gotta tell somebody they're wrong you don't enjoy it it's just gotta be done but you see the
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.200]  imperious remember the tsa ad last year it said we want to hire people with an imperious attitude
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.200]  you know the definition of imperious it's imperial overbearing domineering arrogant
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.880]  a king to his vassal is one of the definitions and how does government act
[37:50.880 --> 38:00.080]  a king to his vassals his slaves assuming power or authority without justification arrogant and
[38:00.080 --> 38:07.680]  domineering that's the webster marion webster in fact let's look at the other definition below it

[38:33.600 --> 38:39.120]  a bomb when there isn't the felony is not saying that all this bomb stuff's fake but the point is
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.280]  i don't go that far it doesn't matter then i say you know this is all a fraud and all a scam and
[38:43.280 --> 38:47.920]  you're all getting cancer in here roasting i'm not talking about the body scanners when they start

[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.200]  the top stories get the news i haven't covered briefly in the next segment before calls but let's
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:13.200]  go back to your calls right now uh jordan you're on the air go ahead hey alex bear with me there's
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.160]  so much news uh first off i wanted to say on your last call about the social security they're talking
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.520]  about shutting that down in 18 months running out of money it's designed to go bankrupt and then
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.360]  always demand more taxes that then go bankrupt it's a takeover yes i know and so that's the problem
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.240]  is there's no amount of money to fix it because the globalists are shutting down all our industries
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:40.720]  so that we don't have prosperity to pay for everything it's designed to fail sorry go ahead
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.920]  i know that's all right uh and another thing i wanted to say is uh a bunch of like i think it's
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.160]  supposed to be about 3000 uh truck drivers supposed to go to washington bc on the 11th through the 13th
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.040]  and protest and my grandpa's one of them and i urge all the truck drivers to go do that that's
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.400]  going to be a big uh event and one question i wanted to ask you real quick uh you know who
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.360]  mark kessler is don't you the police chief who's been speaking out about the un and john carrion
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.360]  all of them uh it rings the bell where is he police chief uh i think it's philadelphia he
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:18.880]  started the constitutional security force and he's a real uh strong for the second amendment
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.440]  i was just gonna say uh i think you i think you and him would get along real well i think you
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.160]  should have him on your show so oh wait a minute i remember that guy it's in a it's in a town outside
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.840]  there and he is an alex jones lister i think i've asked for the folks to get him on before but um
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.640]  let me search his name and i'll just get it going again what was his name uh mark kessler
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:48.800]  m a r k s s l e r okay and uh the last thing i wanted to say is uh they've been talking a lot
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.080]  about uh emps lately and uh i also want to let everyone know if that happens in the electric

[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.280]  that was uh leaked i mean it was a document in 2001 it's a math award document i don't know if
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.240]  you've heard of it but it's actually on the math the website and that tells all about what they're
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.800]  planning to do and what it needs to take place you know kind of like that again sure yeah i know

[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.920]  before and i think they're going after him politically now uh because mark kessler his

[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.200]  taking over parks uh holding people hostage i'm with you you know uh i think the lord personally
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:21.600]  is just opening everyone's eyes but half of them are shut they don't see the massive takeover occurring

[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.760]  offenses and why it's so important to impeach obama because if they're able to set the press
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.360]  for them to get away with this future administrations will be able to do it i know that's common
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.360]  sense but we need to really let that burn into our brains here's some of the headlines up on

[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.280]  all to wreck it to make us collectivized feds hold seniors at gunpoint during national park
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.800]  shut down and then they actually kidnap them and wouldn't let them leave their hotel this is
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:40.320]  incredible that was a yellowstone also we have an article six graders assignment destroy the
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:44.800]  bill of rights in arkansas under federal funding just like you thought two plus two equals five was

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.720]  the u.s. debt default and what it would mean for the global economy i need to get to that
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.160]  article by michael schneider because it ties into the imf coming out about 20 minutes ago
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:30.160]  and warning washington over debt impasse that is in the associated press and time magazines also
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.120]  reporting it so very serious situation that the chai comms are lecturing us that we've
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.120]  got to raise the debt and socialize to pay them back their 1.3 trillion in debt which again isn't
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.760]  even real debt we've been maneuvered into this position we have plenty of industry left and
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.520]  systems to pay off the 16 17 trillion it's the 47 trillion we've paid to foreign banks
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.760]  and being signed on to the 1.5 quadrille 600 plus trillion of that the u.s. assigned onto
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.400]  according to washington post that's not our debt it's the derivatives garbage which the bankers
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  aren't using it's a black hole of debt to destroy us that they sign us on to want to explain that
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.200]  to you this is the plan and now they're maneuvering us to give us unlimited power give us government
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.480]  run healthcare give us debt increases because after all increasing the debt does not increase debt
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.800]  we'll say that again increasing the debt does not increase the debt and say that again
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:36.800]  increasing the debt does not increase the debt obama said uh so there you have it let's go
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.680]  ahead and go back to the phone calls then we'll get to our guest and news as it breaks

[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.480]  things that people claim counter all the radiation people stick patented stuff but you can patent
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.400]  anything on the back of a um cell phone and say that it stops the frequency from hurting you it's
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.280]  still sending out a microwave frequency people say well it changes the fluctuation of it really i
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.720]  actually talked to uh electrical engineers and they say no it doesn't it's the exact same signal
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.680]  i've even off record tested that stuff i'm gonna talk about you i'm not talking about what you're
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.360]  up to i don't know i haven't looked at that i just you know people would love to think that you know
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:35.680]  that there's some answer the answer is don't have a smart meter on your house the answer is vote the
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.680]  smart meters out of your town like you've been helping do god bless you appreciate your call
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:50.080]  nathan in minnesota you're on the air go ahead hi alex hello nathan um yeah i'm hoping i can be
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:59.040]  somewhat articulate here but uh just wanted to say off the bat that uh don't agree with 100%
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.080]  with everything you say but i do appreciate that you have a lot of uh good content and
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.200]  just wanted to give a quick service sir i could always say things differently when i hear a
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.160]  rebroadcast sometimes i i think man i wish i would have said it that way or i'm being sarcastic
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.400]  there people may not understand that so i'm my biggest critic so you don't need to preface it
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.520]  with the you don't agree with me on everything people always kind of call in and they want to
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.760]  be screened because they're used to talk radio they want me to screen their call and they want to
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.280]  say hey i don't totally agree with the host but i want to you know give my point on this brother
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:35.920]  you're live on the air so uh go ahead okay well i just i didn't want to focus on that too much but
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.800]  i want to give a quick shout out to the derek night interview with evert stern last week on the
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.920]  night we knew i thought that was fantastic but um yeah i do agree with one thing and that is how
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:57.680]  crazy this uh stuff that's going on and with the government shut down and to me it seems
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.720]  a lot more like a shutdown of the people than the government because well yeah i mean the government
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.040]  showing you that they're the boss and they can do whatever they want it looks like they're being
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.120]  bullies and that it's a pr disaster they don't care they intend to continue and never stop
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.560]  the rollout of the police state and so they're slapping us around right now i appreciate your
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:26.320]  call sir jamie in west virginia you're on the air hey alex hey i wanted to share something with you
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.440]  i know everything's all screwed up but all the time but i just was watching that government
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.640]  shut down things about a day or two after it happened and along the bottom on the ticker tape i
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.920]  didn't see what the name of the bank was but it said that the government employees could have their
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.200]  mortgage payments and their car payments deferred and i just think my husband's a coal miner he's
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:55.040]  been laid off nine times in 18 months we have moved five times we've had five kids and we're we sold
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.320]  everything we've had and we we don't have any way to prepare for the future because we really have
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:07.120]  nothing left and i just don't understand why those people can get their payments deferred and keep
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.800]  their credit up and live their life when somebody else's life doesn't matter because they're part
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:19.600]  of the federal family for now and the globalists need their minions in place for the final destruction
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.800]  of america this is a military takeover this is all economically been war game by computers
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.600]  that's why they're shutting down the power plants to make the coal miners go bankrupt to make everybody
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.120]  go bankrupt except the insiders did you know in austin this the county the feds in the city
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.600]  and even the central government district terry town where all the commies live
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.720]  and all the criminals live on record i mean they all openly around the city there's election fraud
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.560]  there's no real elections here they all get lower power prices and are guaranteed not to get their
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:57.920]  power cut off during the romanian chelcescu system they're bringing in here i mean we are the un model
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.520]  and so they're just going to squeeze everyone that's the nature of this that they've got the
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:09.280]  taxes and everything set to bankrupt you you're not allowed as a citizen to go to the national
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.960]  parks but the illegal aliens are in the news today allowed to do whatever they want if they're an
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.840]  illegal alien okay because they're god they're allowed to have their illegal alien rallies at the
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.080]  parks but veterans can't go see our linkedin cemetery you understand you can't visit your daddy
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.960]  if he's in our linkedin cemetery but if you're an illegal alien you could probably urinate all over
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.360]  the graves and probably be given a silver star for it this is all this is run by psych warfare
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.000]  people they're here to break our will let us get angry but they're just going to do more and more
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.080]  they're here to break our will and the question is you know will they get away with it i mean we're
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.160]  dealing with psychological warfare okay that's what all these lockdowns are about if somebody
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.240]  sees a neighbor with a gun going to the shooting range they lock down whole areas of the city
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.720]  well they lock down yellowstone and get people in their hotels for days say you're not allowed to
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.360]  come out and if you tried they pulled guns on you and people are like that's outrageous that's
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.160]  criminal the foreigners all fled and said they'll never come here again but they're like no we're
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.920]  here to let you know scum that this next they're going to be taking us to fema camps so they have
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.360]  to get us ready for it and they're incrementally doing it you understand yeah i do and i don't
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.760]  understand why why do we have to wait for them to do it because why can't people act right now
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.720]  well ma'am folks are acting now they're buying more armaments than anybody's ever bought in history
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.240]  and they're buying the ammo and they're ready and the globalists are wanting to start a civil war
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.760]  they'll just fit back while the country implodes people starve to death and mass and then they'll
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.760]  roll in with un forces later but yeah all these control freaks and all these cannon fodder they
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.120]  want to see a real government shutdown once the civil war starts which i hope doesn't happen
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.240]  it's going to be bad and i mean some estimates are if there's a civil war and power goes off
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.720]  and stuff for even a couple months you're talking a hundred million dead do you imagine these spoiled
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.880]  rotten people out here or folks pushed to the edge you have nothing under the system when
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:08.000]  everything turns off can you imagine now it it constantly leaves a feeling of doom over my head
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.320]  well this is how they broke them this is how they broke poland and and and ukraine and and and china
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.720]  our government ran the mouth operation for 20 years and killed 84 million people's the chinese
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.720]  estimate our government administered the killing of 84 million chinese and then and then when mal died
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.040]  they wrote editorials in the new york times praising the great job they did david rockefeller
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.640]  i mean i'm that people look i'm not trying to scare people you just have to know they want a mal
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:44.320]  takeover in america okay they they want to call a large portion of the population and then reengineer
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:50.080]  america forever they want to break the country this is how a war against america looks it's siege
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.760]  okay the white house is a foreign entity the government's captured this is not a joke we'll be

[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.640]  putting moussey tongue and power in 49 didn't mean our whole government was behind moussey tongue
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:22.080]  but criminal elements of it were just like our government helped put the ayatollahs in in 79
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:28.720]  just like our government's now funding al-qaeda in syria and libya and egypt the muslim brotherhood
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.520]  to kill christians you name it they want to destabilize things and they're working against
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:40.000]  free societies everywhere just like they're using odinga obama's cousin to bring in al-qaeda and
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.320]  destabilize kenya this is a mafia and i've just woken up the fact that they're even worse than i
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.320]  thought that's why they're saying illegal aliens can have amnesty deals at national parks across
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:59.120]  the country today but veterans can't go to many areas of our linkedin cemetery like the ewo jima
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:05.840]  war memorial and they want to shut the country down clowered in piven they want to take control of
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.760]  our lives this is short segment long segment coming up i want to get erin clines he's a smart
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.960]  guy new york times best-selling author journalist reporting for world net daily he also hosts her
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:21.280]  incline investigative radio in new york's wabc most of the two stations in the country uh client
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.120]  online dot com or wnd dot com he joins us we're selling his book it's an absolutely key to really
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.280]  understand just how criminal obama is impeachable offenses we're going to get into that and why it's
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.280]  so important to impeach obama because then the precedent set for all this crime if he doesn't
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:43.600]  get impeached i mean he makes nixon literally look like a saint i mean it's that bad that criminal
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.920]  we're going to do that with him in the next segment coming up but i first wanted to ask him
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.280]  where do you think we are as a country erin because everything the government's doing
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.120]  is bad pr but they don't care is it that they're trying to break our will and just set the precedent
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.400]  for even more getting on tv saying your kids belong to the state msnbc in promos uh uh obama
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.440]  saying the chinese on our debt do what they say the imf threatening default if we don't do what they
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:15.440]  say i mean we're really seeing america run like some third world country with with with offshore
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:21.440]  interest telling us what to do what is the method to obama's madness erin climb where you think things
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:27.200]  are geopolitically right now yeah thank you very much for having me i'll tell you we seem to be
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:33.680]  transitioning into the way that president obama first uh talked to to his first to his first
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.120]  goal which is the transformation the fundamental transformation of america but back in 2008 not
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.080]  a single reporter bothered to ask the guy well hey obama what do you mean by fundamentally
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.480]  transforming america what do you want to transform it into and very clearly we are edging along
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.680]  in this process of becoming basically a socialist style entity a socialist style state first on the
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.960]  one hand and by that i mean major federal control dhs out of control president obama
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.720]  out of control side step in congress launching wars but then also at the same time it looks like
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:17.360]  we're seeing the internationalization of the united states at least when it comes to our foreign
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:24.560]  policy so i see both things happening at the same time in emerging federal state that pretty much
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:32.000]  controls every aspect of an individual's life from birth virtually through death plus the disintegration
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.800]  not just in the united states but around the world of the concept of sovereignty of borders of
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:42.480]  statehood of nationhood things like responsibility to protect this is becoming the new norm for
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.760]  international warfare you just summed up what it takes me hours to say in two minutes continue
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:59.520]  continue yeah it really it really is unbelievable that we're at this situation right now but what's
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.800]  more unbelievable is that nobody seems to be talking about it that there is no news media
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.360]  the news media has been on board this from the beginning look at the thing called the
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.080]  journal list as which was that email listserv that literally sought to minimize president
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:20.960]  obama's scandalous radical ties but here's the thing this is not about obama obama's simply
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.880]  a figurehead in all of this and by all of this what i mean is specifically is is so called
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.480]  progressive agenda word progressive i hate it because they get to label their own uh their
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.360]  own institutes their own ideology so they call it progressive or they call it let's say the
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.600]  peace process in the middle east when it's anything but uh it is not progressive it's
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:48.720]  regressive but obama is part of uh decades old strategy in fact even i would say a century old
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:58.640]  strategy or more of uh of socialist infiltration of major institutions of power and by infiltration
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:05.840]  i mean just that hiding disguising the agenda greeting card uh hallmark greeting card agenda
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:11.840]  disguising disguising the true goal which very clearly is a state one pretty much by the federal
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.360]  government but here's obama as i said is just the figurehead uh there are plans i wrote a book
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:21.360]  before this not the fucking other book but pull me twice i was on your show to talk about it
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.760]  uh which was obama's plans for the next four years how did i know that because the plans are
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.080]  published the progressives post about this stuff that's right and the progressives are really
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.080]  they're really hyper-authoritarians let's stay there and that's what i finally learned the last
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:39.840]  10 years i was naive before that these so-called liberals even mid-level they know they're like
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:46.160]  military officers they know they're socialists they plan mass arrest they plan forced labor camps

[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:30.240]  of the country investigative journalist i hear my show rebroadcast on local stations at night
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:36.160]  sometimes when i'm in the car and i hear it and it sounds crazy and then i sit there in the car
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:42.400]  with my children and my wife driving somewhere and i realized this is really happening i mean i wish i
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:47.760]  was exaggerating i wish that i hadn't read all their manuals and training books and admissions
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.200]  like erin cline has done that's when i read his book last year when he was on it was so powerful
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.480]  because it was just quoting them that's how we knew what obama would do six years ago with
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:07.840]  obama deception that's how we knew what he would do a year ago because because these are authoritarians
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:14.640]  these are bad guys and they know they're bad guys i can't tell you how many times i've had a professor
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:20.640]  or a fake environmentalist or one of these people at a counter rally or an event i met walk over
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.800]  when there's no camera around and grabbing by the arm and say when we take over buddy you're dead
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.640]  and i go i thought you're like a liberal you're like you know who we are i mean it's crazy and
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:35.120]  i've had guests here that i'm not going to say their names who are quote liberal and i've gone
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.720]  out to dinner with them and they start drinking repeatedly and they start saying look when we
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.200]  take over we're going to kill everybody remember larry grathwald the fbi informant the special
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.920]  forces guy who was in the weather room with the heirs folks and they said we're going to bankrupt
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.440]  america we're going to bring in socialism make everybody collective and then we're going to put
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.720]  50 million people in camps and kill at least 25 million of them now now look i get up here and
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.320]  i say all this ladies and gentlemen i'm not even saying they'll they'll be able to do this but they
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.400]  have us under collectivism already they have 50 million people on food stamps 101 million on food
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:15.040]  assistance this is their plan under cloward and piven that's just a regurgitation of older plans
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:21.040]  of enslavement and erin in his new book that everyone needs to read you need to get this to
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:27.120]  all of the progressives the authoritarians you know who aren't in the cult you've got outer party
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.200]  members of liberalism who really mean well and really buy into the bull they're going to get free
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:36.560]  health care and obama loves the children and wants the gay people live in peace and blah blah
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:42.480]  blah that's all window dressing the inner party members in their own writings are the most control
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.280]  freak vicious authoritarians what the new york times senior writer former head of the washington
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:51.920]  post say yesterday that obama is the biggest control freak biggest authoritarian they've
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.600]  ever seen they're arresting reporters they're persecuting the tea party they're going after
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:03.280]  everybody they're telling catholic priests and preachers and and rabbis any any religious leader
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.600]  you're not allowed to minister even as a volunteer during the shutdown they're not letting service
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:12.000]  animals come and help people that are hurt at veterans memorials they're saying no visitors
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.480]  can't help the veterans they're not letting veterans get into arlington cemetery now that's
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.800]  the new announcement up on info wars dot com and and erin here's what i'm asking what because you're
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.560]  a really smart guy i mean you just crystallize everything in two minutes earlier i respect you
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:32.880]  well are they power mad or is there a method to this madness why are they so arrogant now
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:38.560]  are they trying to cause a revolt or something yeah i believe there are several things going on
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.440]  here at the same time first i don't think that obama in his head actually thinks that he's
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:48.240]  doing this and by this i mean transforming america basically into a socialist style entity
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.400]  i don't think that he believes he's doing this for like evil purposes or to harm americans i
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.360]  actually think that he and so many in the progress of establishment truly believe
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:06.720]  you that their agenda truly believe that their ideas for america for a larger federal government
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:12.000]  for basically an expansive almost a authoritarian federal government and they believe that this
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.080]  is for the betterment of society they believe that if we give up our individualism if we give up
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:25.360]  our uh... the kind of uh... the founding ideas of of the united states of america and give it
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.320]  up to an all-encompassing government that this is for the betterment but actually you mentioned
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.080]  that there are some within the progressive movement and many really across the political spectrum
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.480]  by the way who who are furious at this i can confirm that i personally heard from some
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.000]  key progressive leaders who read the book read impeachable offenses and they agree with about
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.240]  half of what is in the book they agree with the chapters on surveillance on the emerging
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:02.640]  surveillance regime on the nsa on the basically illegal war uh... in in libya that first toppled
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.240]  gadoff is really sure but erin that's the erin that's the useful idiots that mean well like like
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.200]  like governor brown who really thinks turning it into mexico and legalizing the illegals is a
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.920]  nice thing to do and you know he banned india in the state to sign the bill because he's probably
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.520]  not an evil guy he really like jimmy carter he really believes this but listen listen i've
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:29.600]  i've read their documents look at look at the article out of the new republic calling for obama
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:36.240]  to basically take over congress uh like yeltsin did the duma in 1991 i mean certainly are you
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.640]  saying you haven't run into the progressives that are really hardcore communist and talk about how
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:45.840]  they just want to take over oh no i certainly have run into a lot of a lot of them some of them
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.760]  agree with some of what's in the book but certainly uh their agenda is just that it's it's to take over
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:57.200]  if you would have told me uh a few years ago but actually you were talking about this for a long
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:03.040]  time uh but but i was a kid i was like in high school in the 1990s and if somebody would have
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:10.000]  come to me and said uh that that the united states government for example is arming al-qaeda or
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.960]  most deadly dangerous adversary i would call you crazy i would say you're a conspiracy theorist
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.040]  i would say that that's absolutely uh that's absolute ludicy you could believe such a thing
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:26.160]  well i in the book i document just that and i and i use the word document in a very direct
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.200]  and deliberate way because there's a lot of documentation and footnotes of the united states
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:37.280]  in fact i'm talking here about the the real Benghazi scandal it's not about edited talking
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.400]  points it's not about lies over a muhammad video which within itself should be a scandal
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.480]  it's about what was going on inside that Benghazi facility which was transferring arms
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.080]  to the jihadist led rebels first in libya and trying to collect the weapons and now sending
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  weapons to the jihadist led rebels that include al-qaeda in syria so there there's no question
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:07.200]  we are pretty much at this point during Benghazi it was secretive now we're openly arming al-qaeda
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.560]  led rebels throughout the middle east of north africa and the question we have to ask and maybe
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:17.440]  this can answer your larger question of what is the ultimate agenda the question we have to ask is
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:22.320]  is why why in the world are we arming are we putting al-qaeda on steroids why in the world
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.480]  are we giving al-qaeda weapons that are now proliferating all over the place because they plan
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.640]  to turn the whole middle east of north africa over to him look at his brother odinga's world
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:36.960]  that daily is broken uh on record uh bringing in all the al-qaeda people out of uh you know just
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.480]  north there out of Somalia and actually trying to turn all of africa over to them maybe there's
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:48.640]  something to the fact that uh that obama really really is actually not even using these people
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.880]  but actually might be with them he might be with him you can look at his uh larger let's say
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.120]  islamic background growing up in indonesia although you know it's hard to hold against him
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.120]  where he was he was uh brought against his will as a kid but you could also look of course at his
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.480]  church of 20 something years which was not ordinary christianity it was black liberation theology
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:17.920]  um with an ally basically with with uh islamist ideology with uh with the nation of islam
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:24.560]  but i see a lot of financial interest here for example in in syria there's a key pipeline
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.840]  oh we're we're we're arming al-qaeda in the very swath of territory now that a lot of the fighting
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:36.080]  against Bashar al-sajid regime is is going on oh there's a key pipeline that on the one hand
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.680]  um katar and kuit and Saudi Arabia and the so-called moderate arab regimes these the uh
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:47.840]  let's say the sunni axis uh is trying to build but bashar al-sajid rejected it and about the same
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.360]  time he rejected it that's when the insurgency started in syria and then there's another pipeline
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:00.080]  that russia and china and uh and i ran are trying to build it's called the islamic pipeline and
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.120]  that's really going that's what's in fact going to happen if bashar al-sajid stays in power so
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:11.360]  they're a major gas interest major oil interest there or libya same thing a major natural gas
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:18.080]  reserve of suddenly uh it wouldn't love them all margadofi refuse to do business with this kind of
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.120]  pipeline that's when the revolution started in libya so i think that there are a lot of
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:27.360]  financial interest here that really need to be probed that a lot of people don't talk about
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:32.160]  when it comes to the real Benghazi scandal which is arming our jihadist enemies
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:39.760]  what do you think from researching it it's in your book the strategy is though how do they think
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.600]  they would get away going back three years ago they're getting to accelerate the arming of the
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  most radical uh sunni muslims out of qatar and saudi arabia and other areas how do they think
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:57.760]  they'd get away with this politically because they tried to deny it for a while now in the last
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.520]  year or so the council and farm relations came out and said quote we need al-qaeda that's a quote
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.040]  and admitted they're the only ones that'll actually fight and so that's the group they've
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.280]  got to use it's like well Assad's bad and and and and libya's leader's bad so we're going to use
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.160]  al-qaeda which on record is 50 times worse and these other countries weren't attacking anybody
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.480]  and we're trying to actually work with the west so that actually uh sends the message that if you
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.880]  try to like work with the west we're just going to use al-qaeda on you but then how
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.080]  do they argue that with egypt clearly mubarak three and a half four years ago wasn't going along
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.840]  with the plan for libya so they threw him out put the muslim brotherhood in he started blowing up
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:44.400]  churches every day shooting egyptian military every day and then our media calls them protesters
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:51.040]  and demonstrators how can the west turn against their own strongman mubarak who's not an angel but
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.800]  compared to al-qaeda a great guy uh i mean what is the strategy there i mean that was a guy for
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.720]  31 years working with the west and and you could go there and compared to what it is now egypt was
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.760]  a lot better off yeah there's no question i think that one of the reasons they get away with it
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:14.560]  politically is because i find it hard to believe that republicans were in brief that key republican
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.960]  lawmakers from the congress from the senate were not first briefed those on the intelligence
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:24.480]  committees about the arming of al-qaeda first in libya this goes back to first opposing
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.360]  mohammed afia's regime when we were delivering large quantities or at least coordinating with
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:35.280]  the arab countries large quantities of weapons to our rebel groups whose leaders admitted they
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.960]  boasted that not only are they part of al-qaeda but that they also previously were fighting
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:45.440]  american troops in iraq and afghanistan yeah they bragged they said we've killed americans before
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.800]  and then they say once we go to syria next we're going to get america and israel and then they sing
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.040]  songs to some of them laden it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous and i think some republicans
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.680]  knew about it so that that's first and then second how we get away with it is a question that also
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.680]  needs to be asked about how he gets away with um side stepping congress repeatedly whether
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.960]  it's when congress fails to pass the dream act and then instead basically with executive order
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.160]  which bypasses the word of congress the constitutional right guaranteed only to congress
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.240]  to regulate immigration in the country he changes the immigration law with with just uh uh uh
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.200]  the swipe of a pen that's it how does he get away with that how does he get away with obama
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.000]  care which i know people will say well i went to the supreme court they certified a constitutional
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.320]  well i i see a lot of changes i've been reporting on it in impeachable offenses to obama care to
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.320]  the way it's being implemented changes sure sure that's how they do everything they write
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:50.320]  is a blank check yeah indeed unconstitutional uh so how does it get away with that how does it get
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:56.160]  away when people hear the word impeachment they usually think of high crimes and misdemeanor
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.840]  well first of all high crime is is not an ordinary crime it's a crime committed by an individual in
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:08.640]  a position of high power it's a crime against the office uh but but it's not only impeachment
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.880]  is not only high crimes and misdemeanors it's also bribery and treason well i would put bribery up
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.840]  there with president obama's first term green stimulus i don't understand how he got away
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:25.520]  with so lendra but let's go further is writing his letter to congress after the joint chief
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.520]  told the house of senate committees last year that he got his authority from nato and didn't
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.880]  need to come to them he should have instantly the impeachment should have begun open and shut
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:40.560]  remove him because it's bad to be a dictator or authoritarian but it's really bad to say
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:47.200]  i get my power from nato i mean that is just open and shut case right there he's impeached
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.960]  and then we also had chuck a go who said pretty much that he said we're gonna come to congress
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.640]  and inform you he was referring to launching a military conflict basically launching a war
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:03.600]  so they said we'll inform you if we choose to it indeed and this is responsibility to protect
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.600]  r2p which i have i've reviewed our responsibility to protect extensively i've reviewed those who
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.320]  founded it i have many footnotes and impeachable offenses the book just done this i mean this
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:19.280]  uh it's nuclear missiles are launched the congress has already given the president the right
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:27.040]  to with the football to launch a counter strike yeah it was founded by a group one of three funders
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:33.600]  are george is george soros soros is all over responsibility to protect as as is the man's
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:40.160]  the power who is president obama's uh right now she's at the united nations previously she was the
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:44.880]  sure sure sure i mean i wasn't going after i wasn't going after that lobbying thing to give the
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:49.040]  president the power to every once i was saying what they are talking about with the war powers
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:54.720]  is obviously if the u.s. is struck there's a default that the commander in chief can respond
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:59.200]  but he doesn't have the power to go start new wars or fund rebels wherever he wants without
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:06.000]  congress but he apparently thinks that he does because he did just that in libya for in libya
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.320]  and then specifically in the consulate the non-consulate it wasn't it we never had a
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.640]  consulate in banghazi i don't know why people still call it that it was a a special mission
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.680]  that even the libyan government didn't know about and then he pretty much launched a proxy war in
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:25.680]  syria by supporting one group against the other a proxy war against russia a proxy war against
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:32.400]  uh i ran but that that's the theme here the theme is uh is that we tell you we inform you we go
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:39.280]  well we'll go around congress if need be and we see this throughout all walks of life when it comes
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.880]  to the obama administration legislation including the department of homeland security including
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:51.040]  the militarization by the way of the department of homeland security including let's say vipers
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.240]  drills i have in the book that are have been taken taking place for about two or three years now news
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:01.360]  media doesn't really talk about it taking place with military personnel which is against u.s.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.600]  law and by the way they were having those last week in dc and that's what the woman ran into
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:12.800]  that panicked and we've actually confirmed that but no other media has covered it i'll tell you
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.760]  erin people need to get the book it's available at info or store dot com or book stores everywhere
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.320]  impeachable offenses this needs to be a number one new york times bestseller because in closing
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.960]  i want to see if you agree with me on this if obama gets away with this and then fades off
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:33.120]  they've set the precedent that basically does turn america into an authoritarian state we've got
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:38.320]  to impeach obama we can't just let him become a lame duck inside a bunch of pardons yeah that's
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.680]  just it this is not about a democrat it's not about republican this is not about who has more
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.920]  seats in in congress or in the senate this is about just that if he gets away with it
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.360]  then somebody else that then the president is there then the red line has been cost and somebody
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.880]  else who comes next or in in five years twenty or whatever it is um can can do just this and
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.440]  much more and he already got away with it it seems that almost nothing is going to happen that's
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.360]  why it's very important to send a message uh with with this book and with the impeachment campaign
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.240]  i agree and we're going to have you back up soon to talk about that campaign where can they learn

[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:35.680]  i mean that's impeachable right there that's political persecution incredible all right there

[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:03.840]  listener you can just um go to info wars dot com we have some photos of it but giant giant events
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:11.280]  there so if you're an illegal alien i told you folks you are god for now you're part of the
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.720]  federal family but if you're visiting from mexico or germany or france or italy or japan as they are
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.440]  to national parks they wait till you get into the national park pay your money and then tell you
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:27.040]  you're not allowed to get off your bus but you can't leave or you got to stay in your hotel for two
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:35.200]  days literally as a prisoner i mean i cannot believe the magnitude i keep using that word
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:43.200]  of the flagrantness of this the flagrantness of the world war two vets it's turned out are being
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:48.160]  detained are being ticketed what they do is they put them in handcuffs in their wheelchairs and then
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:53.120]  they go and then give them a ticket and you know the judges are going to throw the book at those
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:59.600]  vets but right next door the illegal aliens they can do whatever they want because again this is
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.400]  about bringing america down ladies and gentlemen and getting as many people as you can and look at
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:11.360]  that guy with a mexico flag right there liberation theology all this stuff to literally tear this
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:15.600]  country apart would divide and conquer that's why they're always injecting race race race race race
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.800]  you don't like big government you're a racist you don't want obama career races you don't turn
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:24.640]  your guns in your races because it's race ideology on all of the quote protected groups they run
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.240]  and then meanwhile everybody gets screwed in the final equation we're going to go to break
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:37.280]  come back with calls and we've got a guest joining us coming up a little bit later in the transmission

[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:30.240]  if i was going to write an absurdist novel to try to top the grand phaloons of
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:37.680]  kurt vonnegut i would write about children taught two plus two equals five i would have
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.800]  an assignment for fifth graders to quote destroy the bill of rights and rewrite them
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:50.560]  i would have the feds holding seniors hostage that i already checked in at their hotel saying
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:58.400]  you're not allowed to come outside uh and i would not allow children to play with
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:02.880]  footballs or other balls at recess saying it could be dangerous but of course i don't need
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.600]  to write that as science fiction that's just the news today illegal aliens can have a rally
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:16.320]  for the end the borders world government free welfare vote to take our guns but veterans
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:23.280]  can't visit the memorial or regular citizens get arrested if you cross the barricades to go on the
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:30.960]  mall i mean it is just cuckoo for cocoa puffs that this is all going on and it's the madness of the
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:39.120]  tyrant and it's a spiritual disease i find this in life in business because i've used business to
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:48.160]  fund our operations that people don't care most of them most people about money or about freedom
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:56.800]  or about stability they care about being able to dominate you wrongfully or do things their way
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:03.440]  that screwed up and it's getting worse ladies and gentlemen i i'm just learning so much about
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.920]  human nature it's bizarre like you do something nice for people they think you need something from
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:17.440]  them or they've they they've got something over on you or or or or that makes them disrespect i'm not
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.400]  talking about everybody but but but more and more it's like a mental disease i talked to a lot of
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:29.520]  executives a lot of successful people in media in in industry and they say it's happening everywhere
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:39.360]  it's not just the police going crazy it is it is the general public has gone stark raving mad
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:48.080]  and i just marvel at it i absolutely marvel and people can't ever admit they're wrong
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:53.840]  i admit i'm wrong all the time people can't it i don't know what to say anymore i'm just totally
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:00.560]  blown away at this point and people also think if they take you down even if they're in the same
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:06.160]  line of work as you are in their eyes that that will make them bigger they don't even understand
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:10.640]  rising tide raises all ships and that's the thing about the collectivist at the end of the day the
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:18.240]  their low level schmucks the suckers the buffoons the marks uh the people that are being conned
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:22.000]  they really believe somebody wants to get them a free lunch show that's all because they love them
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.080]  and it's sweet and that's kind of at the bottom of the barrel you've got a bunch of fools
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.800]  but with the folks running the government running the show and running the big corporations they
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.360]  just want to shut down all their competition and they want to just wreck everything so they can rule
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:47.200]  a giant steaming pile and that's really what it comes down to they want the freedom to wreck your
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:57.680]  life because you living your life is upsetting to them you being empowered you being successful
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:04.320]  you being happy you being strong and then there's this icing of like dirtiness thugism
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.840]  where everybody's a tough guy and everybody's a thug and everybody's low down everybody's
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:16.480]  it's just all just uh it's just like wow man get me away from this
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:22.160]  get me away from this it's just there's no it's not even a culture
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:29.120]  it's television it's it's a hollywood it's all just an oozing stinking scared confused people
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.200]  flailing around and they think if they just had some power over somebody that that would fulfill
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:43.520]  them when just being a good strong human and you having power individually as a person with integrity
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:49.280]  is what would fulfill you instead you got to run my life to feel like you are fulfilled

[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.520]  illegal aliens traipse all over them and have giant demonstrations it's all about the absurdism
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:30.000]  of tyranny and getting us accustomed to being slaves this is the radical transformation obama
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.840]  obozo ozombie uh promised everyone and now we're learning who the real owners are
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.400]  warren buffett and the british government the french government and the imf and the head of
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:48.800]  the imf in france uh and the communist chinese here are the headlines imf warren's washington
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.560]  over debt impasse time magazine yes they're telling us they'll lower our credit rating and we'll
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.240]  collapse if we don't and then here's another one right here get your financial house in order china
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:07.600]  warns us as asia expresses concern over the 1.3 trillion of us debt we've all been positioned
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:12.400]  so that we're all debtors even if we're hardworking but all more people come in though get free
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.920]  welfare and get driver's license and you can vote and you could take alex's guns you could take alex's
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.560]  money and you could take everybody else's money so everybody's bankrupt and the bankers are offshore
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.880]  above the law and that's their plan and this country is going to be a hellhole when they're done
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:36.160]  and that's the plan that is the program to impoverish us to break us to domesticate us and
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:40.880]  bring in green tyranny neo feudalism that the globalists are all exempt from and oh look
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.120]  talk about who's got a plan for all this i'm got my little warren buffett article you know his
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.280]  company's gotten over 400 billion dollars and make your bailouts total in the last five years
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:57.520]  he personally recently got 10 billion from crisis era investments oh a little extra
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.840]  10 bill for him of taxpayer money no wonder he lobbies for higher taxes on rich people
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.440]  which the average blue collar worker thinks is a guy that's got 10 cents more than him
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.160]  warren buffett's like hey that guy that's got a household swimming pool and hires you to do stuff
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:17.040]  you know the economy and or that guy that owns a restaurant and hires he's rich he's bad that guy

[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:28.160]  put out in this film extract it's actually based on a plan outside austin texas that i guess got
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.320]  shut down for similar reasons but the point is oh yeah you didn't know that there's always
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.640]  a lot of stuff he thinks fiction really isn't fiction folks in a way you know what i mean
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:42.080]  give it inside baseball out here the point is is that oh yeah that guy that employs you he's rich

[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:33.360]  i see that i'm calling about the uh conversation you had earlier about the hr 32 30 um concerning
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:40.800]  the reserves getting paid my husband's a reservist he spent 30 years in afghanistan and he's not getting
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.600]  his reserve pay the money's there the first the illegal aliens are going to get there to get
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.920]  theirs though you bet they will but our soldiers aren't going to get there so they have put the
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:57.680]  bill before the house and it passed the senate didn't pass it and obama said if it did pass
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.480]  he wouldn't sign it anyway no no that's what they do and then they lie and say the republicans are
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:07.520]  the ones not paying the reservists just all deception because we're an enemy they treat us
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:13.760]  with total disdain because we are the enemy exactly the other thing that they're stopping
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.680]  is a lot of reservists because they can't find jobs when they get back from overseas
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:24.720]  they can give them a special duty an active duty order and they can get some pay but they've stopped
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:29.440]  all that now too they they won't reservists can't even do any active duty yeah well they passed that
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.600]  bill and signed it to get to regular trips paid so but i mean it's obama going you will get your
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.160]  social security will default and then the chinese government and the imf and others come and agree
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.600]  with him it's obama and a bunch of foreign globalists telling us what to do in our internal politics
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.680]  they have captured us just like a third world nation and they're playing us just right and
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:57.120]  left both sides and the other part is i think what we need is a military million lady march on
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  washington all the spouses should get together and go to washington i hear you i hear you i bless
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.120]  you ma'am and you know there's a lot of people trying to get marches and truck driver stuff and
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:10.160]  things going on there's some elements trying to stir it up and say hey we're going to arrest
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:15.760]  members of congress and we're going to do all this any talk like that is misguided or is a federal
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.640]  provocateur i don't know which one uh but i do support the truckers going to dc i do support
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:26.720]  marches on dc uh it's just that they're really they're trying to antagonize us into something
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.320]  or they're going to blow something up and blame it on us very soon i mean i just see that in the
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:33.760]  cards it's like you're playing poker you've been playing all night you know what they're about to
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.760]  play you see they got ace of spades folks boom stagecare and i'm telling you we got to get the
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.880]  word out on that and psychologically awaken people and inoculate them in a positive way so
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:49.440]  that they understand even if terror is real it's going to be used to take our freedom so so never
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.040]  give up your freedom so now i'll keep my freedom and you know look it's just like the public schools
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.160]  have the article are now banning playing with balls at lunch saying it could be dangerous this is how
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.120]  they do it like i shouldn't joke and say they should have tsa randomly in fields to stop honeybees
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.280]  from stinging people because they kill 200 plus people a year they probably will do that next
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:18.400]  but then push deadly vaccines on you it's all a power grab folks let's talk to dave dave in

[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:24.880]  this book it's very powerful white girl bleed a lot dealing with well racial attacks against
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.520]  whites being organized nationwide now the media is basically covering it up and he was you know
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:35.440]  first known for writing a book about a black fellow that was wrongly accused of a crime as well or
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:39.680]  exposing that but it just shows how the media is creating this vulcanized society we're talking
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:46.880]  about a moment here's a minute or two of the speech obama just finished giving where he is
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:54.720]  saying america won't be held hostage when it's the senate blocking this and obama care
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:58.240]  is completely out of control it's wrecking the country they can't even implement it
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.200]  and all they're doing is saying you know do a few things like medical devices don't tax them
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.000]  he's like no and then the imf the communist chinese they're all saying you'll do what obama says
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:11.760]  this is the breaking of america you're witnessing and and the x like
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:19.200]  like like the republicans want something free an xbox or something when the truth is
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:23.520]  it's obama putting america on welfare and trying to collectivize things here's a minute or two of
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:27.680]  that and then we're going to go to our guest to take your questions so i'll try to be brief at the
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:32.960]  top this morning i had a chance to speak with speaker baner and i told him what i've been
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:38.880]  saying publicly that i am happy to talk with him and other republicans about anything that's why
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:44.320]  they refuse all the bills i think are important but also issues that they think are important
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:52.640]  but i also told him that having such a conversation talks negotiations shouldn't
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:58.400]  require hanging the threats of a government shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the american
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:01.760]  people by the way it's the senate that shut the government down think about it this way
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.320]  the american people do not get to demand a ransom for doing their jobs
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.760]  you don't get a chance to call your bank and say i'm not going to pay my mortgage this month
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:19.520]  unless you throw in a new car and an xbox if you're in negotiations around buying somebody's house
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:25.440]  you don't get to say uh well let's talk about the price i'm going to pay and if you don't give me
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:31.440]  the price then i'm going to burn down your house that's enough shutting down ladies and gentlemen
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:38.800]  uh they are threatening to devalue the currency further and default and shut the entire credit
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.360]  system down if we don't do what they say they held us hostages in 2008 with the banker bailout
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:51.680]  so again it's the opposite of what they're saying and it's it's flipping everything
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:56.320]  meanwhile they're holding all the monuments national parks hostage going into national parks
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:59.920]  run by private interest and saying we don't care if it's all paid for and you're running it
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.360]  no one's allowed to be in here they're holding everyone hostage not letting veterans go to
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:08.000]  memorials in the mall but the illegal aliens can have a rally right now i mean this is just
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.240]  unbelievable but he has more on constituents so what do you expect i'm going to shut up now and
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:16.160]  get to a colon uh here who wrote this book white girl bleed a lot
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:24.960]  we're going to go to colon flairity uh to break down uh his book white girl bleed a lot
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:33.280]  and the book just came out the return of racial violence to america to look at what has caused
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.040]  this because he's written a detailed study of examples and broken this down and so many of
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.760]  the news articles he has in here i've seen them i've read them but they're always local it's never
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:47.360]  a national news story and so sir thank you for coming on the show to break this down for folks
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:51.680]  that haven't read your book or don't know about it in a nutshell tell us why you wrote this book
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:57.360]  and what it encompasses white girl bleed a lot is about an epidemic of racial violence all over
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:03.920]  the country a document more than 500 cases in over a hundred cities but even even more important than
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:10.960]  that uh i document how the media ignores it condones it excuse it excuses it and sometimes even denies
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:18.880]  it and it's getting worse i mean why do you think it's getting worse you know i i don't i don't i'm
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:24.720]  not really that good on the big picture causes and solutions i also don't do apologies i i just
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:30.240]  really document it's happening that's why i wrote the book it's because i was meeting so many people
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:35.200]  who were saying colin that's not happening but then i was looking i was seeing all these stories
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:40.640]  the stories you were talking about and then i would look to compare this what i saw on the paper
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:46.960]  with what i saw on youtube and it was like i was watching stories from two different universes
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:52.480]  so i don't know why it's getting worse it is getting worse it's happening in many many places big
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:58.320]  and small around the country places we would expect it places we wouldn't when we come back
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:02.240]  i want to go over when you first started to see this and discover it and some of the
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:06.880]  cases and examples but the key you just hit i because reading the book it was like deja vu
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:10.160]  because as a news guy i've already been studying this but there was a lot of cases i didn't know
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:15.360]  about that were in the book where the media well there's cases where reporters are attacked and
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:20.080]  they're told well we can't say you were racially attacked because that would be racist there's a
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:26.400]  lot of reporters under attack that's kind of the ironic part of the book yeah we're gonna come back
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:29.600]  and then they're told they can't talk about how they were racially attacked and told it was racial
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.040]  really crazy and msnbc i believe was mainly behind it and the college is promoting it that
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:41.520]  it's like a duty i mean being white is inherently bad and so it's just incredible it's similar to
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:51.360]  the clan attacking black people we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn

[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:20.000]  there in the break i was watching fox news out there in the control room
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:28.400]  and obama said that tea party republicans are holding the country hostage like a nuclear bomb
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:36.080]  in the words of war and the scam artist buffett and that uh in just a week of quote this nonsense
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:40.080]  they're gonna destroy the faith and credit of america and again they're always intending for
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:44.480]  us to default they're totally bankrupt down the road they're maneuvering us obama says when he
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:50.720]  raises the debt ceiling that doesn't raise debt and they're maneuvering us into this but but lying
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:58.880]  to the ignorant public and sitting there telling them that it's republicans folks obama care i think
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:03.200]  mitch mcconnell's actually right now i'm gonna go back to our guests i've thought about this deeply
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:09.520]  it's immoral to let this pass but you've tried to let it pass if they actually step back and go okay
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:16.480]  fine you get obama care it's so horrible it won't even work and then it all just falls apart anyways
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:21.760]  instead they're going to blame everything falling apart on those of us that don't want to wreck the
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:29.120]  country because i can really see where this is going but uh oh it's disgusting let me just ask
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:37.680]  collin flairity his take a best-selling author researcher a journalist um he joins us to talk
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.800]  about white girl bleed a lot but he's also written other featured stories in the los angeles times
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:47.600]  npr as well as an hour-long special on court tv and i should add his story about how a black man
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:51.920]  was unjustly convicted of trying to kill his white girlfriend resulted in the man's release from
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:57.200]  state prison that's a famous case well that was uh kelvin wiley so a lot of folks will spin it but
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:01.840]  as he said he's not going to apologize oh you better apologize you know talking about the fbi
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.080]  crime statistics of black on white crime being so disproportionate he's just a journalist telling
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:11.440]  the truth so i'm going to shut up now sir and let you have the floor and break down the book we
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:18.960]  sell at info war store dot com white girl bleed a lot because again reading this it's worse than
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:24.400]  i even thought tell us what's really happening and the time frame of why this has been accelerating
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.520]  in some of the cases well i'm not you know i don't know why it's been accelerating but let's you
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:35.680]  know let's break down one case that happened last weekend and multiply this by 500 multiply it by
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.880]  a thousand and that's what the book is all about uh in fresno over the weekend did you see a story
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:47.520]  where one person was shot uh one person died and 13 people were shot and the according to the
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:54.960]  washington post this happened at a uh motorcycle a multiracial motorcycle club that was having a dance
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:03.280]  well the real story is uh this was a part this party was part of a weekend gathering
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:10.160]  of the largest gathering of black motorcycles on the west coast of america this was black mob
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:16.640]  violence there were five thousand black motorcycles in town happens twice a year in fresno nobody on
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:23.440]  the planet thinks this is a multiracial motorcycle group any of the dozens of groups that were there
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:29.840]  and so they they they kind of diminish the violence they they excuse they kind of deny who's involved
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:37.120]  in it and here's why this is important uh every day uh you and i pick up a newspaper and we realize
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:42.800]  we live in the most race conscious country in the world we read about black caucuses black churches
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:49.760]  black colleges black labor unions black professional groups yet we turn around and and many of these
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.120]  stories are written by members of the national association of black journalists yet we have a
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:00.880]  story like fresno and we say well what's up with this incredible amount of black mob violence that
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:06.320]  happened just for example in fresno or in seattle the night before that and these same journalists
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:12.160]  will look at you and say we are colorblind so that's why i wrote the book there's so much denial
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.720]  out there i just wrote the book for people that that when they're done reading the book they just
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:23.600]  no one can say this isn't happening well i mean look when when when white mobs in in mob psychology
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:28.880]  get together uh and go out and attack black people which has been a phenomenon uh that's been phased
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:34.080]  out thank god i've gone out and protested it and covered it because it's wrong and it's a gang
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.840]  mentality and they say white members of the cook last clan drug a black guy to death but when black
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:44.480]  folks you know burn a what little white kid up with a blow torch they won't even say it's a black
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:50.880]  lady because it's the opposite it's omitting things and and it's it's crazy political correctness
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:57.520]  you know alex i don't know that you or i are saying that every we have to document the race
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:04.000]  of every single crime that takes place in every single newspaper but the the the numbers are so
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:11.280]  exponentially out of proportion and the papers ignore it on such an epic level i wrote the book
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:16.560]  because i really wanted to call out the media for ignoring it and denying it well sure i mean it's
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:22.240]  orwellian colin uh because i'll see articles as a news guy reading hundreds of days scanning them
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:29.040]  and it'll say uh you know uh family attacked in central park by a group of men wearing sports
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:35.200]  jackets or or or you'll be a soccer type jerseys and they don't even say what color the guys were
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:39.440]  we go oh those will be black guys it turned out it was because they won't say it's like
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:44.400]  there is a male 35 years old scene running out of the liquor store and they won't say the race
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:50.880]  bingo then it i mean it's it's it's wild i mean they'll say the color of a car somebody's in but
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:56.640]  they won't say what color it is and and and the media does this as a rule they will not say
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:02.640]  what color someone is but only if they're black if it's wider hispanic or asian they will say it
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:06.400]  because obviously you know you need to know if there's somebody who's fled the scene what color
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:12.080]  they were well reporters have conferences a society of professional journalists and the
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.720]  national association of black journalists and other groups have conferences about how to cover
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:23.280]  these crimes and they're very explicit melissa harris period msnbc she had a whole show where she
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:29.680]  was talking about uh how how how she thought that black people should not report should black
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:36.400]  reporters should not report black crime uh and muslim reporters should not report muslim crimes
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.000]  if it makes blacks or muslims look bad now normally they have these conversations in private
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.120]  at you know at the move on dot org conventions so i was happy that she had it on the air and i
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:53.360]  write about that in the book as well it's amazing and and we see a lot of examples of this give us
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.480]  some more examples that are in the book of the hundreds well much but you know i mean the the
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:05.440]  book gets its title from uh uh book gets its title from chicago or from milwaukee i'm sorry
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:11.920]  uh where 50 to 100 black people went into a convenience store uh they looted it on video um
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:16.880]  then they they they took their groceries and candy to a nearby park where they assaulted
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.720]  10 white kids having a july 4 picnic at one point a black woman is standing over a white
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:29.920]  woman looks down and says to her friends white girl bleed a lot uh enormous amount of this
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:36.560]  black mob violence happening all over the country enormous amount of denial on the part of uh people
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:44.080]  in the press and you know the and multiply that one k here and here's the here's the story this
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:50.240]  year the story this year that is is not that it's happening in the big cities uh boston new york
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.600]  baltimore chicago philly but it's happening in the in the places that unless you've been there you
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:02.320]  wouldn't expect it like when i talk around the country on this topic i i always say does anybody
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:09.120]  know that milwaukee minneapolis seattle portland are centers of racial violence nobody knows this
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:15.120]  but milwaukee absolutely is what about the small cities what about peoria greensboro
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:21.840]  durham springfield peoria illinois is a hotbed of racial violence and all this is happening
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:26.880]  nobody's connecting the dots and so that's why i wrote the book to connect the dots
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:34.560]  without generalizations without stereotypes but also without apologies well then you have
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:38.560]  something like the unfortunate trayvon martin situation where the media does the opposite
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:42.640]  and calls some guy george zehrman who i'm sorry does not look like a white guy to me
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:46.800]  and and and then they make that that he's a white guy and then he's a racist and
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:50.880]  all this other stuff i mean it look i know why this is increasing amongst other things
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:57.440]  the the controlled corporate media hypes racial division 24 7 and in hollywood and all the shows
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.280]  the white guy is the bad guy and so if people literally i think just like the klan hyped up
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:06.960]  that black people were the problem so whites would go out and kill blacks i mean it's the
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:17.200]  exact same thing there's an enormous amount of you know it's being taught in schools churches
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:21.520]  and homes right now in over 200 school districts around the country and i've written about this
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:26.480]  they learn critical race theory which says race racism is everywhere racism is permanent
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:31.600]  they're teaching this to grade school kids so when you see these videotapes which are which
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:35.680]  are by the way there's thousands of the white liberals made the night black mob violence
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:41.440]  but the there are many many people who celebrate it when you see these videos of black mob violence
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:48.560]  um no no they have websites and they have websites that show it and it's like celebrated yeah it's
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:54.000]  so and so it's it's celebrated but you can see the anger and resentment
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.800]  and you can see and you can see it's now it's being taught in schools grade schools forget
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:04.000]  colleges we know there are lost cause but it's being taught in grade schools wisconsin california
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:11.840]  canada get these are statewide programs it really is amazing you know i grew up in dallas texas and
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:18.640]  i'm you know a white guy and i never heard racial epithets at the deer camp around what you call
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:25.040]  rednecks i never saw or heard any of it uh then when i visited the north more i i noticed everybody
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:28.960]  was making jokes at each other but it was more of a joke thing but i mean i just it just seems
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:34.880]  like things are so racially charged now and then it's clear who's hyping it is the ford foundation
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:41.520]  the msnbc all of them i mean here's an example they go on msnbc every few weeks and say alex
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:47.120]  shows us deeply racist and then show no proof of what i've said nothing i've stated nothing i've done
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.280]  and then i've actually uh i mean the good news is is most black folks are run into are actually
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:57.520]  listeners are awakened or freaked out by this but there are definitely kind of you know gangster type
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:03.920]  thug like folks uh you know kind of like the clan attracts white trash or whatever who who who really
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:09.840]  are believing it and and and and it's a holier than thou thing it's it's almost like gang war how
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:15.920]  the prisons are all segregated with black ispanic white asian gangs i think the left is really trying
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:22.080]  to segregate america into groups because this is all they've got they don't want racism and division
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:27.200]  to die and they i think they've been very successful relaunching it well they've been successful
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:33.600]  but what we have on our side is we have the truth and ten years ago i could not have written this
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:39.040]  book because there were no videos but now there are videos there's an enormous amount of videos
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:44.480]  where we can speak the truth to msnbc and you know whatever anybody calls you a racist or anything
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:50.000]  i mean it reminds me of what the great thomas sol says he says uh a racist is that any conservative
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.120]  winning an argument with a liberal so we don't have to worry too much about what those clowns at msnbc
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:01.440]  say but i want people to be wealthy happy to have good families live in peace this political correctness
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:06.320]  where all over the country they're trying to ban the word brown paperback which has never any has
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:11.920]  any racial connection now if i have white napkins it means i'm racist i mean it's like a mass mental
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:16.960]  illness or something it's a mass mental illness but there are there are also a lot of good people
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:21.840]  speaking out there's people like telly stark's wrote a book called the uncivil war there's all
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:26.320]  the stuff of thomas sol there's all the stuff of walter william there's a lot of people you know
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:31.040]  where the people you know where the people speak out this the truth not in the newspapers but in
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:35.360]  the comment section of the newspaper those i don't even read the stories anymore i just go
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:40.640]  into the comments right a lot of newspapers are getting rid of the comments now admitting uh this
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:45.120]  came out last week i'm sure you saw it admitting that there's extremism and libertarianism and
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:50.880]  racism and conservatism in the comments so they're just getting rid of them i i write about that in
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:55.760]  the book how some how some comments sections are are heavily censored but there are so many
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:00.320]  places there's too many places now there's too many ways for the truth to get out talk radio
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:05.920]  when we talked about white girl bleed a lot the incident in milwaukee uh the police did not even
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:12.160]  take a report when that happened the next day the kids go down to the to the station and they said
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:16.480]  what happened to these people who beat us up and they go we don't know what you're talking about
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:22.800]  they went to talk radio and so the talk radio blew that case up and i was about to say the the the
[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:29.200]  increasing racial attacks in central park the media has tried to cover that up but uh so many
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:35.120]  people involved in it brag so it forced it out and the police will stand there if there's any
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.640]  minority which encourages it i mean i guarantee if they let whites as a general group do whatever
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.320]  they wanted there would be bad criminal whites that would go out and do this kind of stuff
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.320]  just like the klan but you know take the Puerto Ricans raping the women the police would do nothing
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:53.840]  hundreds of times to say they would lie because it is authorized here's an example you got a group
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.520]  of motorcyclists turns out to be cops some of them going and messing with the suv attacking it
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.920]  and then the cops new day one that was their cops and their people but they covered it up it's the
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:10.720]  same deal where the police are afraid to go after their own or any minority you know good example
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:15.840]  of that is uh the iowa state fair a couple year two years ago they had they had hundreds of black
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:22.000]  people over a several night period beating people both in and out of the iowa state fair de moine
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:28.960]  iowa so some reporters went to uh uh uh somebody filed a police report that people were chanting
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:35.760]  beat whitey night so reporters went to the police spokesman lori lovarato and and they said lori
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:40.720]  what's up with is that really are black people really attacking white people mobs of black people
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:46.000]  at the iowa state fair she said yeah it's happening we don't know why but it's happening she was fired
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:53.760]  for that and so there are to me cops on the beat are heroes but the people who run police departments
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:59.760]  are are much less so and a lot of times they'll get in trouble and they'll be fired for uh for
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:07.200]  for for for telling the truth about racial violence other examples i mean i mean this is
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:13.920]  a book you literally can't put down info war store.com or call toll free 888-2533139 we have
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:19.440]  the author on with us uh call inflarity right now the return of racial violence to america
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:24.240]  and and i think the prisons are part of this too because they're all divided into gang groups and
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:28.880]  then once you do that you have to continue it because it really is in racial groups i mean
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:34.080]  america is being balkanized by design why do you think the the the authoritarian left is what
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:39.600]  i call them why are they so obsessed with creating racial division oh man you know alex i wish i knew
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:45.120]  the answer to that but there's absolutely no question that we are we are the most racially
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:49.760]  conscious country in the world and it's getting worse i'm one of these i guess i don't know i guess
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.880]  i'm one of these poor naive people who believes in one race the human race so i don't buy any
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:49:00.080]  of the racial divisions uh but it's getting worse you know i was i was uh i was gonna be on your
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:05.360]  show last thursday but things happen so we put it off till today just since thursday well look
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:11.040]  what's happened in raleigh north carolina we have mobs of black people on two nights in a row
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:18.640]  roaming the streets of downtown raleigh beating people out we had uh uh in see up near seattle
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:26.880]  washington we had a carload of black people stop a hurl racial insults stop attack a soldier
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:33.920]  killing him in seattle washington then we had this business in fresno five a party of five hundred
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:40.960]  or more black bikers creating violence in mayhem on epic scale so this is happening all over the
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:47.360]  place uh why we can't talk about i'm not sure but i will tell you for your list anybody listening
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:53.600]  to this the way to talk about it is don't generalize don't stereotype but we don't have to apologize
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:58.160]  either for noticing well i mean the issue here is is that's the political correctness saying if
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:02.960]  you're racially attacked or see it don't talk about it because hey you you pretty much deserve it
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:08.240]  take the bikers that it turns out were cops it was a double gang deal mo it looks to me on the
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:12.640]  video like the famous new york deal that nobody's pointing out looks like it was probably racial
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:20.480]  as well if you really look at it and it or at least has that connotation you know if it had been
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.000]  white bikers attacking a black guy and there were a lot of black there were a lot of black
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.840]  bikers involved in that new york incident but a lot of people think because they're Hispanic
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:34.960]  they can't be black the biker that the the biker a lot of bikers were involved were from the
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:41.040]  dominican republic that's why they they they're black and Hispanic a lot of black people involved
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:45.280]  in that well my whole thing is it's gang it's just all gang culture stay there want to come back
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:49.760]  and talk about this because folks this is going on everywhere and then people that don't want to be
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:54.800]  part of it they get you know called sellouts or whatever because they don't want to be racist
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:51:00.880]  this is bad when an emergency happens you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family an

[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:27.840]  act the democrats have been the party the cook looks clan it's just a fact and they were already
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:32.960]  racial politics and they lost because of mainly white christians and veterans coming home say

[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:48.640]  wasn't popular but then the democrats switched over to make it racial politics with the quote
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:53.520]  minorities who they're going to make the majority and then it's right back it's racial politics

[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:24.160]  against this as you were saying because it's getting so bad and i i just hope people recognize
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:30.800]  msnbc for what they are they literally are the clan of the 21st century pushing race politics
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:39.520]  well it doesn't doesn't it isn't it reflected in the other news programs at ms at mbc isn't msnbc
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:45.920]  so bad they're torn their racial politics are tarnishing the entire brand yes mbc meet the
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:52.640]  press is at historic lows for ratings how can that not be connected but i mean the power structures
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:57.040]  got to know it's not working it's cartoonish what they do don't want to turn your guns in you're
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:03.360]  racist nra is the new clan when the nra was founded by white christians to arm freed black slaves
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:09.120]  on record that's the truth but as long as there's people like you telling the truth and i'm telling
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:15.200]  the truth i don't think msnbc has a chance i don't think they do either i mean this is the kind of
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:19.440]  media that called charleton has been racist when he was in the civil rights movement i mean there's
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:26.800]  just no end to these people they really are just thugs at msnbc there's no end to them but there's
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:34.800]  also an almost limitless supply of examples that show how um how how diluted they are i mean you
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:40.560]  look at baltimore baltimore this once great city where now if you go to downtown baltimore it's just
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:46.880]  one episode of black mob violence after another man cal moeller went to see jango in the richest
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:52.320]  part of chicago and had black folks tell him and his white buddy get out of here we're gonna kill you
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:58.400]  you know i mean how could you have a better example than that of the the enormous resentment
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:04.640]  that is producing the violence and you know what makes me sad i mean most white folks aren't buying
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:10.880]  into this but i mean this is actually increasing this is actually encouraging the white supremacist
[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:17.280]  in people i mean their ranks are growing now and that's really a really bad byproduct i mean how
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:26.320]  do we counter that yeah he can't hear me because well we're gonna counter it with i can hear you i

[03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:28.400]  war the media has been stirring up one-sided race war predominantly and skype is a weird
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:33.680]  phenomenon sometimes when we got music jacked up going to somebody they can't hear me and then we
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:37.280]  had to like turn that feed down to where he could then hear what i said since two feeds going to
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:40.800]  my guest i don't know how it all works but he couldn't hear what i was saying till we turned
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:47.280]  the audio down and then he could hear the end of it the point i was getting at collin was i mean
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:50.960]  i've answered my own question the power structure doesn't want us unifying around the bill of
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:56.240]  rights constitution and liberty for all they want us divided come to the big city new york
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:03.840]  borough style politics and the question is you know can we stop that but i was just getting
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:10.320]  into how it's encouraging then you know radicals on the other side of the fence as well i mean i
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:16.480]  am seeing an increase uh just in rhetoric from white folks to people that never had been racist
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:22.320]  you know feeling like they're being persecuted so they're now becoming more more more angry and
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:29.920]  that's exactly what msnbc wants yeah psychiatrists tell us we're only as sick as our secrets and
[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:36.000]  what are we more secretive about than race so i know that when we start talking about this racial
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:45.440]  violence with more openness and candor i am just not meant to let him finish his statement now a
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.360]  skype cut out try to reconnect i want to be able to finish his point i want this guy back on over
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:52.960]  phone or something because this guy's a little bit a little bit dodgy there it's a whole another
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:57.040]  kettle of fish as they say uh but but separately i wanted to bring this final point up to him
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:01.280]  is home and getting back on take the poor black lady that got shot and killed last week running
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:05.680]  from a checkpoint i immediately just heard a woman had been killed knew they were having drills
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:11.040]  and don salazar found it we guessed they were lying she hadn't shot at them it turned out we were right
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:16.560]  okay and then i immediately saw comments saying alex is only mad because she's white she was
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:21.120]  driving a fancy car i saw that on youtube and on info wars and i don't even really read a lot of
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:27.760]  comments i just saw them and i thought man people are already thinking racially as if i wouldn't
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:32.960]  care if it was a black lady i mean i could it doesn't even enter my brain whether she was
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:40.640]  you know black white purple green i mean it's just it's so old i mean they obviously know
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:44.800]  saying brown paper bag is racist is not racist they just want us all of each other's throats
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:51.600]  obsessed over everything to create total division or then just collapsing and saying i'll do whatever
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:57.680]  the government says just don't call me racist so that's my point right there is that is that this
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:03.520]  woman got executed and under very suspicious circumstances and the family says that the
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:11.760]  official story isn't true what is your take on um on on how when the government kills somebody
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:16.880]  though they never try to bring the race issue and at least part of the time well there's so many
[03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:21.440]  there's so many wacky narratives out there about race have you alex have you ever noticed when
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:27.200]  when you're talking about race it always takes about a minute for the conversation to get completely
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:33.200]  absurd and because when people have these racial beliefs are so irrational that they can't sustain
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:38.560]  them for more than a minute and so when when and so when we start telling the truth about race
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:45.520]  people get freaked out about it so even the government can't sustain it as you can tell
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:49.760]  from listening to msnbc which is basically you know the mouthpiece for that kind of thing i hear you
