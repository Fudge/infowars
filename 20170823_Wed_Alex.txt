[00:00.000 --> 00:20.440]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:20.440 --> 00:26.440]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic
[00:26.440 --> 00:39.440]  Takeover. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:39.440 --> 00:48.640]  Donald Trump is so incredibly riveting. I can't turn away. This is the ultimate reality
[00:48.640 --> 00:54.440]  show. He's a real president. He's surrounded by total criminals trying to kill him. He's
[00:54.440 --> 00:59.040]  doing the best job he can to try to turn the economy around. He made a big mistake with
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.640]  this Afghanistan expansion if you believe it's really an expansion. I think the jury's
[01:02.640 --> 01:11.640]  out on that. But then I watched live last night that hour-plus-long just volley after
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.360]  volley of truth against the scum and then to watch them lie at just before the speech
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.480]  in Phoenix and after the speech at just a wall of fraud. Everything they say about him
[01:23.480 --> 01:29.880]  is what they're doing. And it made my head spin. An example was all over the Phoenix
[01:29.880 --> 01:37.880]  and National News it was bikers rally against Trump and then they'd show shots from 300
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.800]  yards away of bikers and I went, wait, those are bikers for Trump. And then it was, but
[01:44.800 --> 01:50.160]  they wanted to make it look like everyone was against Trump. They are going beyond
[01:50.160 --> 01:56.440]  any level of lies. The Soviet Union or anybody ever else, North Korean propaganda has nothing
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.800]  on this. That's why they said bigger crowds will be that are against him that are inside
[02:01.800 --> 02:07.960]  and then a few hundred scumbags showed up. And because the cops did their job and weren't
[02:07.960 --> 02:13.160]  on the side of the globalist like Charlottesville, it didn't turn into a melee. When the anti-fog
[02:13.160 --> 02:20.320]  attack people, they got pepper sprayed. It's just crazy. I can't even respond anymore.
[02:20.320 --> 02:27.720]  It's just, it is a full on upside down world where they're creating an entire false reality
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.800]  and then having for consensus. You wonder why CNN, MSNBC, their shows have six, seven,
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.360]  eight, 10 panelists on at a time all just going, we agree, we agree, we agree. The talking
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.200]  points put out and then they all just parrot in some group think for the weakest minded
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.960]  people who tune in to somehow think this is consensus. And then you see the folks by the
[02:50.960 --> 02:58.600]  propaganda. They are the dumbest slobs, the most helpless people and the globalist are
[02:58.600 --> 03:11.160]  in the WikiLeaks like spiders discussing moths or flies they've tied up in their webs. Ah,
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.320]  this one will be delicious. I hate the scum. They don't taste as good as they used to.
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.640]  I mean, it's basically like that. I have a lot of my prettys tied up, but they're starting
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.160]  to struggle. What do we do? We'll have them fight with each other then. I mean, it's like
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.680]  demon spiders talking to each other and I'm like, God, we're ruled by this. How the hell
[03:28.680 --> 03:35.520]  is this happening? And then there is such a hunger. I mean, they've got a $10 million
[03:35.520 --> 03:45.720]  contract out. We've confirmed to news, to pay. They pay grants to the New York Times
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.960]  and CNN and all these things. They pay writers to write stories lying about us and they can't
[03:50.960 --> 03:58.560]  find anything. When they make stuff up, it blows up in their face and I just, you realize
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.640]  they hate me because I see through them. You see through them and I'm here letting you
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.800]  know you're not insane. When you see their wall of lies, you know, there's other people
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.560]  that recognize it as well. We have solidarity and they want to break that off. They want
[04:12.560 --> 04:17.320]  you alone. They want you desperate. They want to force you through peer pressure to join
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.160]  their false reality. And that's in the Facebook documents that came out this year, not just
[04:22.160 --> 04:28.200]  the WikiLeaks. And you read this stuff and it's like, these executives are evil. They
[04:28.200 --> 04:36.120]  are cold-hearted. They are beyond the gulf of this reality. They're in hell. And I don't
[04:36.120 --> 04:43.280]  want anything to do with these people. We have the epic excerpts coming up and it's
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.240]  just, I can't turn away. Plus, I'm right in the middle of it. I'm like the number two
[04:48.240 --> 04:55.680]  enemy now. Bannon has receded. I'm definitely the number two target. It's just, it is surreal.
[04:55.680 --> 05:03.400]  I mean, literal goblin creatures attacking. I mean, you deserve a deep restful sleep with

[06:02.800 --> 06:07.920]  consumer of news and information. And in the last four or five years doing more and more
[06:07.920 --> 06:12.760]  research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the
[06:12.760 --> 06:18.240]  fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:18.240 --> 06:23.760]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing
[06:23.760 --> 06:29.440]  and then processing. And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated
[06:29.440 --> 06:36.260]  bone broth from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and super

[07:58.520 --> 08:12.520]  info wars store.com crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones. Coming
[08:12.520 --> 08:23.000]  to you live from the front lines of the info war. I have made a lot of critical discoveries.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.680]  You don't always get what you want, but you get what you need. Caught the Rolling Stones
[08:27.680 --> 08:35.880]  and it's true. But now the tumblers are all coming into place. Everything's aligning.
[08:35.880 --> 08:46.360]  We know the plan. It's very, very clear. We knew that the glove was teddy. Wicked taste.
[08:46.360 --> 08:54.080]  But now we see the full body of the monster we face. We can even see the ticks clinging
[08:54.080 --> 09:03.240]  to its hairy belly. We can smell it and hear the snort of its nostrils. We can see the
[09:03.240 --> 09:15.800]  wake of death behind it. And so we steal ourselves for the fight. And the great rush of strength
[09:15.800 --> 09:26.920]  and commitment of our ancestors breathing life into our sales upon this sea of chaos
[09:26.920 --> 09:48.440]  and turmoil as we ride the tempest, the black squall into the future in through and beyond.
[09:48.440 --> 09:52.600]  And a lot of people are scared right now. They can feel the energy and they think it's
[09:52.600 --> 10:00.400]  the enemy's energy. No. It's God coming back into the world. It's light. And it's evil.
[10:00.400 --> 10:08.160]  It's already had a long season realizing its time is short. The fear you sense is the fear
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.880]  that evil has in its heart. And don't let that be projected onto you. Have good cheer,
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.800]  my friends, and know I'll never leave you. You'll never leave me. And God will never
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.200]  leave any of us as long as we choose free will and choose God. We are in God's presence.
[10:25.200 --> 10:34.760]  We are with God and the gift of consciousness and life and we are saved. And the enemy hates
[10:34.760 --> 10:41.320]  that so much and wants to convince you that they have control over you just like Faust.
[10:41.320 --> 10:51.480]  And his Faustian bargain that was a fraud, he could have turned back any time, but he
[10:51.480 --> 11:08.120]  couldn't because he lied to himself. So you choose because there's now absolutely zero
[11:08.120 --> 11:17.520]  doubt that the world system being constructed is designed to do one thing and that's kill
[11:17.520 --> 11:31.840]  your soul. One thing and it's got to bring you down and twist you and abuse you and have
[11:31.840 --> 11:44.080]  you abuse others and lower you down before it tears you apart. You've got to be lowered
[11:44.080 --> 11:51.320]  first before you can even be on the level to have this done to you. And the gate through
[11:51.320 --> 11:59.800]  which you entered into this evil is people seeking power and to not have fear and to
[11:59.800 --> 12:08.520]  be enlightened and be as gods and power trips and be so positive. But it's only the image
[12:08.520 --> 12:19.240]  of the universe you have in your mind, the image of God that you can begin to understand.
[12:19.240 --> 12:27.040]  You are not that thing that you can sense. And the devil says, Oh, you are that thing
[12:27.040 --> 12:46.360]  here. I have a path for you and you will attain it. All you will attain is falling, not rising.
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.000]  How do I cover all this? The incredible epic rampage against tyranny last night by President
[12:52.000 --> 13:08.040]  Trump. Beautiful. The spirit alone of defiance quenched a part of my soul that was in pain
[13:08.040 --> 13:18.040]  and gave me even more strength to go forward stronger. A battering ram, a signet, a figurehead,
[13:18.040 --> 13:30.680]  a standard. And that's why they hate him as flawed as a man as he is. He's not out to
[13:30.680 --> 13:38.320]  get you. Look at these headlines. Germany, journalists get six months' sentence for
[13:38.320 --> 13:45.560]  criticizing Islam mildly and pointing out that the Muslims allied with the Nazis across
[13:45.560 --> 13:54.120]  the board. Now, Germany is the model of global government now even beyond England. England
[13:54.120 --> 14:05.960]  has struggled out of its clutches a bit. England's bucking the peer pressure a bit because they've
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.280]  already been pulled halfway down the spider hold and been bit. You know, it really stinks
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.040]  down there and it's painful down there and it's scary down there. And these people running
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.640]  things are a bunch of pedophiles and they're not too nice and we need to get away from
[14:18.640 --> 14:25.160]  these folks right now. And the little pussians are there trying to keep the UK tied down
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.440]  and to keep the Germans tied down and the Spanish tied down. Everyone else tied down
[14:29.440 --> 14:36.240]  as the drawbridge lays open and huge hordes of military aged men come rushing and screaming,
[14:36.240 --> 14:41.320]  give us the women, give us the money we were promised because it's advertised by the UN
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.640]  that that's the case. This is just one article of hundreds that are all just as important.
[14:45.640 --> 14:54.720]  It's up on infowars.com. Paul Joseph Watson. Thunder buckets of stupid ESPN pulls game
[14:54.720 --> 15:01.600]  announcer who's been there for years, Robert Lee, because his name is too triggering despite
[15:01.600 --> 15:09.560]  the fact that Robert Lee is Asian. Yes, it's a common Chinese name. You know, Bruce Lee
[15:09.560 --> 15:16.720]  and you say, well, this is insanity. No, it's not. It's designed to have them move the
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.560]  Overton window to the most extreme craziness. So you'll then accept anything. They're banning
[15:21.560 --> 15:30.080]  every couple days. I see a library, a city council building, a dormitory, a public school,
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.000]  an elementary school, a hospital, changing the name from Lynch because there's been
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.800]  a lot of wealthy Irish named Lynch that gave heavily to hospitals and things that have
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.120]  nothing to do with there being a trial of a family that lynched their son called Lynch.
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.640]  But it's again, literal war on words. They know what they're doing at CNN. They're not
[15:51.640 --> 15:59.040]  whacked out leftist. They are the priests of psych warfare brain damaging their slaves.
[15:59.040 --> 16:05.040]  As much as I was disgusted by the frothing Seattle folks trying to attack me, they all
[16:05.040 --> 16:17.000]  look like soul suck zombies. Those are mind control victims. Orthodox Islam is being orchestrated.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.280]  That's my big epiphany is that it's all true. It's the one thing you don't touch. I've had
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.120]  globalist top journalists, you know, enemy operatives all tell me, Alex, we're, we're
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.240]  going to, we're going to find something. We're going to dig something up. We're going to
[16:30.240 --> 16:35.000]  get you. I know it's existential. You want power. You want control. I expect you to attack
[16:35.000 --> 16:42.440]  me. But it's about there having the will to put out a fraud, a straw man to destroy who
[16:42.440 --> 16:48.200]  I really am. Same thing with Trump. And they tell me, look, we will go easy. Just stop
[16:48.200 --> 16:53.400]  criticizing Islam and let us bring the Muslims in. And it's been decided because there's
[16:53.400 --> 16:58.120]  going to be 3 billion of them in just 10 years. There's a billion 500 plus million right
[16:58.120 --> 17:03.920]  now that, that they are demographically, they are going to Islamify us and bring them in
[17:03.920 --> 17:08.520]  and merge it with leftist stuff. And, and absolutely they're going to run our lives.
[17:08.520 --> 17:11.360]  And I'm somebody who was against the wars and all this because it was designed to destabilize
[17:11.360 --> 17:16.840]  them, bring them down, put the radicals in and prepare it. And then they use fighting
[17:16.840 --> 17:20.600]  the Muslims to sap our military, our treasure. I mean, the globalists are getting us both
[17:20.600 --> 17:29.960]  ways and walking us into our own Vietnam part two, Afghan war part two, but this time for
[17:29.960 --> 17:36.760]  us, not the Russians. And it is just total commitment to evil. And they are seeing Islam
[17:36.760 --> 17:41.600]  as their sword. And because of the mental illness and the inbreeding and the, the ugliness
[17:41.600 --> 17:49.120]  and just all of it, we are to be in a giant ritual. The West is to be defaced, thrown
[17:49.120 --> 17:57.520]  down and use his toilet paper to the Muslim horde. And journalists that say, look, radical
[17:57.520 --> 18:02.800]  Islam has been outlawed with the Nazis, Islam period. This is incompatible. These folks
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.440]  are, are really, really racist, blah, blah, blah. They said, listen, you're going to jail
[18:06.440 --> 18:13.440]  for six months. You elect that. And guess who they hired to run the spine, former Stasi,
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.160]  the Southern probably law center in the ADL now globally are getting all these big donations,
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.200]  billions, billions. Everybody's putting in their million, their 500 million, their 10
[18:22.200 --> 18:25.880]  million, depending on how big they are to just, and they now run YouTube and Google
[18:25.880 --> 18:30.040]  and are now starting all the censorship of political party organizations. That's why
[18:30.040 --> 18:33.760]  they've got to be litigated. We're just getting ready to figure out all the violations we've
[18:33.760 --> 18:39.520]  been under, who's best to, you know, go after here with the best case. Not because I'm
[18:39.520 --> 18:44.760]  litigious, skip this break, but because I absolutely have to do this and other people
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.520]  have to do it. And the lawsuits are being started by others right now too. And Congress
[18:48.520 --> 18:55.280]  is moving. And you know why they're so scared? They're so scared because Joe Arpaio is coming
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.000]  on to give us the first big interview today, which I didn't even ask for the first exclusive.
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.760]  I'm honored. But, you know, he just couldn't believe that we stood up for him when even
[19:02.760 --> 19:07.240]  Fox News wasn't covering that he'd been convicted, was going to spend years in prison for fake
[19:07.240 --> 19:13.520]  contempt charged by a federal Obama judge and who wouldn't even let him have a jury.
[19:13.520 --> 19:18.560]  But it's not a big deal overall that we got the info to Trump and I'm just going to leave
[19:18.560 --> 19:22.920]  it at that and others did as well. I don't even know about one of our pile to come on
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.920]  and thank us for all this and give the inside baseball because it gives the media too much
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.320]  of a hissy fit, but who cares? The point is, is that it isn't about even the pardon for
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.560]  Arpaio. That's the right thing to do. Trump did not even know that this was happening
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.520]  because they had him so isolated. And when he finally learned about it from infowars.com
[19:44.520 --> 19:48.520]  and Rudd report, this is directly from the president and then folks had a chance to talk
[19:48.520 --> 19:53.600]  to him. He called Arpaio and told him where he learned about it and said, my God, I know
[19:53.600 --> 19:56.960]  this was going on for months. We're going to get the lawyers to look at a pardon for
[19:56.960 --> 20:00.560]  you and it almost happened last night. And we told folks he was going to talk about it
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.640]  last night and I don't want to get into inside baseball because this isn't sycophantic stuff
[20:04.640 --> 20:08.680]  about back channels, the president and all the rest of it. I mean, they talk about it
[20:08.680 --> 20:13.960]  on Fox. They talk about it in armed services committee hearings in Congress. The president
[20:13.960 --> 20:20.560]  knows who's fighting for this Republic and who is fearless like he is who is committed.
[20:20.560 --> 20:24.160]  When I say fearless, I don't have fear of the enemy. I have fear of I'm not good enough
[20:24.160 --> 20:29.280]  for this. I don't say that to sound, you know, like some honorable night. I mean, I feel
[20:29.280 --> 20:33.600]  absolutely horrible all the time that I'm not strong enough and I don't have enough
[20:33.600 --> 20:39.040]  will to beat them quicker because these people are absolutely evil. They literally hate
[20:39.040 --> 20:42.560]  you and your family. There are a bunch of pedophiles running it. That's another reason
[20:42.560 --> 20:48.320]  they like Islam is because pedophilia is legal in it. I just, I cannot believe how desperate
[20:48.320 --> 20:52.040]  straights were in and people say, well, why do you keep having kids then? Because I'm
[20:52.040 --> 20:56.440]  doubling down. I'm putting my ancestors didn't give up. I'm not giving up. My kids aren't
[20:56.440 --> 21:00.080]  giving up and I'm just going to just, I love them so much. The more children I have, the
[21:00.080 --> 21:04.120]  stronger I get because I'm fighting for them and the light in their eyes gives me strength
[21:04.120 --> 21:08.200]  to the connection right to God and I'm never giving up. I'm never giving up. I'm going
[21:08.200 --> 21:13.080]  to get stronger. In fact, I can't even stay candle the strength and discernment I'm getting
[21:13.080 --> 21:18.960]  day by day. It is so humbling to be moved closer to God and under God's wings and then
[21:18.960 --> 21:23.720]  to be able to see the enemy even that much clearer. It is just this is good and evil
[21:23.720 --> 21:28.280]  right and wrong. That's all this is. It's spiritual. The devil's real. This whole thing
[21:28.280 --> 21:36.200]  satanic, world government, microchips, genetic engineering. It's already here people and
[21:36.200 --> 21:42.920]  you're not going to get away from it by joining it or trying to hide the only way to get out.
[21:42.920 --> 21:48.600]  I'm here with my children and they basically built this modern civilization as a tomb to
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.960]  bury us alive in and there's one door to get out of and the globalist and his all the
[21:53.960 --> 21:59.200]  minions, the devil are standing in that door and they know we've got God on our side and
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.560]  we can get out of the door if we ask God for the help and then take action. Don't worry
[22:05.560 --> 22:11.440]  about your body folks. You worry about who can get your soul forever. They want you to
[22:11.440 --> 22:16.280]  be with them forever in their ugliness and their misery and they know it and they're
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.400]  conscious and they understand it and they hate you and they are absolutely sworn to
[22:21.400 --> 22:29.880]  destroy you. This is not the time to hedge bets ladies and gentlemen. This is the time
[22:29.880 --> 22:40.440]  to get on your knees and ask God to lead God in direction. This is the time to make the
[22:40.440 --> 22:48.000]  decision for the rest of eternity which side you're on because it's an absolute infinity
[22:48.000 --> 22:57.080]  fact that the fallen spirit on this planet, take a look, take a look where we're at folks.
[22:57.080 --> 23:04.960]  The Bible's dead on. It's here and it wants one thing to get you in its grasp and to take
[23:04.960 --> 23:17.200]  you down. We're going through it. We're going through it and the devil is going to be behind
[23:17.200 --> 23:24.320]  us again. And you can already see we're pulling away. Our hearts, our minds, our souls and
[23:24.320 --> 23:36.480]  the enemy is just no. Your children belong to us. No. We are the authority. You will
[23:36.480 --> 23:46.480]  bow to us. You will submit to us. No, we won't. But you're not going to beat the devil of
[23:46.480 --> 23:53.280]  your will. You're going to beat the devil with God's will and you're not going to find
[23:53.280 --> 23:57.240]  that will at these little satanic churches run by these little glitter bugs up there
[23:57.240 --> 24:02.320]  that are scared to death and at night time get down on their knees to Satan because they're
[24:02.320 --> 24:10.560]  so scared of the devil. You're going to find God by asking God to come into your heart.
[24:10.560 --> 24:17.440]  You want to beat the enemy? That's where it is. You want to be free of this scum? This
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.000]  isn't like some football game or some competitive thing or some pissing contest where we're
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.160]  trying to be the, you know, the guys running things and not the liberals. This is survival.
[24:32.160 --> 24:43.320]  This is survival. And so you've got to say, oh, you threaten me and my family. I'm going
[24:43.320 --> 24:50.920]  to put more into the world for me to love with God. I'm going to hang myself out there
[24:50.920 --> 24:56.280]  right there for you because we've transcended you cowards because that's who you are at
[24:56.280 --> 25:02.720]  the end of the day is a bunch of scum, a bunch of anti-human trash that hates success and
[25:02.720 --> 25:14.520]  hates beauty and hates Genesis. Your lover's a death. What's Genesis life and all its beauty
[25:14.520 --> 25:20.000]  all its permutations exploding throughout the stars throughout time and space. What are
[25:20.000 --> 25:30.120]  you? Oh death. Wow. I'm impressed. As if life doesn't know everything about death as if
[25:30.120 --> 25:41.120]  life didn't give birth to death. Death is only the little separations between all the
[25:41.120 --> 25:55.760]  rest of life. The flickers in and out the pulse. The great equalizer because the evil doesn't
[25:55.760 --> 26:05.760]  transmit forward. It tries to, but it can't. It could only burn out wherever it gets a
[26:05.760 --> 26:18.640]  hold and sit there cold for eons. I promise I'm going to play all the clips when we come
[26:18.640 --> 26:24.520]  back, but just look at one article. Germany, journalists get six months suspended sentence
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.000]  for criticizing Islam, arguing that Islam is a fast ideology now hates speech, which
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.920]  is fascist. Thunderbuckets, a Chinese man named Robert Lee, announcer for ESPN, especially
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.480]  fired because his last name's Lee. That scares people. Right, Robert Lee. Black Lives Matter
[26:41.480 --> 26:49.080]  demands white people's homes as reparations. George and Amal Klooner donate one million
[26:49.080 --> 26:55.600]  to Southern Providence Law Center, took him out of hate rooms. Oh, how good. Transgender
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.320]  reveals self in kindergarten class to five year olds and teaches them about sex without
[27:00.320 --> 27:04.040]  asking the parents. Parents never even talked to their five year old about sex. They're
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.080]  not thinking about sex. And they go, oh yes, you're child sexual and I'm going to teach
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.520]  him because I'm a tranny. And so, oh, I'm not going to criticize a tranny. Go ahead, sexualize
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.400]  my kids. But if a man walked up or a woman to your five year old in the park and said,
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.080]  let me talk to you about sex and what's between my legs, you'd go to jail. But see if it's
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.000]  oh, oh, let's not be mean to the trannies, that's them the excuse to bring this in. It's
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.920]  all formulas and they all know it. They all sit around and laugh at you. George Clooney
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.560]  and Brad Pitt and all those guys behind the scenes, Matt Damon, they all know about the
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.200]  New World Order. They all know about all of it. They all sit around and just make jokes
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.280]  at the public and then read whatever they're supposed to. They're not even cool enough
[27:47.280 --> 27:52.160]  to actually be in to enslaving and killing you like their bosses. They just want to,
[27:52.160 --> 27:59.320]  you know, fancy pants around. Everybody kissed their ass. Special place in hell for you.
[27:59.320 --> 28:07.360]  Antifa leftist riot in Phoenix. CNN blames Trump's angry divisive speech. It's all coming
[28:07.360 --> 28:15.360]  up. Trump will probably end up terminating NAFTA. Oh, look, 4 million Americans paid
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.320]  2.8 billion in Obamacare penalties in just the first three months of this year. But they
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.640]  said there was no penalties. It was a conspiracy theory of races. I mean, they said Alex Jones
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.960]  is deeply racist. This is a quote from MSNBC. The talking point they've said many times
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.720]  because he says Obamacare isn't free and he says there's penalties. They go, well, that's
[28:34.720 --> 28:40.440]  what these deeply racist people do. They just make up lines about our black president. These
[28:40.440 --> 28:48.560]  are quotes. I'm like, here's the bill. They've hired 17,000 more now IRS agents just to penalize
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.360]  you. It's in the bill and the Supreme Court ruled it's tax. They said, listen, I got a
[28:54.360 --> 29:01.680]  magic word racist magic word. Focus, focus. Abracadabra. Literally.
[29:01.680 --> 29:11.280]  Kaboonga. Kaboonga. Kona. Say a magic word. Grabbers on C-span going, thank God these people
[29:11.280 --> 29:19.320]  are soaked up. We're just supposed to roll over to them and have a weird freaked out
[29:19.320 --> 29:22.640]  people look like they're half dead. Going to be on the street. They'll F you Nazi. I
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.560]  go, actually talk to me about your views. Scrill you. I don't talk to you and running
[29:26.560 --> 29:29.640]  off, flipping me off and a couple more. So done. They try to flip me off. They couldn't
[29:29.640 --> 29:36.280]  do the right thing. It's like, is that one? And it's like, what? I'm like, look at you
[29:36.280 --> 29:41.480]  people. They've got like a spiritual spider hooked on to them. They're like half dead.
[29:41.480 --> 29:46.480]  I'm like, you better remove that, bro. They're like, never. Those spiders eyes are red. You
[29:46.480 --> 29:51.600]  actually notice it's the one talking. They're like, whoa. Wow. I knew it'd be like this,
[29:51.600 --> 30:00.040]  you know, like, like, like, like, like, like, like Rowdy Piper and they live. He goes, of
[30:00.040 --> 30:04.080]  course, for Mel died face. Joe Bix here with info wars.com. Today I want to talk to you
[30:04.080 --> 30:09.640]  about guns, why we have them, why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them
[30:09.640 --> 30:14.840]  and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the
[30:14.840 --> 30:19.240]  press. I believe every good journalist needs to know why the second amendment must be
[30:19.240 --> 30:24.800]  considered more essential than the first a minute. This may be a bitter pill to swallow,
[30:24.800 --> 30:30.200]  but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea. Some old dead white
[30:30.200 --> 30:35.800]  guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats. No, it is just as essential to liberty today as
[30:35.800 --> 30:41.800]  it was in 1776. The original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10
[30:41.800 --> 30:46.720]  of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights. The bill of rights came
[30:46.720 --> 30:51.840]  to us with blinders on. It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth. It protects not
[30:51.840 --> 30:57.920]  just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[30:57.920 --> 31:02.640]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston. Alex Jones here to tell you about how you
[31:02.640 --> 31:06.640]  can help spread liberty worldwide. I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best
[31:06.640 --> 31:12.160]  tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade. My favorite coffee
[31:12.160 --> 31:16.160]  has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their
[31:16.160 --> 31:21.400]  unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans
[31:21.400 --> 31:27.840]  in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic
[31:27.840 --> 31:34.000]  coffee at infowarslife.com. This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.960]  the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally. Hands down, this
[31:37.960 --> 31:43.120]  is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas
[31:43.120 --> 31:47.800]  Mexican farmers. Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going
[31:47.800 --> 31:52.200]  to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[31:52.200 --> 31:57.120]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[31:57.120 --> 32:03.360]  my favorite coffee. Available at infowarslife.com. More than two years ago, info wars first
[32:03.360 --> 32:07.920]  told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told
[32:07.920 --> 32:12.960]  you about how sciences have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[32:12.960 --> 32:17.920]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[32:17.920 --> 32:22.280]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took the good halogen out
[32:22.280 --> 32:26.960]  and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is
[32:26.960 --> 32:31.640]  worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in
[32:31.640 --> 32:37.360]  2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[32:37.360 --> 32:43.400]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.440]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.560]  the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock

[33:06.080 --> 33:13.080]  We're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's Alex Jones.
[33:36.080 --> 33:50.320]  It's a really important article that Roger Stone sent me that I posted. I really do
[33:50.320 --> 33:58.840]  this in full to newswars.com and it links through to the Florida paper. We'll put a link on
[33:58.840 --> 34:05.480]  the bottom to the particular paper itself. But it goes over five reasons why boycotting
[34:05.480 --> 34:11.440]  Roger Stone's 420 speech is horrifically stupid. Because I've done the math on this and it's
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.000]  already going to happen. If you decriminalize marijuana, if Trump actually delivers on Obama's
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.800]  promises to do it, and if he can get sessions to worry about the heroin and the prescription
[34:20.800 --> 34:27.280]  drugs and all the serious stuff, that will turn the tide 100% for Trump. But regardless
[34:27.280 --> 34:33.360]  of what you think of that, you read this article, why was he banned on Fox, CNN, MSNBC? We first
[34:33.360 --> 34:36.440]  broke that over a year and a half ago. It was later confirmed there was an actual ban
[34:36.440 --> 34:42.120]  by the Hillary campaign in the WikiLeaks saying, shut down Roger Stone. He's the MVP. Shut
[34:42.120 --> 34:48.200]  down Alex Jones. We've already got a ban on Jones, but get a ban on Roger Stone. As if
[34:48.200 --> 34:53.600]  I need to go on your shows to have viewers. When I go on your shows, then you get viewers.
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.880]  Every time I go on one of their shows, it goes from having a million viewers to 10 million
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.040]  viewers that day. And then it's all over the news for weeks. And number one story of the
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.520]  year appears Morgan. Yeah, they had votes. That was the number one rated thing most covered
[35:05.520 --> 35:14.200]  media event of 2013. They know I'm explosive. Not bragging. It's a fact. And it's the same
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.320]  thing with Roger because he's a libertarian. And he's not who they say he is. And he is
[35:19.320 --> 35:24.080]  able to go out and get Democrats to wake up to how they're getting screwed over, not just
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.640]  Reagan Democrats, but liberals. And it gets into how, you know, he's not against gay marriage,
[35:29.640 --> 35:35.240]  pro marijuana. I mean, Rogers, they call him the super right wing guy. It's just not true.
[35:35.240 --> 35:41.160]  And it's not like he just says all this stuff. He's involved in that business out in California
[35:41.160 --> 35:46.080]  with the legalization and shops and sales and has been for decades, you're trying to
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.720]  get it legalized. It's one of the few things he's aligned with Soros on. Soros is doing
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.400]  it for different reasons.
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.840]  Marijuana is a unifying force. True reform won't happen without stone. Trump's focus
[35:59.840 --> 36:06.680]  on opioid crisis is backdoor for 420. True bipartisan appeal. And this article written
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.280]  by a liberal reporter, I was reading his bio earlier today, actually understands what's
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.880]  going on. And again, just from a Machiavellian perspective, if you're asking why they hate
[36:16.880 --> 36:23.640]  Roger Stone so much is because he's able to cut through all the partisanship. So they've
[36:23.640 --> 36:30.280]  got big national pieces of a Southern private law center and the Soros group, media matters
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.760]  and others saying boycotting, shutting down, get his sponsors, don't let him be on air.
[36:35.760 --> 36:42.640]  Don't let him speak at a 420 conference in California when this is the guy talking to
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.440]  Trump trying to get him to go with what he originally said that he is for the states
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.920]  being able to decriminalize. And that doesn't mean I'm pushing marijuana. I don't like it.
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.600]  It's super strong. But folks, they're selling hundreds of prescriptions that are far, far
[36:57.600 --> 37:01.600]  worse. They're not letting folks have marijuana for all the real medical uses. It's a plant,
[37:01.600 --> 37:09.120]  has incredible medicinal uses, and some people abuse it. People abuse alcohol. And I'm not
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.720]  going off on some marijuana jag. The point is, is that this is key calculus for Trump
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.240]  and it's what it's where he stood for 30 years. So he's very anti drug Trump is, but
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.840]  he understands marijuana is something that's in a whole nother class and that half of America
[37:23.840 --> 37:29.040]  smokes. So as a country, we've chosen to do this. It doesn't hurt anybody else and it
[37:29.040 --> 37:38.280]  needs to stop. We need to stop putting marijuana smokers in prison. But I got so much big news.
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.720]  I just want to point out at news wars.com. There's this story that's just a window into
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.600]  why is the left supporting Obamacare written by the Republican establishment? That's a
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.760]  giant screw job with billions of dollars of fines on people that can't afford it and
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.440]  making you buy healthcare ballooning the price of it. If you've got an industry where you
[37:55.440 --> 37:59.120]  have to buy it, what's going to happen? It's going to price is going to go up. That's not
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.800]  rocket science, folks. I mean, we are being so royally screwed bipartisan Lee and Trump
[38:04.800 --> 38:08.480]  standing against that and Mitch McConnell's running around saying he might get removed
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.560]  now. I told you a month ago the next two months, the word is they're going to have the Republican
[38:12.560 --> 38:19.240]  establishment turned against him bipartisan stays mentally ill, drugging or killing. And
[38:19.240 --> 38:23.400]  now they're all over the new saying he's mentally ill. He's got early onset. Oh, yeah, because
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.600]  he never stutters, never stammers can work 18 hours a day in a super smart boy. If that's
[38:28.600 --> 38:38.400]  all timers, I want some. My conversation with Trump is he listens some but he talks and
[38:38.400 --> 38:46.600]  he finishes your sentences. And the guys like hyper aware. And that's why they're so scared.
[38:46.600 --> 38:51.240]  Again, they want a civil war. They say he's causing a civil war. They say he's got dementia.
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.400]  They've got collective spiritual dementia. Everything they say about him. It's the opposite
[38:56.400 --> 39:05.920]  of what's going on. Now I've got formerly with special forces operations and CIA and
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.320]  all the rest of it, Pachennic coming on. And there was a consortium and people in and out
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.720]  of government that kind of jumped on the bandwagon with the American people for populism and
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.120]  helping back Trump that did want to get out of Afghanistan. That's what all the smart
[39:19.120 --> 39:26.280]  brains say. And he's really pissed off at Trump right now. And I just want to say I'm
[39:26.280 --> 39:32.080]  not a lesser two evils guy, but Trump is great on 90% of things and means well on things
[39:32.080 --> 39:37.040]  he's doing that we might be able to say down the road might be proven wrong. But the enemies
[39:37.040 --> 39:45.280]  of humanity are at Mach 100 with their afterburners melting the fuselage trying to destroy Trump.
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.680]  And why is that? Because they know he's got their number and they can spiritually see
[39:49.680 --> 39:55.080]  it and they are it's like Count Dracula getting hauled out at high noon folks and being tied
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.440]  up, you know, to a stake in the middle of town square. I mean, they are on fire and
[39:59.440 --> 40:05.440]  the energy you see coming from him right now is their meltdown. You're like, whoa, because
[40:05.440 --> 40:09.640]  that's the pedophiles are getting arrested everywhere. It's all over British news. The
[40:09.640 --> 40:13.960]  government's run by pedophiles and blackmail. Same thing here. It's all coming out. It's
[40:13.960 --> 40:21.320]  all they know the season of the bloodletting for them is coming. And by bloodletting, I
[40:21.320 --> 40:30.000]  mean the puss being drawn out. And so they are screaming like banshees, like a, like
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.120]  a wagon load of vampires. They get dumped out in the middle of the Sahara Desert at
[40:34.120 --> 40:44.560]  high noon. They are just look at the sun and they are burning up in front of your eyes.
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.800]  And so they're putting on their kabuki dance, their baloney dance bigger than they've ever
[40:48.800 --> 40:56.280]  done with just a wall of lies. What are we going to do? There's 5000 bikers out in Phoenix
[40:56.280 --> 41:01.760]  and we've only got 200 people that Soros can ship in. Everybody else is too scared. Well,
[41:01.760 --> 41:12.040]  just say the bikers are against Trump. I mean, it is just incredible. Look at that.
[41:12.040 --> 41:19.480]  Phoenix times. Antifosh bikers for Trump and other groups planning to protest Trump's
[41:19.480 --> 41:26.120]  Phoenix rally. And I thought surely, I thought surely that's a typo. And then I read it and
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.680]  it said the bikers for Trump were there against Trump, which they weren't. And then I read
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.920]  it in Reuters. Then I read it in AP. Then I was like, Oh my God, again, I can't even keep
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.840]  track of the lives anymore. It is a wall of fraud. Did bikers for Trump know they were
[41:40.840 --> 41:49.000]  there to protest Trump? That's the level of deceitful, rat-like creatures we're dealing
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.320]  with. Now, right now, that's just one little stack I mentioned here for you. But I want
[41:57.320 --> 42:06.200]  to get into what happened last night because it's so incredibly important. Briefly, yesterday's
[42:06.200 --> 42:09.720]  special that was supposed to end is going to go one more day because as is normal, we
[42:09.720 --> 42:13.840]  are skeleton crewed. Many are trying to up our crew right now and desperately, but launching
[42:13.840 --> 42:19.720]  new shows were very busy. We're extending the sales one more day because I've got to
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.120]  have a sales meeting at the show and decide the best products we've got, the best deals
[42:23.120 --> 42:26.760]  we can do and have new specials. But this has been the biggest, longest special we've
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.520]  ever launched. It's been very, very successful. It was the John Oliver special and the Buzz
[42:30.520 --> 42:43.000]  Feed special is combining that with the 1776 special of this month. So 66% off colloidal
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.520]  silver, 50% off the toothpaste products, survival shield, nascent iodine, absolutely game-changing,
[42:50.520 --> 42:59.840]  1776, 55% off, bio tricillinium, 29% off, Michael ZX is sold out, DNA force is selling
[42:59.840 --> 43:08.440]  out. We've also pulled out of the sales brain force that is going to sell out like a week
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.860]  or so as we took it back to our regular discounted price. It's pretty much never a retail ever
[43:12.860 --> 43:16.840]  once one of those. So that's that's selling out. So it's not a special anymore. We've
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.920]  got to stop the air purifier specials today. We got to stop the electric peer specials.
[43:20.920 --> 43:24.320]  We've never had specials again this this big because they're already discounted. We don't
[43:24.320 --> 43:27.640]  like raise price and then drop it a bunch and say, Oh, look, it's a special. I mean,
[43:27.640 --> 43:33.200]  it is what it is. I'm religious about just doing what I say I'm going to do Alexa pure
[43:33.200 --> 43:38.960]  breeze, vitamin mineral fusion, prostagard. It's all there and it's all massively discounted.
[43:38.960 --> 43:45.080]  Caveman and the true way protein, 30% off super high quality, feel great together. Try
[43:45.080 --> 43:49.760]  the caveman strawberry or chocolate flavor for yourself. I like to put some milk in with
[43:49.760 --> 43:55.160]  it. Some berries in with the strawberry flavor and then it's it's it's really excellent.
[43:55.160 --> 43:59.040]  Everyone's taste terrible. This I wouldn't say tastes perfect with water. But the point
[43:59.040 --> 44:03.840]  is it's it's the nutrients, not the taste. You know, all the ancients and all your grandmothers
[44:03.840 --> 44:08.520]  knew about chicken broth. And that's just a little bit of the essence. This is concentrated,
[44:08.520 --> 44:15.000]  organic, massive dosages of this. It's just the the super food caveman available at info
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.160]  war store dot com info wars live dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[44:20.160 --> 44:25.520]  It takes time to look at the products and decide what the sales are going to be. I think
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.440]  it's going to be t shirts, books and videos for the next few weeks. So if you want to
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.160]  get probably products out, sign up for auto ship and additional 10% off on a thank you
[44:35.160 --> 44:40.680]  all for your support. And the enemy is coming after us. They have got just hordes of private
[44:40.680 --> 44:48.760]  detective groups, newspapers, magazines, publications, just contacting people that I don't even know.
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.720]  And just trying to dig up basically fake informants just to make stuff up like they do and corrupt
[44:53.720 --> 44:58.600]  court sometimes. And it's just everything that's happened is turned against them is but it's
[44:58.600 --> 45:07.480]  just the level of hate is staggering. And my fear is I'm not strong enough to to to
[45:07.480 --> 45:12.320]  defeat them long term. But it's so miraculous how everything is turned around against them
[45:12.320 --> 45:21.520]  because they're such just diabolical trash that God just keeps coming through. But don't
[45:21.520 --> 45:27.560]  think folks if they kill me or put me in prison or do whatever it is that that's a defeat.
[45:27.560 --> 45:31.560]  That is a sign of the extreme victory we've been having. But you need to understand they're
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.480]  announcing massive censorship everywhere. Jahad watch mainline site that just exposes
[45:36.480 --> 45:42.440]  ISIS and al-Qaeda PayPal took them down. It's a southern poverty loss center. And the ADL
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.960]  literally working for the Muslim Brotherhood. Now, I mean, it's just it's the most over
[45:47.960 --> 45:53.680]  the top thing. Now, you mildly criticize any major Islamic group. And the ADL tries to get
[45:53.680 --> 45:57.920]  you shut down. Southern poverty loss center does it's just total racketeering in my view
[45:57.920 --> 46:02.520]  by the SPLC particularly. I mean, these are people that call our president a Nazi. They
[46:02.520 --> 46:09.600]  are just a lying pack of evil. I mean, they are so bad. And how they attack, you know,
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.720]  the family research council and, you know, the gunmen that go in and shoot, shoot at
[46:14.720 --> 46:21.200]  people, shoot people. I mean, it's just they are just so bad. And they're so wicked. And
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.960]  they're really trying to activate their readers and their mental patients. As folks have said,
[46:25.960 --> 46:32.440]  I really think we should also get on today. We really need to get Mike Sternowitz on.
[46:32.440 --> 46:37.080]  He's so knowledgeable. I want to get his take on this moment we're in right now because
[46:37.080 --> 46:43.160]  the enemy is just revealing itself. And it is horrific. I mean, it is just, oh, and you
[46:43.160 --> 46:46.080]  just want to be away from them, but they're in the news. They're in your life. They want
[46:46.080 --> 46:52.560]  your kids. They're just always leering and pushing. And they're so spiritually ugly.
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.200]  And then physically ugly. And they know their demons. They know their trash. And it's just
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.120]  like, oh my God, what is wrong with you? And they're just seething with hate. They want
[47:01.120 --> 47:14.360]  to get, they can't even hide it. It's crazy because they're godless. They're turned over
[47:14.360 --> 47:20.120]  to evil and they, they only think if they can snuff your light out, they'd feel good.
[47:20.120 --> 47:24.840]  They don't know how much worse they're going to feel once they are removed, removed from
[47:24.840 --> 47:34.360]  our presence. Now let's start getting to these epic clips of the president. Let's go ahead
[47:34.360 --> 47:41.520]  and play the first clip. The first clip is if you want to discover the source of the
[47:41.520 --> 47:48.080]  division in our country, look no further than fake news and crooked media. That's better.
[47:48.080 --> 47:55.360]  That's crooked media. They're getting paid grants by billionaires at CNN, MSNBC, Salon.
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.400]  All of them get grants and money, all pile money on from the rig system they've got and
[48:01.400 --> 48:05.920]  prop it up and then pay for all the nasty media. And that's why the media is so desperate
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.920]  because they've been told if you can't deliver, we're going to stop funding you. So there
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.280]  are no rules. There are no standards. There is nothing. Just attack, destroy, start a war,
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.400]  call for the president's death. And so they get up on TV and go, we're going to kill him.
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.720]  We're in very, he's mentally ill. We're going to kill him. People are like, you know, that's
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.680]  illegal. No, no. And anybody in the military says they support them. We're going to kick
[48:27.680 --> 48:30.880]  them out because you can't support the president. We're like, military's supposed to support
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.200]  the president. They're just, it's, it's, they're trying to upside down everything and it's
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.080]  not working on the general public. But for the people under their control, it's driving
[48:40.080 --> 48:44.120]  them into total insanity. And so then they're more and more violent. They're more and more
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.900]  hateful. And it's harder for the media to spin that, isn't there people that are hateful
[48:47.900 --> 48:54.400]  and evil and racist? And so they go, we'll just censor everyone. That's not working either
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.160]  because we had defenses of the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, other things that weren't
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.280]  perfect and were kind of forgotten about, but now have been rediscovered. And it's like
[49:03.280 --> 49:08.480]  a lot of times you try to put a fire out. It'll catch the blanket you got on fire or
[49:08.480 --> 49:12.280]  you try to put it out. It coals roll out and it's pretty soon. There's a brush fire
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.360]  right here and all of a sudden the wind kicks up like God's not on your side. And all of
[49:16.360 --> 49:22.600]  a sudden you're engulfed in your own attempt to put out the fires of liberty and fire goes
[49:22.600 --> 49:29.240]  up and will burn down these evil people in these high places. These fortresses they built
[49:29.240 --> 49:37.680]  for themselves are actually going to be their presence. The ovens of the heavens raining
[49:37.680 --> 49:51.160]  down fire like we saw in the time of Ezekiel, burning away the tyranny. Ladies and gentlemen,
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.840]  you saw that eclipse. You see how beautiful this universe is and you see how strong the
[49:55.840 --> 50:09.320]  fire of liberty is. You witness how you take the metal and you put it into the fire to
[50:09.320 --> 50:18.360]  separate the unpure from the pure. Without these tests, I know everybody already knows
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.600]  this, without being put through the fire, through the forge, without being put like
[50:24.600 --> 50:33.920]  the potters. Creation through the kiln is the paramount looking for. Nothing gets hardened.
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.240]  Nothing gets strengthened. Nothing lasts. Everybody knows that. When we come back, I'm going to
[50:39.240 --> 50:42.960]  just start playing clip after clip after clip after clip of this incredible speech last
[50:42.960 --> 50:53.080]  night that absolutely horrifies the globalist and absolutely drives them insane that they
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.920]  can't break the American people's will but they believe they can break Trump, they can
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.320]  break you.

[54:24.760 --> 54:36.160]  division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which
[54:36.160 --> 54:44.320]  would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth.
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.840]  It was a pipe dream that Donald Trump is not going anywhere. People are saying impeachment.
[54:47.840 --> 54:53.240]  He's going to be there for four years. But he has given oxygen to racists. He hasn't
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.840]  really said anything, denounced the alt-right. He talked about the KKK and whatever. He hasn't
[54:58.840 --> 55:05.600]  really done that. He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country. He has
[55:05.600 --> 55:15.880]  not tamped down race. And I'm just going to say, if he was on my team in this newsroom
[55:15.880 --> 55:22.320]  and said those things, he would be escorted out of the building by security. My colleague
[55:22.320 --> 55:25.600]  Anna Navarro says something, and I want you to respond to this, because I asked Bacari
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.760]  about the 25th Amendment. And she said, the only possible, and this is on Twitter, the
[55:29.760 --> 55:35.800]  only possible defensible explanation for Trump's disgusting, unpresidential, narcissistic behavior
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.720]  would be early onset dementia. Maybe? She's not the only one who's been saying that. Some
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.320]  people have been saying that for months. I mean, but let's not go over it.
[55:43.320 --> 55:46.640]  Yeah, we told everybody that was the next thing about four months ago that was coming
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.120]  from our intel, because the Russian thing, then it was going nowhere. And now, oh, he's
[55:52.120 --> 55:57.040]  mentally ill. He's deeply racist. And notice, first they say, denounce the KKK. Then they
[55:57.040 --> 56:02.080]  label all Republicans that are real. All right. And say, now denounce that, then denounce
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.080]  the Republican Party, then denounce any opposition to them. That's all this is. We're going to
[56:07.080 --> 56:11.400]  bully you and come after you and come after your business and call you a racist and bankrupt
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.200]  you and shut down your website and come after your kids. If you don't, let us bring in the
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.840]  Muslims and let us take your rights away and let us sexualize your kids and let us take
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.160]  your guns and let us run your life. Is that clear? Well, is it clear Don Lemon that almost
[56:27.160 --> 56:33.240]  nobody watches you and that people understand your scum and that you sit up there all day
[56:33.240 --> 56:38.480]  and lie about the president and lie to your viewers and tell people that I said that I'm
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.240]  an actor and don't believe what I say. Just like they're always saying, oh, the Republicans
[56:43.240 --> 56:49.280]  think Trump's looking for a way out. The things he's saying are so crazy and clapper and Brennan
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.920]  are out saying it. We think he wants to resign. That's right. He was never really running
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.440]  to win and they never really wanted to be president and he was never really going to
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.240]  do all this stuff and oh, he really worked for Hillary and all the rest of it. None of
[57:03.240 --> 57:10.320]  it was true. It's all a hoax. Just like they'd march into people's offices early on when
[57:10.320 --> 57:16.360]  Trump was out of town and say, Trump fired you leave. And then they'd call Roger Stone
[57:16.360 --> 57:20.080]  or others up and say, is this true? And they'd say, no, it's a scam. Whiteley comes back
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.120]  to town and go talk to him. And then Priebus came in and said, don't you go talk to him?
[57:24.120 --> 57:27.560]  He goes, well, I'm supposed to. He wants me to talk to him. And they're like, ah, they're
[57:27.560 --> 57:32.040]  like, Mr. President, the leaks are because you only should talk to one person. Now, let
[57:32.040 --> 57:40.720]  us put you in here all alone. And with Joe Arpaio coming on later, the sheriff, Arpaio,
[57:40.720 --> 57:44.640]  with a big exclusive interview, he's on our interview first because he wants to thank
[57:44.640 --> 57:49.720]  us for helping get word of the president. It's not about even the pardon. It's about
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.640]  the story that if you can get to him and let him know something's happening, he will research
[57:55.640 --> 57:59.880]  it and try to do the right thing. And they call that mentally ill, that he's not letting
[57:59.880 --> 58:04.560]  a bunch of globalists play the part of collective president and then tell him what to do and
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.880]  have him read off a script and go play golf. And they're saying, it's insane. Oh yeah,
[58:09.880 --> 58:13.960]  one-sided NAFTA and GATT and TPP and all this that he's pulling out. It's insane trying
[58:13.960 --> 58:17.360]  to bring our economy back. That's why it's in the news today. Wall Street Banks worn
[58:17.360 --> 58:23.160]  downturn coming. They're trying to kill the economy because they know it's associated
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.320]  with Trump and our Make America Great again. It's totally naked. They want you poor. They
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.640]  want you dumb. They want your kids. They want you in poverty. It's in the WikiLeaks. Cloward
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.720]  and Piven. It's public. It's published. They're horrible people and they think they're gonna
[58:36.720 --> 58:42.240]  break you. They think they got control of you. Well, ask God for help. Take action. Speak
[58:42.240 --> 58:47.800]  out and we are breaking them. We've made more gains the last two years and we made the last
[58:47.800 --> 58:50.800]  hundred.
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.480]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[58:54.480 --> 58:59.520]  in stock at InfoWareStore.com. Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infects
[58:59.520 --> 59:03.040]  your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart
[59:03.040 --> 59:08.040]  attacks. That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral
[59:08.040 --> 59:12.640]  health can have a serious impact on your entire body. Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste
[59:12.640 --> 59:17.280]  is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen
[59:17.280 --> 59:21.960]  fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.440]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in
[59:26.440 --> 59:32.240]  Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver
[59:32.240 --> 59:36.240]  and more, due to requests from lifters who found that spearmint was a little bit too
[59:36.240 --> 59:39.640]  strong for some of their children. We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super
[59:39.640 --> 59:44.240]  Blue that is spearmint-free. Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste
[59:44.240 --> 59:49.160]  and more at InfoWareStore.com and support the InfoWare while you support healthy gums
[59:49.160 --> 59:53.660]  and teeth.
[59:53.660 --> 01:00:23.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:34.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:44.200]  A New World Order. The end of the family. The end of mothers. The end of all our gifts
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:52.660]  God gave us. The beginning of horrors that HR Geiger couldn't even imagine in his satanic
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:01:04.700]  twisted mind. Here we are, folks. The separation between good and evil is becoming so clear
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:12.200]  and I just can't believe that the people running our country were even worse than I thought
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.480]  and that the evil at the top now has got people in place that are almost as bad as
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:25.240]  it everywhere and we now know the stakes. We cannot let these people get control. We've
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:32.720]  got to do whatever it takes and just absolutely constantly have our minds focused on being
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:43.560]  good, being straightforward, being honorable and being fearless and being in their face
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:52.520]  because we're dealing with pedophile satanists. You want to know what's bottom of the rabbit
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:59.360]  hole? That's it. Child killing, raping devil worshipers. You want to know? That's it. Then
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.600]  they get bored with that genetic engineering mutating the species, killing the species,
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.440]  putting out genetically engineered funguses that are taking over the ocean and killing
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.280]  huge people. They're just trying to kill the planet right now. It's like watching a demon
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.960]  clown in a nursery full of kids with an ice pick taking his time with him. Some of them
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.200]  he pulls their eyeballs out, others he chops their guts out, others he puts on the microwave.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.120]  Just runs around giggling and smirking and you go see the supporters of the evil, they're
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:33.680]  like mutated versions of that and you're just like, good God. And then the really higher
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.520]  up elites go, yeah, and we're making more of them too because that's their free will.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:46.400]  Now are you going to support us killing all of them? Anytime you want to get sick of this,
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.280]  just join us and we're going to kill all of them soon and then it's going to be okay,
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.880]  Alex. You think we're the evil ones. We actually are just giving them what they want and they've
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.400]  chosen and that's God's plan and yin and yang and you just need to take care of yourself.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.320]  You need to make the right decision. You just go on and join us and it's not too late. It's
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:10.800]  not too late. Just, but you did not much further, Alex. Now come on. Oh, yeah. Oh, so the spider
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:19.160]  can eat me last, eat my kids first and then eat me last. Laughing at me. Never. Not in
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:31.040]  one trillion eons. Not in a thousand infinities. Never, never, never, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.280]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you will not get control. You will not win. You will
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.840]  not kill everybody. You will not deform everyone. You will not have cancer rates of 90%. You
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.280]  will not have everybody infertile. We're going to go to you to have humanoid kids. Oh, five
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.360]  parents. Yeah, it's a, it's a person here. It's your baby. Oh, look at six foot four
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:04:06.280]  and perfectly looking. It ain't got a soul, baby. They're like imprints, these clones.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:11.560]  They just take on whatever they're programmed with in the culture and just go around on
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:23.680]  power trips. It's basically like Satan bots or artificial synthetic sociopaths. See, there's
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.480]  one switch they want to cut off. It's virtue. It's innocence. Innocence is the window into
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:42.640]  infinity, the mind of God. They seek, ever seek to destroy it, ever seeking, ever looking,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.840]  ever wishing. The average leftist if they could would run through a kindergarten with a hatchet.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:58.240]  That's the main line. Want to kill your kids. They'll be right back. That's the epiphany.

[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:02.560]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information. And in the
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.080]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.560]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:18.280]  had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.600]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing. And so I set out to develop
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.440]  caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:36.480]  food ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. Info Wars isn't

[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:28.920]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:47.360]  Part two, slash Vietnam, part two, slash, oh it's the same war over and over again, the
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.360]  situation in Afghanistan. And we're going to have Dr. Steve Pachennick writing shot gun
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.360]  with us for the hour because he was involved, the Founding of Delta Force involved the training
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.800]  of the United States. And he's going to try to have a negotiation, bring in some economic
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.720]  deals and then pull out calling it a build up in the next year. But Pachennick says that's
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.800]  not the case and that he thinks this is a disaster. And who knows? We'll see who's right. He's
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.920]  been right about 95% of the time. I've been right a few times too though when he was wrong.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.200]  So you know, none of us are perfect. But before the election, he's like, I just think they're
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.360]  giving it to Hillary. That's what they're saying now. And I said, you watch. They're
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.440]  not going to be able to steal all the states. He's going to win. And so, and so we'll go
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.600]  to Pachennick here in a minute, but I've got to play some of these clips as I've promised
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.360]  to do. Here's Trump declaring the enemy during the break. I went and got a glass of water
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:40.480]  and that we got Fox News on in the coffee room. And they were saying, we don't know what he
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.120]  means to speech. It was weird. And then they cut the other guy and he goes, yeah, it didn't
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.600]  make sense. It's strange. Trump's rally isn't very helpful to himself. That's going on right
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.720]  now. This is Fox News, folks. It makes me love Trump even more. The entire media combine.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:02.480]  I watched the hour long live deal. I covered it live last night with Rob Do and Owen Shroyer.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.520]  He had crewwork 18 hours yesterday. Couldn't drag us away. And we're sitting there watching
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:14.280]  this. It was all epic. The media is the enemy. They're dividing us. I did decry. Charlottesville
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.840]  were coming together on and on and on. I agree with all of it. Oh, by the way, I'm going
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.680]  to pardon our Pio. It's just not going to be tonight because I want it to all be done
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:31.160]  legally. Correct. We were told a week ago he was going to pardon them at that event.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.440]  And then we were told days before, well, he's going to wait because the lawyers are getting
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.000]  it all straight. The media will spin it that, oh, he just did it on the cuff. Is it legal?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.760]  Of course it's legal. Our Pio is facing years in prison without a jury trial from an Obama
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:51.520]  judge for executing local state and federal law. And our Pio is coming on exclusively
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.520]  next hour. I didn't even ask for this. The guy is so honorable. He's doing Hannity's
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:03.000]  second because I'm going to give you the secrets here. But obviously, our Pio was told by somebody
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.040]  that called him where he learned about it. And it's brought your Corsi right in the articles
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.440]  and it's Matt Drudge picked him up and the president saw it in Matt Drudge's Twitter
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.000]  feed and then said, is this true? I haven't even heard of this on Fox. And he called Hannity
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.640]  up and said, why aren't you covering this? And it's not that Hannity's bad. Fox doesn't
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:29.640]  want this on. They are threatening everybody. Only Hannity is still fighting. Fox and friends
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:35.400]  a little bit. I've talked to other people, high level Fox programmers in high level.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.840]  I talked to L squad a bit before he died, but I'm going to leave it at that. He wanted
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.920]  to actually come to work for Imple Wars, but he would be really there for about a minute
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.120]  and kind of not there. I said, sir, you need to retire. I don't think they killed him.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:51.680]  He was currently walk at the end. They wanted me to go meet with him in Florida. And so
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.800]  all this is going on, all this is happening and you just can't help but love Trump with
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.640]  all these hyenas and all these jackals attacking him and 4 trillion in the stock market and
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.280]  everything else is happening. And then big banks say the end sneer, everything's gonna
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.360]  plunge. We're raising interest rates. I mean, they're doing everything they can to kill
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.520]  this recovery and saying, wait till the economy goes down the next few months, then we're
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.560]  going to be able to get rid of you and say your senile and just nah. And so all this is
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.520]  happening and they're met and they got CIA guys on TV going, we're going to fill mud.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.520]  Well, we're going to kill him in the next month. I mean, this is what happens when they
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.960]  do kill him. They think you have like a full dictatorship. Say, yeah, we killed him. Now
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.640]  we're going to kill Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones. You people are crazy as if you won't
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.320]  be instantly thrown out of that coup. I mean, anybody knows anybody that executes a big bloody
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.920]  nasty coup like that, four or five groups are going to be basically taken to the guillotine
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.240]  after that. I'm going to be as far away from this power struggle as possible if they kill
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:58.000]  El Presidente. And I say El Presidente because we are banana boat baby at that point. So
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.840]  let's play a few clips and go to the rest of the hour and take your calls 800-259-9231.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.760]  Here he is calling out the enemy. I've already played this clip. I'm going to play it again.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.560]  Here is the president calling out the enemy, the media, the corporate whore media owned
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.120]  by foreign banks that had the gall to pass Obamacare to triple your prices, make you
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:19.440]  buy it and gang rape you written by Republicans. And then the dumb Democrats go, it's mine.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.480]  It's mine. It's mine. Yeah, please don't throw you in that briar patch idiots. God, you're
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:31.520]  stupid. Let's go to the clip. If you want to discover the source of the division in
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:42.960]  our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:55.600]  get ratings in clicks than tell the truth. I want to play next to the clapper piece and
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.440]  then I'm going to go to our guest and play more of the clips with him. We're going to
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.360]  Afghanistan summit and back into the president overall that we told you four months ago.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.400]  The chatter was, because Roger Stone is really smart. And this isn't a secret. He talks to
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.160]  probably 50 reporters a day and so he gives them a lot of good stuff. They give him stuff.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.840]  And he said, no, the next thing is the Russian narrative is going to fail. They're going
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.760]  to expand it to all of his records and his whole family and try to find a bounce check
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.960]  or something, which they later admitted two months later. But the big thing is he's going
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.640]  to have a early onset of dementia. And now that's the drum. It was all over the news
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.000]  last night, but here's clapper. This is the guy that ran all quote US intelligence at
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.760]  17th agency that said that the NSA never spies on Americans and that the sky is black at
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.840]  noon, not not not blue. The Easter Bunny's real, but George Washington isn't James clapper.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.000]  I questioned Trump's fitness for office. Wonder if he's looking for a layout. Again, the same
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.680]  lies and then McConnell deserting him and saying, we're going to turn McConnell tried
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:00.440]  to stop him in the primaries. It's the same dirt bags trying to hoodwink you. This is
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:06.280]  a test of you. Forget who Trump is. This is a test on their controlling the narrative
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.920]  like Carl Rowe trying to show off to some, you know, reporters just like Richard Pearl
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.000]  saddled up to a bunch of hot reporters and said, you know, I kill people. I'm a big killer.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.880]  I kill a lot of people like waste 400 pounds, huge black circles, looks like a raccoon.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:25.880]  And the women are like, oh, gross. Hey, hey, dude, women don't want to hear about any people.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:33.000]  You ordered killed yourself when he came early walk. But at the same meeting, Carl Rowe tries
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.200]  to show up and goes, I control history. And all of you media are nothing. I tell you what
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.840]  to say, whether it's true or not, you put it out, then I'll change history again. It's
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.440]  like Winston being tortured by a Brian in 1984. And he's pulling his teeth out. He goes, listen,
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.920]  once you're totally mentally ill, you won't believe in gravity. I tell you, we're going
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.880]  to get you the point where I show you four figures. You see whatever the hell I want.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.800]  And you don't see four figures. You see 527. Hey, you see purples, you're ass, bro. When
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.640]  I'm done, you're, you have no mind because my religion is destroying your mind and pissing
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.580]  on everyone because I'm in the priest of power. And that's all this is for Don Lemon and the
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:13.480]  rest of them. And, and, and Carl Rowe in an airport, I walk over and he goes, you're not
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:19.000]  a team player. You could be on Fox if you just start being a team player. And I'm like,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.160]  I mean, I don't want to get into stuff. He's just so stupid. I'm sitting there like I want
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.680]  to be on Fox when they've already offered me shows like 15 times. I don't want to get
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:36.200]  into numbers or any of it. He's just so stupid. I mean, I was like talking to a retarded midget.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.560]  He even looks like he's got extra chromosomes and I'm not being mean here. It's like they've
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:48.400]  got a poor down syndrome guy and he literally is bragging to women that he's powerful and
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:56.600]  controls reality. Oh my God, that, that is the virtue. And I love down syndrome kids
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.880]  and give my special Olympics. They're great people. I'm just saying he has, but he has
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:09.960]  that strength though. He does have that idiot strength. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm going
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.200]  to skip this break. So we have more time when I start laughing this hard. It's really a
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.600]  bad situation. Okay. Hey, Dr. Puccini, you've been down about the app. You don't stand
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.880]  thing, but it's okay. It's okay. Go ahead. You are brilliant. I'm not paying for this
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:33.960]  show. Honestly, I don't think anybody really understands how incredibly brilliant you are
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:39.760]  when you're riffing. It's like a jazz riff of incredible insights. I mean, talk about
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.560]  stream of consciousness, but it's always on target. You're right. Cal rovers are midget.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.640]  You're talking about Ailes. He was ready to die. I worked with him on the Bush campaign.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:56.640]  You know, these are very mediocre individuals. The reason why you stand out is you've got
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.440]  a mind that's fast. It's quick. You pick up on that stuff. Enough about me. Come on.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.800]  Come on. Let's talk about you're really mad at right now about Afghanistan. I agree with
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:12.520]  you. Let me just put it in simple word. We don't need wars. Trump came in. We said no
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:19.200]  more wars, no more Afghanistan, no more Iraq. That was it. And his initial instinct was correct.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:25.720]  I don't want to go into Afghanistan. Then mad hog, Mattis, and I get credit to Conley.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:32.440]  Mad hog. I like that. It's a man named Conley from Boston, South Boston, who did a brilliant
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:40.800] ... No, it was a man named Conley who lives in Maine. I give him credit called Mad Hog
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.040]  because he couldn't wait to get out of the military and then run to General Dynamics
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:53.120]  and then run to Theranos, which was this incredibly ridiculous company that was doing bloodstains
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:00.240]  and it was bankrupt. And it shows you how stupid really Mattis is and capable of really
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.760]  living a life on his own. And he had the great insight one day to say, oh, I remained in
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.880]  the military because I didn't want to have a midlife crisis. Are you kidding? This guy
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:18.640]  is a disaster. He is a self-promoter, a self-aggrandizer. And when you read his articles, they're childish,
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.600]  they're stupid. That's what I thought. It's like he goes, I know philosophy. I'm really
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.880]  smart. I'm a genius. It's like I'm a shaman and like it is the most... It sounds like
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.480]  a five-year-old wrote it. Correct. And he comes out of the Hoover Institute. Meanwhile,
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:39.560]  he hasn't done anything creative. He can't write. He's not articulate and he has no strategy.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.400]  So other than that, we're doing fine America. Thank you, Mrs. Lincoln. We had a wonderful
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:51.360]  time at the theater. We're in a disaster mode. Trump should have gone with his instinct and
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:57.680]  said, get out. We don't want to need it. McMaster's a disaster clapper who has been, should have
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.040]  been indicted, convicted, and gone to prison for lying in front of Congress. This moron
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.280]  who came out of a cult sighing and then becomes DNI, while he's direct of national intelligence
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.880]  clapper, works for another company at the same time. Then when he gets another position,
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.240]  he works with another... I understand they're all a lot in their pockets, but let's expand
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:24.560]  on this. Afghanistan. Trump was against it 15, 16 years ago. He's against the Iraq war.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.560]  All this, his instincts have been right. What changed? What are your sources? I've got a
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.560]  lot of sources.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.280]  Well, it's not my sources. What you can do is look at the New York Times and you'll
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:39.200]  read the lead article by a man who worked for me, who I call the most slimy, egregious,
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.960]  disgusting individual whom I've had to work with, and so-called ambassador, Zalmi Halizan.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.760]  He comes from Afghanistan. He's the only Muslim among the neocons. So he got slipped in and
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:55.600]  Zalmi has been influencing this narrative. When the first time around he influenced it
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:02.080]  with the neocons, we went into Iraq. They created a disaster. Zalmi is a CIA operative,
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:06.960]  one of the dumbest they have, came out of the University of Lebanon, American University
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:13.280]  of Lebanon, married to a Christian woman, Kristi Berna, and all they've done is to make themselves
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:20.280]  egregiously sick of things in order to get through the political system. So the CIA pushed
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.040]  them through, and my policy planning staff, the boss who oversaw me, my friends, said,
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.880]  be careful. I took him into the West Bank in Gaza. He had no idea of what was going
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:36.400]  on. He was a terrible translator. He couldn't really conceptualize any strategy or tactics.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.320]  I came back, explained to Secretary of State Schultz that we would have eventually in
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.120]  Tafada. The Israelis were creating Hamas at that time. The Israelis denied it. They created
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.920]  Hamas as a counter force of Hezbollah. Zalmi came out of the University of Chicago along
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.520]  with Paul Wolfowitz, Scooter Libby, and Richie Corp.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.320]  I understand. So they've got a neocon in there advising the generals.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.280]  Not only have they had a whole bunch of them. Steve Hadley back again. You've got this
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.600]  moron and coward, John Bolton, who said, I can't go into Vietnam War because I'm going
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.120]  to end up in a rice pad. He dead. Oh, really? No kidding.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:23.320]  But he does have a nice mustache. You're correct. I must admit, but you know, this is the kind
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.600]  of guy that will never understand your humor. None of them will understand you, but they
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:34.240]  take themselves so seriously that they are really slimy parasites of our country. And
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:43.280]  what we have as a parasitic institution now, 80% of the generals between 2004 and 2011 left
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:49.360]  their six-figure pensions and went on to get more than six and seven figures from General
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:57.000]  Dynamics, SAIC, L3, blah, blah, blah, all the other industrial complex. What I expect
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.040]  that Trump to have done as I'm a businessman, you're a businessman, one to follow his instincts,
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.440]  get out of the wars. We don't need the wars. There is no terrorism. The CIA's created the
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.200]  Taliban. They created Al Qaeda. They created... I understand. You're giving this history lesson,
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.800]  but what do you think is going to happen? How did Trump get convinced of this? I was
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.800]  told, and by the way, Eric Prince, actually, he was being critical the other day, was talking
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.400]  to some of our sources saying that it's all going to be a disaster and not a good idea.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.880]  He was saying, pull out... I mean, I'm critical of Eric Prince because his background was
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.080]  very simple. I knew his background when he was a seal. He was not a great seal. I'm not
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.560]  saying he shouldn't be doing what he's doing. That's his business. But when he created Blackwater,
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:44.880]  you're talking about a kid who was financed by his father. His father's a multi-billionaire.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.520]  He didn't make his business. And then he came in and got multi-billion dollar contracts
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.960]  from Cheney through his sister, DeVos. See, you're not talking about individuals who've
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.640]  really proved themselves in the past. What we have here is a series of failed individuals.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.400]  That's my business, to understand the personalities and how their failures, in turn, repeat and
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.600]  create more dynamics.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:13.560]  Let's get into Trump's psychology. He's somebody who has great energy, great health overall,
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.600]  but does have some issues from going to military academy with kind of worshiping the commandant.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.040]  I agree with you. I'm not a psychiatrist like you or a doctor or whatever from MIT and all
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.720]  your degrees, but looking at the claims that he has early on set of dementia, this obvious
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.160]  talking point, and what do you make of that as a society? I know you're under the Goldwater
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.880]  rule, those who are diagnosed from a distance, but they're all doing it. What do you make
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:41.980]  of all their ridiculous diagnoses? Because they've had diagnoses about me that I'm a
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:47.160]  megalomaniac, that I'm a narcissist, all this other horsemen are.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:54.640]  Listen, I hit the psychoanalytical community, I said to others who are not qualified, Trump
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:00.840]  is fine. He may have certain personality traits, that's his, but he doesn't have dementia.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:06.960]  If that woman Navarro got sued by Trump and the family, you would see everything stopping.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.240]  There's nothing mentally ill with Trump. What he's doing is his own personal life.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.040]  Well, we found out they were told at the New York Times meeting four months ago, they said,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.800]  don't worry, we're not going to get him on Russia, we're going to get him on dementia.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:24.200]  I mean, I did a video, it's got a million views of Roger Stone, we had people in the
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.760]  damn meeting. I mean, it's ridiculous how much intel we've got on these people, but
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.320]  they just fly like, they don't care that they have a huge radar signal, they just do what,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.320]  there it is, Roger Stone predicts Trump critics will float Alzheimer's claims to demand impeachment.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.360]  Let me see if the Washington Times gave us credit, let's scroll down. Because, I mean,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.040]  that was back a four or five months ago, I did that, that was May 17th, that was way
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.960]  before that we broke that down. So, I mean, it's now happening.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.200]  I'm not saying Roger's wrong. I'm just saying that the basic, no, no, no, no, obviously
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.480]  we know he's not mentally ill and doesn't have dementia. He's in great shape for 71.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:05.880]  Looks like he's 60. What I'm saying is it's like, where is this going? As a psychiatrist,
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.160]  let's get real about watching Trump and see what he does. It is a little interesting.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.280]  He always wants to have his family around. It's a little interesting that he just gets
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.880]  really crazy around generals. I know he loves the military. That's good. That's one of the
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.920]  best expressions of our societies, folks that sacrifice a stamp or something compared to
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.200]  the leftist blobs. I mean, I get what he's saying, so I admire a lot of it, but it gets
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.360]  a little creepy with the general stuff.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.440]  What he is, is it's not creepy. I told you in the beginning, his father was German, came
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:39.320]  here, built up a huge real estate empire and understood that Trump as an adolescent had
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.200]  a disciplinary problem, so he sent him to the New York Military Academy, which was more
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:50.480]  of a reformatory school. That's fine. In turn, Trump really began to appreciate the military
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.000]  precision and all that, but he himself never wanted to go to Vietnam and really avoided
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.400]  the draft for whatever reason. The key element here isn't even about Trump. It's about this
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.080]  machinery, this war machinery that keeps on pushing through not only the Clintons, the
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.160]  Obama's, the Bush's, now even Trump, who came in to say, we're going to clean this all out,
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160]  and suddenly they sequestered him.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.920]  Now, I'm going to blame part of this on myself because I encourage some of my people to have
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.840]  military discipline in their command and control. I had no problems with John Kelly, but when
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.360]  I heard that we were going back to Afghanistan and then I could see the footprints of this
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:39.320]  slimy monster, Zalmi Halazzad, who avoided every military conflict we had, but made sure
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.840]  that we had wars in 9-11, went into Iraq, he became ambassador of Iraq, then we went
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.560]  into Afghanistan, he became ambassador of Afghanistan. He never could earn a penny outside
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.640]  of the Rand Corporation or any papers, and suddenly he has his own consulting firm.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:01.000]  So what I'm talking about is the repetition of these obsequious sociopaths, both in the
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.800]  military and the civilian and the CIA, who come to find the narratives and then finally
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800]  they extract money from it.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.000]  Well, I know in the meetings from folks that were in a conference call and happened that
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.760]  they kept saying, sir, 10,000 troops died for this, it's for the troops, and it's like
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:23.080]  he's got this weak point, literally, it shows how good he is, and he's like, yes, we can't
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:27.920]  give up, we're winners, we've got to, because we can't let them die in vain. What do we
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.720]  do about that psychology?
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:37.080]  Well, the bottom line of the psychology should have resided with McMaster, and he failed.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:42.840]  McMaster wrote a definitive book, the PhD thesis on the dereliction of duty, and the
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:49.200]  dereliction of duty, he explained exactly how these obsequious generals Abrams and West
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.960]  Moreland got the president to do what they wanted him to do. We have the same situation
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.080]  right now, and what he needs is a reality test, not his own family, he needs somebody
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:05.360]  from the outside, whether it's Roger Stone or someone else who he can trust to say, look,
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:10.680]  you have to be consistent with your promises to the people, and that way, Bannon was a
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.240]  very effective reality tester, where he had a problem, and I probably would have had the
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.040]  same problem, is that Bannon was talking too much as he came in, and he was talking too
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.680]  much as he left, in other words, in some ways he had to be more Machiavellian and more restrained
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.080]  on himself, in order to affect the changes that we are dealing with.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.640]  Well, sure, and then I love the New York Times today, it's like, Democrats warn Bannon, don't
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.320]  leak intel, we'll have you indicted, but they're the biggest leakers the world ever seen. We'll
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:45.800]  be back with phone calls, more clips from Trump, stay with us.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:57.880]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:02.360]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.360]  by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.560]  and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.040]  men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.880]  government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:29.480]  to abolish it and to institute new government. Independence isn't a day, it's a mindset,
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.320]  an attitude that says, I will not be your dependent, I will not be your slave. Dependence
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.080]  and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements. When you
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:46.800]  trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave. Slaves are never safe,
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:52.480]  you won't get rich by being a slave. Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:58.080]  who tries to take it. For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:05.560]  Years of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.560]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:17.560]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:23.560]  air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:29.560]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.560]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:40.560]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic,
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:48.560]  concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.560]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.560]  into our own hands, and it starts at inforwarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.560]  I want to tell you about Texas radio and the big beat.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.560]  It comes out of the Virginia swamps, cool and slow with plenty of precision.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:26.560]  The black meat narrow and hard to master. Some call it heavenly, it's brilliance.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.560]  Others being a roof on the western dream.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:38.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.560]  you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:48.560]  One last breath before the wind blows.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:54.560]  Better raise your ears. Sound the hooves knock at your door.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.560]  Lock up your wife and children now. It's time to wheel the blade.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:14.560]  Now you've got some company. The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:19.560]  They come to take your life. On to the dead of night.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  See the forehorsemen ride. So choose your fate and die.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:38.560]  Dave Mustaine wrote this song and now he's writing a lot of other good songs.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.560]  Growing up listening to that song, the forehorseman, when I was like 12 years old,
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.560]  lifting weights or whatever, I could never imagine years later,
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.560]  I'd work on a little bit behind the scenes to write some of the new albums.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.560]  But it shows how all of you can do amazing things.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:57.560]  You never know when you're doing little things how big it is.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.560]  An example of that is David Knight came in here yesterday and he goes,
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.560]  look I'm only getting hundreds of thousands of viewers online on millions,
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.560]  and we're only got 15 stations signing up in the next month.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.560]  I go, dude, most people take 20 years to get on 15 stations. You're doing great.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.560]  And I said, I used to be on access television in 95, 96,
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.560]  and a few thousand viewers, I had no idea when I was Mike Judge.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.560]  He said this on tape. I'm not bragging about me.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.560]  He made one of the top 10 TV shows ever, they had 11 seasons or whatever,
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.560]  King of the Hill, one of the few shows with a few decent values,
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.560]  and kind of the Hank Hill character, and then you got the Dale Gribble,
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.560]  because he didn't know if I was right or wrong, so he kind of created
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.560]  the Hank Hill character off his dad and his grandpa and me,
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.560]  but then the bad sides, he wasn't sure if we were right, was Dale Gribble, the conspiracy terrorist.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.560]  You know, it's Gold Fringe on the flag, it's the fascist court.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.560]  And then later, I meet Mike Judge, you'd be good friends with him,
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.560]  and he's like, yeah, look at this VHS, it says Alex Jones, you know, the three Gribbles,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.560]  and it was like, I was a composite, him watching every night, he used to go up there every night,
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.560]  and then he was riding King of the Hill while he was at his house in a studio,
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560]  and it's just then, I thought I wasn't influencing anybody at 95, 96,
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.560]  but I was influencing Mike Judge and King of the Hill,
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.560]  and that's just an example of how you throw these rocks out in the pond,
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:20.560]  and you don't know what they're going to do, and that's why the Globalists are so desperate
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.560]  about ban information, ban everyone, you have no power, you're scum, you're racist,
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:26.560]  if you talk about anything, if you notice there's death panels,
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.560]  or that we're doing a double your healthcare, you are a Nazi!
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:33.560]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, it's because they're so scared.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.560]  All of this is not a sign of their strength, it's a sign of their weakness,
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.560]  which scares me that a bunch of crazy people are dug in in the government
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.560]  who are peacocking around trying to stop Trump when they ought to be asking,
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.560]  we can beat him by becoming more populist and ride all the wealth
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.560]  and figure out why everybody hates us,
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.560]  but they don't want to figure out why everybody hates them,
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.560]  because they're going to project on to everybody else who they are a bunch of race pimps.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:59.560]  Now we'll go to the psychiatrist here in a minute, talk about that,
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.560]  Dr. Steve Chris, John Paul, Scott and others that are patiently holding,
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.560]  but briefly, before I play a few of these clips and go back to the chenic, of steveachenic.com,
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.560]  yeah, say what you want, I don't like this, this, because he said,
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.560]  and he always does what he says, man thinks this is bad, get out,
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.560]  I get you can't announce you're getting out, we just just sort of act away any announces,
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:21.560]  I've removed 90% of the forces, the last forces are leaving tomorrow,
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.560]  or you know, whatever, and then you don't have the Saigon event of 75,
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.560]  but I don't like it, but then compared to the wall of evil over here,
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.560]  I'm just not going to get the whole hissy fit about it,
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.560]  even though it's going to be our troops getting their arms and legs blown off,
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.560]  and I feel sorry for them, and I don't want 24 suicides a day and all this,
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.560]  I mean, he's trying to help with more visits to the VA and all this other stuff,
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.560]  trying to privatize it, great, whatever, we'll get the chenics taken on that,
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.560]  which should happen to the VA, he's worked in psychiatry at the VA,
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.560]  and run whole divisions of it, but all I know is my gut knows Trump's real,
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.560]  my instinct knows he's real, and I'm going to see him stumble,
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.560]  but he's in the arena, cut up pretty bad folks,
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560]  and the wolves are now coming in, trying to crash the market, everything,
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.560]  it's just a moment of real truth here, but before I go any further,
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.560]  if you don't fund us, it encourages the enemy to attack us,
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.560]  because we know they watch our capital and they know what we're doing,
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.560]  and there's been a lot of stuff behind scenes,
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:22.560]  but I'm just going to leave it at that, I mean, because they don't just say they're going to kill you,
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560]  there's also a lot of other things that come in to play,
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.560]  and some of the offers that you're good groups and good people,
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.560]  but 500 million, 50 million, 20 million, and we don't even want control here,
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560]  and it's just like, I don't know if I can deal with all that stuff, you know,
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:39.560]  and then they have the news, oh, 500 million dollars, oh, yeah, but all this stuff is happening,
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.560]  I just need you to buy products like water filters, air filters, T-shirts, books, videos, supplements,
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:49.560]  that I know are great, are the best products we can bring in, we go just private label,
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.560]  whatever's been around 20, 30 years, they go, he's still stuff's been around forever,
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.560]  yeah, the tried and true formulas, private label by us,
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  what do you think, I don't know, I'm a target, plus I want to sell you good stuff,
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.560]  but of course I go out and get the very best brand names and private label them.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:09.560]  I mean, anyways, we're selling out a DNA force, we're selling out a lot of the products,
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.560]  secret 12, 66% off, the colloidal silver, a DNA force is selling out,
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.560]  we can't do Myco ZX, that's sold out, the brain force is selling out,
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.560]  so it's not on sale anymore, survival shield X2 is still on sale,
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:25.560]  all the reganose is on sale, doesn't sound fancy, it's really amazing,
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  the sodium selenium just muster seed, truly organic, it's like our iodine,
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.560]  they go, we tested it, it's not sodium iodine, it's not this other iodine,
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  it's just pure iodine, which we've never seen anybody sell.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.560]  Well, it's pure atomic iodine from deep earth, yeah, you never saw anybody actually sell that,
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.560]  so everybody's too lazy to go dig it up and get a DEA license,
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.560]  the stuff like turns into blue, purple gas, like I dream a genie if you get it out in the open
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.560]  until we put it into the palm oil, the point is it's all available
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  at InfowarsLife.com, InfowarsStore.com, and I was not going to have this special today,
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.560]  but I got busy in meetings and a bunch of other stuff, we did not,
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.560]  it's my fault, get to the new specials, I haven't figured them out yet,
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.560]  but it's not something where, oh, the sale's one more day because I'm saying it,
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.560]  even though it turns out to work really well, I haven't gotten around to a new sale.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.560]  We never had one this big, this long, there's dozens of things,
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.560]  free shipping on $50 or more, Santa Forato ship, it's an additional 10% off,
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  at InfowarsStore.com, or triple A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9,
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:29.560]  but know this, when you spread our articles and videos, when you pray for us,
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.560]  when you talk to folks word of mouth about Infowars and NewsWars.com,
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.560]  when you send the videos out, when you buy products,
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.560]  you could not be savaging the enemy more, because this is war bonds here,
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.560]  and they think I'm crazy because I don't sell out to them,
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.560]  I'm not selling out to much pedophiles, it's not happening,
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.560]  it's easy to not sell out to these people.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.560]  A bunch of devil-worshipping, self-centered jerks that,
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.560]  oh, the finest thing in the world of an elite is to kill a child,
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.560]  that's really powerful, I mean, it's just, that's who they are.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.560]  These are the folks grabbing your kids out of your backyards, okay?
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560]  You take a one look at them and you can see it as well.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560]  So Dr. Pachett, I want to play some clips and go to calls,
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.560]  but getting into positive things, they've got Fox News, CNN,
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560]  they're all unified against Trump now.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.560]  Why do you think that is, and other points on that?
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  I want to get to a point that you said about the ability
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560]  to create something for oneself.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.560]  I think that's the most important thing we can teach our audience.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.560]  And let me say something, when I started writing,
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.560]  it took me, I was 20 years overnight success.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.560]  I was getting four and five rejections a day,
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.560]  and I was changing the type, the character, it didn't matter.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.560]  Then one day I came up with the notion of an ops center,
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.560]  which was a fictional notion of what would happen in the present
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560]  and in the future.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  And now the threat fusion centers, the whole model out of your brain.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.560]  And one day I walked to Clancy because he used me as a model
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560]  for Jack Ryan and Dick Clark.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.560]  And I said, Tom, I'm going to share this with you.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  Put your name on the book.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.560]  Now, this is the same book that was rejected hundreds if not
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.560]  thousands of times, went back to the same publishers
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.560]  with Tom Clancy's name on it.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.560]  They thought I was a genius.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.560]  They couldn't believe it.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.560]  They said this couldn't be the same book.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:20.560]  So my point to you and your audience is this is what America is about.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.560]  America is not about the congressmen or the politicians
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.560]  or even the generals.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  You serve if you want to serve.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.560]  You don't take money.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.560]  I did not take money.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.560]  And the one thing they could not understand about me,
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:35.560]  because I was a Cuban refugee, came to America,
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560]  and they told me I would have to serve this country.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.560]  And I said, fine, even though I may not agree with your wars,
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:42.560]  I will serve.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  And I did.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.560]  I was quickly promoted to an 07, which is a rear admiral rank,
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  at the age of 39.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  I had 10 years of pension in.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.560]  And you know what I did?
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.560]  I said, you know what, gentlemen, I'm not going to continue anymore.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.560]  And they said, are you nuts?
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.560]  Are you crazy?
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.560]  Do you not continue?
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560]  We're going to make you the director of NIMH,
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.560]  the director of this and direct.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.560]  I said, I don't want to be director of anything.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.560]  I just want to go out in the United States of America
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.560]  as a refugee and screw up.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.560]  They said, what?
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.560]  I said, yeah, be a chance to screw up.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.560]  Not a chance to succeed, but the chance to make my own mistakes
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:24.560]  without a safety net, without any degrees, without any medals,
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.560]  without anything else.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560]  Guess what?
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.560]  I screwed up.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.560]  And I enjoyed it.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.560]  And you know what?
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:33.560]  That's the message I can give to you and the entire.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  And everything they pitch with these participation medals and stuff
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  is don't screw up, never get out on the net.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.560]  But Eisenhower was the end of understanding
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.560]  that centralization of knowledge was the problem
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.560]  with his military industrial technocracy speech,
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.560]  because they had programs under Eisenhower that extended out
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.560]  to when my dad, even though he was gone by then,
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.560]  wrote off to, you know, to Union Carbide and to NASA.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  And then an 18-wheeler pulled up with a big ruby laser system
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560]  because, you know, he was doing good in school and all the stuff.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560]  And he was like 14 years old.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560]  And they go, here's your laser system.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560]  Now build it.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.560]  They were actually testing to see, because they knew it wasn't going
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560]  to come from the top.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.560]  It was going to come from, and they were sending weapons systems
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.560]  and lasers and stuff.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.560]  Later, he told me about the other people he knew
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:21.560]  were being sent, even crazier stuff, to see what kids would do.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.560]  Because back then, the elite knew it was from the grassroots.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  That was the American system.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.560]  Instead, it changed with a bunch of sycophant white shoe boys
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.560]  about how they're the elite.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.560]  And Carl Rove walking around arrogant, not realizing,
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.560]  if you really have real ideas, you know, you block your mind out
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.560]  when you become arrogant.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:39.560]  These people are missing the very essence of creation,
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560]  the very essence of that spark.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560]  No, you hit it on the head.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.560]  And one of the reasons why I've criticized the CIA,
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:50.560]  but I've always admired what they've done is because
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.560]  in the 1970s and 60s, they created the McCone Center at MIT
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.560]  to study political psychology, propaganda, national character
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  with people like Lucian Pye, Everett Hagen, Ken Kaufman.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.560]  And when you learn those things, you never forget it.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.560]  And in turn, that was the essence of the CIA then.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.560]  It eventually transmuted into other organizations,
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  but they were always very kind to me.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.560]  They've offered me endless types of jobs,
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.560]  and I just said, guys, I'm not interested.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.560]  I don't want to be in the business of being controlled.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.560]  And even when General Boykin asked me, do you want a clearance,
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.560]  I said, no, I don't want a clearance.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.560]  I don't need a cover because in the world I work in,
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.560]  as a singleton, just as an American,
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:39.560]  I go out there to specifically get interrogated
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.560]  so I can find out for us what are the key issues
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  that are going to be coming out in Syria.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560]  You don't find it out by confronting them.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560]  You find it out by having yourself arrested
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.560]  and finding out which questions are essential.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  Now, they never thought of that concept,
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.560]  but yet I have great generals like Keith Alexander and others
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.560]  and Jerry Boykin.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  Well, sure, you go out and you draw the enemy fire.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.560]  Correct.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.560]  I want to go to some phone calls here, but I just got word.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.560]  I just got word, I'm not going to say from whom.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:09.560]  It's not Roger Shone.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  It's not Sheriff Arpaio, and it's not anybody.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.560]  Nobody we've ever heard of.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.560]  The paperwork is clear.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.560]  The pardon is done.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.560]  Good.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  So he is set to sign it today.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.560]  We'll see when that's announced.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.560]  But they just want everybody to know that we have it here first.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560]  Arpaio's coming up in about 15, 20 minutes.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  I want to go to a few phone calls right now.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.560]  But just, it's not about, oh, we broke this or we did all this.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.560]  It's about the fact that we got this in front of the president
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.560]  and then he did something.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.560]  That's how sequestered and why they're so pissed.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  Because they know he goes to Info Wars.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.560]  He goes to Drudge.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560]  He goes to Breitbart.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.560]  They know, and then he watches Hannity.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.560]  And they're saying, sir, don't even look at these people now.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.560]  Well, what they're trying to do, and we've talked about it before,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.560]  is they're trying to deprecate you and deprecate you in a way that's
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.560]  just absurd because most of the media is totally jealous of what
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560]  you're capable of.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.560]  They can't riff in the way that you do.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560]  And I'm not trying to buddy you up.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.560]  Well, you're nice.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.560]  I was told the way he got the paperwork was almost done.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.560]  Go ahead.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  You can't riff the way you riff with both insight and humor.
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.560]  If you could tell me who does that.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.560]  And these are professional comedians.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.560]  Look at Bill Maher.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.560]  He can't do that.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.560]  All he has done is just collaborate.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.560]  I've known Bill Maher when he was a comedian in New York.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560]  Well, he's telling prompters.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.560]  Well, that's correct.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.560]  Then you look at, you know, whatever else, the British guy,
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.560]  totally useless.
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:43.560]  I mean, when you come to Alex Jones, and this was very important,
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560]  and I want the audience to understand it,
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.560]  it's not just about giving you information.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.560]  This is the ability to absorb it and understand the actual
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.560]  passions of somebody like yourself who grew up in Texas,
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.560]  somebody like myself.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.560]  Most people don't realize I grew up in Harlem on 108th Street
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.560]  in Amsterdam.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560]  I went to Booker T. Washington.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.560]  What's a white minority guy doing in a black school?
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.560]  So when you want to talk to me about the elites,
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.560]  this is the way I got out.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.560]  I got out because I got a scholarship thanks to David
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.560]  Nelson Rockefeller, which was a anonymous.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.560]  In other words, you had to compete.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.560]  It was called the New York State Region Scholarship.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.560]  And by chance, I won one out of 800 out of 2 million.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.560]  And I go to a school I've never heard of.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  Cornell.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:30.560]  I hadn't any shopping.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.560]  My parents couldn't care less.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560]  But you know the Rockefellers were obsessed with test scores.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.560]  They wanted to get everybody that had a brain.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:39.560]  Well, I'm not, I'm going to say something,
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.560]  but I know the Rockefeller, certain parts of the family,
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.560]  you know, they have much money and they've done many things.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.560]  But within their own family, and I won't name it,
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.560]  they have had massive, massive tragedy.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.560]  When a son is died, commits suicide,
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560]  and a daughter's hospitalized,
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.560]  that's not enough to be a Rockefeller.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.560]  And I have pity for them.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.560]  The Rockefeller Foundation, however, has been affir-
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.560]  No, you're right.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560]  Great wealth is a curse.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560]  People don't know that.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.560]  No, it is a great curse.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.560]  I used to treat very wealthy people in many places.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.560]  And they couldn't find their point of happiness.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.560]  No, I mean, I found out later,
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560]  like all these people, members of my family,
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560]  people that were involved in the Texas Instrument,
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  calculators and missiles and everything,
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560]  like, they would get like a billion dollars.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  Back when I was a billionaire, they would just give it away.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  And I'm like, why do they do this?
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560]  It was like, because they know it's a curse.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560]  That's correct.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.560]  It's not only a curse,
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560]  the guilt that comes in from making the money,
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560]  however they made it,
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.560]  the Texas Instruments pretty legitimate at that time.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.560]  But the point is, most of them,
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.560]  you can't become a billionaire without being a crook.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.560]  I mean, it's just not possible.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.560]  At the same time, in order to assuage their own guilt,
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560]  they give it away and make it sound
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  as if they're really self-righteous and noble.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.560]  I mean, nothing is more egregious in the Gates Foundation
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.560]  as if he had some major influence.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.560]  Oh, well, the Foundation's a money laundering deal.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.560]  He gets the money back.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.560]  Correct.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  Now, that's correct.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]  But there is an organization within the government
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]  that we never talked about.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:09.560]  And that's DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.560]  And what do they do?
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560]  They go out and they find the smartest individuals.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.560]  Well, no, I mean, it was basically DARPA.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.560]  What was the name of it before that sent my dad
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560]  the 18-wheeler with a laser?
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560]  Well, that was DARPA or ARPA at that time.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  But it was Defense Advanced Research Project Agency
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.560]  that understood the Internet in the 60s and the 70s.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  But think of this thinking in like 1965
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  to be sending thousands of kids science sets
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.560]  and 18-wheelers with lasers
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.560]  not put together to say,
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.560]  how would you put this together to see what you did?
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.560]  You know, and then my dad created like a particle beam,
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.560]  actually, not even a ruby laser.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.560]  And then it was blew up, but it was a big success.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.560]  But I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.560]  Imagine the mindset of that.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.560]  We're going to promise.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.560]  We're going to your phone calls on the other side

[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:53.560]  then judge our pile exclusive coming up.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:59.560]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:02.560]  So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.560]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.560]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.560]  in every size for incredibly delicious water now
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560]  and in an emergency.

[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.560]  Forget bunkers.

[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.560]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.560]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.560]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.560]  It's an honor to speak to a legend like you.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.560]  No, it's hard to talk to you. Come on.
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:34.560]  Well, this is what I want to say.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.560]  We need to get out of Afghanistan, the Middle East.
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560]  There's no point of us being there.
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.560]  The only one that benefits, sir, is Israel and the Zionists.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560]  We are there because we're joined to the hip with Israel
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  and the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee or APAC.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  We'll tremendous power.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.560]  Investment senators can't get elected to office in this country
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:53.560]  if they're against Israel.
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.560]  They're branded as an anti-Semite, a Jew-hater.
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.560]  They just wield too much power.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.560]  And talking about APAC, all of the garbage that's going on
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.560]  for Trump is coming from George Soros,
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.560]  who is an international Jewish banker,
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.560]  communist and fifth columnist,
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.560]  who's behind the Occupy Wall Street movement
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.560]  and the Black Lives Matter,
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:16.560]  and him along with Charles Schumer and Adam Schiff
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.560]  and Bernie Sanders, Diane Feinstein,
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  want to make America a Jewish communist nation.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.560]  Let's be honest.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.560]  America absolutely positively has a Zionist-occupied government,
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  the Jews control Wall Street, the media, Hollywood,
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.560]  and American foreign policy.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.560]  Well, let me ask you this question,
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.560]  because I think in your statement is the answer.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.560]  You've got Soros trying to overthrow Israel and Netanyahu
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.560]  in the documents in the WikiLeaks,
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.560]  and then you're saying that Soros is controlling America
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.560]  when he was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:52.560]  Isn't it that you've got all sorts of different Jews in the world
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:53.560]  with different political views,
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  and then some of these leftist Jews,
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.560]  because they're just leftist,
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.560]  have these collectivist models?
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.560]  I mean, I understand there's a big Israel lobby,
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:04.560]  and I don't like any foreign lobby manipulating us,
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.560]  and I've been against it.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.560]  So I get called anti-Israel while I'm called a minion of Israel,
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.560]  but let's get Pechenik's take on that,
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.560]  because I mean, I know Dr. Pechenik, you had family
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.560]  that actually did die under Hitler's occupation.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.560]  You're, I guess, half Jewish or whatever,
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.560]  so you guys fled to Cuba because the U.S. wouldn't take you
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.560]  or whatever.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.560]  Earlier, I guess, with FDR, but later would.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.560]  You've written a book about it,
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.560]  and your mother's experiences.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.560]  I mean, what is your real view on this
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.560]  as the guy that did the Camp David Accord successfully
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.560]  with Jimmy Carter?
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.560]  I mean, you're a famous guy when it comes to Middle Eastern peace.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.560]  What's really happening?
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:39.560]  He's not wrong.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:42.560]  I wish he were, but the issue of our dip,
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.560]  I'm as a Jew, and in the beginning,
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.560]  I was in what's called Betah.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.560]  Betah was the right wing of the Israeli armed forces
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:53.560]  and the right wing of the political system.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  What the gentleman is trying to say,
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.560]  and he's not being anti-Semitic,
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.560]  is that there is a disproportionate number of Jews
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  in the White House.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.560]  He's absolutely correct.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.560]  I do not need an Orthodox Jew in the White House
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.560]  who's going to tell you about Chabad.
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560]  What they don't tell you about Chabad
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.560]  is that Rabbi Schneerson was a traitor.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.560]  When he got out of Warsaw with the Nazi help
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.560]  and the Abwehr, he came to the United States
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.560]  and denounced my family who was exterminated
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:26.560]  and said the six million Jews were deserved to die.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:28.560]  So we have Israel.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:32.560]  When, in fact, we, the escaping Jews from Europe,
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560]  tried to get to Israel,
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.560]  and Eifman actually spoke Hebrew.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:39.560]  He was in Israel in the 1920s.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:42.560]  Ben-Gurion and the head of the Jewish agency
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.560]  said to the Eifman who wanted money and needed people.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.560]  He said, we will give you thousands of the Jews in the camps
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:53.560]  in return for some financial help.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.560]  The answer was no.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.560]  We need 300 cows instead of one Jew.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.560]  So the issue of the American Jew
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.560]  who knows nothing about anti-Semitism,
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.560]  the APEC issue, he's correct.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.560]  Isn't it really a ruling class of people feeding?
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.560]  Isn't it so-called Jews feeding on Jews?
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.560]  Like, Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.560]  Jews feeding on Jews.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.560]  You have different cultural Jews.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.560]  I mean, in Israel, you have 124 types of Jews.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.560]  What he's saying is that in America,
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.560]  APEC does have disproportionate power.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.560]  Let me give the example again.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:28.560]  Hold on. Let's come back with that and get Scott's comeback.
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.560]  Then our piles on.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.560]  How am I going to get 20 hours a day?
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.560]  There's just so much to cover here.

[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.560]  Cheers!
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.560]  By the way, I'm just curious.
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:45.560]  Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:15.560]  So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:48.560]  He should have had a jury, but you know what?
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:02:04.560]  I'll make a prediction. I think he's going to be just fine, okay?
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.560]  But I won't do it tonight because I don't want to cause any controversy.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:17.560]  Is that okay?
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.560]  But Sheriff Joe can feel good.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:26.560]  The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration,
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:32.560]  the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:39.560]  MS-13, we're throwing them out so fast they never got thrown out of anything like this.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:42.560]  We are liberating towns out on Long Island.
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.560]  We're liberating. Can you imagine?
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:50.560]  In this day and age, in this day and age, in this country, we are liberating towns.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.560]  This is like from a different age.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:54.560]  We are taking these people.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:57.560]  They don't shoot people because it's too fast and not painful.
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.560]  They cut them up into little pieces. These are animals.
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.560]  We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails and we're throwing them out of the country.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.560]  We're liberating our towns.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.560]  That's right. The same gangs that are torturing Mexico go to 120,000 people the last decade.
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:11.560]  You've seen it.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.560]  They're being kicked out.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.560]  You've lived it. And you elected me to put a stop to it.
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:22.560]  And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it. That I can tell you.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:31.560]  I remember 10 years ago when Sheriff Orpio was in the middle of his constitutional duties as sheriff there in Maricopa County.
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:35.560]  It'd be in a local news where they'd find 67 severed heads.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.560]  And then I would report it.
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:40.560]  And the news would say, Alex Jones made up severed heads.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:43.560]  Well, no one's making up the severed heads of the mass graves.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.560]  Texas is worse on our border.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:50.560]  They found like 5,000 buried people just in one year down by El Paso.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:54.560]  And it's the criminal gangs then working on the Democrats that keep it open.
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.560]  We're going to go to break.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:58.560]  We have the exclusive Sheriff Orpio interview.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:03:59.560]  Here he is joining us.
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.560]  And a lot of people said, hey, you know, he's out of power.
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.560]  The Justice Department's going after him. Let's just move on.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.560]  I said, move on.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:09.560]  I said, we're next in prison, buddy.
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:12.560]  We're the ones that are going to get set up next.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:20.560]  Orpio's the champion that basically woke America up and led us to this point many ways and went through all this hell.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.560]  Stopping the Islamic people, Chinese coming across, Eastern Europeans.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:25.560]  It didn't matter. Just illegals pouring across no border.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.560]  Like having no door on your house.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.560]  And now that he's out of power and they've got him on the horns of the globalist going to throw his ass in prison for years.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:36.560]  We're going to fight harder with our writers and reporters than Dr. Corsi.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.560]  We're going to get it in front of the president.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:40.560]  And when he finally got it in front of him, he had no idea.
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.560]  Which shows how isolated he is.
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.560]  So the story's bigger than our bio, though he's important.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  It shows how when the president gets the facts, he comes through.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:50.560]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:05:11.560]  Stay with us.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:24.560]  At the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:11.560]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:22.560]  We've got Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former federal agent, highly decorated sheriff for decades, America County raising the alarm that the collapse in Mexico was coming that we were facing in here.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:27.560]  50 miles into Arizona, no go zone, signs saying citizens don't go in these areas.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:32.560]  This lawless anarchy, poor Mexicans fleeing the tyranny trying to come up there.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:36.560]  He was just going after the criminals, being called a racist, having the UN come after him, everything.
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:43.560]  And then he has a kangaroo judge with no jury trying to put him in jail for basically years with made up contempt charges doing his duty.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:47.560]  And the president didn't know. Our listeners are like, why isn't he doing something for Arpaio?
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.560]  When we finally talked to him, he said, you're kidding. It was nowhere.
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:54.560]  So let's play that clip one more time and go to Sheriff Arpaio.
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:02.560]  But here's President Trump last night in Phoenix, throwing down the gauntlet and standing up for an American champion.
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:26.560]  By the way, I'm just curious. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:34.560]  Let's keep it going here. Look at that crowd. There's like a hundred scumbags outside.
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:50.560]  And the media spun it. The bikers were there against Trump. Just total liars.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:57.560]  By American, by American. That means no matter what color you are.
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:12.560]  So was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? That's what?
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:18.560]  He should have had a jury. But you know what? I'll make a prediction. I think he's going to be just fine. Okay?
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.560]  Let's go to the man himself, Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.560]  Only a few other people out there that's been through the gauntlet, Trump has.
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  I mean, just the lies, the demonization, the garbage, trying to protect citizens, black, white, Hispanic, you name it,
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:36.560]  from the scourge that Mexico has collapsed under.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.560]  So for being a guy that didn't go along with the Democrats and the establishment and them,
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.560]  like Trump and Sessions have said, these sanctuary cities are run by traffickers.
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:52.560]  They bust in city council members, brothers with basements full of people and they don't pay, they torture them and sometimes kill them.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.560]  This is Austin. I mean, this is a mafia. This is sick.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:04.560]  And Arpaio stands up against it and they finally with George Soros money and Bloomberg money ran him out through a fraudulent election.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  And now they want to put him in prison. Well, the president says, you're not doing that, but the bigger story is, as I said earlier,
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:15.560]  Trump didn't know about this because they've got him so isolated.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:21.560]  Former Sheriff of America County, former federal agent and DEA, Sheriff Arpaio.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  Thank you for joining us. Wow. Thanks for giving us the exclusive. You've got the floor.
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:31.560]  What it's like to see this to see Trump come through how they've got the CIA on TV saying they want to kill him.
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:35.560]  I mean, this country is already in a civil war and the Democrats started it.
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:48.560]  Well, I want to thank you, Alex and your staff, Jerry Corsi, Roger Stone for bringing this story out and reaching the president.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:55.560]  And, you know, I supported him from what, two years ago at the same forum that he did yesterday.
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:00.560]  And I'm with him and I'm with him to the end. I feel sorry what's happening to him.
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:06.560]  You know, especially the media, what they're doing to him. Every time he does anything, they pick on him.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:14.560]  But you and your station, you get out there and you tell it like it is.
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:20.560]  You break stories. Sometimes you take heat, but you know, in the long run, you're right.
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:27.560]  And you started this by saying an abuse of the system, abuse of the political system.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:35.560]  I can go on and on. And I'll be talking about that, about this whole situation in the near future.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.560]  Alex, you don't want to open a new case by making comments about it right now.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:41.560]  Pardon?
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:46.560]  You don't want to open a new can of words and a new can of worms until the pardon comes through.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:52.560]  I think you're probably on track on that one. But there's a big story here. It's not about me.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:13:04.560]  It's about our country. They can get me, a guy with 55 years in law enforcement, where Holder and Obama started this 60 days after they took office.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:13.560]  And here I am. I had two parking tickets in my life, served as a director in Mexico, South, you name it, I've been everywhere.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.560]  And I'm sitting at a defense table, a defense table.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:24.560]  They already drove me out of office, Soros, and they're still continuing going after me on this.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:32.560]  But they don't, I don't get angry normally, but I'm a little discouraged at the federal government, which I served.
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  I was, I joined the army when the Korean War broke out, but I served my country 55 years.
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  And this is what I get for it because they're after this sheriff and try to destroy him.
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.560]  So I'm a little, yeah, I'm a little angry, Alex, but you know what?
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:57.560]  Once again, it's people like you to get the story out and you'll hear more of this story as time continues.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.560]  Well, specifically, obviously, the president has the paperwork. The word is, I've heard it's already signed.
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:08.560]  I guess we're looking for the time to do it, but it's a no-brainer for the president. They're going to demonize him for it.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.560]  I know you're not supposed to get into the case itself, but what you were doing in Phoenix versus what they said you were doing,
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  thank God a few sheriffs blocked the crime wave that collapsed Mexico.
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.560]  You can't even go to Cancun now. There's robberies, murders, kidnapping.
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:26.560]  I love Cancun. I love Mexico. It's collapsing.
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:29.560]  Let's talk about the state of Mexico and then this dam breaking.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.560]  And then you dare try to just do some defense, just hold your hand up to it.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:36.560]  And you're supposedly a bad guy.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:39.560]  Well, I haven't served there as a director in Mexico.
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:44.560]  I work with Noriega, I had agents in Panama, Argentina, Bogotá.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.560]  So I've been around, especially in Turkey. I cover that area.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:53.560]  All these places are hot spots right now, but it's sad what's going on.
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.560]  I have to give the president a lot of credit.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:00.560]  You know, they talk about him speaking out, Twitter, whatever you call it.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:06.560]  No, that's a deterrence. The immigration problem, illegal, is subsided.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:09.560]  You know why? Because the president's putting the word out.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.560]  They're afraid to come over. They know they're going to jail.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:15.560]  So the president's doing the right thing when he starts talking.
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:20.560]  And I don't know why the media has to cut him in pieces every time he says anything.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.560]  It's very sad what they're doing to him.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:27.560]  Well, I know you were an instrumental first endorser of the president,
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  and you guys have hung up quite a bit.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.560]  They try to sequester him since he's been in the presidency,
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.560]  but did it feel good to see him? I mean, when did you, I'm not getting into details,
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:39.560]  but when did you start getting word? I kind of know the backstory,
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.560]  but when did you get word this was coming?
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:44.560]  What was it like to see that speech last night?
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.560]  Well, I'm watching you. That's how I find out.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:53.560]  The president has never called me. That's okay, or his staff.
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:59.560]  I was in the dark, and I'll tell you one thing.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:04.560]  I had to deal with the media. I had no contact with him, but that's okay.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.560]  I didn't show up at the rally. I would love to go because I've been the seven of them,
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:14.560]  but I didn't think it would be right because of possible demonstrations, riots,
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.560]  and why agitate the situation.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.560]  I wanted to make sure the cops were safe, the people were safe.
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.560]  So I missed it, but that's okay.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.560]  But I have a great respect and love for the president.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:30.560]  I'm with him to the end. I don't care what anybody says.
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.560]  I'm with him to the end. As long as he's the president, I'll be supporting him.
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:42.560]  Well, that's what this is. They're trying to bully all of us into basically
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:45.560]  deserting him when he's delivered so much already.
[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:49.560]  And just like, I'm not going to desert you because what you said, we're in this together.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:54.560]  They're coming after everybody, and it's really a great brotherhood or kinship
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:57.560]  to actually be persecuted by these globalist scum.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:00.560]  Why is the media after Trump? Because they know he's for real. These are globalists.
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:03.560]  They're trying to sell the country out, Sheriff.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:10.560]  I know. Mark Goldman talked to you. He had him on, so I have a good lawyer for a change.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.560]  So I'm fighting this out, and I'm never going to surrender.
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:22.560]  And I'll tell you, I'm going to try to get the real story out about the abuse that was done.
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.560]  They can do it to me. Think of that. They can do it to anybody.
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:30.560]  And that's dangerous for our country.
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:34.560]  Well, it's going to be very, very exciting to see the pardon.
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:36.560]  And I think the president, she uses presidential power more.
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  They're going to demonize it. They're going to call it reckless.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:44.560]  But he's not pardoning cocaine dealers and child smugglers like Bill Clinton.
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:49.560]  He's parking a guy with no criminal record that executed the law.
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.560]  Yeah, you know, I got two parking tickets in my life.
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.560]  Think of that. I'm a senior citizen.
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:00.560]  And after 55 years, I have to sit behind a defense table.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:05.560]  For what? For a misdemeanor? Get the same time for barking dogs?
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.560]  Because they went after me the day before early voting, the Department of Justice.
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:13.560]  And then that was under Obama.
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:19.560]  And then two weeks later, they went after me for a misdemeanor, contempt of court.
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:25.560]  And I'm not going to get into that situation now, but I'll tell you, I'll get into it very soon.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:30.560]  And then the media constantly say I'm a racial profiling.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.560]  Nothing came out racial profiling.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:40.560]  It's because I use the word race on a criteria where the Department of Justice authorized me to do.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:46.560]  Well, that's what it says on the on the forums buying a gun or getting a driver's license or being enrolled at a police station.
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:48.560]  It says that right there.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:52.560]  Yeah, and the judge on before now, I'm not going to get into it.
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:19:00.560]  She's the one that handled the 1070 and the Supreme Court came out and said that you can stop people and ask them for their, you know,
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:06.560]  to pursue into the probable cause and ask them for their papers or where they're from.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:13.560]  What's the big deal? I've been doing it a long time ago now that here's here's what's happening to me, but that's where I'm a big guy.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:15.560]  I could take care of myself.
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:18.560]  But once again, I have to, you know what?
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:19.560]  I had a gut feeling.
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:25.560]  I think they came out for the four hours before the rally.
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:28.560]  The press secretary and said that he would not talk about this.
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.560]  You know what?
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:34.560]  Everybody said he won't talk about it deep in my heart knowing him.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:36.560]  I knew he was going to talk about it.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:39.560]  I had no communication with anybody.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:40.560]  So you know what?
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:46.560]  He did talk about it and I'm very happy he's back to the old, you know, to speak out.
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:47.560]  That's the way he is.
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:52.560]  That's why people love him and that's why the media hates him.
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.560]  That's right.
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:58.560]  We finally have a president that's actually being the president and it isn't a coward and he was just trying to do fair deals.
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.560]  They've really hated you for a long time.
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:05.560]  Why did they single you out in one of America's biggest cities?
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.560]  Why did the establishment hate Sheriff Joe Arpaio so much?
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:10.560]  Look, you got the president on your side.
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:11.560]  The pardons coming.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.560]  I know your lawyers are like, hey, be careful and I've had your lawyer always a great guy, you know, certainly.
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:16.560]  But this is a time for speech.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:17.560]  It's a time for freedom.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:20.560]  Time to celebrate what's happening and standing up and not being intimidated.
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:22.560]  And Trump isn't intimidated.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:23.560]  It's why they hate him.
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:26.560]  You weren't intimidated and that's why they get freaked out.
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:27.560]  You have your own inner compass.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.560]  You know you're a good person.
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.560]  You know you're not a racist.
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:33.560]  And so you're doing what you think you need to do.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:34.560]  That's what they hate.
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:35.560]  Why do they hate you so much?
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.560]  And where do you see all this going?
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:38.560]  Where do you see America going?
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:39.560]  What do we do?
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:47.560]  To not just stand up for Sheriff Arpaio, but all of ourselves, whether we're old, young, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter against these globalists.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:48.560]  You know, I'm a nice guy.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:53.560]  When you get right down to it, I'm not going to get into my personal life and so on.
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:54.560]  Been married 60 years.
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:01.560]  By the way, it's my wife's birthday, 48 hours from now, so I'm very happy because, you know, she's concerned.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:03.560]  She followed me all over the world.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:04.560]  I had a lot of threats.
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:06.560]  People are arrested trying to kill me and all that.
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:07.560]  Won't get into that.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.560]  But you know what?
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.560]  I'm an elected sheriff.
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:15.560]  I was a bureaucrat for all those years as a cop in D.C., Vegas, you know, Army.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:21.560]  But now I was an elected sheriff and I feel that being elected, I have to do what the people want me to do.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.560]  I did, I've been sure, 24 years, longest in history.
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:30.560]  You know, they go after me because of the tents and I can talk on and on and on.
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:36.560]  But we've done some great things, but they don't want to hear that these activists that want to get rid of this sheriff.
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:40.560]  By the way, those tents are better than all the mass graves across the border.
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:43.560]  Yeah, and our military are living in tents fighting for their country.
[02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:46.560]  So the new guy, of course, took everything down.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:52.560]  I'm not going to get even though Soros gave him $4 million to win the election.
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:54.560]  Go after him, sheriff, do it.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.560]  I mean, believe me, Trump's fighting.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:59.560]  Tell us what you think about Soros, that Nazi collaborator.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:04.560]  Well, he went after me for illegal immigration and he said the tents have to go.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:07.560]  But there's another thing I'm not going to talk about now.
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:13.560]  I feel he really went after me and I'm not going to get into birth certificates right now.
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:20.560]  But this is a bigger subject matter and we'll address that in the near future.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.560]  Well, I've been asking the question, sheriff, at the time we have left, you've got the floor.
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.560]  What do you want to cover?
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.560]  The world's listening.
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:27.560]  This is going to get picked up everywhere.
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:28.560]  You got seven, eight minutes.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.560]  You've got the floor, sheriff.
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:30.560]  Tell us.
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:33.560]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you again.
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.560]  I don't blame the president.
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:40.560]  He's got a lot on his plate, but I'm pretty sure he didn't know about this.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:43.560]  No, no, I've talked to folks that talked to him and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:48.560]  He did not know and didn't believe it when he was told a month ago.
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.560]  Well, where are those people that I knew on the campaign?
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.560]  But you know, that's the bureaucracy.
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:58.560]  People want to isolate the president sometimes.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:22:59.560]  They're all greedy.
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:00.560]  They wouldn't contact.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:02.560]  I mean, the times I've talked to the president, I didn't ask for anything.
[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:03.560]  I said, cut the taxes.
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.560]  No, we believe in you.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.560]  Defend the troops.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.560]  Defend the border.
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.560]  Defend Christianity.
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:08.560]  Stop radical Islam.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:11.560]  And I'm not saying I'm a great guy.
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.560]  Lobbying him to be strong and good helps my family.
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.560]  Not asking for a family member job.
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.560]  That's all these pissants want, Arpaio.
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:21.560]  It's like when they talk to him, they just want their little thing.
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:25.560]  They don't get we're going to lose everything if they don't stop being little shmucks.
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:31.560]  Well, you know, I think I've been on 4,000 TV interviews overseas.
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:34.560]  I'm not even talking about locally.
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:36.560]  So I do deal with the media.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:38.560]  You know, how are you going to get the word out?
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:41.560]  Alex, if you don't deal with the media, I don't have money on the side.
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:42.560]  So I deal with them.
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:43.560]  Okay.
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:47.560]  There's a lot of good reporters, a lot of good station, but you get aggravated sometimes.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:51.560]  I know how he feels when they pick him on everything he does.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:53.560]  Certain channels, you know that.
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:54.560]  And that's sad.
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:56.560]  They ought to be supporting him.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:00.560]  Talk about the good things for the good of our country that he's doing.
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:02.560]  So I feel sorry for him and his family, too.
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:04.560]  They're going after his family, too.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:06.560]  Exactly. How big a champion?
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.560]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.560]  Don't think me.
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:09.560]  You are me.
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:10.560]  You're Trump.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.560]  I'm you.
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.560]  We're under attack.
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:13.560]  We're doing this.
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.560]  Let me tell you, buddy, me defending you is defending me.
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.560]  Believe me, I get that.
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:18.560]  Folks don't get that basic thing.
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:20.560]  Hang together, hang separate.
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:21.560]  Benjamin Franklin.
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:24.560]  Americans need to rediscover that.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:26.560]  Well, you're correct, Alex.
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:30.560]  And I'm not going to, you know, I don't watch it that much.
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.560]  I'm beginning to watch it now.
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.560]  But I've been on your show years ago.
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.560]  You can, you know, they give you a bad reputation.
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  But how many times have you said things that come true?
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:43.560]  People don't talk about that.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.560]  So, you know, and you use common sense.
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.560]  A lot of your predictions are common sense, you know, being around.
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:56.560]  By the way, here from Austin, I was head of the federal drug enforcement there in
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:58.560]  Texas covered your area.
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.560]  I didn't know you were in Texas.
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:03.560]  But some good people come from Texas, do you know?
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:04.560]  Exactly.
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.560]  Also, what they do to you and me and everybody in Trump is they build a strongman.
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.560]  They say we said something.
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.560]  Notice they never show the video.
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.560]  And then they just put fake quotes.
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:12.560]  Fake news is so bad.
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.560]  I've never seen the media this bad.
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.560]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.560]  They don't like the president.
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.560]  Let me tell you.
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.560]  And there's a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that don't like him.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.560]  You know why?
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.560]  Because he's doing his job and he's outspoken.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.560]  He's keeping his promises.
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.560]  They don't like that.
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  The bureaucracy.
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:36.560]  I know I've been in Washington three times with some high jobs.
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:37.560]  I know how they operate.
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:38.560]  He's different.
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:44.560]  So why not give in and let him do his job, take advantage of it for the good of our country?
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.560]  He's great overseas.
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:48.560]  I think he knows more than any secretaries say.
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:50.560]  We haven't had a president like this in forever.
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:52.560]  They just love him overseas.
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:54.560]  But our media says everybody hates him.
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:55.560]  Yeah, of course.
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:57.560]  They love him over there.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  I'll never forget just briefly.
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.560]  I took over Mexico City.
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:06.560]  They hated this because G Gordon Liddy and I ran an operation in except for the Mexicans hated this.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.560]  So I took over.
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:08.560]  I met the attorney general.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:09.560]  He used to come to my house.
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.560]  You know how I got him on my side?
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.560]  He liked blueberry pie.
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.560]  My wife kept pumping out blueberry pie.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  I threw some whiskey from the PX.
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.560]  I got more depth with blueberry pie and whiskey than a big stick.
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:22.560]  That's how you do it.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  You go in the back room, light up a cigar, make a deal.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.560]  And he's making some good deals.
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:29.560]  You'll never hear about it.
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.560]  They always criticize him whether the first, what the first lady wears.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  What is this?
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.560]  Exactly.
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  Wow.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  Sheriff Arpaio, what is it like though?
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.560]  Is it surreal to see the president preparing to pardon you for doing your job?
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:46.560]  I mean, that has got to be surreal.
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:50.560]  Well, he'll know more as time goes on.
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.560]  But the real story is on this situation.
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.560]  I'm not going to keep quiet.
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:59.560]  Not for me, but because it affects everybody.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  If they can do this for me, Alex, they can do it to you.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.560]  They can do it to everybody.
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.560]  That's not right.
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.560]  You know why they're panicking?
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:13.560]  It's because Trump, when he gets info and evidence, he'll make good decisions.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.560]  That's why they're trying to isolate him.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:18.560]  And I'm really worried with banning out and all this other stuff that's going on.
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:22.560]  He's stronger than ever, but he is just in the swamp.
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:26.560]  And I just, it's not like some football game where you want your team to win.
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:27.560]  This is beyond that.
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:30.560]  This is so real for my children, everything else.
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  And the left one's riot, civil war, death, you know, cop-tilling.
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:39.560]  It's just, and they're saying, they said he wanted civil war.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.560]  When they're calling for civil war, Sheriff Arpaio, and they've got a Phil Mudd,
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:48.560]  former director of counterterrorism for the CIA saying, quote, two weeks ago,
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.560]  we're preparing to kill the president.
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.560]  That is a total rogue government out of control.
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:56.560]  Why isn't he arrested?
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.560]  Well, I think the president should start cracking down and get some people
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:03.560]  that are willing to have the guts to do that.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.560]  I'm not going to criticize the federal government,
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:14.560]  but I think they ought to start bringing people in that have the protection of the president.
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.560]  I'll use the word loyalty.
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:21.560]  You know what, if you work, the people that work for you,
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.560]  those people have to be loyal to you.
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:24.560]  You're their boss.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.560]  The president is the boss.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:29.560]  So you ought to be loyal to carry out his policies.
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.560]  And if you don't like it, go get another job.
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:36.560]  That's in private industry anywhere.
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:38.560]  Not that you're going to do something.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:40.560]  You're loyal under the Constitution.
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  He's totally executing it, so you're totally loyal.
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.560]  I've never felt such loyalty as I feel towards Trump.
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:50.560]  I just feel it's very empowering, actually.
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:53.560]  Yeah, I feel sorry for him, but you know what?
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:54.560]  He's tough.
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.560]  And I said this when I first introduced him two years ago in Phoenix.
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:03.560]  It was kind of an empty platform, a stage, if you know what I mean.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:05.560]  He was running against 17 people.
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:06.560]  But you know what I said?
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.560]  He's going to be the next president.
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  And I'm going to say something right now.
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.560]  My gut tells me he'll go down as one of the greatest presidents we had.
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.560]  I've ever had in this country.
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.560]  Mark my words.
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.560]  When it's all over, that's with his reputation.
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:22.560]  Stay there.
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:23.560]  Let's do a few more minutes.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:24.560]  I know you've got to go, Sheriff Arpaio.
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:26.560]  Legendary fighting against tyranny.
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.560]  We're going to come back and talk about that, more of that,
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.560]  because you got cut off by the music.
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.560]  I want to talk about, I agree.
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:34.560]  I think if he delivers, he'll be as great as George Washington.
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:36.560]  He'll be a new, he'll be a Trump monument, folks.
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:38.560]  It's better than Washington.
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:40.560]  This is it. This is real.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.560]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.560]  And how do we remove that power from Washington
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:17.560]  to our local communities to the individual?
[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:19.560]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:21.560]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:25.560]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:27.560]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.560]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution
[02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:32.560]  to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:34.560]  But as James Madison also pointed out,
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:36.560]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:38.560]  People who mean to be their own governors
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:41.560]  must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:44.560]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:47.560]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:51.560]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:31:07.560]  From ForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:26.560]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:28.560]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:31.560]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:33.560]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:37.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:41.560]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:43.560]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:45.560]  replacing older, more expensive filters
[02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:47.560]  that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:50.560]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:52.560]  at ForWars.com.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:24.560]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:27.560]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:30.560]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.560]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:35.560]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:39.560]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be,
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:42.560]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:45.560]  to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:47.560]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:50.560]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.560]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.560]  With Z-Shield, at ForWarsLive.com.
[02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:56.560]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:58.560]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.560]  Across the desert, spare man.
[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:02.560]  I'd read the mountain there, man.
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:04.560]  I'd travel ahead my share, man.
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:06.560]  I've been everywhere.
[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:10.560]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:14.560]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:19.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:22.560]  I'm a killer, I've been everywhere, man.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.560]  All right, it is surreal to have Sheriff Joe Arpaio
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:28.560]  with his long service, the Army DEA.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:31.560]  Sheriff for decades, they're America County.
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:34.560]  George Soros, Bloomberg.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:37.560]  Just millions and millions and millions of peace dumped in.
[02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.560]  Now the Southern Property Law Center has been given billions of dollars.
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.560]  Hundreds of millions every few months, I see.
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:49.560]  To run YouTube and Google and they're banning jihad watch
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:53.560]  in groups that just expose Hamas and al-Qaeda groups.
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:55.560]  They'll show like a clip of an Imam saying,
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:57.560]  kill Americans, kill cops, blow up.
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:59.560]  And then they go, you can't do that.
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:01.560]  Like Germany, where they arrest you for it.
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.560]  So you really understand the Democrats
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:09.560]  have demographically looked at Islam with a billion and a half people.
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:13.560]  They're going to have something like by 2026, 2027,
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:15.560]  10 years from now, 3 billion.
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:18.560]  And they've made their demographic choice.
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:23.560]  The weird, crazy left is going to join with radical Orthodox Islam.
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:28.560]  And they're sexualizing our children and they are running ramparts
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:31.560]  and kill the president all over the news.
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:36.560]  And it is just, it is a civil war they've started.
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:40.560]  And then they say the president is involved in the destabilization
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:42.560]  when all his speeches are, let's love each other.
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:45.560]  Let's come together, let's take care of our elderlier veterans.
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:47.560]  Let's get jobs back.
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.560]  And then he delivers despite Republican and Democrat opposition.
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:54.560]  And I say, let's have everybody run against these neocons
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:56.560]  and fake conservatives and Democrats.
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.560]  And let's break the trance and see this big realignment
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.560]  we already saw last year.
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  900 plus house seats in those states.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:08.560]  30 plus states, Republican governors, Senate, House.
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:12.560]  The media is acting all crazy and acting confident
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:15.560]  and saying Trump's dementia or Trump's evil or Trump's going to die
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:17.560]  because they're desperate.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:20.560]  The Republican and Democratic establishment are hanging on
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.560]  by their fingernails.
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:23.560]  That's my view.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:25.560]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, I'd like you to speak to that.
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:31.560]  And what do we do as citizens when they're on every major channel
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:35.560]  saying kill the president, martial law, arrest all the conservatives,
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.560]  shut down, talk radio.
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:39.560]  I mean, they're really calling for some tall orders.
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:41.560]  And I go, oh, that's just crazy.
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:42.560]  You won't get it done.
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:44.560]  But, you know, they've got a lot done before.
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  What do we do?
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:47.560]  Because we're not extremists.
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:50.560]  We sound crazy even covering what they're saying.
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:52.560]  It doesn't sound real.
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:53.560]  But it's happening.
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:55.560]  What do you think with your guts and your gravitas
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:59.560]  and your acumen and your history, your knowledge, your wisdom?
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:01.560]  What do you think we should do?
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:02.560]  Where is America?
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:04.560]  What do you want to say to President Trump?
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.560]  Well, first of all, I've said this for many, many years.
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  I learned one thing, especially in the federal government,
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:13.560]  that the president sets the temple.
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.560]  He sets the tone.
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:18.560]  And this president is setting the temple in the tone.
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:23.560]  The problem is you have to have people that will follow out his policies,
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.560]  not try to beat him down or oppose him.
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:31.560]  And I worry sometimes about the bureaucracy, Alex.
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.560]  I mean, where is the real loyalty?
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:36.560]  A lot of people don't like this president.
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:38.560]  Actually don't like him.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:39.560]  So, you know what?
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.560]  Those in the government that don't like him,
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:44.560]  they're not going to follow his policies, get rid of him.
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:48.560]  I don't know why he's taken this long to make changes.
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:56.560]  For example, the integrity unit that went after me under Lynch and Halder.
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:58.560]  The same people are there.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:00.560]  Why aren't they changing these people?
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:03.560]  You have the opening of the...
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.560]  They just ignore the president's orders.
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:08.560]  Maybe he should call you up there to help with that.
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:09.560]  Well, you know what?
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:11.560]  I'm not looking for a job.
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:13.560]  You know, when the president calls everybody,
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:17.560]  he says, oh, I have to serve my country, I have to go.
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:18.560]  Well, that's okay.
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:19.560]  I understand that.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:20.560]  That's patriotism.
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.560]  However, if he called me, it would be very difficult for me
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.560]  to turn him down because I will do anything to help him out.
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:33.560]  I don't know if that makes sense to you or not.
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:34.560]  No, I get it.
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:37.560]  Aren't you like 85?
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:39.560]  You have to give that out?
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.560]  No, you look like you're about 70.
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:45.560]  My point is you've got such stamina, such energy.
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.560]  I understand you don't want more work.
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.560]  You deserve to rest.
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:51.560]  But absolutely, I would imagine somebody like you
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:54.560]  is chomping at the bit to keep doing his duty.
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  I'm not fishing.
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:57.560]  I'm still active.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:00.560]  And it's always, you know, Joe Smith Jr.
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560]  Joe Smith Sr.
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:06.560]  Me is Joe Arpaio, comma, 85 years old.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:09.560]  Every, every time they mentioned my name,
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.560]  they have to put 85 next to I'll outgun anybody.
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:17.560]  But Joe, I think it's an honor like Obi-Wan Kenobi
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:19.560]  that you've done so much and that you're so vibrant.
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:23.560]  I meant that as a laurel that you're 85.
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:24.560]  Italian olive oil.
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:26.560]  Always my mother fired the game from Italy.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:28.560]  Drink the olive oil.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.560]  No, I agree, but just get it clear from me.
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.560]  When I'm 85, I want to be like Joe Arpaio.
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.560]  When I'm 71, I mean, look at Trump looks like he's 60 for 71.
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.560]  What a bull.
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:39.560]  That's right.
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:42.560]  We were born the same day, you know, you know,
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:43.560]  I was born on flag day.
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:45.560]  He was born on flag day.
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:47.560]  And I'm going to tell you something, Alex.
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:52.560]  I've been the honorary chairman for Bush, Mitt Romney,
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:55.560]  Perry, you know, and all these people I endorse,
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.560]  they always say, don't say this, say that,
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  not once has the president or his staff ever told me
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:06.560]  what to say, what not to say made it difficult
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.560]  because when I'm introducing them all the time,
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:11.560]  I don't know if I'm going to say something to her again,
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:12.560]  but I will say this.
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:14.560]  We've been traveling the same highway,
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.560]  95% we think the same way without any collusion.
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:21.560]  You're saying you're synced up.
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:23.560]  You're synced with the president.
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:24.560]  Yes.
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:29.560]  Without even exchanging information or how to,
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:30.560]  what to say, think of that.
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:36.560]  I've never seen this before where a candidate will let you go along,
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:39.560]  do what you want to do, not tell you what to say.
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:41.560]  He's never done that.
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:44.560]  That's why I hate him because the globalists want to script everything
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  and he doesn't script.
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  He doesn't tell a prompter.
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:47.560]  He doesn't make you do it.
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:49.560]  He knows you're a good guy.
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:51.560]  He respects you and lets you talk.
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:53.560]  That's why the political class of these nobodies
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:55.560]  that get control of these gatekeepers,
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.560]  that's why they fear Joe Arpaio.
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:00.560]  It's why they fear Donald John Trump.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:03.560]  And I think if they miscalculate and kill him,
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:05.560]  it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.560]  I don't want to violent civil war though, folks,
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.560]  win politically, withdraw your money from globalist groups,
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.560]  liberal groups, and just support patriots.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:15.560]  What are your concerns about their attempts to kill him?
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:17.560]  What do you think would happen Joe Arpaio
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:19.560]  if they kill the president?
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:24.560]  Well, first of all, it would be a sad day for our country,
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:29.560]  but number two, anybody that talks about any threats,
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:31.560]  throw them in jail.
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:33.560]  I've been threatened, I don't know how many times,
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:35.560]  at least we lock our people up to threaten me.
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:37.560]  Those that threaten me go to jail.
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:39.560]  So I'm concerned about him.
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:40.560]  I really am.
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:43.560]  A lot of kooks out there, a lot of them out there.
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  So I do have that concern about our president.
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.560]  But you know, he's not going to stop,
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.560]  he's going to do what he's been doing,
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  he's going to have his rallies, he's going to do,
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.560]  and let's hope that the Secret Service
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.560]  and law enforcement protect him.
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.560]  Because you know, he loves the cops,
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:00.560]  he loves veterans, he loves the military.
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:03.560]  I know, I've been with him, I know how he reacts.
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:06.560]  So he's just a great guy,
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.560]  people will leave him alone.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:10.560]  I was about to say, they blocked his inauguration,
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.560]  I couldn't get in for three hours, they beat everybody up,
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:14.560]  then they said nobody was there or it was a record crowd.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:16.560]  And then I know the Secret Service,
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:18.560]  I've talked to him, he said, I don't care.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.560]  He goes, I can't give in to their intimidation and fear.
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:23.560]  When he got out for miles and walked to the front of the motorcade,
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:27.560]  this is an act of defiance against them and their threats.
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:30.560]  And I don't, he loves life, but he's very fatalistic.
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:33.560]  And you know, I'm the same way when I was in Seattle,
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:35.560]  they were on the news saying, you come out, we're going to kill you.
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.560]  So I went out and marched around unguarded,
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.560]  and they even attacked me because at a certain point,
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:42.560]  the cowards need to know, you could take my life,
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.560]  but you're not taking what I stand for.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:47.560]  They're the cowards, they need to know, we're not afraid.
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.560]  That's right.
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.560]  I was there at the inauguration too,
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:54.560]  and I'll tell you a secret at the convention.
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:58.560]  Everybody was asking me, when am I going to speak?
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:00.560]  And I got no message,
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:03.560]  but I was able to get in and see the president by accident
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:05.560]  when he was relaxing,
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:08.560]  and he had a few people I'll mention who was near him.
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:11.560]  And I went up to him, I said, Mr. President,
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:14.560]  well, at that time he wasn't the president,
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:17.560]  but I mentioned that don't you ever think
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  that I turned down speaking, you know,
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:23.560]  for you on the stage, he went bananas.
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:25.560]  You mean you're not speaking?
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.560]  Nope, nobody told me.
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:30.560]  Boy, I'll tell you, once again,
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.560]  they isolated him from me,
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:35.560]  but you know what, I did speak,
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:38.560]  actually I got a better good spot at the last night,
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:41.560]  but he doesn't know a lot of things that are occurring.
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:44.560]  You know what's more important in this video we're watching?
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.560]  He put his wife and his kids out front too,
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.560]  and they were willing to do it.
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:50.560]  That's a commitment right there.
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.560]  He's got a great family.
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  You know, I've been married about 60 years,
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:57.560]  and I have four grandkids,
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:00.560]  and my wife has been around the world.
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:03.560]  She's a tough gal, but she loves Trump.
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:05.560]  And I know that he thanked,
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:07.560]  when he found out my wife had cancer,
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:09.560]  when I was in the federal court,
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:12.560]  he called her and he's followed up with those calls
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:15.560]  several times to see how my wife is doing.
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:20.560]  He didn't need to use my wife to get me to support him,
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:22.560]  because I was hooked with him from day one.
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.560]  I didn't have to use my wife.
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:25.560]  So this is...
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:27.560]  I'll tell you a story.
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:29.560]  I've had one divorced, unfortunately,
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.560]  but my new wife, I got married,
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:34.560]  and not even tell anybody.
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.560]  It was a secret.
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:38.560]  I got about it and called me to talk to her
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.560]  when I was in Hawaii in January,
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:42.560]  and he wasn't doing it as a stunt.
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:44.560]  He's all about families, all about people.
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.560]  He understands humans of the value,
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:50.560]  workers, factories, firemen, police, school teachers,
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:51.560]  farmers.
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:52.560]  He likes people.
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:53.560]  He's not a globalist.
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:55.560]  All these European leaders and socialists,
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:56.560]  none of them have kids.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:57.560]  They're not committed.
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:43:59.560]  They're little selfish people.
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:01.560]  Trump's got a whole bunch of kids, a bunch of life.
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:03.560]  I'm not here to grovel.
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:06.560]  It's just comparing him to an Obama or to a Bill Clinton.
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:09.560]  I mean, it's night and day.
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:10.560]  Well, you're right.
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:13.560]  And I want to thank you again.
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:15.560]  You know, sometimes you disagree with the president.
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:17.560]  He can't be perfect.
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:19.560]  But I want to thank you again, Alex,
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:21.560]  because you're getting that word out.
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:24.560]  You can't rely on certain news channels.
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:25.560]  You know that.
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.560]  Absolutely.
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:29.560]  Well, your story is big because when he saw the facts,
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:31.560]  he didn't know, got upset, did something.
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:32.560]  We're going to see this pardon.
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.560]  It's great.
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:34.560]  And we're all in this together.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.560]  Sheriff Joe, when the pardon comes down, promise me,
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:37.560]  I'm going to be careful.
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:38.560]  We're the first.
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:39.560]  We love handy everybody else.
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:40.560]  Thanks for giving us the first one.
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:44.560]  Please come on and give us all the backstory once you're free
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:48.560]  of this spurious kangaroo court, you know, garbage.
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:50.560]  But again, thank you so much for joining.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.560]  I know you've got some websites, other stuff.
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:54.560]  How do how do folks find you?
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:55.560]  How do they follow you?
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:57.560]  What's the best way for people to keep track of,
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:00.560]  you know, a guy that basically swam against the stream and won?
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:02.560]  Well, I don't have a computer.
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:07.560]  I have a smith Corona typewriter and I don't have Twitter's.
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  I don't have email.
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:11.560]  I know you've got some sites and stuff with Zulu and stuff.
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:13.560]  So, so when he's on next, we'll plug all those.
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.560]  Yeah, Mike's a good guy.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:16.560]  He's a good guy.
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:19.560]  So anyway, I want to thank you, Alex.
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:21.560]  All right, Sheriff, we appreciate you.
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:22.560]  We know you got a lot to do today.
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:25.560]  We appreciate you being, you know, honorable and hat tipping that
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  we were behind the scenes.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.560]  We didn't even talk about it publicly thinking it might get
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.560]  to Bosch. We don't literally, we don't care about,
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:31.560]  we care about the results.
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:33.560]  And I just, if they're setting me up, I know you're going to
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:35.560]  come to my aid because let me tell you, I know what you've
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:36.560]  been through.
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:37.560]  It's really been rough for me.
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:38.560]  I'm not going to play.
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:40.560]  I asked for it, but you find out how evil they are.
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:42.560]  You're like, damn, these people are really bad.
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.560]  It makes you recommit to fight them.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.560]  Yes, but take care of yourself.
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:48.560]  All right.
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:49.560]  Any other points you forgot to make?
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:50.560]  Just final comment.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.560]  No, just stay tuned.
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.560]  I'm not done yet.
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:57.560]  So we'll figure out what happens in the near future.
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:45:58.560]  All right.
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:45:59.560]  Thank you.
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:01.560]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, about to be pardoned by the president.
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:02.560]  Now this is historic.
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:03.560]  Thank you, sir.
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:04.560]  Thank you.
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:05.560]  Thank you.
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:08.560]  You know, I think it's not that we're good.
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:09.560]  It's that we mean well.
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.560]  We don't have bad will.
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.560]  Well, we know we're bad.
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:12.560]  We're falling.
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:13.560]  You know, I'm a Christian.
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.560]  I know that I'm an evil person, but I want to be good.
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:17.560]  And that's the difference.
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:19.560]  But this is a microcosm of everything because this is going
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:21.560]  to be in thousands of those papers that we have the
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:22.560]  exclusive.
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:23.560]  It's going to be all of her.
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:24.560]  It's going to help us.
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:26.560]  But I didn't early on when they, when they did this,
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:27.560]  no one was covering it.
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:28.560]  I said, it's wrong.
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:29.560]  No one's doing this.
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:30.560]  It's wrong.
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:31.560]  We got to get to the president.
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:35.560]  Let's write articles every two days for months to get our
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:37.560]  pile coverage because I was protecting myself.
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:42.560]  See, when you step into this, you then like hook up with
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.560]  all these other people.
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:46.560]  And when they're chopping him up, like you kept saying,
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:47.560]  they're getting me.
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:49.560]  They kill our pile.
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:50.560]  They've hurt me.
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.560]  They put him in prison.
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:52.560]  They hurt his family.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:53.560]  That's me.
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:56.560]  That's not some talk.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:02.560]  That means you mess with people that I know are honorable and
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:04.560]  have done a good job and who are politically incorrect and
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:07.560]  are being demonized and who a lot of world people say, oh,
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.560]  that's a failure.
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:12.560]  Soros destroyed him.
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:13.560]  The UN sued him.
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:14.560]  They, they won.
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:17.560]  No, they didn't.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:20.560]  Because you see, we've got the president and he's going to be
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  the symbol in their face of the higher power because everything
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:27.560]  we do here on earth is just a mirror of what's above as above
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:32.560]  so below to use their alchemy terms.
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:35.560]  And so then they understand how it works.
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:41.560]  But the ultimate part is when you die because we are all bad.
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:45.560]  And what you want is the big part.
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:49.560]  And man, I used to doubt that, but now I've lived a long time.
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.560]  It feels like a thousand years actually.
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:59.560]  And I have seen it's evil.
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:03.560]  When you share the same thing out of somebody's mouth, the same
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:06.560]  weird stuff nobody else ever said in one city and you hear it
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:09.560]  another and the person literally growls at you and you're like,
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:10.560]  this is Linda Blair.
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:11.560]  This is real.
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:13.560]  That's this isn't made up.
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:15.560]  This isn't somebody mentally ill.
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  This isn't somebody acting.
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:18.560]  This is a damn demon.
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:22.560]  And the moment that happens to you and somebody says something
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.560]  to you about something happened a month before that nobody knows
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:28.560]  and you're looking at somebody looks like a goblin and is talking
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:30.560]  and smiling and saying, we're going to get you.
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.560]  And they just said something nobody knows.
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:35.560]  You're like, what the hell's going on here?
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:38.560]  And the leftists all know this, but they're falling.
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:40.560]  They know this is all real.
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:42.560]  And that's where they're all, there's no God.
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:43.560]  There's nothing.
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:44.560]  It's all science.
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.560]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  I'll just go away.
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:51.560]  You know, cause they only get let off the leash when they're
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:55.560]  brainwashing a kid, dumbing a kid down, ruling their innocence.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:56.560]  That's kind of the low level.
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:59.560]  Then it's corrupt your child.
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:01.560]  Have sex with your child.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:03.560]  Abuse your child.
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:05.560]  Kill your child.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:12.560]  And they only, I've talked to top psychiatrists that treated
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:14.560]  Dahmer, all of them.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  I forget, she's a famous lady.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:17.560]  She's on history.
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:18.560]  She's on her channel.
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:19.560]  Heard her on coast to coast.
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:20.560]  We got a, she's been on the show.
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:21.560]  What's her name?
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:23.560]  She's the doctor to psychopaths.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:28.560]  And I said, you know, I saw it in the movie, the remake of a
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:32.560]  Manchurian candidate with Denzel Washington, where he's not even
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:35.560]  alive until they give him the code words and everything's blazing
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:36.560]  white and he's alive.
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:39.560]  And he feels great when he's carrying out the operations.
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:44.560]  And I said, I've talked to people and I've experienced it when I
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.560]  was a little bit younger and almost went that direction.
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:50.560]  I should be honest with folks that it's like everything's white
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.560]  hot, everything's slow motion.
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.560]  And all there is is just evil.
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:00.560]  And I never was fully turned over to it, but just little glimpses
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:02.560]  of like, you could have this.
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:04.560]  And it's, and that's what they are.
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:07.560]  Psychopaths are like zombies that have nothing and are totally
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:09.560]  depressed and tortured and unhappy.
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:10.560]  It's not like they don't have feelings.
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.560]  That's all a lie.
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:15.560]  Inside of their world, they are tortured.
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:18.560]  And only when they've got a kid in a basement, torture them and
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  they're begging for mommy, do they even feel good.
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:22.560]  Then they feel really good.
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:23.560]  It's a drug.
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  But other than that, they don't feel bad.
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  So see these writers and reporters and people, they don't even
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.560]  feel good till they're doing bad.
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:35.560]  And those are the deep secrets right there.
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:39.560]  It sounds really hardcore, but it's basically criminology.
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:43.560]  And it's the truth.
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.560]  That's why so many good men go to war when things are seduced by
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:48.560]  the dark side.
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:51:14.560]  We'll be back.
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:20.560]  Your family deserves the best.

[02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:54.560]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:57.560]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:52:59.560]  may not be fully detected by you.
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:01.560]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:04.560]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:07.560]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:09.560]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:12.560]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:15.560]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:17.560]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.560]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.560]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:23.560]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:26.560]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:31.560]  should be using this product as a preventative
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:34.560]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.560]  I'm almost ashamed to come before you and say fund us.
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:03.560]  But if you only turn loose the power you have financially,
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:05.560]  my job would be a lot easier.
[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:08.560]  And I'm not complaining, you've already done so much.
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:11.560]  We sell the vests to supplements.
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.560]  They're just things that everybody's efficient in, most folks.
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:17.560]  Real, pure eye and eye, your body can absorb.
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.560]  X2.
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.560]  I set the sale in yesterday.
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:23.560]  I've got it right after this broadcast ends.
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:25.560]  And who's taking over? Owen Shroyer.
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:27.560]  And that's going to be Mike Cernovich Friday.
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:29.560]  Roger Stone's tomorrow.
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:32.560]  He's on a plane today out to LA on some important work.
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  But tomorrow we'll have some new specials.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:38.560]  They'll be some great specials on what the specials are.
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:41.560]  We always have great specials, but it won't be as expansive.
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  Because this is two months of specials combined.
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:47.560]  And I said it would go to the end of the month, but seven days left.
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:50.560]  I have to stop it because four things have sold out,
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:54.560]  two are about to, and some of these things I'm not getting for months.
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:59.560]  We just got word on one of the batches that's done past California standards
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:01.560]  of DNA force.
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:04.560]  So we have to send the lot back and then wait months until it comes in
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:06.560]  to pass California standards that nobody else does.
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:10.560]  But I wanted to burn butts feeding everybody when they finally tested it.
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:13.560]  So we do California standards, hence the problem.
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:14.560]  I mean, it's all a scam.
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:23.560]  Lawyers wrote the law, Prop 65, so that there's more lead in the air than there is in the products.
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:26.560]  But you can get stuff from sources if you really try.
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:28.560]  That is basically completely clean.
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:29.560]  So that's what they said.
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:32.560]  Okay, there's nothing bad in it.
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:35.560]  Excuse me, but it's overpriced.
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:40.560]  And then of course we were selling the same stuff they were promoting for 35 for 1776.
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:41.560]  That's all going to end today.
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:42.560]  It's got to end.
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.560]  I'm leaving in 10 minutes to walk 50 yards into another meeting room
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  and I'm going to look at everything and try to come up with a new stuff.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.560]  Kind of cheap, a cheap cook and bottle washer around here.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:01.560]  I didn't get to a handful of these clips that everybody did a great job.
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:02.560]  Everybody did a great job.
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.560]  But I'm telling Owen Schreuer, don't be like me.
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.560]  Come on, play the 15 clips we've got.
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:10.560]  Comment on them.
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:11.560]  Talk about them.
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:12.560]  Get them all in.
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:17.560]  Because I want to take more calls and I want to play the clips.
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:20.560]  I have them get all these great clips that are so important and then I don't get to them.
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:23.560]  So that's all coming up in the next hour.
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:34.560]  Infowars.com has a lot of the posts at newswars.com, but just briefly here, infowarstore.com.
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:38.560]  We are doing pretty good.
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:43.560]  But my gut tells me I've got to sue some people because they're cutting everybody else off and trying to cut us off.
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:47.560]  And I put up with it and just go, I'm doing okay right now.
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:48.560]  Then I'm giving in to them.
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:50.560]  So I got to fight them.
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:53.560]  I'm not looking for a fight, but you know what, you're going to punch me upside the head.
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:54.560]  I'm going to get you.
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:56.560]  But I'm not going to just throw a punch and do nothing.
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:00.560]  I want to get a full uppercut when your mouth's open and break your teeth off.
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:03.560]  And if you need another measure, I'll punch you right in the throat.
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:06.560]  And if that doesn't do it, I'll stomp you on the head politically.
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:08.560]  And we've kind of done all that happen.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:11.560]  We've been, we're beating the hell out of them.
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:17.560]  But they're coming back at us and the knives, they shove into me actually feel good.
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:18.560]  I'll be honest.
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:23.560]  I'll make sure my heart keeps pumping all the way until I've squeezed the life out of their little chicken neck.
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:25.560]  Then I can roll over and die.
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:27.560]  But we're going to beat these people.
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:34.560]  And as long as you financially support us, as long as you realize that they're trying to block us or articles or videos constantly,
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.560]  and that the act of you getting those out is victory over this trash.
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.560]  And that we're not just doing it in vain.
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:48.560]  That is so wonderful.
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:51.560]  We've won the marketplace of ideas.
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:57.560]  And that's why the globalists are coming after us is because we didn't take the deal.
[02:57:57.560 --> 02:58:05.560]  We didn't get our knees, the devil could unzip his pants and do what he does.
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:07.560]  And the devil didn't just want to destroy everybody.
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:09.560]  I wouldn't fight so hard.
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:13.560]  But there's no giving in to something like this.
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:15.560]  There's no quarter.
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:18.560]  And it's not like you just give in, the devil kills you and it goes away.
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:19.560]  He gets you forever.
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:26.560]  So if you don't want to be in that old farmhouse down in that basement with the devil pulling your teeth out forever,
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:29.560]  I suggest you do everything you can to beat these folks.
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:31.560]  And if not for yourself and the children.
[02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:34.560]  Fourth hour straight ahead, I've got a few clips I'm going to play.
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:36.560]  And then Owen Schreuer is coming in.
[02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:43.560]  In FullWars.com, spread the link.
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:10.560]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:13.560]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:14.560]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:17.560]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:18.560]  You have the neem in there.
[02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:21.560]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:24.560]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:25.560]  All right.
[02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:28.560]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:29.560]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:31.560]  Living Defense in FullWars.com.
[02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:34.560]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:38.560]  And you support the broadcast in fullwarslives.com.
[02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.560]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:40.560 --> 03:00:05.560]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:18.560]  The Trump saying he's looked at NAFTA.
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:24.560]  It's a one-sided rape job by a bunch of bipartisan scum.
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:25.560]  What a beautiful statement.
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:27.560]  Here's that clip.
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:32.560]  One of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into.
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:41.560]  We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA.
[03:00:41.560 --> 03:00:43.560]  Well, the folks that sold us out are pissed.
[03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:47.560]  And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time.
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:51.560]  And I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.
[03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:52.560]  You have to see this.
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:53.560]  We have to give notice.
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:56.560]  And after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time.
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:57.560]  Then you have to give another.
[03:00:57.560 --> 03:00:58.560]  Then you have to wait a long time.
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:01.560]  Anyway, we started two days ago.
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:03.560]  Bob Lighthizer.
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:09.560]  Personally, I don't think we can make a deal because we have been so badly taken advantage of.
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:14.560]  They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular Mexico,
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:16.560]  that I don't think we can make a deal.
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:20.560]  So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point.
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:22.560]  Okay, probably.
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:30.560]  But I told you from the first day we will renegotiate NAFTA or we will terminate NAFTA.
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.560]  I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination,
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:36.560]  but we're going to see what happens, okay?
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:42.560]  You're in good hands, I can tell you.
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:44.560]  See, globalists get off on lying.
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:46.560]  Trump gets off and telling the truth.
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:48.560]  See, there's not just committed liars.
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:52.560]  There's committed truth tellers.
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:55.560]  That's what this is all about.
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:56.560]  Let's go ahead and do another clip.
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:00.560]  Trump, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:02.560]  Here it is.
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:04.560]  Build that wall.
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:08.560]  Now, the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me,
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:10.560]  we have to close down our government.
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:12.560]  We're building that wall.
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:14.560]  Let me be very clear.
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:16.560]  And it's just a symbol.
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.560]  Mexico's got a wall, too.
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:20.560]  Let's go ahead.
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:22.560]  This is an important clip.
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:24.560]  Democrats have a vision of total socialism.
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:26.560]  That's probably the most important club here it is.
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:30.560]  All of the Democrats in Congress,
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:32.560]  that's the only thing they do well.
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:34.560]  They do one thing well. You know what it's called?
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:36.560]  They have no ideas. They have no policies.
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:38.560]  They obstruct.
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:40.560]  That's all they do.
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.560]  Their word is we resist.
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.560]  They don't resist.
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:46.560]  It's all they're good at.
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:50.560]  It's all they're good at. That's all they do on healthcare.
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:52.560]  They have 48 Democrats.
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:54.560]  We've got no votes.
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:56.560]  We've got no votes.
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:58.560]  And it would have been great healthcare.
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:00.560]  And by the way,
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:02.560]  healthcare for Arizona would have been great.
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:04.560]  So the Democrats have no ideas,
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:06.560]  no policy,
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:08.560]  no vision for the country,
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:10.560]  other than total socialism,
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.560]  and maybe
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:14.560]  on socialism from what I'm seeing.
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:16.560]  Let's stop that.
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:18.560]  That's a muddy clip for tomorrow.
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:20.560]  Everybody's great, by the way.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:22.560]  We've got one from WhiteHouse.gov.
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:24.560]  That is really the rest.
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.560]  I was watching that for an hour and 15 minutes last night.
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:28.560]  Just his speech.
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:30.560]  It was so truthful.
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:32.560]  It made me sick that he did this Afghanistan thing,
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:34.560]  which
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:36.560]  is not his creation,
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:38.560]  but he's making it his problem.
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:40.560]  And a lot of folks think it's really dumb,
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:42.560]  but
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:44.560]  I guess we're going to see if Mattis and all of them are right.
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:46.560]  A lot of folks tell me the word is
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:48.560]  this is actually a build up to pull out.
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:50.560]  And if that's the case,
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:52.560]  then he's better than I thought he was.
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  But he's not Hillary out to get us.
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:56.560]  And it's not a lesser or two evils.
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:58.560]  I've got 70, 80 people working here.
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:00.560]  And they're great people.
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:02.560]  But just communications and problems and breakdowns,
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:04.560]  it's a headache.
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:06.560]  I couldn't imagine 4,000 executive branch,
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:08.560]  millions of people
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:10.560]  in the government.
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:12.560]  Most of them moles put in by Obama blocking him.
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:14.560]  I mean,
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:16.560]  it's like watching some guy trying to push a
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:18.560]  guy that doesn't even have wheels
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.560]  up a mountainside.
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:22.560]  You're going, hey, you know, do a little bit of better job doing it.
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:24.560]  You just stumbled there.
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:26.560]  And it's just like, all I'm saying is
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:28.560]  is my gut says Trump's good.
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:30.560]  Man, the older I've gotten,
[03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:32.560]  even though my brain's not as good as the USP,
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:34.560]  I still have a photographic memory.
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:36.560]  I learned one thing, my gut's always right.
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.560]  And my gut just loves Donald John Trump.
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:40.560]  We'll be back with Alan Shroyer.
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:42.560]  More clips, your phone calls.

[03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:15.560]  100 humans from a burning building
[03:08:15.560 --> 03:08:17.560]  and CNN would come out and
[03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:19.560]  criticize him if a cat
[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:21.560]  had a
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:23.560]  hair on his tail singed.
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:25.560]  So he comes out, he has an amazing rally last night
[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:27.560]  and then all of the attack dogs in the media
[03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:29.560]  come out. They spin his words, they twist
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:31.560]  his words. Actually, they don't even play his words.
[03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:33.560]  They just lie and make things up.
[03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:35.560]  We've got a few more clips from the Trump rally.
[03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:37.560]  He calls out Antifa
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:39.560]  by name
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:41.560]  last night and then they get violent
[03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:43.560]  in the streets. Here's President Trump
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:45.560]  naming Antifa.
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:47.560]  How did he get in here?
[03:08:47.560 --> 03:08:49.560]  He's supposed to be with a few people outside.
[03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:51.560]  How about
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:53.560]  how about all week they're talking
[03:08:53.560 --> 03:08:55.560]  about the massive crowds
[03:08:55.560 --> 03:08:57.560]  that are going to be outside? Where are they?
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:08:59.560]  Well, it's hot out.
[03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:01.560]  It is hot.
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:03.560]  I think it's too warm.
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:05.560]  You know, they show up
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:07.560]  in the helmets and the black
[03:09:07.560 --> 03:09:09.560]  masks and they've got
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:11.560]  clubs and they've got everything.
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:13.560]  Antifa!
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:19.560]  That's actually kind of perfect
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:21.560]  the way he makes fun of them.
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:23.560]  They show up with their black faces
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:25.560]  covered in their clubs.
[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:27.560]  Antifa!
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:29.560]  Antifa!
[03:09:29.560 --> 03:09:31.560]  I want to do this thing. They chant
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:33.560]  anti-fascists in the street.
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:35.560]  They go, ah, auntie, auntie,
[03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:37.560]  fa, she, stuff. I want to troll and be like
[03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:39.560]  ah, auntie, auntie,
[03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:41.560]  ya, ma, ma!
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:43.560]  And they just have syrup out or something.
[03:09:43.560 --> 03:09:45.560]  We just need to start trolling these people
[03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:47.560]  because they're just basement dwelling.
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:49.560]  I don't want to be mean to these people.
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:51.560]  But Trump labels Antifa last night
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:53.560]  right before they decided
[03:09:53.560 --> 03:09:55.560]  to riot inside a riot outside the streets.
[03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:57.560]  But he also addressed real issues.
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.560]  He talked about the infrastructure.
[03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:01.560]  Maybe if we fixed our infrastructure
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:03.560]  there wouldn't be as many Antifa protesters.
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:05.560]  Here's President Trump on infrastructure.
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:07.560]  They're going to do
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:09.560]  an infrastructure bill.
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:11.560]  We will build
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:13.560]  leaving new roads, bridges,
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:15.560]  highways, railways, waterways
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:17.560]  all across our beautiful
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:19.560]  land. Our greatest creations,
[03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:21.560]  our most incredible buildings,
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:23.560]  our most beautiful works of art
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:25.560]  are just waiting
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:27.560]  to be brought to life.
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:29.560]  American hands
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:31.560]  will build this future.
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:33.560]  American energy will power
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:35.560]  this future. We have
[03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:37.560]  become an energy
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:39.560]  exporter for the first
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:41.560]  time ever
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:43.560]  just recently.
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:45.560]  And it's time to start seeing
[03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:47.560]  all the ridiculous
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:49.560]  amount that we pay in taxes
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:51.560]  actually go towards our infrastructure
[03:10:51.560 --> 03:10:53.560]  and not infrastructure
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:55.560]  in another country far far away
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:10:57.560]  that you most likely will never visit.
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:10:59.560]  So hopefully
[03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:01.560]  we start to see that. I mean that stuff that, again,
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:03.560]  will unify America even though
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:05.560]  this speech was divisive according to CNN
[03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:07.560]  and angry when he's talking about
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:09.560]  infrastructure like that. I mean, how dare he?
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:11.560]  So
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:13.560]  two of the things, though, that he can do when he gives
[03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:15.560]  these speeches and he did both of them last night.
[03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:17.560]  One, he did a linear
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:19.560]  breakdown of how he
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:21.560]  reacted to Charlottesville versus
[03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:23.560]  what the media was saying about him,
[03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:25.560]  what liars like Paul Ryan were
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:27.560]  saying about him. He breaks it down linearly
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:29.560]  and says, look, here's what I said
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:31.560]  on this time at this date, and then here's
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:33.560]  what they said I didn't say, and then they said this
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:35.560]  about me after that. So he just clearly shows
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:37.560]  their liars. Another thing he did
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:39.560]  which will help us
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:41.560]  make Congress great again in
[03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:43.560]  2018, was he identified
[03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:45.560]  some of the rhinos in Congress
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:47.560]  like John McCain,
[03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:49.560]  like Jeff Flake,
[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:51.560]  and he got quite a stir out of the crowd. Here's that clip.
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:53.560]  One vote away,
[03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:55.560]  I will not mention any names.
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:57.560]  Very presidential,
[03:11:57.560 --> 03:11:59.560]  isn't it? Very presidential.
[03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:01.560]  And nobody wants me to
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:03.560]  talk about your other senator
[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:05.560]  who's weak on borders,
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:07.560]  weak on crime, so I won't
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:09.560]  talk about him.
[03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:11.560]  You know
[03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:13.560]  McCain and Flake are just
[03:12:13.560 --> 03:12:15.560]  squirming. Nobody wants me to talk about him.
[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:17.560]  Nobody knows who the hell he is.
[03:12:17.560 --> 03:12:19.560]  Jeff Flake.
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:21.560]  And now,
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:23.560]  see, I haven't mentioned any names,
[03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:25.560]  so now
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:27.560]  everybody's happy.
[03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:29.560]  But
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:31.560]  we are going to get
[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:33.560]  rid of Obamacare. I will never
[03:12:33.560 --> 03:12:35.560]  stop. One vote!
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:37.560]  I will never stop.
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:39.560]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:41.560]  Seven years of empty promises
[03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:43.560]  from Rhino Republicans
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:45.560]  like McCain, Flake, McConnell,
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:47.560]  Ryan.
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:49.560]  These are the people. This is the swamp
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:51.560]  that we need the trashman, Trump
[03:12:51.560 --> 03:12:53.560]  to drain.
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:55.560]  So we saw what happened last night. He gives a
[03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:57.560]  terrifying speech, a powerful
[03:12:57.560 --> 03:12:59.560]  speech.
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:01.560]  Immediately after that, Antifa
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:03.560]  starts riding in the streets, assaulting
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:05.560]  people, assaulting police officers,
[03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:07.560]  acting
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:09.560]  like beyond petulant children.
[03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:11.560]  It's adult versions
[03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:13.560]  of petulant children. Imagine a petulant child
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:15.560]  throwing a temper tantrum and then add
[03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:17.560]  give or take 20 years to that.
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:19.560]  And this is the people that you have in the streets
[03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:21.560]  protesting Trump.
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:23.560]  But it's not just them.
[03:13:23.560 --> 03:13:25.560]  I noticed that the U.N.
[03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:27.560]  is now coming hard after
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:29.560]  Trump today.
[03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:31.560]  And I first noticed it with this story
[03:13:31.560 --> 03:13:33.560]  from the New York Times.
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:35.560]  U.N. panel condemns Trump's response
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:37.560]  to Charlottesville violence.
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:39.560]  So they're not dropping this.
[03:13:39.560 --> 03:13:41.560]  They're going to keep bringing this up
[03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:43.560]  even though he's disavowed the whole thing.
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:45.560]  And we were
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:47.560]  you know,
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:49.560]  I thought we were moving on, right?
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:51.560]  I mean, we forgot about the whole Russia thing.
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:53.560]  No, they want to hold on to this.
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:55.560]  This is their baby.
[03:13:55.560 --> 03:13:57.560]  They're nurturing this
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:13:59.560]  and they're going to turn it into removing
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:01.560]  all these statues, all these
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:03.560]  monuments, removing history,
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:05.560]  bringing back Nazis, bringing back
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:07.560]  all of this, the KKK
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:09.560]  to pretend like this is a threat to make you think that
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:11.560]  Nazis and the KKK
[03:14:11.560 --> 03:14:13.560]  is what you really need to be threatened with.
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:15.560]  The alt-right.
[03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:17.560]  So the U.N. panel condemns Trump's response
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:19.560]  to Charlottesville violence
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:21.560]  even though he
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:23.560]  you know, we know what they're trying to do here
[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:25.560]  but here's the story from the New York Times.
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:27.560]  President Trump's seesawing response
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:29.560]  seesawing
[03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:31.560]  to the deadly racial violence in Charlottesville
[03:14:31.560 --> 03:14:33.560]  racial violence
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:35.560]  racial violence
[03:14:35.560 --> 03:14:37.560]  a white man
[03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:39.560]  is said to have ran over
[03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:41.560]  a white woman.
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:43.560]  So what's the racial violence there?
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:45.560]  President Trump's seesawing response
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:47.560]  he seesawing
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:49.560]  the deadly racial violence, we're all racist
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:51.560]  it's race violence everywhere
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:53.560]  that the mainstream media, the New York Times, the Washington Post
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:55.560]  the CNNs, the MSNBCs
[03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:57.560]  they're the ones pushing this
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:14:59.560]  but see, they're saying now
[03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:01.560]  that it's Trump's response that's been
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:03.560]  rebuked by countless politicians
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:05.560]  business executives, community groups
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:07.560]  and religious leaders. So
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:09.560]  here's Trump
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:11.560]  being forced to disavow all of this
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:13.560]  and again, you have to continue to
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:15.560]  reiterate this. Everything that Trump
[03:15:15.560 --> 03:15:17.560]  is being forced to disavow is
[03:15:17.560 --> 03:15:19.560]  a product of the left.
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:21.560]  Nazis, a socialist party
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:23.560]  the KKK
[03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:25.560]  a democrat invention, the alt-right
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:27.560]  coined by Hillary Clinton
[03:15:27.560 --> 03:15:29.560]  ran with by Richard Spencer
[03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:31.560]  to which everybody
[03:15:31.560 --> 03:15:33.560]  is disavowing now. So
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:35.560]  he has to disavow these things created
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:37.560]  by the left. It's the most unbelievable
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:39.560]  thing ever.
[03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:41.560]  It goes on, now the United Nations
[03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:43.560]  has weighed in too, a body
[03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:45.560]  of United Nations experts on Wednesday
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:47.560]  announced the
[03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:49.560]  failure at the highest political level
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:51.560]  of the United States of America
[03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:53.560]  to unequivocally reject
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:55.560]  and condemn racist violence
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:15:57.560]  and I quote
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:15:59.560]  they are at the UN
[03:15:59.560 --> 03:16:01.560]  deeply concerned by the example
[03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:03.560]  this failure could set for the rest of the world
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:05.560]  so that's nice
[03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:07.560]  the UN now
[03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:09.560]  completely ignores
[03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:11.560]  reality.
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:13.560]  Just, he's never disavowed
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:15.560]  he's never denounced
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:17.560]  look at all the racial
[03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:19.560]  violence that Trump has caused
[03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:21.560]  not CNN, not Van Jones
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:23.560]  not Rachel Madcow
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:25.560]  no no no, not MSNBC, not them
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:27.560]  it was all Trump, not Obama
[03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:29.560]  not demonizing the police
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:31.560]  not the Chuck Schumer's
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:33.560]  it's all Trump's fault
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:35.560]  not the New York Times, not the UN
[03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:37.560]  lying about Trump
[03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:39.560]  and then in this
[03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:41.560]  story they even have to admit
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:43.560]  this is the most incredible thing about it
[03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:45.560]  in the story they even say Trump singled out
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:47.560]  the Klu Klux Klan, neo-Nazis
[03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:49.560]  and white supremacists for condemnation
[03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:51.560]  so they write the whole premise
[03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:53.560]  the entire premise
[03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:55.560]  of this article is that
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:57.560]  he never condemned the Klu Klux Klan
[03:16:57.560 --> 03:16:59.560]  he never condemned the neo-Nazis
[03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:01.560]  he never condemned the white supremacists
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:03.560]  that's the entire premise of this story
[03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:05.560]  that's why the UN panel
[03:17:05.560 --> 03:17:07.560]  is condemning Trump's response to Charlottesville violence
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:09.560]  because the premises
[03:17:09.560 --> 03:17:11.560]  he never condemned the Klu Klux Klan
[03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:13.560]  even though in the exact story
[03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:15.560]  they have to admit he did
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:19.560]  wow folks
[03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:21.560]  the United Nations Committee on the Elimination
[03:17:21.560 --> 03:17:23.560]  of Racial Discrimination invoked
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:25.560]  early action and urgent warning procedures
[03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:27.560]  in deploying the violence
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:29.560]  and urging the United States to investigate
[03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:31.560]  well Trump's administration is investigating
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:33.560]  they don't mention that
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:35.560]  the urgent warning procedure allows the committee
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:37.560]  to draw attention to situations that could quote
[03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:39.560]  spiral into terrible events
[03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:41.560]  and require immediate action
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:43.560]  I'll go on here
[03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:45.560]  the committee called the Charlottesville violence
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:47.560]  horrifying and said it was alarmed by the racial demonstrations
[03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:49.560]  with overtly racist slogans
[03:17:49.560 --> 03:17:51.560]  chants and salutes by individuals belonging
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:53.560]  to groups of white nationalist neo-Nazis
[03:17:53.560 --> 03:17:55.560]  KKK promoting white supremacy
[03:17:55.560 --> 03:17:57.560]  inciting racial discrimination and hatred
[03:17:57.560 --> 03:17:59.560]  so the mainstream media
[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:01.560]  incites all the racial discrimination
[03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:03.560]  incites all the hatred
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:05.560]  they do all that
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:07.560]  no mention of that
[03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:09.560]  no mention of Hillary Clinton and Robert Byrd
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:11.560]  no mention of Hillary Clinton's comments
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:13.560]  about black people
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:15.560]  no mention of Bill Clinton's son
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:17.560]  who's Danny Williams who's half black
[03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:19.560]  that he completely shoved to the side
[03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:21.560]  so no mention of all that
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:23.560]  the committee cited two victims by name
[03:18:23.560 --> 03:18:25.560]  Heather Hire who we've all heard of
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:27.560]  and Deandre Harris who I hadn't
[03:18:27.560 --> 03:18:29.560]  heard of until I read this story
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:31.560]  who was savagely beaten by white supremacist
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:33.560]  zero on leftist violence
[03:18:33.560 --> 03:18:35.560]  what happened at UC Berkeley
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:37.560]  what happened at the Trump event in Chicago
[03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:39.560]  what's happened to all these Trump supporters
[03:18:39.560 --> 03:18:41.560]  that get beer bottles smashed in their face
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:43.560]  and have to have surgery
[03:18:43.560 --> 03:18:45.560]  what about them
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:47.560]  what happened to the GOP committeemen
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:49.560]  who got shot by his neighbor
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:51.560]  his anti-Trump hating neighbor
[03:18:51.560 --> 03:18:53.560]  who had anti-Trump signs in his yard
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:55.560]  then goes out and shoots his neighbor
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:57.560]  what happened to Steve Scalise
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:59.560]  nothing none of that
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:01.560]  all of it's Trump's fault
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:03.560]  even though they have to admit in their own story
[03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:05.560]  he denounced everything they're saying he didn't denounce
[03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:07.560]  so then zero hedge picks it up
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:09.560]  and they put a new angle on this
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:11.560]  that needs to be looked at
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:13.560]  United Nations issues rare early warning signals
[03:19:13.560 --> 03:19:15.560]  potential civil war conflict in America
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:17.560]  a United Nations committee tasked with combating racism
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:19.560]  on a global scale has issued
[03:19:19.560 --> 03:19:21.560]  an ultra rare early warning for the United States
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:23.560]  at stockboardasset.com
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:25.560]  notes this rare signal often
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.560]  preludes the potential for civil conflict
[03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:29.560]  we've seen it in
[03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:31.560]  Burundi, Iraq, Ivory Coast
[03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:33.560]  and so on Nigeria
[03:19:33.560 --> 03:19:35.560]  so is the UN ready to come in
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:37.560]  is that what they're saying
[03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:39.560]  they're going to declare civil war and then the UN
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:41.560]  is going to come to our streets to stop racial violence
[03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:43.560]  I didn't elect the UN
[03:19:43.560 --> 03:19:45.560]  did you
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:47.560]  if the UN wants to stop racial discrimination
[03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:49.560]  shut down CNN and MSNBC now
[03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:51.560]  heart disease is on the rise
[03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:53.560]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[03:19:53.560 --> 03:19:55.560]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[03:19:55.560 --> 03:19:57.560]  by you
[03:19:57.560 --> 03:19:59.560]  but the symptoms are there
[03:19:59.560 --> 03:20:01.560]  loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops
[03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:03.560]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:05.560]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:07.560]  that something is wrong

[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:21.560]  and last night
[03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:23.560]  we did special coverage of trumps
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:25.560]  phoenix rally
[03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:27.560]  and i was reminded afterwards
[03:24:27.560 --> 03:24:29.560]  why i made the transition
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:31.560]  from sports media into politics
[03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:33.560]  because for the first time in my life
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:35.560]  when i tuned in to cnn
[03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:37.560]  when i tuned in to msnbc
[03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:39.560]  when i tuned in to mainstream news
[03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:41.560]  to get news to figure out what was going on
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:43.560]  i've i'd never had before in my life
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:45.560]  and i felt so violated
[03:24:45.560 --> 03:24:47.560]  i felt so
[03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:49.560]  just slimy
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:51.560]  and disgusting
[03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:53.560]  watching these people spew lies
[03:24:53.560 --> 03:24:55.560]  watching these people sit up there
[03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:57.560]  knowingly lie knowingly omit facts
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:24:59.560]  knowingly spread fake
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:01.560]  information
[03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:03.560]  and it was so
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:05.560]  it felt so violating
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:07.560]  it made me so mad that i had to get out of
[03:25:07.560 --> 03:25:09.560]  sports media
[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:11.560]  and get into politics
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:13.560]  and then here we are last night
[03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:15.560]  trump gives the most unifying speech you could possibly give
[03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:17.560]  as an american president
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:19.560]  and the attack dogs
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:21.560]  the sycophants
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:23.560]  in the mainstream media come out and say it was divisive
[03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:25.560]  and it just reminded me
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:27.560]  these people are literally the scum of the earth
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:29.560]  and it's so hard for people to comprehend
[03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:31.560]  that someone would actually be
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:33.560]  that conscious of a liar
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:35.560]  that someone would consciously sit there
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:37.560]  and just be a total phony
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:39.560]  so let's go to some of the
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:41.560]  highlights from the disgusting
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:43.560]  despicable treasonous
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:45.560]  trash
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:47.560]  cnn don lemon show
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:49.560]  last night after trump's speech
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:51.560]  what do you say to that
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:53.560]  what a
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:55.560]  what a
[03:25:55.560 --> 03:25:57.560]  i'm just going to speak from the heart here
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:25:59.560]  what we have witnessed was a total eclipse
[03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:01.560]  of the facts
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:03.560]  someone who came out on stage and lied
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:05.560]  directly to the american people
[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:07.560]  who wrote that for you donny boy
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:09.560]  he didn't write that
[03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:11.560]  don lemon is a twit
[03:26:11.560 --> 03:26:13.560]  charlottesville
[03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:15.560]  he's unhinged
[03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:17.560]  it's embarrassing
[03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:19.560]  i don't mean for us the media because he went after us before
[03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:21.560]  you're an embarrassment you know you're an embarrassment
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:23.560]  this is who we elected president of the united states
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:25.560]  you didn't elect him
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:27.560]  you're an american trash
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:29.560]  we deemed to be his
[03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.560]  enemy like an imaginary friend of a six year old
[03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:33.560]  you no you're real
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:35.560]  you're still on tv somehow
[03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:37.560]  we're all facts but you're still real
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:39.560]  wisdom there was no gravitas
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:41.560]  there was no sanity there
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:43.560]  no sanity
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:45.560]  on something else
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:47.560]  he did it
[03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:49.560]  i didn't do it
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:51.560]  oh but when obama was president
[03:26:51.560 --> 03:26:53.560]  it was all bush's fault
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:55.560]  let's not forget about that
[03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:57.560]  the people who are abandoning him
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:26:59.560]  in droves meaning those business people
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:01.560]  and the people in washington now
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:03.560]  who are questioning his fitness
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:05.560]  literally all lies
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:07.560]  and whether he is
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:09.560]  stable
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:11.560]  a man backed into a corner
[03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:13.560]  this is the unstable unhinged america right here
[03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:15.560]  and beyond his understanding
[03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:17.560]  a rat
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:19.560]  that they put a suit and tie on
[03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:21.560]  that's the truth a human rat
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:23.560]  you watch that speech as an american
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:25.560]  we're gonna be thinking what in the world is going on
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:27.560]  what in the world is going on
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:29.560]  this is the first thing we elected as president
[03:27:29.560 --> 03:27:31.560]  these people are a joke
[03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:33.560]  this petty this small
[03:27:33.560 --> 03:27:35.560]  the person who's supposed to pull the country together
[03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:39.560]  certainly didn't happen there
[03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:41.560]  it's stunning
[03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:43.560]  it's honestly stunning
[03:27:43.560 --> 03:27:45.560]  it's like how do you even cover this
[03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:47.560]  how can i even cover this
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:49.560]  how do i tell you that 2 plus 2
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:51.560]  actually equals 4
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:53.560]  after don levin told you 2 plus 2 equals 5
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:55.560]  how do i tell you that
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:57.560]  how do i properly get that message to you
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:27:59.560]  so let's go to another cnn panel
[03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:01.560]  goes ballistic on trump after phoenix speech
[03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:03.560]  don listen i mean
[03:28:03.560 --> 03:28:05.560]  this was a
[03:28:05.560 --> 03:28:07.560]  castro-esque speech in length
[03:28:07.560 --> 03:28:09.560]  it was
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:11.560]  an astounding chain of lies
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:13.560]  tied together by lunatic asides
[03:28:13.560 --> 03:28:15.560]  by a man who obviously
[03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:17.560]  is mentally unstable
[03:28:17.560 --> 03:28:19.560]  i'm not joking about her being a smart
[03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:21.560]  person
[03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:23.560]  this is the funniest thing
[03:28:23.560 --> 03:28:25.560]  trump literally said the fake news
[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:27.560]  gets a bunch of trump haters on the air
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:29.560]  just to confirm their bias
[03:28:29.560 --> 03:28:31.560]  and then they do it right after he says it
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:33.560]  and try to
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:35.560]  it's unbelievable
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:37.560]  and then they say there's no truth to what he said
[03:28:37.560 --> 03:28:39.560]  even though they did exactly what he said
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:41.560]  he happened to forget that the
[03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:43.560]  actual impact of the speeches he gave
[03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:45.560]  wasn't to reprimand
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:47.560]  or to chastise
[03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:49.560]  the alt-right and the nazis and the anti-semites
[03:28:49.560 --> 03:28:51.560]  but in the clans
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:53.560]  to let them all nudge each other
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:55.560]  and go hey listen he's still dog-whistling
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:57.560]  it's cool guys keep up the fight
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:28:59.560]  this is the guy who went out there tonight
[03:28:59.560 --> 03:29:01.560]  and behaved in a way
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:03.560]  he alternated between being a whiny 6 year old
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:05.560]  who's had his nintendo taken away
[03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:07.560]  that's what you sound like
[03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:09.560]  they're the whiny 6 year olds
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:11.560]  who just had their country taken from them
[03:29:11.560 --> 03:29:13.560]  because we don't want to trash it anymore
[03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:15.560]  we don't want to piss on it anymore
[03:29:15.560 --> 03:29:17.560]  they're cleaning the country
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:19.560]  pissing and crapping
[03:29:19.560 --> 03:29:21.560]  and they're dead
[03:29:21.560 --> 03:29:23.560]  and she said
[03:29:23.560 --> 03:29:25.560]  the only possible
[03:29:25.560 --> 03:29:27.560]  the only possible defensible explanation
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:29.560]  for Trump's disgusting
[03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:31.560]  unpresidential narcissistic behavior
[03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:33.560]  would be early on
[03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:35.560]  Anna Navarro
[03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:37.560]  she's not the only one who's disgusting
[03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:39.560]  some people have been saying that for months
[03:29:39.560 --> 03:29:41.560]  but listen we don't know
[03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:45.560]  we don't know
[03:29:45.560 --> 03:30:14.560]  Don't you anti-federalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
[03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:16.560]  Patrick Henry warned us
[03:30:16.560 --> 03:30:19.560]  the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[03:30:19.560 --> 03:30:23.560]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
[03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:27.560]  today everything the government does at every level is concealed from us
[03:30:27.560 --> 03:30:29.560]  we have trade deals to manage our economy
[03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:32.560]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see
[03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:34.560]  later in life Patrick Henry looked back and said
[03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:36.560]  when the American spirit was in its youth
[03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:38.560]  the language of America was different
[03:30:38.560 --> 03:30:40.560]  liberty sir was the primary object
[03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:44.560]  today our primary concern is safety and comfort
[03:30:44.560 --> 03:30:46.560]  when we should be demanding liberty

[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:40.560]  Last week, I went out to Lake Travis a couple of weeks ago.
[03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:43.560]  I ended up getting a little earache from water tubing.
[03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:45.560]  I put the Silver Bullet in my ear.
[03:54:45.560 --> 03:54:47.560]  The earache was gone the next day.
[03:54:47.560 --> 03:54:49.560]  Okay, so you can use it for an earache.
[03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:50.560]  This morning, I woke up.
[03:54:50.560 --> 03:54:51.560]  I had a little bit of a sore throat.
[03:54:51.560 --> 03:54:52.560]  My allergies had been bugging me.
[03:54:52.560 --> 03:54:54.560]  I took a little Silver Bullet, swallowed it.
[03:54:54.560 --> 03:54:55.560]  Sore throat is gone.
[03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:57.560]  I wouldn't be yelling this much if I still had the sore throat.
[03:54:57.560 --> 03:54:59.560]  I mean, Silver Bullet does everything.
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:03.560]  I get blisters on my foot a lot from playing basketball and running.
[03:55:03.560 --> 03:55:06.560]  So bad that there's literally raw flesh.
[03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:08.560]  And I get a thing of silver.
[03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:11.560]  I dip my foot in it, and it literally heals it the next day.
[03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:12.560]  So Silver Bullet can do everything.

[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:12.560]  You know, I'm trying to figure out what we can do as a country
[03:56:12.560 --> 03:56:16.560]  to win this battle and to ensure there's a future
[03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:21.560]  for all Americans that's prosperous for the Republic.
[03:56:21.560 --> 03:56:26.560]  And the answers are obviously very hard to come by.
[03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:28.560]  They're going to be very difficult.
[03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:29.560]  It's going to be tough to even figure it out,
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:32.560]  but there's one solution, folks.
[03:56:32.560 --> 03:56:35.560]  There's one thing that is easy, it's universal,
[03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:38.560]  and everyone can do it, and it's free.
[03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:40.560]  And that is prayer.
[03:56:40.560 --> 03:56:42.560]  And even if you're not a religious person,
[03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:44.560]  even if you don't believe in God,
[03:56:44.560 --> 03:56:50.560]  the power of prayer goes well beyond religion, folks.
[03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:54.560]  It's the old saying, I think, therefore I am.
[03:56:54.560 --> 03:56:57.560]  If we have a nation of people,
[03:56:57.560 --> 03:56:59.560]  if every American in this country,
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:01.560]  whether they liked Trump or not,
[03:57:01.560 --> 03:57:04.560]  whether they voted Trump or Clinton or it doesn't matter,
[03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:08.560]  all Americans, no matter what differences we had,
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:11.560]  if we could all agree to pray for each other,
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:15.560]  to pray for our future, to pray for peace,
[03:57:15.560 --> 03:57:17.560]  if we were all praying for these same things,
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:20.560]  whether there's a God out there listening or not,
[03:57:20.560 --> 03:57:22.560]  that is hearing these prayers and is going to listen
[03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:24.560]  and answer them and take care of us,
[03:57:24.560 --> 03:57:26.560]  if all of us are thinking this,
[03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:29.560]  if we're all consciously thinking peace,
[03:57:29.560 --> 03:57:31.560]  prosperity, a future for this country,
[03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:34.560]  a future for my family, getting along with my neighbor,
[03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:36.560]  no matter what the race color or creed is,
[03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:37.560]  getting along with my neighbor,
[03:57:37.560 --> 03:57:39.560]  no matter what their political affiliation is,
[03:57:39.560 --> 03:57:40.560]  if we're all praying for this,
[03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:42.560]  if we're all consciously thinking this,
[03:57:42.560 --> 03:57:45.560]  it manifests itself.
[03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:48.560]  It will naturally manifest itself
[03:57:48.560 --> 03:57:52.560]  because we're all on the same page psychologically.
[03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:56.560]  We're all on the same wavelength mentally
[03:57:56.560 --> 03:57:58.560]  that we can come together and make things better.
[03:57:58.560 --> 03:58:00.560]  Again, we don't have to disagree with everything,
[03:58:00.560 --> 03:58:05.560]  but we should all be able to agree on the future of this country,
[03:58:05.560 --> 03:58:08.560]  peacefully expressing ideas,
[03:58:08.560 --> 03:58:12.560]  and if we can pray together to have these things happen.
[03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:15.560]  That's why Trump had multiple prayers before his rally last night, folks.
[03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:18.560]  He gets it. He gets the power of prayer.
[03:58:18.560 --> 03:58:21.560]  So, folks, if you want to know what you can do for this country,
[03:58:21.560 --> 03:58:22.560]  just pray.
[03:58:22.560 --> 03:58:24.560]  Pray for your family, pray for this country,
[03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:26.560]  pray for our future, pray for your family and friends.
[03:58:26.560 --> 03:58:29.560]  Thanks for tuning in. You stay classy until waters.
