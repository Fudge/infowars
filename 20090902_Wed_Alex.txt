[02:50.480 --> 02:55.400]  few months ago and the guy said oh no it's not a hit piece we just want to
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.760]  you know talk about you and the phenomenon on your show and then
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.120]  immediately I knew it was a hit piece so I knew it would be published which was
[03:02.120 --> 03:05.680]  good I can always tell when a big reporter is interviewing me and it's not a
[03:05.680 --> 03:09.200]  hit piece I tell him this is not gonna be published you know that right just
[03:09.200 --> 03:13.280]  happen with the Wall Street Journal and Sarah McBride she's called us and sent
[03:13.280 --> 03:17.800]  us emails said you were right wasn't a hit piece it wasn't really even on my
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.400]  side it was just wasn't a distortion this is a distortion and I love it this is
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.160]  really good it's it's because the enemy show in their hand it's kind of like
[03:28.160 --> 03:32.320]  when media matters came out last weekend and said that I'm a complete liar
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.680]  there is no bill for National Compulsory Service the president never said it
[03:37.680 --> 03:42.160]  Rahm Emanuel never said it I am a liar and then we can read what they said here
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.760]  on air and then play the clips I mean this is fabulous fabulous because
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.800]  they're still playing the game that Edward Bernays you know who wrote the
[03:52.800 --> 03:57.080]  book the modern book on psychology playing games manipulating lying to people
[03:57.080 --> 04:00.360]  for the ruling class using it a weaponized psychology against the
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.720]  people and he bragged how they had feminists go out and smoke cigarettes in
[04:04.720 --> 04:09.000]  front of newspaper photographers in the twenties and thirties to get women to
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.640]  smoke and they he brags how they helped to break up the family I mean he wrote
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.440]  books about it so that we can have a big mega state and he brags about how
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.400]  psychologists uses a weapon against the people it's real funny to them but see
[04:23.400 --> 04:32.080]  this isn't 1930 or 1950 or 1960 people now know about your crap and so this is
[04:32.080 --> 04:36.320]  a I've never seen such a distortion I was on man Cal Muller's radio show this
[04:36.320 --> 04:40.200]  morning and he was bringing up the article I hadn't read it so I ran into
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.120]  the office of scanned over and we're gonna read it live on air not because
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.480]  it's about me we don't read most the articles that talk about myself we're
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.720]  gonna read it because it goes into the mind of this priest class who are
[04:53.720 --> 04:57.280]  desperate to keep people in their controlled false paradigm and say it's
[04:57.280 --> 05:02.160]  mental illness to question tyranny hello this is Alex Jones with some

[06:28.440 --> 06:34.440]  seven years after the attacks of September 11th a global awakening has taken place
[06:34.440 --> 06:38.440]  an inside job how dare you

[07:37.440 --> 07:43.440]  they've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement

[08:27.440 --> 08:42.440]  it's good to have national television psychology today
[08:42.440 --> 08:49.440]  the George Soros army of establishment foundation funded websites
[08:49.440 --> 08:51.440]  it's good to have them attacking me
[08:51.440 --> 08:59.440]  Paul Watson is writing I guess he's already read it and is already on it is writing a debunking of the psychology today piece
[08:59.440 --> 09:11.440]  this magazine is sent out to millions of psychologist psychiatrist healthcare workers
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.440]  and we saw in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany that is history that they use psychiatry as a tool of oppression
[09:17.440 --> 09:23.440]  and it's also been used here they would say you were mentally ill and take you and sterilize you under eugenics laws
[09:23.440 --> 09:26.440]  and I would on the phone with the psychology today guy
[09:26.440 --> 09:34.440]  I would attempt to say okay I'm on a computer I just googled this I want you to search engine this
[09:34.440 --> 09:41.440]  and he said I don't know about psychology being used in Nazi Germany or Russia to oppress or communist China today
[09:41.440 --> 09:49.440]  I don't know about the famous doctors that would do public ice pickings where they would jab an ice pickin under somebody's eye
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.440]  and stab it a couple times into the brain
[09:53.440 --> 10:01.440]  and I pulled up mainstream news about it who invented lobotomies and he just said it's not true
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.440]  and I would say well here's an article calling for world government the financial times of London
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.440]  here's one in Newsweek and it says he would just get quiet and say so you believe there's a world government
[10:13.440 --> 10:19.440]  you believe they're out to get you and I said no sir this is a world empire set up by private corporations
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.440]  and he just didn't care and they have scores of new psychological designations
[10:25.440 --> 10:31.440]  I know Watson's listening right now Watson you might show a few examples of those
[10:31.440 --> 10:37.440]  where they're saying if you think there's a corrupt government you think there's a tyranny you're mentally ill
[10:37.440 --> 10:48.440]  and so I'm going to go over this today and then the Associated Press Reuters
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.440]  we're going to go over these coming up are all reporting that they are going to have mass quarantines
[10:55.440 --> 11:03.440]  lockdowns of cities forced inoculations police quarantining people in their homes
[11:03.440 --> 11:09.440]  and what's going to happen is this is how the psychology works if we're able to back them off from doing this
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.440]  because they're openly announcing on CNN, Fox, we've played the clips here
[11:13.440 --> 11:20.440]  they will go on the news and they will say there was a hoax put out by the anti-vaccine people that all this was going to happen
[11:20.440 --> 11:36.440]  but it didn't happen and then people are further conditioned to just accept all of this
[11:36.440 --> 11:42.440]  so it is the establishment on record in fact here's world net daily here's just the top of the stack on this
[11:42.440 --> 11:54.440]  Trump's jump on swine flu power shots heard around the world pandemic bill allows health authorities in their homes to tame without warrant
[11:54.440 --> 12:02.440]  now they just passed a bill on the state legislature of Texas to set up checkpoints and take blood without a warrant
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.440]  now see first four years ago the Fed started paying states they do it right here where I live in Austin
[12:08.440 --> 12:17.440]  they take blood with rubber stamp warrants it's just a fake rubber stamp general warrant they have these RVs out there on the side of the highway at night
[12:17.440 --> 12:28.440]  generally at night they take your blood now that's federal I first saw this in Arizona and Colorado in 1999
[12:28.440 --> 12:34.440]  and I would read these articles on air out of the Denver Post out of the Tucson star and people didn't believe it
[12:34.440 --> 12:40.440]  before most people weren't on the internet yet or didn't know how to search things or go look at them so I'd be on the air reading this
[12:40.440 --> 12:47.440]  and my listeners would call in and say we don't believe you well now you can just Google police to take blood without warrant
[12:47.440 --> 12:57.440]  and you'll watch KVUE Austin all the major Texas stations are announcing it it's all over the country I played one last week
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.440]  it's kind of like I tell people 12 years ago they're taking blood at birth from every baby under international law and putting it in a
[13:04.440 --> 13:15.440]  UN human genome database for bio weapons production and other things that whole national geographic genome project with the
[13:15.440 --> 13:23.440]  Cold Springs Harbor eugenics lab and IBM is the real reason is to develop a race specific bio weapons we have the evidence of that
[13:23.440 --> 13:31.440]  I mean this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.440]  and I'm going to try to deal with the stress of all of this I'm going to try to deal with the incredible pressure of being the
[13:37.440 --> 13:45.440]  main focal point of resistance this because I never said I was up to the challenge and
[13:45.440 --> 13:50.440]  but I'm just going to have to be and all of us are going to have to work with what God gave us
[13:50.440 --> 14:01.440]  but all of us each and every one of you have to be leaders in this fight and have to get out and speak out and be bold because
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.440]  tyranny is just coming in like a flood on us
[14:05.440 --> 14:12.440]  when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it
[14:12.440 --> 14:20.440]  a pandemic response bill currently making its way through the Massachusetts state legislature would allow authorities to forcibly
[14:20.440 --> 14:26.440]  quarantine citizens in the event of a health emergency compelled health workers to vaccine citizens authorized forceful entry into
[14:26.440 --> 14:32.440]  private hunt dwellings and the destruction of citizens property and impose fines on citizens for non-compliance
[14:32.440 --> 14:39.440]  if citizens refuse to comply with isolation and quarantine orders in the event of a health emergency they may be in prison for 30 days
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.440]  or fine $1,000 per day but the violation continues now
[14:44.440 --> 14:52.440]  I mean I'm glad we're all that daily wrote this story but this is nothing I mean this is only the states trying to comply with the
[14:52.440 --> 15:04.440]  executive order signed by Bush continued by Obama that we've covered here
[15:04.440 --> 15:13.440]  this is United Nations level six pandemic international agreements
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.440]  so everybody keeps questioning will there be quarantines will there be forced roundups will there be forced inoculations
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.440]  that depends on how many people die from this flu and how much the media hypes it
[15:23.440 --> 15:31.440]  if 36 and a half thousand people die that's what I every year just under 37,000 from the regular flu
[15:31.440 --> 15:36.440]  and they're acting like it's the end of the world with a couple hundred dead in the U.S.
[15:36.440 --> 15:42.440]  I don't know they're announcing it's 500 and they've got news reports about quarantines already all over the U.S.
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.440]  and they do it in areas where the government's in control one person gets sick shut down the school
[15:47.440 --> 15:52.440]  lock kids up in the college dormitories if one person has it
[15:52.440 --> 15:55.440]  oh you look sick on an airplane we're going to drag you off and lock you up
[15:55.440 --> 16:14.440]  it's all just beta testing to train you to accept all this
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.440]  all of this is going on all of this is happening and then meanwhile
[16:19.440 --> 16:29.440]  psychology today is writing giant hit pieces on me
[16:29.440 --> 16:36.440]  and when poplowski kills three cops because his mother he throws a fit and his mother's trying to throw him out with his pit bulls
[16:36.440 --> 16:41.440]  urinating all over the floor within two hours of them being arrested
[16:41.440 --> 16:47.440]  they go into his thousands of internet visits and they they say he killed him because of me
[16:47.440 --> 16:50.440]  and then it turns out the guy was actually attacking me all over the internet
[16:50.440 --> 16:56.440]  why is the southern prairie law center thinking about me the first thing in their mind is me
[16:56.440 --> 17:01.440]  well because we write articles and expose and post the government documents where they were involved with McVeigh
[17:01.440 --> 17:07.440]  if anything happens to me you need to look into the southern prairie law center
[17:07.440 --> 17:13.440]  what a Morris D's and we've had an article up there today about this is quote to the media when they asked him
[17:13.440 --> 17:18.440]  well why are why did you have informants running only in city why are you in these FBI documents with McVeigh
[17:18.440 --> 17:26.440]  and he told the media and he said if you knew I'd have to kill you and he wasn't joking
[17:26.440 --> 17:33.440]  why is the George Soros operation going after me now
[17:33.440 --> 17:36.440]  just I need your prayers ladies and gentlemen I'll just tell you that right now
[17:36.440 --> 17:41.440]  because they know that we know exactly what they're doing
[17:41.440 --> 17:54.440]  now psychology today is basically a drug ad for Prozac and other psychotropic and other antipsychotic medications
[17:54.440 --> 18:00.440]  the antipsychotics of course in all of their class and you go to their website it's an ad for them
[18:00.440 --> 18:10.440]  and you go to this magazine and it's a giant ad and they got ambilify that you take for the other mental problems
[18:10.440 --> 18:29.440]  you take the ambilify for the mental problems the other chlorine fluoride based drugs cause you
[18:29.440 --> 18:34.440]  and of course they're making everyone mentally ill they're listing everybody as mentally ill
[18:34.440 --> 18:40.440]  their own internal new freedom initiatives 2005 documents associated press world net daily Reuters
[18:40.440 --> 18:46.440]  you can pull them up when their own members blew the whistle in the Ohio board meetings
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.440]  for the national rollout of the new freedom initiative they said which the president got passed
[18:52.440 --> 19:00.440]  that we've got 20% of school kids on drugs our goal is to put 50% in the next phase
[19:00.440 --> 19:07.440]  and then after that 75% they now when you when the government has foster children in their clutches
[19:07.440 --> 19:15.440]  they put 68% national average on them see we're all mentally ill we've all got to be drugged
[19:15.440 --> 19:22.440]  we've all got to be controlled by the priest class and they are going to decide what reality is
[19:22.440 --> 19:32.440]  and this this individual at psychology today he kept saying you think they're trying to kill you
[19:32.440 --> 19:38.440]  you think they want eugenics and I said what are you talking about eugenics and psychology are joined at the hip
[19:38.440 --> 19:44.440]  they came out of the same school and I would say would you like me to send you encyclopedia links
[19:44.440 --> 19:49.440]  would you like me to give you their own statements and he would just go so you you really believe this
[19:49.440 --> 20:00.440]  and I said may I give you the sources and he basically said no you see I'm insane none of this exists
[20:00.440 --> 20:05.440]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[20:05.440 --> 20:09.440]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[20:09.440 --> 20:14.440]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing
[20:14.440 --> 20:19.440]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[20:19.440 --> 20:24.440]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[20:24.440 --> 20:30.440]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[21:05.440 --> 21:09.440]  from the industrial age to the space age gold has weathered the test of time
[21:09.440 --> 21:13.440]  for 6,000 years gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth
[21:13.440 --> 21:18.440]  according to the World Gold Council in the US Mint demand is at an all-time high
[21:18.440 --> 21:22.440]  the stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative

[22:06.440 --> 22:08.440]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope
[22:08.440 --> 22:11.440]  the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up
[22:11.440 --> 22:17.440]  it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.440]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.440]  in the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom

[23:58.440 --> 24:09.440]  prisonplanet.tv
[24:10.440 --> 24:16.440]  in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s you can pull off the mainstream european newspapers
[24:16.440 --> 24:19.440]  telling their public it is a conspiracy theory
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.440]  there's no plan for a european union
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.440]  the european union does exist
[24:26.440 --> 24:30.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it exists in a big, big way.
[24:38.040 --> 24:45.400]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and read in its entirety this story out of psychology today.
[24:45.400 --> 24:58.200]  Psychology today that was dishonest at every level, at every front,
[25:00.280 --> 25:03.640]  and then they were so cheap they wanted me to supply them a photo,
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.400]  and so I supplied them a photo and I said,
[25:07.400 --> 25:24.440]  that they could use it and I guess they graphically made a mistake when they went to print with their
[25:24.440 --> 25:33.000]  computer system because it stuck my sister's name down on the side of the page at a crooked angle
[25:33.000 --> 25:41.880]  and so instead of it being underneath the photo, it's way down here at the bottom of the page at
[25:41.880 --> 25:48.920]  a crooked angle and that just shows how sloppy this is because all this is is a backdrop for
[25:49.560 --> 25:57.080]  Prozac ads. I'm going to cover some of this on prisonplanet.tv today so you can see the article.
[25:57.080 --> 26:05.720]  I mean they've got this they've got this depression drug with a woman who's a wind-up toy
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.040]  and then when she gets the drug she's happy that's the first ad.
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.200]  There's ads on almost every page
[26:16.200 --> 26:24.440]  for psychotropics
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.160]  and then there's another article in here called One World Order 9-1-1 didn't affect much
[26:36.840 --> 26:43.800]  and it says One World Order. I mean all this is when you talk to these psychologists
[26:43.800 --> 26:49.800]  because over the years I've had a few of them call and interview me. They literally think they're
[26:49.800 --> 27:00.040]  like delicate geniuses and they're up above you looking down and it's really just morons on power
[27:00.040 --> 27:07.880]  trips. That's the ones that believe their own propaganda. Still more of them are really intelligent
[27:07.880 --> 27:12.360]  smart and are making money working for the advertising agencies and government on how
[27:12.360 --> 27:18.120]  to lie and manipulate people and it's very very sad very very disgusting
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.640]  to see them getting away with things like this.
[27:27.480 --> 27:33.560]  So I'm going to go ahead and start reading this article from psychology today.
[27:33.560 --> 27:46.360]  It's a large spread on page 37 into page 38 and it says dark minds
[27:48.680 --> 27:57.080]  field guide to the conspiracy theorist. When does incredibility become paranoia by John Gartner
[27:57.080 --> 28:06.360]  and again it was just unspeakable talking to this guy. It's all distortion. It's all lies.
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.920]  He implies in here and this is how I learned of this today.
[28:11.720 --> 28:15.320]  Man Cal Muller goes hey have you seen that you're in psychology today and I said no.
[28:16.920 --> 28:20.680]  He said well we get a lot of magazines here at the radio network he's on. He said
[28:20.680 --> 28:26.520]  it says you didn't have any friends in high school that you lied about having friends.
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.040]  And I had so many friends in Rockwall and Dallas where I lived that we literally had
[28:34.040 --> 28:38.920]  to move down here just so I could finish high school. I was in high school five years three years
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.080]  and I came down here was a straight A student and kind of I did kind of keep to myself once
[28:43.080 --> 28:49.800]  I got down here. I mean I hung out with some of the guys on the football team and I hung out some
[28:49.800 --> 28:55.800]  with folks we go camping and we go lift weights. I mean I hung out with some of the jocks and I
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.760]  was already hanging out with mainly college students and it was rock climbing and jet skiing and
[29:01.800 --> 29:10.360]  just so many friends. It was just just just but I mean it's like a junior high mentality. It's
[29:10.360 --> 29:18.120]  like Alex doesn't have any friends. What do you mean I don't have any friends? It's just insane
[29:18.120 --> 29:24.920]  because he wanted the names of my friends and family. He also implies they're like I don't
[29:24.920 --> 29:30.120]  even have family because I wouldn't give him my parents phone number. My parents would never
[29:30.120 --> 29:37.960]  talk to you. My parents have never been interviewed by the media about me. So I mean that he just
[29:37.960 --> 29:43.320]  assaults who I am at the very foundation because they have to. They can't face any information I
[29:43.320 --> 29:49.400]  put out. He has to come out and accuse me of being a liar when he is a big fat stinking liar and you
[29:49.400 --> 29:57.720]  know you are. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.880 --> 30:04.120]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[30:04.120 --> 30:09.320]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[30:09.320 --> 30:14.280]  auditor they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[30:14.280 --> 30:19.080]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.600]  system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric water generator
[30:24.600 --> 30:29.880]  is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola blue 28
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.600]  produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art
[30:34.600 --> 30:40.440]  carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques. That's right,

[30:59.080 --> 31:06.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.400 --> 31:12.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us
[31:12.200 --> 31:17.800]  would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[31:17.800 --> 31:23.080]  the best interests of the American people. Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day
[31:23.080 --> 31:28.520]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[31:28.520 --> 31:35.240]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:37.400 --> 31:43.400]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works
[31:43.400 --> 31:50.520]  for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[32:59.320 --> 33:22.840]  Okay, I will now read from psychology today the priest class
[33:22.840 --> 33:31.720]  official talking points. These are the people who openly have announced they want to break
[33:31.720 --> 33:41.400]  up families in America on the PrismPlanet.com forum. We have posted links to scores, scores
[33:41.400 --> 33:46.760]  of government textbooks for psychologists and social workers saying the families of disease
[33:46.760 --> 33:56.440]  that must be eradicated. This is a group waging war against the order of the species. They believe
[33:56.440 --> 34:00.600]  in a scientific dictatorship. They believe they are remaking humanity in their eyes.
[34:01.240 --> 34:05.960]  The schools of psychology and psychiatry out of Germany and England were completely
[34:06.680 --> 34:13.320]  formed from the marble, from the granite of eugenics and Galton and the rest of them. And
[34:13.320 --> 34:20.280]  that's a fact. And Paul Watson, I want that out of the gates that this is the ruling class of
[34:20.280 --> 34:25.240]  power-tripping people. Let me tell you, people who are control freaks go to become psychologists.
[34:25.240 --> 34:28.520]  Some people because they have their own psychological problems. Some people because
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.440]  it's interesting. Some people because they want to help folks. The whole Carl Junging
[34:34.440 --> 34:43.240]  view of Carl Jung from Switzerland. I mean, there is some really powerful, important information
[34:43.240 --> 34:52.280]  there. So I'm not saying all psychologists, all psychiatrists, but it sprung from German governments
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.200]  because they had governments at that time wanting to manipulate and control populations. It was
[34:58.200 --> 35:07.720]  developed in the last 180 years when the Prussian military said, we want robotic-like soldiers,
[35:07.720 --> 35:14.280]  kindergarten, psychology, everything, the entire system we live under. And that's mainline history.
[35:19.720 --> 35:22.920]  Hitler called it mind warfare or mind weapons.
[35:22.920 --> 35:33.800]  It's called propaganda. And Edward Bernays wrote a book called Propaganda, bragging about it.
[35:33.800 --> 35:43.640]  Read it. I mean, Edward Bernays quotes are just so chilling. In fact, I should print some up.
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.120]  I mean, again, I just scanned over this before I went live on air because I'd kind of forgotten
[35:48.120 --> 35:59.080]  about the interview was done a few months ago. But another big issue here is this is just very
[35:59.080 --> 36:07.000]  shoddy journalism. We probably need to scan this for Paul Watson just to show people they couldn't
[36:07.000 --> 36:14.680]  even put my sister's name, Marley Jones. They couldn't even put that under the photo caption.
[36:14.680 --> 36:25.560]  They are so slip shot and lazy and stupid in their posing and their pretensions,
[36:25.560 --> 36:32.200]  their preening to be these great godlike experts up on Mount Olympus with their delusions of grandeur
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.760]  that they couldn't even get that right.
[36:36.760 --> 36:44.920]  You know how I beat the subpoena to go to federal court for some moron? It was making
[36:44.920 --> 36:48.520]  threats on my website in the comment section. We just found where the FBI made mistakes
[36:49.240 --> 36:53.560]  in their report and they couldn't get that right. They couldn't get anything right.
[36:55.560 --> 37:01.080]  Side issue. I just never get over how lazy people on the new world orders team are.
[37:02.440 --> 37:05.160]  I don't know that they actually, the FBI guys that came over here weren't that bad.
[37:05.160 --> 37:11.800]  I'm not trying to bash them. We make mistakes too. It's just that they make the pretension
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.120]  that they have got all their crap together. We are rag tag here. We make mistakes. We're not
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.960]  perfect. And I'm all about the fact that I'm not perfect and don't have all the answers,
[37:25.960 --> 37:33.000]  and then I'm not some messianic leader. But I had H.G.Net television here yesterday asking me if I
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.200]  thought I was basically the Messiah. When I say the complete opposite, look in the mirror for the
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.840]  solutions to this tyranny. It doesn't come from leaders. That's in this article. It's in media
[37:42.840 --> 37:50.520]  matters. The talking point is that I'm a cult leader. That's what they're going with. Thank God
[37:50.520 --> 37:56.360]  we've tried to build this operation against the new world order around ideas and a manifesto
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.240]  of liberty and freedom and renaissance. And so it's not going to work. All right, let me go ahead
[38:03.240 --> 38:10.360]  and go through the article. Field guide to conspiracy theorists, dark minds. When does
[38:12.440 --> 38:19.800]  in credibility become paranoia by John Gartner? And I want in this article, John Gartner,
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.120]  to be near the headline, because when anybody Googles John Gartner's name,
[38:24.120 --> 38:31.080]  other people he's planning to prey on with his deception, I want them to read our article. And
[38:31.080 --> 38:37.960]  Mr. Gartner, from now in time immemorial, when at the top of Google, buddy boy,
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.040]  as long as the architecture of the internet continues to operate this way with whatever gets
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.880]  the most hits is what's at the top, you are going to be exposed. So also understand, I don't do this
[38:49.880 --> 38:55.720]  eventually. I do this like putting a buoy up. If I'm out on a boat and I run over some submerged
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.720]  rocks, but there's no buoy, I'm going to go back to the Coast Guard or I'm going to go back to the
[39:00.600 --> 39:04.200]  water, you know, Lake police and I'm going to say, Hey, we need to get a buoy out there.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.800]  And they'll say, thank you, you're right, we'll go check it. And I'm just putting a buoy out,
[39:09.800 --> 39:17.080]  a warning beacon on the internet and cyberspace forever, Gartner, that you are a distorter
[39:17.080 --> 39:23.000]  and a twister and a liar and you make me sick. You really do. I mean, talking to your
[39:24.520 --> 39:29.480]  foppish self and just the preening and the arrogance in your voice and
[39:31.720 --> 39:38.760]  you really are a travesty. Here it is. Alex Jones is trying to warn us about an evil syndicate of
[39:38.760 --> 39:44.280]  bankers who control most of the world's governments and stand poised to unite the planet under the
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.840]  totalitarian regime of a new world order. Hey, let's stop right there. I mean, it's all over the
[39:48.840 --> 39:56.120]  news worldwide, more than 50 trillion stolen, 23.7 trillion in 10 months and growing at current
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.000]  rates is probably 27 trillion. We always find out two months later, the latest numbers. That's
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.480]  double the GDP in the US total over 50 trillion worldwide. They openly wrote the rules to steal
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.840]  the money with derivatives. It's all over congressional hearings. And this guy opens it up
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.320]  when they've announced a new bank of the world carbon taxes to be paid to the bank of the world,
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.520]  just like when they gave us the income tax in 1913 to be coupled up like a horse and carriage,
[40:23.720 --> 40:31.000]  like a man and woman, like white on rice with the Federal Reserve Act. I mean, and so he's
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.680]  still playing the 1950s Edward Bernays game of when they had media domination.
[40:36.680 --> 40:45.880]  Your air war only works when you've got air superiority, dumbass. You don't have air superiority.
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.720]  We get to respond to your lies, but just keep playing that 1950s model, please. That's why
[40:51.720 --> 40:57.240]  we are kicking the living daylights out of you in the info war. We're stomping your guts out
[40:57.240 --> 41:03.640]  because not only can we counter you and your lies. We work harder than you. We're not lazy like you.
[41:03.640 --> 41:08.360]  We have the truth on our side. And as the founder of the Texas Rangers said,
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.960]  somebody in the wrong cannot stand up against somebody in the right who keeps on a common.
[41:13.960 --> 41:19.400]  And we aren't going to stop. We don't listen to crap you say anymore. We just analyze how it's
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.720]  a bunch of baloney. I mean, how am I going to analyze this story? The entire thing is a fraud
[41:23.720 --> 41:29.240]  into it. Alex Jones is trying to warn us about an evil syndicate of bankers that control most of
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.280]  the world's governments and stand poise to unite the planet under their totalitarian reign, a new
[41:34.280 --> 41:45.640]  world order. Now you notice that it's all about what I believe and what I'm trying. They're openly
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.600]  in their own words in the publication, foreign affairs of CFR. They say David Rockefeller in
[41:50.600 --> 41:57.880]  his memoir says the new world order is a global government, global governance. I kept telling
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.360]  this guy, I said, there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles
[42:02.360 --> 42:07.640]  in the last few months calling for world government. And he said, oh, you're exaggerating. And I said,
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.520]  no, I'm not exaggerating, sir. We call Rob do in here. Rob do come in here because this is coming up.
[42:16.920 --> 42:25.080]  I mean, I need you to come on in here. Rob in here, I said to him, I said, listen,
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.640]  I've turned down just the last few weeks, 60, 70 interviews. And because I remember at that time,
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.720]  usually we turned down maybe 2030 a week, we had turned down just a huge amount as they come in and
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.160]  like, it's kind of like when you're out in the middle of nowhere in the countryside and there's
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.480]  a four-way stop and you don't see cars for 30 minutes and suddenly cars from all sides come.
[42:41.480 --> 42:46.360]  I mean, usually, usually what would you say we, how many interviews do we normally turn down in a
[42:46.360 --> 42:52.920]  week? Well, just this morning, I had three interview requests for you that I sent them
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.320]  them replies back saying, you know, get in touch with us at the end of September because you're
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.080]  finishing the film. And because this morning, and because we've been doing that there, it's
[43:01.080 --> 43:07.000]  cut back on them calling. Because when you say no, you get removed from the system. But
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.160]  this was about two, three months ago. Remember that huge flood? When Obama deception was out
[43:11.160 --> 43:17.400]  and hitting hard and heavy, I mean, there was, I spent most of my day either scheduling interviews
[43:17.400 --> 43:20.920]  for you or telling people we didn't have any time because there's only so much. Well, he recorded
[43:20.920 --> 43:27.480]  this and he can put the recording out. But, you know, I, what I said or meant to say was,
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.680]  I've just turned down, you know, 50, 60 interviews. I mean, I probably should have said, I just turned
[43:32.680 --> 43:37.080]  down 200. I mean, if we were talking about three, four months, but, but see, he says that's my
[43:37.080 --> 43:41.720]  delusion. Doesn't, I, I was telling him on the phone, he said, how many views has Obama deceptions
[43:41.720 --> 43:47.560]  had? And I said, well, you know, at the time I said, well, one YouTube alone has had a million
[43:47.560 --> 43:52.600]  and a half roughly. And he started laughing. And I said, well, just Google Obama deception.
[43:52.600 --> 43:56.440]  He started clicking and he said, oh yeah, I do. And he suddenly sounded shook up. It was like,
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.440]  oh, oh my God, they're listening to him. I, I'm supposed to control everything. I'm supposed to
[44:00.440 --> 44:05.160]  be the only one they listened to. You know, I mean, it's over 20 million when I quit counting.
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.000]  Right. On all these different, and they just don't understand it. Well, there's also a
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  sentence in there. It calls you a part time filmmaker. How many films have you put out?
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.560]  I, I think it's 24. Yeah. I mean, in, in let, that's more than one a year. I don't, I don't see
[44:19.560 --> 44:26.440]  how that's part time. You know, no, we produce two films a year and I'm in scores of films. I
[44:26.440 --> 44:30.760]  consult on film, I'm consulting on a major television show for TV. I'm in it. That's what
[44:30.760 --> 44:34.440]  it goes. You know, he says you're part time, a part time. I mean, I was consulted on scanner
[44:34.440 --> 44:38.520]  darkly. Right. I'm in scanner darkly when scenes with Keanu Reeves and when owner Ryder.
[44:38.520 --> 44:45.480]  But I mean, again, it's this guy about how they're in control. See Alex is little. He's nuts. He's
[44:45.480 --> 44:52.440]  a liar. So, so would you say Rob? And I, and I know you're thinking to say 50 or 60, I turned
[44:52.440 --> 44:57.880]  down. I think that's actually an understatement since definitely around that time. Now, I don't
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.880]  think it's 50 or 60. Now that we turned down, but because we're sending them to the end of
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.640]  September, but you know, we're not doing any interviews right now, except very, very selective
[45:07.640 --> 45:12.360]  people. Just cause of the time issue. You have to have time to work on the film and the interviews
[45:12.360 --> 45:18.280]  take up time. We had the camera crew here yesterday, you know, from HD net and you know,
[45:18.280 --> 45:23.240]  they were only supposed to do a 30 minute, but the thing is he creates false deception. Oh, sure.
[45:23.240 --> 45:28.120]  And, and man cow reading this thought that I've been on the couch with this guy and that's kind
[45:28.120 --> 45:34.280]  of how I was on the phone with him. I mean, this is insane. I mean, this is a total fabrication.
[45:34.280 --> 45:40.440]  Well, they used a good picture at least. They didn't even look. They put my sister's name
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.760]  down here crooked at the side. They even screwed that up in the computer formatting.
[45:46.280 --> 45:52.920]  Yeah. I mean, there's no end to these people. Okay. Well, listen, listen, I appreciate coming in
[45:52.920 --> 45:59.880]  because I better get ready or I'll never get to it. We'll go. Okay. Look, ladies and gentlemen,
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.720]  I mean, I've just never seen anything like this. I mean, this is this probably takes the cake for
[46:03.720 --> 46:10.440]  deception. Alex Jones. Okay. It goes on while we might be tempted to dismiss Jones as a nut. The
[46:10.440 --> 46:17.720]  king of conspiracy is a popular radio host, the part time filmmaker, latest movie, the Obama
[46:17.720 --> 46:23.160]  deception in which he argues that Obama is a puppet of the central bankers. You got four times the
[46:23.160 --> 46:28.120]  money that McCain got from the banks has been viewed millions of times on YouTube. So that's
[46:28.120 --> 46:34.360]  the one thing he got right. When we spoke, Jones ranted for two hours about FEMA concentration
[46:34.360 --> 46:39.640]  camps, Halliburton child kidnappers, when that was in the Chicago Tribune, government eugenics
[46:39.640 --> 46:44.840]  programs and more. When I stopped him to ask for evidence that government is practicing eugenics,
[46:44.840 --> 46:50.920]  he pointed to a national security memorandum, but I found the document to be a bland policy report.
[46:50.920 --> 46:58.680]  I mean, you know, again, all, I sent him, or I told Watson to see him and once that he did all
[46:58.680 --> 47:05.240]  these links to United Nations biological diversity assessments to Kissinger. Now you got eco science,
[47:05.240 --> 47:11.960]  all this stuff. I mean, what is he talking about? Jones cherry picks, not just facts, but phrases,
[47:11.960 --> 47:19.480]  which once interpreted his way, become facts in his mind, says Lewis Black, editor of the Austin
[47:19.480 --> 47:25.160]  Chronicle. This is a guy, Lewis Black, who's always had a obsession with me and lies and deception
[47:26.200 --> 47:35.480]  that are only rivaled by this article. And Lewis Black wrote a editorial in his own paper
[47:35.480 --> 47:43.640]  saying that Sentra is not Spanish owned. And I told mankind, I said, Sentra is Spanish owned,
[47:43.640 --> 47:47.480]  and it is taken over our roads. And mankind just said, Oh, you say so. I mean, that's how
[47:47.480 --> 47:57.320]  these people work. I mean, I mean, it is Spanish owned, you know, Jones cherry pick, not just facts,
[47:57.320 --> 48:01.400]  but phrases, which once interpreted his way, become facts in his mind, says Lewis Black,
[48:01.400 --> 48:06.520]  editor of the Austin Chronicle, who knows Jones, a fellow Austin resident. When I confronted Jones
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.480]  with my reading of the report, he became pugnacious, launching into a diatribe against
[48:11.480 --> 48:18.520]  psychologists and agents of social change. Well, I did that the whole time. By the way,
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.600]  that report says that they will use food as a weapon, wars as a weapon, and hold back IMF World Bank
[48:24.600 --> 48:29.160]  funding if they don't reduce their population and their birth rate by 50%. So I mean, you know,
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.120]  he goes, I don't see that in the report. He's like, I don't see about roadside shows, giving
[48:34.120 --> 48:43.160]  people lobotomies with ice picks. I don't believe that conspiracy thinking is embraced by a surprising
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.840]  large portion of the population. 69% of Americans believe President John F Kennedy was killed by
[48:48.840 --> 48:57.880]  conspiracy 69. What? I mean, give us your poll on that, pal. Give us an asterisk. Give us a poll.
[48:57.880 --> 49:06.920]  I mean, the polls I've seen are 87, 89, 90, 91, 92. I mean, look, I'm sorry. Your flim flam
[49:06.920 --> 49:11.960]  doesn't work anymore. A magician's tricks work just fine until you find out they're liars.
[49:11.960 --> 49:15.480]  President John F Kennedy was killed by conspiracy and 42% believe the government
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.640]  is covering up evidence of flying saucers. See, they mix in flying saucers. I'm nothing about that.
[49:21.640 --> 49:28.120]  Well, you actually got all these astronauts saying they saw him. So finds Ted
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.440]  Gorzel, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University at Camden, 36% of respondents,
[49:34.440 --> 49:41.240]  the 2006 Scripps NewsHour poll at least suspected the US government played a role in 9-11.
[49:41.240 --> 49:47.960]  How about 84% in the New York Times or 83% on CNN? He uses the very least polls he can find.
[49:47.960 --> 49:53.720]  We're all conspiracy theorists to some degree. We're all hardwired to find patterns in our
[49:53.720 --> 49:57.800]  environment, particularly those that might represent a threat to us. And when things go
[49:57.800 --> 50:05.160]  wrong, we find ourselves searching for what or who is behind it. In his 1954 classic,
[50:05.160 --> 50:10.760]  the paranoid style. See, they always say this, oh, you need to see pattern. It's scary to you
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.520]  that 19 guys could carry out the attacks. So you want it to be the government because that means
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.600]  somebody's in control. Oh, you want to believe, I mean, when the government admits they're doing
[50:18.600 --> 50:26.760]  things, they'll say this. And it's 1954 classic, the paranoid style. You know what I'm going to do?
[50:27.880 --> 50:33.160]  That's part one of me going over this. I got a bunch of guests coming up. What I'm going to do is
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.400]  at 1240, coming up in about 50 minutes, I'm going to just cover this end to end and try to do it
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.600]  succinctly because I run out of time with some guests coming up on another subject. Again,
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.960]  labeling, that's what this is. Labeling gun owners, Christians, veterans, basically
[50:54.760 --> 50:59.400]  half the population of the country as terrorists. We got a state representative coming on about this.
[50:59.400 --> 51:06.600]  Stay with us. Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important
[51:06.600 --> 51:11.800]  factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink
[51:11.800 --> 51:17.560]  should be at a pH level of eight or higher. Alkivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[51:17.560 --> 51:23.480]  of the most alkaline minerals. Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.760]  to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops in the water you
[51:28.760 --> 51:34.680]  drink to raise the pH to a healthy level. Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[51:34.680 --> 51:40.120]  and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and
[51:40.120 --> 51:45.960]  cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment. Order your bottle of Alkivision

[52:13.480 --> 52:18.840]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[52:19.480 --> 52:26.280]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[52:26.280 --> 52:34.600]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.800]  open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. Build America is

[54:01.240 --> 54:07.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:10.760 --> 54:15.800]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have Representative Jim Gaston from Missouri and a
[54:15.800 --> 54:23.080]  reporter as well who are in the hearings and at the hearing in Missouri last week dealing with the
[54:23.080 --> 54:27.880]  Mayak report that the Feds basically wrote. Government officials have had to step down or
[54:27.880 --> 54:34.440]  have been demoted or going along with it. Again, we told you over a decade ago the Feds were
[54:34.440 --> 54:38.360]  listing veterans and gun owners as terrorists and at the entire Homeland Security System.
[54:38.360 --> 54:43.400]  That's right, pre-911, Bill Clinton was setting it up, was for the American people. Now it's all
[54:43.400 --> 54:50.680]  admitted right again. By the way, this chilling article talks about, am I a threat to the president?
[54:50.680 --> 54:58.040]  Am I dangerous? I mean, this is really declaring war on me and implying that I'm sending people out
[54:58.040 --> 55:04.040]  to attack the government. Now, you know, all I call for is peaceful protesting but also defend
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.720]  yourself as you have a right to do. I mean, they really are trying to set me up with this
[55:09.720 --> 55:16.680]  Poplowski thing and all of this. Again, just pray for me, folks. But I do this cheerfully. I wanted
[55:16.680 --> 55:21.000]  to fight the globalist. I wanted to do my best job going up against them and I'm doing it.
[55:21.960 --> 55:26.680]  Something else we were right about. I remember five years ago when I really started hammering
[55:26.680 --> 55:40.360]  gold because I saw the trends, gold was $300 an ounce. It is now 960 and shooting up and the fall
[55:40.360 --> 55:46.520]  is historically when it just explodes in price. Ted made such big buys in his vaults. He's got
[55:46.520 --> 55:52.200]  at the nearby bank in Minnesota that he still has some gold and silver from the joke level
[55:53.960 --> 56:00.920]  prices from when gold was 905 to $911. That was the two different buys he made.
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.120]  We've got him here with us to tell us how much of that he has left and what the new prices are,
[56:04.120 --> 56:14.600]  but gold is $975 and 90 cents right now. It's up $18 and 78 cents and it was up $10 yesterday.
[56:14.600 --> 56:27.800]  It was up from 955 to 965 yesterday. It's gone from 965 to 975 and 90. Ted, again, you have
[56:28.760 --> 56:33.880]  a deal here that, well, if people don't check it out for themselves, I don't know how to explain
[56:33.880 --> 56:39.160]  to them that if you bought gold in the market when it was $70 less than it is now, that it's
[56:39.160 --> 56:44.600]  a smart move to get into it. Well, it sure is. And especially at this particular time, knowing
[56:44.600 --> 56:49.320]  that Bloomberg right now is calling for gold at 1300, they're right on the mark last time they did
[56:49.320 --> 56:57.320]  that. Here's what we have right now. I have the Lakota at $19 and 70 cents. That coin was at that
[56:57.320 --> 57:02.600]  price last time I was on the air with you when gold was down around that 945 level. I've priced
[57:02.600 --> 57:06.600]  them right now. Lakota is right now, if you want to buy them, they're going to be trading at the
[57:06.600 --> 57:14.520]  price of about $21.50. That's because silver shot up over 15 bucks. And I was just talking to Bob
[57:14.520 --> 57:20.120]  Chapman. He says this is definitely a breakout. And I got to say the same thing. Gold has been
[57:20.120 --> 57:26.360]  real resistant at that 945 level. And to see $1,000 an ounce should be a piece of cake.
[57:26.360 --> 57:32.680]  We also have the British sovereigns at 266. We got the Franks at 216. You'll have to call for
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.880]  these, but I had a good supply of Chinese pandas. I bought those back when gold was lower.
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.840]  Just a whole bunch of stuff. I mean, Alex, that's what I've been doing this last few weeks here
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.160]  is trying to buy in all these dips because I knew this was going to happen. Here we are sitting
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.640]  now coming into September. We're at the first of it now, but this is the time that everything
[57:51.640 --> 57:59.080]  breaks loose. Get rid of Labor Day here and all bets are off. Gold is doing well right now. And
[57:59.080 --> 58:05.400]  if you're doing well, it's got a rocket strapped to its back like why Wiley Coyote? How long can
[58:05.400 --> 58:10.040]  you hold this deal, Ted? Well, this one's going to be real short. I just, I have the feeling
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.760]  maybe I'll be able to go for the week, but I'm not sure on that. It just depends upon what's
[58:14.760 --> 58:19.240]  going on. This is going to be a short run deal because gold is up way too much and so is silver.
[58:19.240 --> 58:25.000]  806.862.237. Get into small amounts of gold and silver. Get into large amounts.
[58:25.000 --> 58:33.000]  Any amount is great. The brokers are there to answer your question right now at 1-800-686-2237.

[1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:25.320]  G-C-N Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:32.760]  Giant psychology today, disinformation hit piece by the drug pushers and their priest
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:37.640]  guild want to take over our society. They've already taken over the public schools where
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:43.720]  they wantonly have their way with the children. Close to 70% of foster kids drug buy them.
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:48.360]  I'm going to break that down coming up in 40 minutes. We've got Representative Jim Guest
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:52.600]  coming up about the MAC report and hearings there and all the big new developments on that front,
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:57.560]  but going back to Ted Anderson. Ted, I haven't had you on in a few weeks, even though Gold's
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:07.160]  been creeping up that whole time. It's gone up, I don't know, what's 9.55 to 9.76 basically,
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:19.240]  it's 9.75-90. That is just a huge $20 move right there alone and explain to people in
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:26.520]  layman's terms. You bought this Gold and the Silver at a much lower price, but you're not
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:30.920]  raising it because the market's gone up as most Gold and Silver brokers do. You're keeping it at
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:37.000]  the old lower price. Well, I'm holding it because I bought the inventory at a certain level
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:43.480]  and I just try to be smart about this. I try to use my 30 years of experience to flush out and
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:49.160]  figure out what are the lows are and then buy. Then I just sit on that inventory until the prices
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:54.680]  go up or sell some of it at that point in time. People need it, but yeah, you're right. The
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:00.840]  prices are lower at this point. I can't replace this inventory and sell it at the prices that
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:06.200]  I'm selling it for today. I'll be losing money and I'll be out of business shortly if I continue
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:12.360]  to do so. What I have right now are some coins that are, I mean, Lakota's are going to be up almost
[1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:18.120]  $2 from where they are right now. The British sovereign at 266 to give you an example, that
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:25.800]  coin would be closer to 271 to 275. The Frank right now at 216 is going to be closer to 219
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:32.520]  to 221. Relative to spot where it is today, you can see that Gold is going up. Anybody with a
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:37.800]  brain can go take a look and see Gold is breaking loose. It's going upward and has had a lot of
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:42.840]  resistance when it starts hitting that 945 level and it doesn't want to go lower. So there's not
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:47.720]  a whole lot of, there's not a whole lot of a success with the sellers in the marketplace,
[1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:53.160]  but the buyers are winning right now. In the time of the year too, historically, this is a
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:58.840]  better time for Gold. In addition to this, we have about two to 300 banks right now that are
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:04.280]  sitting on the chopping block ready to fail. That's right. That's been government announcements
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:10.920]  between 200 and 500 is the numbers I've seen. Why is Bloomberg and other big financial publications
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:16.120]  saying they believe Gold's going to go completely crazy because of the inflationary trillions
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:20.040]  that are now starting to trickle into the economy? Yeah, that's what's going on. I mean, there was
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:25.480]  all that tarp money and everything. It's about velocity. As soon as that money actually enters
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:31.080]  into the system and starts moving the prices upward, that's when Gold is going to look really good.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:35.800]  And so the money is there. It's all debt money, but it hasn't entered into the system where it
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:40.760]  can start driving. And it's kind of like goodfellas when they rob the airport of the diamonds
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:45.480]  and they're not supposed to spend any of it, but everybody starts spending it. The bankers have said
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:50.680]  they can steal the $23.7 trillion and the tens of trillions worldwide on top of it,
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:58.040]  but if they only buy highways, roads, other banks, then it won't cause inflation.
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:02.600]  That's why they pay banks not to loan. But if anybody starts spending it,
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:08.680]  it makes inflation start and ruins it for them. Now, obviously they can't help themselves. They're
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:14.120]  spending it on houses, on cars, on things. And that's why inflation and commodities are about
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:19.480]  to go absolutely crazy. Ladies and gentlemen, you need to give Midas resources, the owners of
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.560]  Genesis. You're not only getting a great deal, you're also supporting the network with the tiny
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:28.200]  markup that Ted puts on the Gold, which is completely overshadowed and dwarfed by the fact
[1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:34.520]  that he's selling it to you when the market's up by 50, 60. No, excuse me, even more money.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:40.680]  You bought this at 9.05 and some of this other Gold at like 9.11, 9.20. Then you're talking just
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:51.240]  huge amounts of savings here. 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237. Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:55.880]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex. The brokers are there right now. Get out of some of that paper
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:05:03.640]  while you still can. 800-686-2237. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:08.360]  buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:13.640]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:18.440]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:23.560]  name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:27.800]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:32.360]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:37.320]  their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:42.040]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:49.480]  Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:08:54.040 --> 1:09:00.040]  Max Kaiser joins us from Paris to break down the latest economic developments and also the
[1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:05.720]  police state developments and Obama's sliding approval numbers that continue to fall at record
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:14.280]  rates. I'm going to cover this story out of psychology today, the house organ of the priest
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:20.600]  class that are pushing all of their drug ads on us and that want to drug according to the new
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:27.240]  freedom initiatives, internal documents, 50% of school children saying half are mentally ill at
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:31.400]  least. They're making everything a mental illness so that they can be the priest class that
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:36.200]  drug us and run our lives. And so we're going to break down this, this amazingly distorted
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:42.680]  hit piece coming up and it's so shoddily done. Do you see this photo here for prisonplanet.tv
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:48.040]  viewers? My sister took this photo. We had so much media a few months ago asking for photos. I said,
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:53.080]  why don't I get a professional photographer in here? My sister is one and got a, you know,
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:57.320]  college degree in that and she will in like a couple months when she graduates. She's in
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.120]  her last semester. And so she came by and took some photos and I said, yeah, you can have the
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:06.440]  photos because you're so lazy. They wouldn't send somebody to get one, but you got to put her name
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:12.280]  under the caption. Give credit. Look where they gave photo credit way down at the bottom corner.
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:18.520]  They couldn't even get their computer formatting right, much less proofread it. I mean, and the
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:23.480]  whole story, you know, they kind of imply in here, I'm crazy when I said that I've been visited by
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:29.640]  the FBI, but I couldn't talk about it. I was under a federal subpoena gag. Now it's in the
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:35.560]  Associated Press and Wired magazine. Why I was under that gag and other media said I was just
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:41.800]  making it up. They were never here. Oh really? Well, now their names are public and part of the
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:48.440]  court record that they were here because some idiot made threats against police by name and
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:53.800]  where they lived in my message board. I wasn't in trouble. That idiot was in trouble. People are
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:59.080]  like, why did you give it to them? They subpoenaed it. They came here. They got those names.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:06.360]  Okay, so that's what happened. But the side issue, that's delusional in here. Yes. But see,
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:12.120]  showing how full of crap this guy is. Back at the time, I said, I can't tell you it's a subpoena.
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:18.760]  It's a, I'm under a federal subpoena saying not talk about it. The court ordered that and the son
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:24.520]  of a bitch didn't believe that. Excuse me. I mean, I just, there's just no end to these people. I mean,
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:30.680]  I don't lie about anything. Okay. I occasionally get something wrong. And when we do, we come here
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:35.000]  and tell you because all that matters is our credibility with you. All we want is to be
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:42.520]  truthful. I want to be a moral good person. I apologize to representative guest for being ungentile.
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:47.720]  Representative Jim guest of Missouri, a Republican represents, uh,
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:52.600]  the Cobb County and parts of Clinton, Buchanan and Gentry counties, district five
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:56.200]  in the Missouri house representatives. He was elected to the house in November 2002.
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:00.920]  He's on several committees and he is now sitting in the committee to hear public testimony on the
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:09.080]  MIAC report that we broke. I had TV news here and it was a conspiracy theory that, that,
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:14.760]  that we broke the MIAC report. No, we broke it. Kansas city star admits that. And I don't care
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:21.400]  about the credit, but I made the Obama deception. I did get the report from two different state
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:27.880]  police officers, one in California, one in Missouri. We did break the DHS report. We did break the
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.400]  infregard. We did break the clergy response teams. We did break the FEMA camps. We did.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:40.200]  I mean, you know, I'm just tired of everybody attacking me saying I'm a liar when I'm not,
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:47.080]  but see they are trying to lie to you. They think you're stupid and they think that if they just
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.720]  say everything I'm saying is a lie, that we'll all get tied up and arguing about whether I'm a liar
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:56.760]  or not. Instead of, it's like this, the executive order, the number one representative Jim guest,
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:02.280]  just Google for everybody on screen at prison planet.TV and on the radio, type this in executive
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:09.560]  order quarantine. Now the first link that comes up under Google web, executive order quarantine
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:15.880]  is CBS news with the executive order set with a link to it
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:30.840]  that openly states that I got distracted by what they had up on screen there.
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:34.600]  What was the search I was telling you that openly states quarantines and lockdowns of cities.
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:40.120]  Now, then we have a debate whether that's true or not. The executive order says it.
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:46.280]  It didn't come up at start page.com. Do it. Do it in Google. Star page is a great search engine,
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.240]  but to get that response, you need to do it in Google. Okay. All right. Let's go representative
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:57.000]  Jim guest here right now. Representative guest. Good to have you here with us, sir. Alex,
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:02.520]  it's good to be here and it's good to be on your show and continue to fight for the
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  sovereignty and freedom and the rights of the people of this country, which continually are
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.640]  being challenged. That's for sure. Well, sir, you were the first person to be nationally interviewed
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:17.800]  in memory serves when the mic report broke. Did info wars.com break the mic report?
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:24.520]  Absolutely. I think I got a, somebody sent me a copy of the email that morning and I
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:29.560]  can't question the whether it was true or not. And surely after that you call me and I think
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:34.680]  we did an interview that afternoon. So you were the, uh, yes, you broke the story. You're the
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:42.520]  first one that I, uh, knew about it from. Yes. And again, I just, this is what the establishment
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:47.560]  does. They, and I have to respond to some of it, but if I spend all my time, it's like responding
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:52.360]  to the media about whether or not they're setting up a bank of the world for global governance.
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:57.640]  When it's in all the federal documents, all over the news, they'll simultaneously say they're doing
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:03.000]  it. But then if you say you don't want world government, they say you're a liar. So true.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:08.440]  Yes. You know, I think, uh, the last few years more and more people are realizing this, uh,
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:15.160]  one world government, uh, what's going on. They can see the, uh, influences of it out there.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:19.800]  They can see the indicators and they can see the trend that we're going to. So I think more
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:25.640]  and more people realizing what you and others have been, uh, forecasting or warning people
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:32.520]  about are coming true here now. Well, sir, we've got you here because you and others called for
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:37.400]  hearings. You first called for hearings. Some of the state officials got disciplined. The, uh,
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:43.800]  the lieutenant governor came out and had press conferences against it and it became a national
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:49.480]  issue representative guest. Can you recap what's in my, what happened and now the new discoveries
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.200]  coming out in the committee that the anarchist appeared to be government provocateurs. They've
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:16:00.040]  been caught in other states and cities like Denver last year confirmed as provocateurs, Denver
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:06.360]  post provocateurs and in the federally is the prison planet.com headline. Can, can you tell us
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:13.640]  what the committee is finding? Uh, yeah, we've had three hearings. The first one basically was in
[1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:20.360]  the state capital and at that point we had the highway patrol, the, the my act, uh, people there
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:26.040]  and they kind of, uh, obviously defended the program. They told about how it came about
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:32.440]  and what they were using it for. Ironically, in all the descriptions when they told about how the
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:38.360]  my act was functioning, they never listed that terrorism or potential terrorist, terrorist that
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:44.120]  they were using it for. They were using it for sharing of information within the state on, uh,
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:49.640]  thefts and stuff like that that was going on. You know, they do have to have a sharing of
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:55.800]  information about thought is ironic that they didn't talk about the, what the report came
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:17:02.200]  out, which is a modern militia movement that tended to gloss over, ignore that. So that was,
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:07.640]  that's it. Everything's a lie. And in fact, I saw them on Missouri news online. They came out and
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:14.680]  said, we're just trying to stop bank robbers when, when the whole issue is about their report
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:20.360]  written by the feds distributed by them. First, they said it wasn't real. Then they come and say
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:25.400]  it's about bank robbers. No, it's about Ron Paul bumper stickers and people getting pulled over
[1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:29.800]  in Missouri, people with Ron Paul material, being frisked, being searched, being asked
[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:34.280]  why they have money in their wallet. I'm, but, but, oh, no, this is about bank robberies. See
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:41.880]  how they always deceive, deceive. They don't, they're not wrong. They know they're deceiving. It's a
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:47.080]  game. That's true. And like I said, that's what most of us, we had a couple of citizens that
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:52.040]  testified at that point. The next one was in St. Charles, just outside of St. Louis. And we had
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:59.400]  a lot of citizen commentary input testimony there. They started asking us some pointed
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:05.720]  questions. We had somebody from the Illinois, I think what they call their non-Diac. And I was
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:10.680]  rather disturbed to listen to what they were giving us there. Because basically we asked the
[1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:16.120]  question, you know, if you gather information on citizens when you make a stop, what can you find
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:21.240]  out if your information, if your name's on that list and basically through the sunshine law,
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:27.320]  freedom of information or some other way of getting that, they basically said, no,
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:32.200]  you're not going to be made this. And they have somebody there trying to defend the
[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:39.000]  my act stuff and where he really went wrong was when he tried to say that the, if you read that,
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  you'd really understand why that was needed. And that certainly fired up the committee members.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:48.200]  Well, sir, I received from, from, from inside the FBI, their training videos that they give
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:52.840]  their officers, their agents, and they're given a local police. And it says, if somebody's got
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:19:00.760]  binoculars or a cell phone or sleeping bags or maps to go ahead and put them in the terror database
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:07.080]  for life. And this is designed just like England to put everybody on a list so they can claim probable
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:13.320]  cause on you. Absolutely. If I, if they stopped me at some point and asked to search my car and
[1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:18.520]  I said, no, because they had no reason to. And for some reason they did, they would, I would
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:23.000]  be on that list because they might find a shotgun in my trunk. They might find a box of shotgun
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:28.920]  shells or something like that, you know, which any sportsman or anybody that can legally carry
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:33.080]  that should do so. And by the way, Mr. Guest, Representative Guest, we're going to break.
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:40.440]  You're not joking. If you have a gun, if you have a map, if you have a cell phone, it's so wide,
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:45.640]  it's meant to put everybody in secret police databases that go to the federal level and we
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:51.640]  have the internal FBI training videos on this. We played it yesterday. We need a huge report
[1:19:51.640 --> 1:20:11.320]  at infowars.com very soon on this. Stay with us, Representative Guest. We really appreciate you.

[1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:11.640]  hyperinflation in Weimar, Germany, people who had worked all their lives invested conservatively
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.200]  were wiped out, reduced to poverty. There are many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S.
[1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:20.680]  today. I'll send you a list. There are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:26.520]  silver, and legal and constitutional ways to avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable.
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:31.720]  I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources. Many of the people I talk to today are aware of trouble

[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:49.640]  yourself. Call me today. Bob Moss at 800-686-2237, extension 111. That's Bob Moss Midas Resources

[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:06.760]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:11.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:17.560]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:22.280]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already
[1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:27.880]  fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:34.200]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:40.520]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:47.880]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:55.640]  copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at presentplanet.tv,

[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:13.960]  Representative Jim Gaston, Missouri, is with us. He's the guy that really blew the whistle
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:22.920]  on Mayak and his state and called the state police and confirmed it was real. For a week or so,
[1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:26.520]  the media just said I was making it up and put out a fake report. And look at this,
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:31.320]  socialism sauce. We just got mailed this with Obama on it. I guess we'll be putting a terrorist
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:37.160]  database because of this. But I don't want to just glaze over this, what the representative is
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:43.160]  telling you. We have the training manuals. We have the training videos. We know. And two years ago,
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:51.080]  a head federal marshal in Denver came out and said that they were ordered to put families,
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:56.360]  children. They had a quota to put innocent people on a terror database for the rest of their lives
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:00.840]  so that they could go back to Congress at Homeland Security and say, look,
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.640]  we've put this many people on the database and that meant a little kid taking a photo
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:12.360]  out the airplane window. That meant someone ordering a vegetarian lunch at one of the kiosk.
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:17.480]  They're just secret police all over. And this is the core of secret police. And they use it and sell
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:23.480]  it in the name of fighting foreign terrorism. But now they flip the whole deal to say it's for
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:27.640]  the American people. And that's what the Mayak report and the Homeland Security, remember day
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:32.920]  one, I said, that's a Homeland Security report regurgitated by the state. They have to get their
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:38.680]  federal money. And then the DHS report came out and it was word for word. So this is the secret
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:45.160]  police putting you in a database for literally no reason to create the perception that they're
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:49.160]  terrorist everywhere. Representative Gass, continue with what happened in these hearings.
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:55.160]  Okay, thank you. Like I said, we had a hearing in St. Charles just outside of St. Louis. There
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:01.480]  were several pointed questions and testimonies by individual citizens who wanted answers.
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:07.400]  The chairman of the committee tried to tell us at the beginning of these hearings that we're not
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:13.080]  supposed to dwell on the modern militia movement. Well, that's what prompted all of this. So obviously
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:19.640]  a large number of people are very concerned. Those who had been almost pointed out that are
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:25.880]  hearing in Kansas City, Daryl Casso, who was the vice presidential candidate for the Constitution
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:33.320]  Party was actually there because he was second to Chuck Baldwin and very much involved in being
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:39.320]  pointed out there. And he gave some very good testimony of why he thought it was dangerous
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:46.520]  and the danger to that. And there was a couple of law enforcement for Kansas City tried to justify
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:51.880]  why and how they could use information in the MYAC and the sharing of information.
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:59.160]  We do want sharing of information within the state for drug, task force and stuff like that.
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:03.000]  Yeah, but let's be clear. It's saying libertarian bumper stickers,
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:13.240]  Ron Paul, bumper stickers, anti-UN stickers, stop them, put them in a database, list them as like
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:20.120]  Jews in Nazi Germany to later be picked up. That's what this is. This is the police being
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:25.720]  turned into federalized political police like right out of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.760]  Yeah, but when we asked him what the, in Kansas City, the law enforcement there, what they did
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:37.560]  with this, he said, well, you know, he did send it down to people to review in his command. I said,
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:42.520]  you know, what did, what did you see in there that prompted you to do this? Who did you think
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:48.680]  was dangerous in there? Of course, he could not answer that. So it's again, he was going to his
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:55.800]  training to send it down and compile this list of so-called terrorist, what you're talking about
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:01.400]  says common malicious symbols and underneath is political and anti-government rhetoric. And
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:08.280]  below that is the political paraphernalia, which included the libertarian party. There is no doubt
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:14.920]  that they were targeted with this. And you know, we, of course, here in Missouri, they said that
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:20.840]  they will no longer issue any strategic reports, but I'm not sure how we know that that will be
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:26.600]  the case. But then, we'll continue to have one more hearing here. The citizens are coming out
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:33.080]  and asking some very pointed questions. And we'll have a, probably in about three weeks,
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:37.640]  I think the report will come out with our suggestions on this. A large number of people has
[1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:45.160]  said, you know, all the way from disbanding the MYAC to an obvious oversight committee.
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:49.000]  And what I want to know is my question, which I haven't gotten an answer from yet,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.680]  can anybody in Missouri or any other state find out if they're on the watch list, if they're in
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:29:00.040]  the data file for whatever reason, why they have been stopped? You know, I think any citizen of
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:04.600]  this country needs to know whether they've been fallen, just like our watch list and no flight
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:10.680]  list. They've got, what, hundreds of thousands of people on there and people who shouldn't be on
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:14.840]  there and they have a common name, they're on it. The same thing is going to happen in this list
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:19.720]  here that's coming out of this MYAC thing or this huge database that exists.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:25.160]  And let's be clear. We just discovered this at the Missouri level. It's come out in Virginia
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:30.920]  and Tennessee and California. It's all the same in general terms. Some are even worse,
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:36.440]  where they just list everybody. And we've got to dig up that article from two years ago in
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:45.320]  the Denver Post where the federal marshals went public, the air marshals, saying we've been ordered
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:50.440]  to put innocent people on databases for life for quotas. Stay with us, Representative.
[1:29:51.320 --> 1:29:58.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:06.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:10.920]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:16.920]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.920 --> 1:30:22.200]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:26.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:31.480]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:36.840]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:42.040]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:46.760]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:34.680]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.

[1:32:56.680 --> 1:33:12.120]  terrorists. We are back live. We're going to be going to Tony Pacheco, Pacheco here in just a
[1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:15.880]  moment, freelance writer. We want to get his perspective. He's been at these hearings
[1:33:15.880 --> 1:33:23.400]  on the Mayak report in Missouri, a window into the secret police world of every local police
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:28.840]  department, state police, totally federalized spying. We showed you internal FBI training videos
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:36.120]  where they say cell phones that cue it up to that cell phones, video cameras, sleeping bags,
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:42.200]  maps. And of course, this is all separately come out that the Texas report that we also broke years
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:49.560]  ago, but 2004 written by the fed said if somebody's wearing blue jeans, they can be a terrorist.
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:54.360]  So it's basically everybody's a terrorist, but the government, the real terrorist staging the
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:34:00.120]  terror attacks. I want to go to Tony here in just a minute. I want to keep representative
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:07.240]  guest on with him, but representative guest, it came out in testimony. We have a story written
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:13.720]  on this with links to it that there were provocateurs at the fed rally and they were overheard
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:16.840]  saying, yeah, we can't even get them to J walk. We're not going to be able to arrest them.
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:21.640]  And in Denver last year, the police had to admit they did stage attacks on themselves.
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:25.160]  The Canadian roll amount of police got caught at the SPP meeting doing this.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:32.280]  Can you tell us about provocateurs anarchist at the end the fed rallies and now confirmed at
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:37.720]  the tea parties? I guess they must be. I speak of one, so I must be one of them. I asked that
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:41.880]  question at those end of the fed rally there in Kansas City because I spoke to them. I said,
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:46.120]  I asked the people, I said, do you watch these infiltrate them? And they said, no, we're not
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:52.360]  of concern to. However, I have trouble believing that because we see some people at those rallies
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:58.600]  that we do not recognize and they just don't fit in. So we, that's our concern is that there will
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:05.640]  be those provocateurs, somebody to stir some up, created the instant to justify taking action against
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:13.240]  these people protesting the Federal Reserve or photo protesting what these my act reports have
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:17.880]  done. So at some point, I think we're, I'm not concerned afraid that that's what's going to
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:23.400]  happen to justify this. And the other problem we have is Department of Homeland Security has
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:29.000]  an interest they put money into it. And I think they have undue influence on what's going on.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.440]  The people in these my act groups say that, you know, they deny that say that's not the case,
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:39.240]  but then they do say, you know, well, they are a source of funding to us to keep some of our
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:45.400]  organizations going. So, well, that's what these threat fusion centers are, is where they're moving
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.080]  generally in former federal buildings or former National Guard armories all over the country.
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:57.400]  They move the county, the city, multiple counties and cities into one roof. The feds give them cars,
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:04.280]  helicopters, armored vehicles, dial in to the systems that track cell phones real time to the
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:09.480]  federal cameras, the face scanning, the license plate reading cameras. And they're just totally
[1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:15.640]  federalizing police. They send them out to spy on everybody and then report people back
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:22.200]  into these databases that are just full of made up enemies list and innuendo. My dad got pulled
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:27.560]  over a couple of years ago in East Texas driving back from our family ranch at about 10 o'clock
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:31.640]  at night. And the guy said, yeah, the cameras flagged you and people that don't believe this
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:37.560]  just Google town runs every plate of every car. And you'll see it in Florida and Indiana and
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:42.040]  Texas and the feds pay grants to put these in and my dad was driving through this little town
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:48.840]  flagged as Alex Jones because I had an old car that I'd sold him. My dad will never buy a new
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.480]  car. So I sold him one of my old cars. He just, it's not, it's not that he's a penny pincher. He
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.720]  just doesn't like to, he just from the country. He doesn't buy things. He's got shoes, little
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:02.840]  holes in them and everything else. So I, I sold him this car for next to nothing. So it had my
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:08.040]  name on it and they pulled him over and they got, are you Alex Jones? You know, I've got you in the
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:14.120]  database. This said proceed with extreme caution. And my dad said, how do you know that? And they
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:19.800]  said, well, we have this whole database on you now that the feds gave us. So my daddy gets to get
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:25.400]  interrogated because of me. I mean, that's this country's Nazi Germany. There's somebody looking
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:31.880]  over your shoulder at all points. And my question I had here in Missouri is why is the Mayak headquarters,
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:36.680]  which is supposed to be under the direction of highway patrol located on a military base.
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:39.240]  And I haven't got an answer back to that question yet.
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:48.120]  It's, it's, it's, it's just amazing that all of this is, is going on. And obviously it's by a
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:53.880]  military base because you can pull up. In fact, guys, Google this for everybody or start page.com
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:38:02.840]  for everybody. If you can the term army liaison officers or, or army officers and local police
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.240]  departments and you'll get hundreds of heads where they go, Oh, the army is just part of our
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:12.200]  department. Now, representative guest, have you heard the new report that's come out out of the
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:17.560]  Hill newspaper and out of the progressive that now the army wants 400,000 troops on the streets
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:25.880]  of America to quote deal with domestic extremists, 400,000 troops. I mean, this is, this is really
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:31.720]  happening. You know, that's our fear is that we'll have a martial law declared and we'll already
[1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:38.200]  have these federal troops in place around here and no longer will your local law enforcement
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:44.200]  be in control, but it'll be the military. So that's just one step towards going enough to that
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:56.840]  point. Representative, I want to bring up Tony, who is a freelance writer for the examiner. He
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:03.960]  wrote some great stories very informative for the examiner.com Chuck Baldwin 2008 VP candidate
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:11.480]  Castle testifies regarding my act and Tony is great to have you up with us. Thank you,
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:17.960]  Mr. Jones. Hello, Mr. Guest. How are you? I'm fine. Tell folks just from your perspective what
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:23.880]  you've seen at these hearings. Well, it's pretty interesting. Obviously, the majority of the time
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:31.000]  was both spent on the my act reports themselves, but it was pretty interesting what came out with
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:39.080]  Dr. Sissy Sprague and the testimony. And I got a hold of her last night and got her to
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:43.880]  elaborate a little bit more on what happened. So if you don't mind, I go into that for just a
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:51.240]  minute. Yes. And Tony, I want to get this right. Is it Pacheco or Pacheco? It's Pacheco. Pacheco,
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:58.600]  great. Yeah. Please continue. Tell folks this breaking information. Oh, sure. And just to be
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:05.640]  clear, she is under the impression that they were harmless, but her story, in my opinion, will
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:12.360]  kind of say otherwise. She was, you know, she basically said that, that, you know, they were
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:23.080]  trying to recruit them to cause trouble. And then she went on to say that, you know, there's four
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:29.960]  or five of them, rather young, and that they were trying to get them, you know, to basically go and
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:39.720]  disrupt traffic. And, you know, that was one of the four things that Army Defense Report and that
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.800]  on in the Fed, you know, to go out and spy. And that was one of the four things that said that,
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:49.640]  that they were trying to avoid. Yeah. And then that's always the blueprint. The Army says these
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.720]  may be terrorists. Now they try to block traffic. They're terrorists. That's a violation of
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:59.960]  infrastructure protection. Then the Army can get involved. And we wrote a big story with all the
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:06.920]  declassified examples of the feds and the states doing this. We've got to have people at every
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:14.360]  event who basically stake out these events to surveil the people who are surveilling or counter
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:20.680]  intelligence, because if we just expose the police and the feds a few more times and start demanding
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:26.280]  some jail time, because it's criminal to try to go out either with provocateurs or with feds
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:31.560]  themselves or agents themselves and try to get people to commit crimes. That is a crime. That
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:37.320]  is not just entrapment. That is criminal. Representative Guest, I mean, it's one thing
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:42.440]  to ask somebody, hey, you want to buy some drugs? And courts have said that's bad, but not really
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:47.640]  illegal. But to go out and try to get people to commit crimes and try to lead people into crimes
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:53.320]  at political events so you can crack down on free speech, this is high treason. It is. And I was
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:59.240]  just looking at my notes here that what Tony was talking about here that when Sydney testified,
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:05.880]  she brought up the point that in the Department of Justice training manual, they call protesters
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:13.960]  low level terrorists. So basically, they are anybody that protest anything out there as we've
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:19.560]  said all along goes on the list. See, that's my point. Two weeks ago, it came out that the
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:25.640]  Justice Department in a document says all protest is low level terrorism. That's an actual quote
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:31.720]  that they're teaching police, military and feds and people who accuse us of exaggerating how
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.560]  bad it is. How much worse does it get? It's worse than we even remember. In fact, guys,
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:42.840]  you can Google that protesting low level terror or start page dot com that another great search
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:49.480]  engine and pull that up for people because folks need to see this for themselves. Go ahead.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:54.280]  I was my point was, I think I asked her, I said all these people protesting these rallies,
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:59.080]  the national health care plan, are they being classified as low level terrorists? Basically,
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:05.560]  it's getting to point anybody who talks against the federal government or who protest their voices,
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:11.640]  their displays are being classified as a terrorist or a threat to this nation or a threat to their
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:18.360]  government. And that's absolutely false. We're supposed to have a country that was based upon
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:23.800]  the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression without having any retribution taken against you,
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:28.040]  but that's not the case. We're being classified as a potential threat.
[1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:38.120]  Absolutely. Tony, as a reporter at these events, continue with the provocateur angle
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:40.600]  or any other key tidbits you'd like to relay to folks.
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:45.800]  Well, if you don't mind, could I tag on to what Mr. Guest was saying about?
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:47.240]  Yeah, whatever you want, sir. Say whatever you want.
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:54.120]  Okay. Yeah, it all really picked up steam back after 9-11 when Bush said,
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:57.320]  you're either with us or you're with the terrorists. And from then on,
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:03.960]  they kind of had an exclusive deal with public opinion and anybody who said anything outside
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:11.240]  of that was with the terrorists. And then now, unfortunately, President Obama has taken a hand
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:19.640]  off from Bush and now anybody that's against their policies are racist or otherwise.
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:27.240]  But it's starting to backfire. That's the point, is people can see how bad these
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:34.840]  hip pieces are, and then they go and look otherwise. So I think that it's kind of blowing up in their
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:41.880]  fate. One thing that we're not getting was I was hoping the way these hearings would get more.
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:47.080]  Obviously, Alex, you're doing a great job here, but some of our local news media are not picking
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:52.040]  up on this. And I guess that's probably not too surprising that they don't want to
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:59.480]  put too much visibility on what we're doing here in the investigation. And the testimony is taking
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:06.280]  place, but I was hoping we would see more media, TV coverage, even newsprint coverage of these
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:12.520]  hearings just going on. But that's being done whether they're told to cover it up and not make
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:19.880]  it public or not. But certainly, I and others that believe in the threat that's here are going to
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:26.840]  make it public as much as we can. Yes, sir, we appreciate you and Tony. There's a reason.
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:33.160]  In fact, there's the article. DoD training manual describes protest as low-level terrorism. We have
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:39.480]  a link to it, and the ACLU has also got a link to it covering it. So yes, it's real. Protesting is
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:45.160]  an act of terror because we have terrorists running our country. But of course, these are secret.
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:49.400]  It's secret they've turned the police into secret police. It's secret they're all reporting back
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:54.440]  to the feds. It's secret that they're saying gun owners and veterans are the number one threat.
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:59.320]  And they don't want us to know that Homeland Security and Northcom is for us. The feds are
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:04.120]  controlled by the offshore banks, period. They're fraudulently taking us into receivership.
[1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:08.840]  And if we're aware of the fraud they're perpetrating, they won't be able to get away with it. So
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:14.600]  it is essential that we expose this is going on not just in the U.S., but worldwide, and that
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:19.640]  this entire police state's been set up for us. And the good news is police and military are really
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:25.960]  waking up. They're very upset about what's happening. But this lets us know who the federal
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:32.680]  government is. It lets us know that it's being run by very anti-American tyrants who really want
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:38.120]  to turn America into the Soviet Union. Mr. Jones, may I tell you about the media coverage?
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:46.680]  Yeah, I believe I was pretty much it. I mean, I sure have. And some of my family said,
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:53.400]  well, do you think any of the media will be there? And I said, well, there should be maybe a camera
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:47:02.120]  too. And I show up and I drove past the building because I didn't see any hoopla. And then it
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:08.360]  turns out that I was at the right place. I go in there. I watch the hearings. I go home,
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:14.840]  do the report. And then when I wake up in the morning, I see a couple of letters in my email
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:20.040]  box. I wanted to know more information about the hearing because I was the only one that wrote
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:25.960]  an article about it. And that's, you know, the majority of the public fits in the categories
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:32.280]  of that report. And the only reason I went, you know, I wanted to go to these hearings,
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:35.160]  but I didn't know when they were. But thankfully, you guys posted it on your
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:43.320]  info wars website on last week. So, you know, I was able to go and, you know, it took a vacation
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:49.160]  day for my nine to five job went out there, covered it and, and, you know, I'm glad to get the word
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.840]  out. Well, good job, sir. And we'll continue to watch the reports you're doing. And you're,
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:59.560]  and feel free to write great reports to follow reports for info wars.com. Just send those into
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:04.280]  writers and info wars.com if you want us to publish your fine work. And the representative
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:10.280]  guest as this continues, we'll keep checking in with you. But yeah, this isn't just a report
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:16.440]  demonizing patriots. This is about the federalization of police. Representative Charles Key, of course,
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.560]  of Oklahoma and others that I've had on from Oklahoma, when they just try to have state
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.000]  sovereignty declaration or when they say they're not, they're going to follow the bill rights,
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.880]  the state police, local police show up and change the subject and say, don't you want to stop bank
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:36.200]  robberies? We've got to spy on your neighbors. They always change the subject. They have already
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:41.320]  been federalized. Most of them, most of the police chiefs are CIA or FBI. That's on record.
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:46.520]  And so we have to understand that we need to start removing these police chiefs and sheriffs and
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:52.280]  other people that are singing to the wrong sheet of music. We're the people. We run this country
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:58.200]  and we're tired of the banking cartel coming in with a corporate takeover. And so when you've
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:03.480]  got the police trying to come in and muscle the state representatives, that's called treason.
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:11.160]  That's pretty heavy handed. And the next hearing will be on September 9th in the southwest corner
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:14.680]  of the state of Missouri. It's going to be at Springfield. Don't have exact location. We had
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:19.800]  people who drove from Oklahoma to testify here in Kansas City. So if people want to become a part
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:24.920]  of it and provide their testimony, that'll be their next in that part of the country.
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  Absolutely. And call all the newspapers all over the country and say, why aren't you
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:33.720]  covering the secret police and the federalization? And the fact that the federal marshals say they're
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:39.240]  ordered to put innocent people on the databases under quotas. And there's no judge, no jury. Now
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:44.200]  they say no fly. You won't be able to buy a gun. This is all, I mean, we're all being put on list,
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:49.720]  folks. And if we let them have a chilling effect and shut us down and cower us into shutting up,
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:54.120]  they win. That's why they're coming out and saying to criticize government is now racism.
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:59.000]  To say you don't want socialism as racism. I think I saw a new clip on the Alex Jones channel
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:06.760]  this morning on YouTube of Chris Matthews saying that if you criticize all the White House servants,
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:12.200]  you're racist. If you criticize big government, you're racist. They're using this as psychological
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:17.480]  weapon to say, don't you criticize big government racist thinking they can use white guilt to make
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:23.560]  you go, well, okay, I don't want to be called a racist. Hey, I think I like strawberry ice cream,
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:28.920]  not vanilla. That's racist. I think I like black shirts, not white shirts. That's racist. I think,
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.840]  you know, I like the swimming pool at 85 degrees, not 75 racist. I like blue skies racist. You know,
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:39.320]  I like to breathe air racist. Basically, you have no thoughts, just the high priest of mind
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:43.560]  control and political correctness just say, shut up, do what we say or we'll call your racist
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:49.320]  representative guest. And of course, the writer also, we appreciate both of you for joining us.
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:53.320]  God bless you and take care. Okay, thank you, Alex. Thank you. Take care. You bet. Take care,
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:57.240]  gentlemen. We'll be right back with psychology today's hit piece on me. Stay with us.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:06.680]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill? If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form,
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:11.880]  that's exactly what you're doing. Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman. According to the
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:17.560]  physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed. It
[1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:22.360]  doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills,
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:27.160]  you're flushing $90 down the toilet. Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow,

[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:11.800]  being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people
[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:16.680]  know that 9-11 was a state? It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral
[1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:24.040]  Commission, the CFR. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the
[1:52:24.040 --> 1:52:30.040]  seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:36.680]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:41.320]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:45.960]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:51.080]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary

[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:59.080]  this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major
[1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:04.360]  environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:08.840]  drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune,
[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:13.480]  and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue

[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:28.760]  All right, Max Kaiser, we're coming up in the next segment. I want to spend some time now on
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:35.480]  this. There's an article called Dark Minds, Field Guide to Conspiracy Theorists, and they've made
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:39.480]  hundreds and hundreds of new psychological designations. Don't like big government. Don't
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:44.360]  like corruption. Don't like Nazi Germany. Don't like Soviet Russia. You're mentally ill. And
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:51.000]  Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany had psychiatrists, you know, where the first group's out having people
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:58.840]  detained and grabbed. And notice right next to it is another mood disorder or, you know, another
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:05.400]  drug ad is right next to the story hit piece on me. I mean, this whole thing is drug ads.
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:11.560]  And I'm somebody that criticizes that 20% of our kids and 18% of adults and now the government wants
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:17.000]  under drug company lobbying to have 50% new freedom initiative. And this guy just says,
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:24.840]  Jones makes things up. Jones, you know, I almost can't even get into this because there's so much
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:31.400]  disinformation here. You know, Jones thinks there's FEMA camps. Jones thinks Halliburton's
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:35.880]  involved in child kidnapping. And that was all over the news. Chicago Tribune, you name it.
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:42.280]  I mean, it's come out about black water and the, and the, and the child prostitutes and
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:46.520]  I mean, it's come out about the UN, but I know, and he would, when I would say that, he'd go,
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:51.000]  really, what's your proof? And I'd go, well, just search engine, UN child kidnapping,
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:57.320]  Halliburton. And he just would laugh at me. I mean, it's not funny. You smart ass smug little bastard.
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:04.040]  I mean, this stuff isn't funny. And he says, Jones just gets, I write when you challenge him
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:11.080]  on his made up stuff. I'm not making any of this up. And you know it. And it just goes on here in
[2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:18.200]  the article that says we're all conspiracy theorists to some degree. We've all hardwired to find patterns
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:25.400]  of threat. Yes. Like the Bengal tiger in the bushes in Central Asia or the lion on the African
[2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:31.400]  Savannah to see patterns. I mean, what patterns they're openly announcing world government,
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:35.560]  but he says that's a crazy conspiracy theory. I have they're openly announcing a new bag of the
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:42.600]  world to carry out global governance in Newsweek time magazine, you name it. And he did, I sent
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:49.240]  him all this. He didn't want it. He just wanted to write an article to fill in the pages between
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:56.840]  drug ads. But the really sick part is the end where he says that I'm like some basically calling for
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:06.600]  violence. But here we go. In his 1954 classic, a paranoid style in American politics, historian
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:14.840]  Richard Hofstandner hypothesized that conspiracy thinking is fueled by underlying feelings of
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:19.960]  alienation and helplessness. Well, why did the police have hundreds of thousands of charges
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:24.120]  of conspiracy every year? And conspiracy just means two people get together and have an agreed upon
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:32.840]  plan. But government and corporations don't do that. Recent research supports his theory. Oh,
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:39.960]  yes, we are from other psychologists. New Mexico State University psychologist Maria
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:49.400]  Albanonia Papa has found that people who endorse conspiracy theories are especially
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:56.520]  likely to feel angry, mistrustful, alienated from society and helpless over larger forces
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:04:02.440]  controlling their lives. Yeah, if you're awake and your kid got shot in the back by police or
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:07.960]  CPS took your kid, you know, you're going to be pissed off. You're going to be alienated.
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:12.680]  And then I mean, you heard the representative when they tried to have hearings about the
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.520]  Mayak report, they would go, we're not talking about the Mayak report. We're going to talk about
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:21.240]  stopping bank robbery. Let's not talk about conspiracy theories. I had the reporter in
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:25.400]  here yesterday and she said, I can't find the Mayak report about Ron Paul and bumper stickers.
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:31.080]  I flipped it open said right there. Oh, I didn't see that before. And she was thinking I hadn't
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:35.880]  read it or looked at it. I mean, you know, just because you say it isn't there, just because you
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:42.120]  say the moon has made a cheese doesn't make it so folks. So I'll come back and finish up with this.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:52.920]  But the end part, I mean, it's just basically I am the new helter skelter. I'm the new,
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:05:01.720]  you know, evil Charles Manson with an army of killers. We'll be right back. This is Alex Jones.

[2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:09.160]  generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[2:06:09.160 --> 2:06:14.360]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:18.920]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:23.960]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:28.200]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the
[2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:32.680]  hurricane and dangerous summer storms season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose
[2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:37.640]  their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:42.360]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:49.800]  Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:09.320]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:14.600]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:07:14.600 --> 2:07:19.960]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:25.160]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:29.400]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will
[2:07:29.400 --> 2:07:34.280]  you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:39.720]  good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:45.320]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:53.320]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web

[2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:07.160]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:18.680]  You know, tomorrow I'll do a more thorough debunking of this, but I mean there's really
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:27.560]  really not much to say about this. I mean it's just, it's a trashy,
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:31.800]  trashy article that just says I'm a liar and then I'm making stuff up.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:38.920]  Historian Richard Hofstadter had a hypothesis, the conspiracy thinking is fueled by underlying
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:48.840]  feelings of alienation. And it goes on to say Jones insists he had a leave it to beaver childhood.
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:52.600]  See, that's taken out of context. I said I had a great parents that were like leave her to beaver
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:58.520]  parents and were really nice. Yes, how are your parents? Parents are really nice. Maybe a little
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:04.360]  too lenient sometimes now that I'm a parent and look back on it. And just great parents. I had no
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:08.680]  idea how great my parents were. I've always talked about that. And it's just impossible to this guy
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:14.040]  that I had a great life. I mean I grew up in a middle class neighborhood on a golf course
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:23.240]  and I dated cheerleaders and just went on camping trips other than getting a lot of fist fights and
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:28.520]  seeing a lot of weird stuff growing up, seeing the police being drug dealers and that was on record
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:34.760]  that the sheriff went to jail for it. I had a great childhood. But no, it's just a lie
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:39.400]  because I wouldn't give this little bastard because once I got into the interview, I could tell this
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:46.360]  was slimy and a hit piece. This is exactly what I thought it would be. He said I want your parents
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:49.560]  number. My parents have told me we do not want to be interviewed. I said my parents don't want to
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:56.200]  be interviewed. They're private. They're private, huh? Problems with your parents? No. I'm going to
[2:09:56.200 --> 2:10:01.560]  my parents every week or so. We get along great. Oh, what's wrong? You're hiding something with
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:07.400]  your parents, you know? And so psychology today is saying I have a bad childhood. I mean just,
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:15.240]  it's made up crap. Is there no end to these people? Jones insists he had to leave it to beaver childhood.
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:20.920]  I couldn't confirm such an idyllic pass. When I asked if I could interview his family or childhood
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:26.280]  friends, he insists his family were very private. I said they're very private. They don't want to
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:32.760]  talk to the media. And he had not kept in touch with a single friend. No, I said I know who some
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:36.680]  of my friends are, but they're like all off now with families. I haven't talked to them in years.
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:44.280]  One of my high school friends died. And he said, can I have their names and numbers? And I said,
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:50.840]  no, I'm not going to put my friends in a hit piece. He didn't put that in here though.
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:57.240]  No. When I asked if I might look them up, he became irritated.
[2:10:58.680 --> 2:11:03.240]  He doubted he could spell their names. And besides, well, no, I was thinking of the
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:07.400]  raceler brothers who was really good friends with an Austin, who I lifted waste with three days a
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:16.280]  week and went deep sea fishing with and camping. And one of them is an engineer. The others,
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:21.960]  a, uh, in fact, let's look up online right now in front of everybody. Look up Nate, Nathan,
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:29.480]  raceler. It's spelled like Roachler, raceler. And Roger, raceler was a UT football player. He was
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:34.520]  two years younger. I mean, here, let's look them up. I said, I said, well, there's the raceler
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:37.480]  brothers. And he goes, how do you spell that? And I said, Oh, I could look it up. And he goes,
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:43.800]  no, that's all right. Cause he didn't want that. He just wanted to make it sound like, oh, you
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:49.960]  know, with, with any of my friends, I couldn't spell their names. See how this is, this is crazy
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:55.480]  mind games from flim flam men who just want to, oh, look, the Chicago business school where the
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:12:00.840]  neocons came from. There's only drug ads in here, except for Chicago business school ad
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:14.440]  ad with the Straussian view of, and it goes on to say, uh, when I asked him, I might look them
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:19.560]  up. He became irritated. He doubted he could spell their names. And besides I'd already taken up too
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:26.440]  much of his time. I turned down 50 or 60 requests for interviews this week, which was true. The
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:31.800]  Obama deception had just come out. Usually we turned down, I don't know, do said three today,
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:37.080]  probably four or five moral come in by tomorrow. Let's let's say five a day, five a day in a week is
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:44.600]  25, 30. So I mean, do the math with seven times five. We're talking about 35 interviews,
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:48.040]  but back then with the, with the Obama deception peaking. Yeah, it was,
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:53.560]  so he doesn't understand that dude. He was saying, I was lying about millions of
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:58.520]  views of the Obama deception till I made him go online. See, that's what I mean. I mean,
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:03.640]  it just, they constantly spew their propaganda, which always turns out to be bull. We tell the
[2:13:03.640 --> 2:13:10.840]  truth and then we're getting attacked. Listen to this. The number sounded wildly inflated.
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:17.720]  He doubted he could spell their names. Besides I already taken up too much of his time.
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:23.400]  I turned down 50 or 60 requests for interviews this week. He wanted me to know the number,
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:28.280]  sounded wildly inflated. Conspiracy theorists have a grandiose view of themselves as heroes
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:34.200]  manning the barricades of civilization at an urgent turning point in history.
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:43.160]  The psychologist held Jones has a Messiah complex. Black contends now blacks, the fake name of the
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:50.600]  potbellied, uh, Austin Chronicle guy who writes editorials saying that Sentra isn't a foreign
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:57.240]  owned company taking over Texas roads. Go to Sentra. Just it's in Spanish. Sentra is a Spanish
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:02.760]  company, but they don't care. They have such contempt for you. They will tell you it's American owned.
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:10.920]  Black contends that I'm have a Messiah complex. Grandiosity is one of the defenses against
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:17.320]  underlying feelings of powerlessness. No, all I talk about is how powerful human beings are.
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:22.120]  Even well-grounded skeptics are prone to connect disparate dots when they feel disempowerment.
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.240]  I sent this guy link after link to government documents and UN documents on population reduction.
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.120]  I mean, here's eco science calling for drugging the water, taking children at birth,
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.720]  reducing the world population written by the White House science are.
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:39.400]  I mean, everybody knows about this. This was in the Associated Press.
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:46.600]  I sent him a whole bunch of stuff just like this. He doesn't care. He says, I'm making it up.
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:51.480]  Look, I'll spend 30 minutes on this properly tomorrow. Watson's doing one. The worst thing is
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:58.120]  at the end, it says, uh, indeed there are no coincidences in Jones world and a scene from
[2:14:58.120 --> 2:15:03.880]  the Obama deception. Jones dives into the belly of the beast. The hotel or purported conspirators
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:10.440]  will be meeting. See, he's, he, he wouldn't agree with me over the phone that I was really at
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:16.120]  Bilderberg and really covered it or that they didn't pull the fire alarm or that we were being
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:21.000]  followed. And I said, no, we were really being followed. And he just said, Oh, you were imagining
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:26.440]  you're being followed. I said, look, buddy, I had FBI guys come in and sit down to me next
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:30.360]  at the hotel. I was staying at and asked if I wanted to attack the state department. He went,
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:38.040]  Oh, sure you did. I mean, you know, this is the type. I mean, it's, it's just, this is what's crazy.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:44.600]  This, but it's not crazy. It's crazy like a Fox. This is a drug ad hundreds of billions of dollars
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:49.560]  a year in this crap. That's all it says about is them defending the takeover of our society.
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:56.440]  Indeed, there are no coincidences in Jones's world. And I talked to this guy, he believed I was
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:16:02.440]  just having a schizophrenic episode in an imaginary hotel, you know, just insanely
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:09.400]  thinking people were following me. Used to, they would just say Bilderberg didn't even exist.
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:16.200]  As he begins a telephone interview, the alarm bell goes off. The bastards have set this up,
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:20.360]  he says, which I had security walk up to me as I'm walking up from the restaurant eating.
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:24.840]  And they go, we don't like people setting off fire alarms. You go to prison. If you do that,
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:28.600]  say that to me and Rob Jacobson. And we went, we're not pulling fire alarms. Thank you. And
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:35.400]  yeah, people try to rob the place. And we were like, and so I go up to my room, close the door,
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:41.560]  coast to coast AM calls. I picked the phone up and the fire alarm goes off. I go downstairs
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.040]  and the head of security with Bilderberg security walks up and goes, I'm going to f and take you
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:55.400]  out Jones. I'm called Jacobson's in here. He's a witness to it. But see, I live in the real world.
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:59.560]  It was all over the Canadian news. I got arrested in Canada. I brought that up to him,
[2:16:59.560 --> 2:17:04.280]  not real. I didn't go to Canada, didn't get arrested. Wasn't in the front page of all their
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:11.160]  papers. You have just dozens of the top papers, national post Toronto star all over the news.
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:16.760]  And I've got my film. Don't say that's grandiosity. I have my film with the newspaper headlines.
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:22.280]  That film is real buddy. But see, it's good. They're denying everything to this level because it's
[2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:27.320]  so asinine when they say none of this exists. And then people find out it does just like Obama's
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:31.800]  people are saying there's no call for national compulsory service. George Soros funded media
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.920]  matters is attacking me saying it's not real. People then click on my site and see the video
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:42.840]  of Obama calling for it and Ronald manual calling for it. Jones says that he's even been visited
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:49.640]  by the FBI and Secret Service, but can't discuss the interviews. Well, since I did this interview
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:53.960]  three months ago, I now I'm not under federal gag order. And you can read the AP and wired
[2:17:53.960 --> 2:17:59.480]  magazine that the FBI and Secret Service were here for threats against government officials and
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:06.040]  police and they subpoenaed the IP addresses and arrested the people. So see little jackass.
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:13.240]  It's real. Okay. Stick that your stupid pipe and smoke it. You're a fool. But then he has it both
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:17.640]  ways. He says it may be that federal agents in fact wanted to evaluate whether he is a threat to
[2:18:17.640 --> 2:18:24.040]  the president. No, they were here wanting me as a witness in the trial and I quash the subpoena
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:31.320]  for that one. That's in the news. Jackass. There's no reason to believe he is, but the
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:36.280]  same can't be said of his listeners. In 2002, Richard McCaslin carrying an arsenal of weapons
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:40.120]  entered the Bohemian Grove of camping ground in California that annually host a meeting
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:44.520]  of the political and business elite. He told authorities he had been planning his commando
[2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:49.640]  raid for a year after he says hearing Jones claim that the ritual infant sacrifice was
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:53.720]  taking place there. He asked me about this and I said, my film is on record that it's an
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:57.880]  effigy of a child and we've never said they're killing a real person. I gave him the video.
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:03.640]  He didn't care. He implies I'm saying it. I explained McCaslin had been in the Marine Corps
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:10.920]  in force recon and had and was obviously out of his gourd and sending me weird hand-drawn comic
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:17.080]  books and that he'd worked at six flags playing the part of Spider-Man and that he tried to come
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:21.560]  around. I'd refused to meet with him. He then moved out to California in what looked like a
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:25.560]  staged event in the middle of winter, dressed up with a bunch of weapons and went out there and
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:31.880]  set fire to a trash can and then waited for the police. Looks like a staged event. But see,
[2:19:31.880 --> 2:19:37.000]  that's all distortion. He knows you don't have all that background so this guy can manipulate you.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.160]  He wants to be a psychologist so we can have power over people. How many psychologists have been
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:46.520]  caught doing weird stuff to their patients? The war continues in a video promoting Obama
[2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:52.360]  deception. Jones urges, we know who they are. We know what they are. We know what has to be done.
[2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:56.840]  Implying I'm calling for violence when I was calling for political peaceful action
[2:19:56.840 --> 2:20:01.320]  right after that in the film. A total deception from this piece of trash.

[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:25.240]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%

[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:27.800]  with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United
[2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:32.120]  States government and interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of
[2:22:32.120 --> 2:22:36.520]  business. The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However,
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:45.160]  the Executive Order still stands unrepealed. Minus has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call 800-686-2237.

[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:39.480]  radio show in London and he is a frequent guest here at goodoldinfowars.com and on the radio
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:46.280]  show and I'm excited that Jesse Ventura's crew is also interviewing him coming up soon for the
[2:24:47.240 --> 2:24:53.240]  new TV show Conspiracy Theory that I'm also in and a consultant on show a lot going on and I'm
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:56.840]  glad I've been introduced to Max Kaiser's big international audience and I'm excited to introduce
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:01.800]  him to our audience. I think it's a great event that's happening. This is a short segment. We'll
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:05.800]  come back in a long one and cover a lot of other issues, but commodities starting to go up, gold
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:12.200]  exploding, the media lying, saying the economy's good, underwear sales are up for men. They say
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:17.800]  that's always an indicator of an economy going up. What do you really see happening with this
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:23.640]  economy? I see the tens of trillions of dollars the banks have hoarded starting to trickle out
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:31.880]  and cause some action, but overall jobless rates, unemployment, the rust belt. I mean,
[2:25:31.880 --> 2:25:37.400]  the real economy, what I see is falling apart. What does Max Kaiser with all of his economic
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:43.000]  acumen and gravitas tell us? The reason underwear sales are up for men is because a lot of men
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:52.360]  are making do-do in their pants. The economy is so bad. They got no job, they got no prospects,
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:56.520]  and they're incompetent. So they get out of the store and they buy some fresh underwear,
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:01.400]  but they can't keep in stock because the economy is so bad. You've got a president who thinks he's
[2:26:01.400 --> 2:26:05.240]  starring in the West Wing part two. We don't even think he knows he's the president. I think
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:08.680]  he's trying to get an Emmy Award and for your time they're going to give him an Emmy Award. He
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:14.600]  won't even know that he was in the White House. It's a complete joke. You've got the capitalism
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:19.800]  is failing. You've got systemic collapse. So naturally, gold is pushing a thousand dollars
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:25.560]  again. And let's talk about gold for a second, Alex Jones, because I was in Germany making a film
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:30.920]  about gold at the Bundesbank, which is the central bank of Germany, which acts more or less as the
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:36.040]  central bank of Europe. We went in there, we talked to them about gold, and they told us that,
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:39.640]  and I mentioned to them, I asked them, where is most of your gold? And they said, well, you know,
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:45.320]  our gold is held in New York, and this created a huge international uproar, which got the attention
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:50.600]  of a lot of gold. Exactly. I saw that. And again, that's just you as a real journalist asking a
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:55.720]  real question. Then you ask New York, and they say Germany's got our gold. Right. Well, what's
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:01.320]  come out? And if you go to sites like the Gold Action Trust Action Committee and other sites
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:08.440]  attract the gold market, Germany has been complicit in this scheme to keep the gold price down.
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:14.120]  And them, along with the Wall Street banks, they lease out or lend gold to be sold in the
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:18.520]  open market with a wink and a nod. And they, because they know that they're going to keep selling
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:24.840]  this market, this gold into the market, to force the price down, to give these banks easier,
[2:27:24.840 --> 2:27:29.160]  riskless profits as part of the collusion between the central banks and the Wall Street banks.
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:34.520]  So this so-called growth you're talking about is all based on market manipulation. These stocks
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:38.120]  like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and these other financial stocks are up big because basically
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:43.400]  the government buying stock for themselves are laundering money. All those tarp funds and all
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:48.440]  those bailout funds that they were on the receiving end after Boston held Congress hostage,
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:52.760]  they now have to figure out how to launder that money, just like any mafia king has to
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:55.960]  launder the money. So they go to the stock market, they buy these bank stocks, they
[2:27:55.960 --> 2:28:00.440]  suck in the public, the public buys into it, CNBC and Jim Cramer stomps up and down, says,
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:03.800]  buy bank stocks, buy the market, the suckers come in again, they launder the money, then they're
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:10.200]  out. So once again the public is being hoodwinked. And is that what Max, Max, Max, you said months
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:15.480]  ago, Bob Chapman said months ago, Ron Paul said months ago, all our experts here said the same
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:23.880]  thing. In fact, six months ago, people like Bob Chapman wrote it on record that they would
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:30.120]  first run the market down to 6,000, then run it back up 10, 11, 12 or even higher as a suckers
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:35.080]  rally and that they would do that by the big central banks dumping all the money they'd stolen
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:39.960]  from taxpayers into the market and that it was completely rigged and that they would then plunge
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:45.640]  it even further. Is the plunging we're seeing the start of that or is this just a hiccup?
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:49.160]  Will it continue to go up before they really rape the slaves?
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:57.320]  Look, the people are on the short end of the stick and on your show, Alex, I have talked
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:02.600]  about the casino gulag economy. About the only way that they're going to keep these suckers rolling
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:08.280]  is to introduce more gambling in the United States and sure enough in Kansas, the heartland of America
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:13.160]  just announced that they're going to start introducing gambling. Why? Because there's no
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:18.120]  other way to stimulate the economy than vice. You know, the mafia makes tons of money selling
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:23.320]  gambling, sex and money laundering and other, you know, murder for hire and these other
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:26.680]  activities. This is what the local government, the municipal government and the federal government
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:30.760]  knows. They always can raise money to get into the gambling business. Now, Kansas is going to go
[2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:36.520]  gambling. That's right. Not only will the state now, as you predicted, allow gambling,
[2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:40.280]  they're going to own it. That's the Associated Press Revenue of Hungary, Kansas, will be owner
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:45.240]  of new casinos. Max Geyser, maxgeyser.com. Here's our guest. I'm Alex Jones. Our websites are

[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:15.320]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.

[2:32:00.680 --> 2:32:05.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:32:05.320 --> 2:32:09.960]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:15.240]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:32:15.240 --> 2:32:20.360]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:25.240]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:29.320]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:32:29.320 --> 2:32:33.480]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:32:33.480 --> 2:32:38.520]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:32:38.520 --> 2:32:43.000]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:49.800]  Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:55.880]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:32:55.880 --> 2:32:59.640]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:32:59.640 --> 2:33:15.880]  Yeah, when I saw this morning, it was Max that emailed it to me, and I appreciate that, Max.
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:21.400]  The Associated Press, and he sent me a bunch of other stories where everything's happening,
[2:33:22.120 --> 2:33:28.040]  now major states are going to own the casinos themselves. I mean, it's for the government,
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:32.600]  same thing with Russia. The government is now just going to own all the vices. That's why
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:37.800]  they've always had laws against vices, so they can tax it and regulate it and control it. A license
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:44.120]  is something, is an authorization to do something that would be illegal. So owning a gun is illegal,
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:48.920]  having a car is illegal, if they make you get a license. That turns it into something illegal.
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:55.400]  But we're shifting towards this and continue, Max Kaiser.
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:34:02.200]  Yeah, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, and Yeltsin, who was then in charge, gave away all
[2:34:02.200 --> 2:34:08.680]  the industries to the Russian oligarchs. Now, in the United States, when the Glass-Steagall Wall
[2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:13.640]  came down, separating the banks and brokers, it took a few years, but now we see the results,
[2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:19.080]  plus a couple of other deregulatory moves that happened since then. But in effect,
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:25.240]  it's the same plan. The nation's wealth is being given away to the nation's oligarchs,
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:32.760]  the American economy is run by oligarchs. And this was done, and this was done in a premeditated
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:38.920]  fashion, and they put the police state in place beforehand, and now try to use it to suppress
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:43.080]  people. Go ahead. Right. I mean, you say the roads in Texas are run by a Spanish company.
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:46.920]  Of course, the roads in Texas are run by a Spanish company. All the tall booth roads,
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:52.200]  all the bridges, all the ports are being sold off to foreign investors in exchange for these massive
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:56.040]  debts that have been run up for years, and there's no possible way to pay them back.
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:03.560]  The total debt and burden of the U.S. is now $70 trillion. The interest on that debt alone
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:09.240]  will never, ever be paid back, even if America puts in 100% of their income as a tax for 10,
[2:35:09.240 --> 2:35:14.280]  20, 30 years. You know, they're never going to pay it back. So the U.S. is left to give foreign
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:20.200]  creditors more and more of America's infrastructure, all of its, you know, what some call selling
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:24.600]  the cow and then buying the milk. Okay, so America's giving away their toll roads, giving away
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:28.040]  their ports, giving away their infrastructure, selling it on the cheap basically in exchange for
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:32.920]  debt forgiveness, and now America's got to pay through the nose to be on their own property,
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:37.480]  to pay their own roads. They're going to be paying foreign creditors, and that deal in Texas for
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:43.400]  the Texas roads is just one example of a trend going coast to coast. In California, the economy
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:47.400]  is technically bankrupt, and they're giving away and selling huge portions of the economy to
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:52.440]  foreign creditors. And it has happening all over the United States because the U.S. isn't too much
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:57.800]  in debt, and nobody in government is saying that the U.S. has to get off its debt addiction,
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:02.120]  which brings me to a very interesting topic, which I want to get into, which is this whole
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:07.400]  healthcare debate, you know, and it's an interesting debate because basically it pits
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:13.160]  two forces in the American economy against each other. There are those in the economy
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:17.640]  that want to charge monopoly pricing for healthcare. That's the oligarchs,
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.080]  which include the insurance company. And then the other side of the coin is, well,
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:27.000]  there's a possibility of paying competitive prices for healthcare. That is that people in
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:30.840]  America would pay a competitive price. There'd be free competition in the health business and
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:35.720]  the insurance industry, so the consumer would benefit from competition. But this debate under
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:40.440]  Obama's watch, and he's been completely asleep on this, is allowing the oligarchs to say, no,
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:45.560]  no, what's the best for America is the oligarch monopoly pricing. So I'm putting a challenge.
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:49.800]  I'm putting a challenge to you, your listeners, and anyone listening. I'm putting up, I'm talking
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:53.320]  to the same people I talked to a couple years ago in London when we were putting together our
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:59.480]  hedge fund. And I'm trying to organize right now a million-dollar payout to Americans,
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:05.640]  a million-dollar payout to the victims of the U.S. health insurance industry.
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:12.280]  All we need to do is get the price of Whole Foods stock. And remember, the CEO of Whole Foods recently
[2:37:12.280 --> 2:37:17.240]  came out and said he was against competitive health pricing. He's for the oligarchs. He's
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:21.240]  for the monarchs. And he proved, proved any idea that Americans should get any kind of
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:26.200]  decent healthcare. If Whole Foods stock, because of this boycott, which is mounting and gaining
[2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:30.440]  speed all over America, is on Facebook and Twitter and all these social networking sites,
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:35.480]  the boycott is exploding. If we can get the share price of Whole Foods down to below a dollar
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:41.160]  a share, it's currently a $28 a share. It's worth about $4 billion. If the boycott can get big
[2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:45.640]  enough to drive the share price to less than a dollar, then my guys in London are prepared to
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:52.120]  give a million dollars away to victims of the American health industry to America directly.
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:56.520]  So, you know, my message to people in America who are complaining about the healthcare situation,
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:37:59.320]  do something about it. Stop complaining. Stop talking to them.
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:05.960]  Max, let me, let me stop here for you. Let me, let me stop you here because what the establishment
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:11.480]  does is they always have false debates about issues that don't even resemble reality. And so,
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:17.080]  I agree with you to a point here, but I want to be specific and find out exactly what you're saying.
[2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:25.800]  Yes, we have more and more a monopoly healthcare where big insurance companies and big mega
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:34.040]  healthcare businesses. Doctors are paid about half what they were per capita for inflation
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:39.480]  in the 1970s. They're certainly being squeezed. The people are getting less. The 30 million
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:45.160]  illegal aliens have bankrupt a lot of the state and county and city systems. That's another factor.
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:51.160]  So, when we hear this healthcare debate, all Obama's doing is trying to give liability protection
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:58.520]  to insurance companies, HBO's and big medical firms and has nothing to do with even socialized
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:04.680]  healthcare, whether you're for that or against it. So, then the left all piles on supporting
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:10.600]  the single payer. When we're not even debating that, the question is why do Americans pay three
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:16.280]  times when anybody else does for drugs? Why are we known as the moron schmucks that get charged
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.440]  more for healthcare when we did have the best healthcare in the world? So, I don't think the
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:25.560]  British socialists wait two years for a brain tumor surgery. And I've seen Tony Blair admit
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:31.400]  they do that on the house of floor on the comments floor. I know it goes on. So, we're not talking
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:37.560]  about that system. None of us want that. But the issue is big corporations have come in.
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:42.200]  Here's an example. My dad's a dentist. Most of these big dental offices now that are big chains
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:50.280]  only take what they call capitation. And that means that big companies come in and pay a company
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:54.920]  millions of dollars to say they'll take people on their plan, but then you get reduced care when
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:39:59.720]  you come in for it. So, Max Kaiser, what I'm trying to say here to you and my question is,
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:03.880]  what are we dealing with here? I mean, what are you saying because the healthcare debate was...
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:09.320]  Okay. Let me connect the dots. Okay. Let me connect the dots. We know that America's energy
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:15.000]  policies are written by the energy industry. Okay. Would you say that's a fair statement?
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:18.600]  Yes. When Jamie came into office in 2000, he had that secret meeting with Enron and the whole
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:24.440]  industry. And they wrote America's energy policies, which included by some accounts
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:28.920]  invading other countries. But the industry was writing the energy policy, not the administration.
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:33.320]  First statement, I think so. How about America's defense contracting business and America's foreign
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:38.280]  policy? And is that being written, in fact, by the same mercenary firms that stand to benefit
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:43.400]  from a corporate perspective? Yes. Okay. Who's writing America's banking policies?
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:47.640]  Is it the banking industry? Yes. Of course, it's the banking industry. There's no one
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:50.920]  representing the people in the writing these policies. It's the banking industry that's
[2:40:50.920 --> 2:40:55.320]  writing all these policies to benefit the banks. So, you know, connect the dots. Why should the
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:41:01.080]  health industry be different? The health industry, all the policies are being written by the health
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:05.400]  industry. That's the main point. That's point number one. Exactly. So the reform we hear we're
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:10.680]  getting, either way, the Republican version is one monopoly, the Democratic version is another
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:16.840]  monopoly, either way, no matter what you call for, it's going to be written by the lobbyist and
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:21.080]  going to be something completely different. That's why I say we want nothing out of government.
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:26.280]  We ought to pay them just to stop writing laws. Okay. So listen, if we're saying that
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:31.400]  soliciting the government and petitioning the government is a waste of time, then,
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:36.360]  you know, we can agree that that's probably true. And what I'm suggesting is that anyone in the
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:42.120]  country, in the United States who wants to push back in a meaningful way, if you boycott this
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:48.920]  company, whole foods to sufficient to drive the stock price down to below a dollar a share,
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:53.560]  my guys in London are prepared to give a million dollars in cash to the victims of
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.680]  America's health care industry. That means they'll all get one dollar a piece. Well,
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:03.880]  first of all, it shows that the people have the ability to push back. Okay. Well, that's less
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:07.720]  this out here because you've never, you've never done anything like this on my show before. I got
[2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:13.640]  to be honest with you. The owner of Whole Foods is a listener of this show. He lives in Austin.
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:21.960]  We have confirmed it. Isn't it possible Max that he just disagreed with the government takeover?
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:28.760]  And that certainly was in the bill of health care. And he's saying people should just be healthier.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:32.840]  I mean, and we should eat healthier food, which I think is important. I mean, I mean,
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:36.920]  I agree with you on a lot of stuff, but I'm not sure where this is going. I mean,
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:41.240]  if they're able to bully because the same George Soros outfits that are bullying,
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:47.000]  you know, everybody else about free speech and saying, if you disagree with Obama,
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:54.280]  you're a racist. The same crew is saying destroy Whole Foods. Yeah, but why parse our words? We
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:58.600]  know that corporations, they're all connected to the banking industry, including Whole Foods.
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:03.560]  It's a four billion dollar company. He's out there trying to parse his words and play both
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:07.720]  sides of the fence. And he's playing to an institutional investor audience. He's also
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:11.320]  trying to play into a retail audience. And what I'm saying is we can agree that the government
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:16.600]  is not there who's going to step up to the plate for the people. The people have the ability to
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:22.680]  affect a massive dislocation and that stock price. Okay, he's probably listening right now.
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:27.160]  A million dollars. Stop, stop. The victims of American health industry. You know,
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:30.920]  if they can get that stock price to below a buck a share. Now I realize you're,
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:35.160]  you've got Austin, it's a big presence in Austin. And there's, I'll tell you what,
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:38.280]  I'll tell you, have Mackie, who's the CEO of Whole Foods, come on my show.
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:42.280]  Well, I'll tell you this. I have confirmed he's a listener every week.
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:46.760]  And I told my guys just last week, I want to get Mackie on. I've,
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:52.280]  had him come on my show. I mean, I want him to tell the world why he thinks Americans shouldn't
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:56.920]  have decent healthcare. Tell the world, it'll be laughed out of, you know, he's going to be laughing
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:02.680]  at his face. He only America can see you like him get up and pause it. That Americans shouldn't
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:07.720]  deserve healthcare to cheap at a price that they can afford. It's absolutely unconscionable.
[2:44:07.720 --> 2:44:10.440]  But is that what he said in the Wall Street Journal? I mean,
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:15.160]  he was saying he didn't like this Obama plan that was written by special interest.
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:21.400]  Well, I'm saying he has to pay me on my show. Okay. I don't want to put you in the middle.
[2:44:21.400 --> 2:44:25.320]  Okay. Have him come on my show and I'll play him. I'll rip him apart.
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:28.680]  I'll, you know, verbally on my show. And you know, that's enough on that. But I'm saying
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:33.080]  that if the people out there want to push back against what they consider to be a corporate
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:37.320]  controlled policies that are, they're the victim of, they're getting no savings,
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:42.440]  they've got no pensions, they've got no jobs, wages are going down, the economy is going into
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:46.680]  the mud. And the people are saying, what do we do? What do we do? And I'm saying, I'm giving you a
[2:44:46.680 --> 2:44:51.480]  possibility. Break out this company down to the stock below a dollar share. I've got a million
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:55.640]  dollars. I'm trying to raise in London to give to victims of the American healthcare industry
[2:44:56.280 --> 2:45:00.600]  and move it that way. And I did this. I had a campaign like this in London two or three years
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:05.000]  ago. It became international news. We were talking about Coca-Cola and the hedge fund
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:09.560]  talking about Coca-Cola. And there's a legal opinion written about it. They said this is an
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:17.640]  absolute legal method to impose the risk associated with Max, Max, Max, Max. I mean,
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:22.200]  I'm not here attacking you. I don't have a dog in the fight with Whole Foods. I shopped there
[2:45:22.200 --> 2:45:30.440]  sometimes and, you know, read what the guy said. And I just, I see this bullying going on where
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:36.840]  I have media matters saying, I'm a liar. There is no plan for forced national service. Now,
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:41.000]  you're an informed guy. You know, they've introduced the bills. You know, Rahm Emanuel's
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:46.040]  called for that. And, and here's what I'm talking about. Here's a short clip of Chris.
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:49.720]  He's praying for time. All they're doing is they're just trying to play out the clock. They
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:54.440]  want to get rid of Obama and bring in, you know, God, who knows, Dick Cheney again. They're just
[2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:58.600]  trying to marginalize Obama for as long as they possibly can. And the United States people need
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:04.200]  to realize this is probably the last 36 months they'll have. You know, as your film talks about
[2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:09.480]  fall of the republic. It's not a meadow. It's not, it's not a, you know, a stretch. This is it.
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:15.480]  This is the last 36 months. Do you want to stand up and you want to fight for your economic freedom
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:20.520]  against corporate jihadists? Or do you want to die in the mud? Now that's a simple question.
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:26.200]  No, I know. I know, but Max, I'm, I'm trying to understand here. What would you do with healthcare
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:35.640]  then? Well, the healthcare is obvious. It's like any other business. You want to get the best price
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:39.800]  for your healthcare. There's nothing mysterious about it. Drugs cost money. Doctors cost money.
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:44.760]  But that's not a free market to have Obama waddle in. Do you want the wholesale price? Or do you
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:48.680]  want the retail price? Do you want to pay the Tiffany prices and get crappy healthcare? Or do
[2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:53.160]  you want to pay Walmart prices and get healthcare that works for you? It's just a matter of pricing.
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:57.240]  You know, healthcare is nothing mysterious about it. You know, they talk about European
[2:46:57.240 --> 2:47:01.720]  health system and they talk about the system in Britain and the system in France. Basically,
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:07.000]  boils down to this. You pay a low, you know, yearly amount of money when you break it all down
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:10.760]  and you don't have to think about healthcare. People in France don't even think about healthcare
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:15.720]  because it's not even an issue because it's just totally within their life. They don't sit around
[2:47:15.720 --> 2:47:20.920]  debating healthcare. They saw that mystery 60 years ago. The Americans still talk about
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:26.280]  healthcare 60 years after World War II. It shows that they, completely, there's the Pupu
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:30.600]  Caca phase. You know, there's Jesse Ventura's show. They want me to fly to New York to talk to
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:34.440]  Jesse Ventura. I'm like, I don't want to fly to New York. I don't want to fly to Calcutta. Do you
[2:47:34.440 --> 2:47:39.080]  think I want to go to that third world cesspool? I don't want to talk to anybody satellite. I don't
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:43.480]  want to go to that ugly place. I live in France, man. They have a quality of life here.
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:53.240]  Now, Max, Max, Max, there are a lot of Canadians, Max, there are a lot of Canadians and Brits
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:48:02.520]  that do fly over here to get their healthcare. I'm glad you love us so much. Hey, anyways,
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:07.480]  it is kind of becoming like Mexico or a third world country here with the police and things,
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:15.000]  but, but I want to play you. Chris Matthews involved in social terrorism. Here it is. This is
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:21.640]  Chris Matthews. People willing to allow Barack Obama and his stars to tax us into bankruptcy
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:28.440]  while Michelle Obama and her 26 aides live it up on our door. Wow. Let me go to Jonathan
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:32.520]  Morgan. And it seems to me I will, when I heard people going after the first lady and the number
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:37.160]  of staff people they have, it sounds racist to me. It sounds like people are maybe have a Black
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:42.200]  First Lady. That's what it sounds like. There's no question that that is Chris, part of it,
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:46.200]  with a certain element in the conservative base in Texas. Just the fact that we have
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:51.080]  a Black First Lady. That's enough. So there you go. You're like, why are we letting them frame the
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.080]  debate? Why are we letting the major media frame the debate? No, I know. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:48:58.760]  Why do we care what the mainstream is framing the debate or the insurance industry is framing
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:04.840]  the debate? I understand Whole Foods. Okay, they've got an interest in, in some of the media properties
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:08.360]  in Texas. Okay. They're, they're marketing in Texas. That's, that's another story. That's why
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:12.520]  I'm saying come onto my show, CEO of Whole Foods. I talked to an international audience. You try
[2:49:12.520 --> 2:49:15.560]  to justify your comments in the Wall Street Journal to an international audience. They're
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:18.600]  going to be laughed out of the, out of the show. I know I'm just going to buy yours.
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:25.560]  Hey, hold on a minute, Max. What did that last statement mean about Whole Foods having
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:30.760]  interest in Texas media markets? So come on your show because I said I was going to try to get
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:35.880]  him on this show. They're an advertiser, right? You're trying that. No, no, they're not an
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:39.560]  advertiser. I misunderstood. I thought you said they're an advertiser and I, and I respect that
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:43.480]  because, okay, but I just thought that. No, they're not. No, no, no, no, no. I said, I've,
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:48.520]  I live in Austin. So we're Whole Foods started that there's, there's a couple of Whole Foods
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:55.240]  in Austin. I was saying, I don't have a dog in the fight. I'm not connected to Whole Foods
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:02.760]  or the Saudi Arabians or ABC or Scientology or anything else or the Catholic Church or
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:08.600]  anything. I'm an independent person. So before the new rumor starts that I, that I am Mackie
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:14.280]  and I pull rubber mask off at night or that I'm Bill Hicks. Have you seen that one or that I'm
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:18.920]  the guy that Alex, I mean, the comparison of Bill Hicks is enough is a compliment. I mean,
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:24.200]  Bill Hicks is a brilliant social commentator. He was more than just a comedian. He really
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:28.440]  understood this, the, what was happening in the U S and during the first Bush administration,
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:32.120]  the first call. I mean, to be compared to Bill Hicks, who I believe was also from Texas,
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:39.160]  is a huge compliment. No, they say I am him. They say I am Bill Hicks that I stage my death.
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:44.680]  Well, you know, you know, the thing is Bill Hicks is that guy Dennis Leary,
[2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:49.080]  he thinks he's Bill Hicks and that guy should be, uh, you know, he stole Bill Hicks's act.
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:52.040]  Yeah. Well, Dennis Leary really is a sack of crap. Since we're,
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:55.960]  yeah, I agree on that. We agree on that. Since we're on the scatological, uh,
[2:50:55.960 --> 2:51:22.280]  bandwagon here today. My third blossom over right back.

[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:12.760]  My new film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:16.600]  western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:22.360]  as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:27.240]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:33.480]  the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:39.240]  secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[2:52:39.240 --> 2:52:44.040]  guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:44.040 --> 2:52:49.480]  Terror Storm is a film and everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get your copy today

[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:13.080]  nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve. Experience is the best
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:17.320]  teacher but that means time. To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:22.600]  lived it. Author Linda Runyon is that teacher. Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:27.880]  The DVD gives you a 3-hour overview of her world directly from her. The book gives you an in-depth
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:32.760]  reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need, and her wild cards are your portable
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:37.080]  summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork. This 3-pronged learning system will take you from
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:42.760]  spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years. Folks, I can vouch that Linda's
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:50.360]  the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it. So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-518-FREE.

[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  I'm looking at the fall of the Republic article that Paul Watson wrote. It says personalities
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:26.840]  who appear in the movie. Gerald Salente, Alan Watt, Jesse Ventura, climatologist Tim Ball,
[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:31.480]  economist John Perkins, Oath Keepers, Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny, Webster Garbley, Bob Bowman,
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:37.400]  Wayne Madsen, George Humphrey. We need Max Kaiser in there. So please ask him to add Max Kaiser.
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:47.160]  And there's a bunch of other people too who are in the film. And so yes, Max is in the trailer
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:56.280]  for it. He's a big part of the film. Guys, Kaiser, have you had a lot of coffee today?
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:02.040]  I want to do a shout out to your crew. Okay. Your crew is the hardest working crew in radio.
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:07.480]  Okay. And we're talking on the break. What you need to do to, you know, show your gratitude.
[2:55:07.480 --> 2:55:11.640]  Okay. You got to show your crew some gratitude by, you know, what we discussed during the break.
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:16.280]  Yes. Yes. Anyway, listen, Alex,
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:22.200]  we got to talk about this Pirate My Film thing. Tell me about it. Yes, please.
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:31.000]  Okay. PirateMyFilm.com. I was on your show last time and I mentioned the site and I want you
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.240]  to go on the site and open an account. It takes 30 seconds and you list a movie that you're trying
[2:55:37.240 --> 2:55:44.200]  to raise money for from the Pirates. This is the Pirate Futures Exchange. So you say, let's say
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:51.800]  you need $50,000 for a film, you get people to give you $5 today and then when you go make your film,
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:56.200]  you deliver a copy of the film. But not only do they get a copy of the film,
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:02.280]  but you cut them in to any advertising that you might get from your film. It's called the Pirate
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:08.840]  Yield. So the idea is like sharing the booty. Yeah. It's sharing the booty. So your film
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:12.840]  for all the Republic, which is coming out on October 21, which I'll be talking about on
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:18.360]  international markets and various outlets all over the world. You know, that film is going to get
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:25.240]  20, 30, 40 million views. That means advertising. Now, if you all had shared in the financing of
[2:56:25.240 --> 2:56:29.880]  that film with your listeners, they would get some of that advertising money back to them at
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:38.120]  PirateMyFilm.com. I realize it might not be as sexy as a garden and a can, but it's the joint.
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:43.800]  You got to check it out. Oh, Kaiser, you're out of control. Interesting. I'll have to,
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:46.920]  I'll have to look at that. I noticed somebody already made a dummy Alex Jones account that
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:51.000]  is not my account on there, but I will look into PirateMyGardenInTheCan.com.
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:57.560]  And it takes 30 seconds to start a film. You say the Alex Jones untitled, how do you crew do it?
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:03.320]  Untitled Alex Jones film, whatever the budget is, how much is your last film? By the way,
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:10.120]  also let me make this point about you, is that you're entirely financed by cash and you don't
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:15.400]  actually use any debt financing. So when people come against Alex Jones, they got to realize
[2:57:15.400 --> 2:57:20.360]  that because you're honest about the banking system, you can't go down to Wall Street and get
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:24.840]  a 10 or 15 or 20 million dollar loan to build a movie studio. You got to do it the whole
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:30.120]  fat, the old school way. You got to get the listeners one by one by one, cash, money, bombs,
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:35.080]  anywhere you can do it. That's the Texas way. That's the Alex Jones way. That's the real way.
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:41.320]  Well, I've been told it's strange, but no, we, we have no debt. We, everything is paid for.
[2:57:41.320 --> 2:57:45.000]  Because no one's going to lend you any money because you're a pariah. You think Citibank
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:49.480]  or JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs are going to loan Alex Jones 50 million dollars to make movies,
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:54.200]  you know, with what we say about them on your show? No. So you got to go to the public.
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:57:59.400]  So piratemyfilm.com, it says to hell with them studio financing, to hell with Wall
[2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:02.840]  Street. We're taking the media back. We're going to finance it. We're going to get paid to
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:08.920]  finance it. We don't need them. Well, something you talk about is we could pre-sell product
[2:58:08.920 --> 2:58:13.720]  placement in our films, but then we couldn't sell very much. We have to sell it for a lot,
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:19.320]  you know, for what it costs us because we do implant in the web versions some ads
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:25.880]  to try to get some of the money back. Yeah. Well, the reason we have had success is our
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:30.760]  great listeners by the videos, by the books at info wars.com and they're pretty low budget.
[2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:37.560]  I mean, my biggest budget film, which is fall, the Republic is going to be about 160, 170 grand
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:44.440]  and most films cost 100,000. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:22.840]  All right, Max Kaiser is our guest for another 15 minutes. Then we've got Wayne Madsen coming
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:29.560]  on max. I wanted to get into some other subjects here. You heard me when you were on hold for a
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:35.800]  few minutes getting into psychology today attacking me. And I mean, it is whole cloth
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:42.840]  baloney. It implies I'm estranged from my parents that I know no one that I'm a liar that I'm
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:51.320]  delusional that I'm calling for people to carry out acts of violence. I mean, the system don't
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:58.040]  they understand they're discrediting themselves just with their wholesale line? Well, you know,
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:03.480]  psychiatrists remember Hannibal Lecter was a psychiatrist. So that's about as credible a
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:08.040]  representation of that industry as you're going to find anybody who listens to the psychiatry
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:14.680]  industry might as well be going on a day with Hannibal Lecter. Well, I mean, this whole thing
[3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:23.320]  is an ad for mind altering drugs. The editors know the editor looks like she's had her soul
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:31.880]  sucked out here. I mean, these are the I just get amazed by people this deceptive, just a crew of
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:38.280]  talk about piratical people. I mean, do you agree with me that it really has become just a ruling class
[3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:42.360]  that wants to say everybody's mentally ill so they can manage our lives and force druggists
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:49.960]  in a THX1138 system? Look, let's see the oligarchy we talked about before and it extends to these
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:54.120]  rights industries and the health industry and the drug industry is an industry that's being
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:59.320]  allowed to write policies for their own benefit. And if they've got psychiatrists and psychoanalysts,
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:04.600]  remember in the torture in Guantanamo Bay and these other areas in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:09.480]  the American Psychiatric Association was actually having people there oversee the torture.
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:13.400]  They were actually witnessing the torture. Is that the role of a doctor to oversee torture?
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:18.680]  So they're totally out of bounds in their industry. They've been discredited by their
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:24.280]  participation in torture in these places and they know when to listen to them and obviously
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:28.920]  they have an interest in selling drugs and to keep people as mentally unstable and as
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:36.680]  incapable of forming rational thought and opinions as possible. So to be, again, to be
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:40.440]  criticized by them, it only means you're doing the right thing. Of course, you're going to attract
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:45.000]  the attention from that industry because what you're saying is going to possibly take people off
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:49.400]  drugs and that would cut into their profits. So of course, you're going to be attacked. I mean,
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:54.360]  I don't know why I spend more than five seconds on it. Those people are just frontmen and pitchmen
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:59.320]  for the drug industry. If someone's looking to show they're not on mind-altering substances,
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:06.040]  it's because you have shown them the way toward a free thought environment that doesn't need to
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:12.200]  be told by the drug industry what to think. So you're cutting into their profits. Anytime
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:18.040]  you cut into the industry's profits, you're going to be targeted by that industry. If you come out
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.680]  and say that the banking industry is holding Congress's hostage for a bailout, then the
[3:03:22.680 --> 3:03:27.320]  banking industry is going to come out and smear you publicly. When I last finally did this campaign
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:31.880]  against Coca-Cola two years ago, the one I just described to you with Whole Foods, we got this
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:37.320]  guy all over America. They wrote smear campaign. If you look it up, Coca-Cola hedge fund, you'll
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:41.080]  see that they were calling me all kinds of vicious names because I was actually threatening their
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:44.360]  profit centers. If you threaten their profit centers and their profit centers are all based
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:49.720]  on monopoly profits and oligarchal profits, they're going to come after you. That's how it's
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:55.480]  night follows day. But as long as people are supporting cash on cash, the expansion of the
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:04:00.840]  Alex Domain, Alex Jones domain, then obviously the people are with you because if they weren't
[3:04:00.840 --> 3:04:07.320]  with you, your domain would not be expanding as it is. Yeah, it's just creepy to have George Soros
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:14.120]  and the Republicans and Psychology Today and the Wall Street Journal and just all attacking
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:20.280]  me. And I know it's because we're having success. It's just, it's creepy. Okay, but Soros, okay,
[3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:25.880]  let me tell you something about Soros. He's a pure, pure hedge fund. He's a pure hedge funded
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:34.520]  and hedge funds are a free floating force in the financial universe. They will go wherever they make
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:39.560]  money. And that's my point. In other words, if enough people boycotted Whole Foods to drive
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:46.680]  a stock price down, George Soros would be selling short Whole Foods for us. Because he's a political
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:54.120]  atheist. He'll he'll just a total pragmatist. So why don't we use hedge funds to leverage our ideas
[3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:58.360]  instead of having the government use hedge funds to leverage their ideas? The hedge funds are
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:04.920]  ever going to be made. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[3:05:04.920 --> 3:05:09.720]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:15.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:20.360]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:24.760]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:29.640]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:05:29.640 --> 3:05:34.120]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:05:34.120 --> 3:05:39.160]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[3:05:39.160 --> 3:05:44.920]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.

[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:32.280]  Max, we're trying to get on your, uh, part of my film side. It's crashed. So, uh, a lot of the listeners
[3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:40.840]  are checking that out. We're out in beta. So, you know, uh, I figured it would crash. I got to get,
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:46.760]  yeah, it's in beta. So, okay. Sorry about that. But, um, you know, it's going to, uh, as I said,
[3:08:46.760 --> 3:08:52.040]  the point is that people can, uh, if the pilot futures market, you can raise money for independent
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:57.960]  films and, um, you can do so by sharing the revenues of pirate yield, pirate sales, as we were just
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:01.960]  talking about, with the people who were helping you finance the film. So, you're bypassing Hollywood,
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:07.080]  you know, Hollywood. I've, you know, Hollywood is another monopoly in America that does not
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:13.240]  doing anybody any good. Yeah. The only problem with your model is all these, all these weasels
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:18.760]  out there will say they're part of your film now. That's why I couldn't be part of something like that,
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:24.440]  at least in your early stages, because people would come invest in it just to claim they had a stake
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:29.080]  in it to mess it up. I mean, have you ever dealt with infiltration, Max? Oh yeah, but let me explain
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:33.400]  something to you. First of all, these are not investments. Okay. People are pre-buying a copy.
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:37.960]  They are pre-buying a copy. So, anyone who wants to buy a copy is giving you the order to buy the
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:43.240]  copy and giving you the money for the copy today. Okay. So, they're going to get a copy of the film.
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:48.040]  So, it's like on Amazon and getting something. Now, the fact is you can share as part of the
[3:09:48.040 --> 3:09:53.080]  revenues with those people who pre-buy a copy, but they're not obligated to. You have the option to,
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:57.240]  and their expectation is that they may get nothing because, so this is not an investment.
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:02.280]  It's not an SEC regulated investment. It's like you buy a pack of cigarettes and you get a coupon,
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:07.080]  and the coupon might be worth something. Here, you buy, you pre-buy a copy of your film,
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:11.960]  and you're going to give them a coupon. So, it's almost like a political action or supporting
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:16.120]  alternative film outside the existing corporate model. Now, I understand what you're doing. That
[3:10:16.120 --> 3:10:20.200]  makes a lot of sense. Very good idea, Max. Okay. In the few minutes we've got left with you,
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:25.320]  briefly, because I respect your opinion on this, what do you see happening in the next month,
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:30.200]  two months, you know, five months, six months a year with the economy, as people see that
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:37.720]  Main Street is still collapsing at an accelerated rate, while the media says green shoots, Valhalla,
[3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:41.560]  stock market up. I mean, where do you see this going?
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:49.480]  The de-leveraging is the word to keep in mind. De-leveraging is the term used to describe
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:57.320]  banks that need to get rid of their bad assets, and the banks have many, many more trillions
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:11:02.600]  of dollars worth of bad assets than the trillions of dollars that the government is throwing at
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:09.000]  the banks. Now, in 2008, for example, you had a lot of people on your show who talked about
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:12.520]  inflation because they said that the government was going to throw trillions and trillions of
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:16.200]  dollars at these bad banks, and that trillions of dollars were going to enter the economy
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:21.400]  in the form of price inflation. Well, it didn't happen. Why? Because the amount of trillions
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:26.280]  of dollars that have been thrown at the banks is not as great as the many, many trillions of
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:32.360]  dollars of bad toxic debt that have yet to be revealed. The net result of that is actually,
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:38.360]  in 2008, had been deflation, you know, shockingly enough. Now, the good news about deflation,
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:44.680]  by the way, is that gold bullion does well in both deflation and inflation. It does well during
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:49.400]  economic, extreme economic stress periods, and that's the play for gold bullion. Forget about
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:54.120]  gold bullion in terms of an inflation play or deflation play. Think about it in terms of an
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:59.800]  economic systemic banking failure play, and that has yet to be played out. The banking sector has
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:07.080]  yet to collapse due to the implosion of hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives and bad
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:13.400]  debt, and the fact that simply by Obama putting a few band-aids over the situation, the cash for
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:18.920]  clunker scheme, all that does is defer the problem. You know, people who owned a car outright for
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:27.000]  cash now have a monthly car payment, so all they did was increase the debt. They try to solve that
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:32.360]  by increasing the debt. So the debt payment is still very high. The global creditors are still,
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:37.320]  you know, looking to America. I think the trend for Americans is that they have to understand
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:42.120]  that the U.S. government is forced to sell off more and more of the American infrastructure,
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:46.920]  tolls, roads, as you find in Texas that you talked about on your show, ports,
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:52.920]  and other vital infrastructure has to be sold to foreigners and to forgive the debt,
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:56.360]  which means that the Americans are going to be living in a country that they themselves
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:13:04.200]  do not own. But then meanwhile, Cintra came in through its Zachary Australian arm and bought
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:11.720]  up over 100, it was 144 local newspapers on the trans-Texas corridor routes to shut them down
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:16.280]  from criticizing. That's how much money they've got. They spent hundreds of millions doing that
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:21.640]  by these little papers. Then they have the Austin Chronicle write hoax articles saying it's not
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:29.000]  Spanish owned. Well, they did the policies for media are again written by the media industry.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:34.680]  You know, here's a hot button topic for you. This hot button topic is what was the how was it
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:39.080]  described? What was it called? Not equal access, but there was a law for a while ago,
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:43.320]  balance through balance access or equal access. You probably know the phrase,
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:47.080]  but I'm trying to think of it. When both, you know, they got rid of it under Reagan.
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:51.880]  When both they were given both sides were given the chance to comment on a topic.
[3:13:51.880 --> 3:13:59.800]  And then what's it called? Fair Fair. I forget what it is, but Reagan got rid of this because
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:05.000]  basically he's toutowing to get to the media industry. You know, let me make another point.
[3:14:05.560 --> 3:14:12.360]  How come you're not getting subsidies and payments from guys like Glenn Beck, who simply
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:19.720]  take your emotion that you have demonstrated you can have on a public media platform and then use
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:26.520]  it to sell his agenda. He should be paying you a monthly residual on basically what you pioneered,
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:34.760]  which is this very honestly over emotional type of presentation that Glenn Beck simply has stolen
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:39.320]  and he uses it to put forward the Fox News agenda. And that's outrageous. You know,
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:42.920]  he should be paying you every month. He should be paying all your life bills, all your parking
[3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:48.120]  bills. You should be paying you out because he's a piece of fake copies of moron. Well,
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:52.600]  I tell you this in closing, Max, and I can't wait to get you back up with us and also be on your
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:59.000]  new TV show that I have talked to people at Fox and they admit that they are imitating us. They
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:03.960]  are copying us on their internet shows. They're even using the same video backgrounds we use.
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:12.680]  It's very bizarre. And Beck does do a copy of me, but then he twist it. Yeah, he's exactly because
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:17.640]  they, in other words, you pioneered this entire space of user supported films and documentaries
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:23.160]  that go on the internet. Now everybody's doing it. You invented it. You have a way of doing your show,
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:28.920]  which Glenn Beck tries to imitate, but push the Fox agenda, which is completely dubious and false
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:34.120]  and counter to what you're talking about. They even use the same video filter for guests that we
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:39.320]  first used. It's actually scary. You should have gone back for defamation or for ripping you off
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:44.040]  from trying to claim you. You know, the guys should be paying you quoting fees every month.
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:48.440]  You know, the Fox News want to get their own shows and their own presenters. Why do they have to rip
[3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:52.920]  off Alex Jones? Why would more doctors have any money? You can't hire regular presenters. You can't
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:58.840]  hire a real talent. He's got to hire these bozos. You know, it's shocking. And, you know, Jesse
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:03.400]  Ventura, let's face it, his new show, it's going to be a great show. I'm sure, but who pioneered
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:09.000]  the way for that show? Alex Jones. You know, I mean, you redefine media in America and
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:11.640]  you know, the mainstream media keeps saying, Oh, it's not going to work.
[3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:15.960]  Well, Max, you don't know how right you are. I was talking to Ventura about six months ago.
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:20.600]  No, it was, it was, it was almost a year ago. It was last October when he was here and he said,
[3:16:20.600 --> 3:16:25.720]  yeah, I'm doing a new show called conspiracy American conspiracy. And then on air, I said,
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:30.760]  that's funny. Jesse watched this and I showed him the trailer for a TV show that was pitched two
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:36.440]  years before for me called American conspiracy. So they changed the name. He didn't know that.
[3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:43.480]  He didn't know he'd been pitched my show. They pitched him a new show and they changed the name
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:47.960]  to conspiracy theory. And now they have changed it the way Jesse had the idea of he'll go out and
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:53.320]  judge conspiracy theory. So it's not really, but the zenith of it was that. And that's what scary
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:17:00.040]  is to realize that I have trailblazed and pioneered unknowingly so much of what's happened. But you've
[3:17:00.040 --> 3:17:05.320]  also pioneered a lot of media activism and ideas in your own right. And I think that's a message
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:11.720]  to everybody else that, that they can pioneer new ideas and new thoughts by just getting out there
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:18.840]  and doing it. Yeah. Well, the pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their back. You know, the pioneers,
[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:22.680]  they go across the country and they open it up to trailblazers for the rest of the country.
[3:17:22.680 --> 3:17:25.880]  You know, they're the ones that get the arrows in the back. They're the ones that die on a trail.
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:29.800]  You know, and then the people who come later say, oh, this is great. What a fantastic trail.
[3:17:29.800 --> 3:17:36.600]  And unfortunately as a pioneer, I have no choice. And I can't, I just can't stay static and watch
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:42.360]  these lame mimics and clowns and their duels over there at Fox News and these other media outlets.
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:47.000]  Continue to rip people off and serve it up with their monopoly pricing schemes and they
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  infiltrate the news. They don't give any kind of balance reporting whatsoever. They are as
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:56.120]  responsible for the health catastrophe and the war catastrophe and the banking catastrophe.
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:01.320]  You know, CNBC has got to be held responsible. James Kramer has got to be held responsible.
[3:18:01.320 --> 3:18:06.440]  This guy is a financial terrorist, James Kramer. Think of all the money he's blown out of people
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:11.880]  that counts going on TV every day, dancing and, when I was a stockbroker in 1982, okay,
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:16.600]  it was illegal to put a color photograph in a perspective because they thought it was too enticing.
[3:18:16.600 --> 3:18:21.560]  Here we are in 2009, James Kramer is practically doing a strip tease on a strip pole, you know,
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:26.760]  showing a little fight and doing his little come on dance. You know, where's the Christian
[3:18:26.760 --> 3:18:31.480]  right about that? James Kramer, it looks like he is. Well, no, no, he gets you all emotional and
[3:18:31.480 --> 3:18:35.560]  it's mad money, but it's like it's crazy Eddie or something. But let me ask you this in closing
[3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:40.440]  and then we've got Wayne Mads coming up with some breaking news on the CIA, always breaking big news.
[3:18:42.520 --> 3:18:46.520]  When do you see the sucker rally ending then if it is a sucker rally?
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:52.920]  It's not just not tradable. You know, it don't trade this rally thinking you're going to get in
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:57.960]  and out. You know, just stick to your core positions, which are gold bullion gold bullion has been
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:04.360]  averaging 20% a year for five or six years now. Last year was up 5% even during the catastrophe
[3:19:04.360 --> 3:19:08.760]  of 2008. Just stick to your core positions. If you want to get actively involved in this market,
[3:19:08.760 --> 3:19:13.400]  do what I'm telling you, which is to get involved in this boycott Whole Foods and encourage George
[3:19:13.400 --> 3:19:17.880]  Soros and each other hedge funds to sell short Whole Foods and to drive that stock price down to
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:22.280]  below a buck a share. And I've got people in London with a million bucks to give to the victims of
[3:19:22.280 --> 3:19:26.600]  America's health care industry based on that stock price going to below. And what you have an article
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:31.560]  with the details of what you're talking about at MaxKaiser.com. It'll be, it's basically the same
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:35.720]  thing I did two years ago at Coca-Cola. If you look up MaxKaiser, Coca-Cola and the
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:40.600]  Carla Bank Hedge Fund. So you haven't even put this out in press release yet. You're talking
[3:19:40.600 --> 3:19:46.840]  about it here first. I'm breaking it on your show. Uh-oh. All right. Hey Max, let me see
[3:19:46.840 --> 3:19:51.160]  about here in the break. And we got Wayne Madsen coming up with a lot of key news straight ahead
[3:19:51.160 --> 3:20:03.560]  right here on GCN Radio Network. There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California,
[3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:08.280]  who owns one of our affiliate radio stations. He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:13.080]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job
[3:20:13.080 --> 3:20:17.400]  for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job
[3:20:17.400 --> 3:20:22.840]  security. You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:28.280]  and own your own business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his
[3:20:28.280 --> 3:20:33.800]  own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:39.240]  benefits of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost
[3:20:39.240 --> 3:20:43.720]  home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people
[3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:49.000]  lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income. Visit chocolate.
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:55.240]  ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very
[3:20:55.240 --> 3:21:01.240]  little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:08.600]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:11.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:15.800]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you,
[3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:20.680]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R., and Lisa D'Arcella?
[3:21:20.680 --> 3:21:25.240]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:30.760]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:21:30.760 --> 3:21:37.320]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[3:21:37.320 --> 3:21:43.880]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:46.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:52.120]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[3:21:52.120 --> 3:21:58.280]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.

[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:15.880]  Wayne Madsen is our guest for the rest of the hour. He's on the street in DC. He just came out
[3:24:15.880 --> 3:24:22.680]  of an international TV interview. Wayne Madsen worked with the National Security Agency. A lot
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:26.280]  of times when you're watching C-SPAN, they're having an NSA hearing or CIA hearing. You'll see
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:30.920]  him in the audience reporting. He's just broken so many big news stories here on this show.
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:36.280]  And he said he's been in the CIA government archives the last few days. He has something big
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:42.360]  for us today. But I originally wanted to get him on when we called him late last week. He said he
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:47.880]  was in the CIA archives and their archives couldn't come on then was about his reports that are now
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:52.600]  coming out mainstream news that the makers of the vaccine won't take it. The doctors won't take the
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:57.560]  flu vaccine, but they want us to take it. And of course, he originally broke that it was man-made.
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:03.080]  Other virologists and scientists have now concurred with that. So Wayne Madsen joins us now. Should
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:09.880]  we get into the flu thing first or the latest Blackwater torture, those hearings and Blackwater
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:15.160]  killings and I should have said Blackwater and torture hearings. I was watching yesterday.
[3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:19.480]  Where should we start, Wayne? Well, we can certainly go with the flu first because that's
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:25.320]  that's going to start to really suck my head at the end of this month now. We're already in September.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:31.960]  Amazing that it's September 2nd. And they're now talking about quarantines, lock downs of cities,
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:37.400]  mainstream news. They're talking about implementing executive orders for this. Do you think they're
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:41.320]  going to go with that or has their fear mongering not taken hold like they wanted?
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:47.320]  Well, it's hard to say. We're seeing directives coming out of various state governments,
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:54.200]  for example, that are talking exactly about things like forced quarantines and forced
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:26:00.920]  vaccinations. We had Governor Schwarzenegger basically sound a very dire warning about the
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:08.920]  number. One in four people in California could get this flu. And the chief epidemiologist for
[3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:17.000]  the state of Minnesota is talking about similar numbers in Minnesota. And so now we have state
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  officials sounding this very severe alarm bell. So where is this all going? I guess we won't know.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:32.120]  Well, we saw President Obama urge people to get the H1N1 vaccine. I think it would be
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:37.240]  interesting to find out if he is going to take it and he's going to have it administered to his
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:45.080]  two girls and Michelle. Now, will his two girls get all three of the shots that Dr. Obama wants
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:50.520]  us to take? Well, listen, if there was anyone in the White House press corps that had any,
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:55.720]  you know what, you know what, they would ask that question. But don't hold your breath on that,
[3:26:55.720 --> 3:27:02.120]  because this White House press corps has shown itself to be totally compliant with all their
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:07.480]  puffball questions. You're talking about a huevos-free environment.
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:15.800]  Well, I'll tell you that what I'm hearing about the vaccine and this actually is coming
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:21.800]  in one case, somebody who was very instrumental in developing the smatpox vaccine is saying that
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:27.320]  that he's not going to take this particular vaccine. He's urging his family and his friends
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:34.680]  not to take it either. Break that down for us. Well, I mean, what we've got in vaccines and I
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:43.000]  noted that even NBC's Dateline the other night ran a story on the danger of vaccines, especially
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:51.560]  with the issue of autism with this ingredient called the merisol, which is one-half mercury,
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:28:00.040]  and also these squalings. These are what's thought to have caused the Gulf War syndrome
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:05.240]  in the troops during Desert Storm who were administered vaccines, I would say. I would
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:10.280]  note also against the will, of course, if you're in the military, they say they own you 24 hours a
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:18.840]  day and we saw that appear terribly in the ailments of some of our returning troops from Desert Storm.
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:30.440]  Now, under level six, and previously level six was the highest, now it's 6.2. It's like their
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:36.520]  spinal tap. They're going from 10 to 11. A new level of pheromone ring or on the red color code
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:46.280]  to some color above it, purple, for even worse. But under the executive order that CBS News is
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:54.120]  reporting on, it allows quarantines, forced inoculations, all of this. This was originally
[3:28:54.120 --> 3:29:00.680]  out in April in CBS News. We'll zoom in on this article there for people at PrisonPlanet.tv and
[3:29:00.680 --> 3:29:05.960]  yeah, it's now in Iowa and in Massachusetts. They're preparing to come in your house without
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:13.160]  warrants, forced injections, and then Texas passed a law where they're going to take blood now at
[3:29:13.160 --> 3:29:20.440]  checkpoints without warrants. I mean, just any excuse to get in our bodies. And also, I saw a
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:25.480]  directive from the state of Tennessee that talks about maybe having to close banks down, that the
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:32.040]  banks would be allowed to close for business if they're concerned about people transmitting the
[3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:37.480]  flu in banks. So, we're seeing a lot of this stuff now coming out from various state and local
[3:29:37.480 --> 3:29:46.360]  governments. Absolutely. Wayne Madsen's our guest. Long segment coming up with Wayne Madsen. We're
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:51.880]  going to cover a whole host of issues and where he sees the economy going. Stay with us. We're on
[3:29:51.880 --> 3:30:01.800]  the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, friends. This is
[3:30:01.800 --> 3:30:06.440]  Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:12.440]  tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260
[3:30:12.440 --> 3:30:17.240]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly
[3:30:17.240 --> 3:30:21.960]  linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:27.320]  going to do about it? The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back

[3:33:18.040 --> 3:33:23.880]  the history of psychiatry and psychology with Hitler, the Soviets, and of course the communist
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:31.160]  Chinese. And I want to put in there what Kaiser mentioned about how it was psychologists and
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:36.600]  psychiatrists that ran the torture, including in the Army's report, raping the children.
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:42.520]  So let's make sure that we show that this system works for the globalist. I mean,
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:48.920]  it's nothing but a group of high priests that, what do you think of this move to list? And that's
[3:33:48.920 --> 3:33:54.280]  what they do. Psychology Today hit piece labels conspiracy thinking as psychotic illness talks
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:33:58.920]  about how we're potentially violent and dangerous. Says right here that it's dopamine levels that
[3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:07.400]  were borderline, that were borderline schizophrenic. You know, we're so insane, we're hearing choo-choo
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:13.720]  trains in the background. I could tell Madsen's by train. I mean, this is really a juvenile trick.
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:19.080]  He says there's no world population reduction numbers. None of that's real. There's no bank of
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:24.600]  the world. There's no global banking cartel. It's just Madsen. We are completely mad.
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:31.800]  Well, I ran a story not long ago about the National Security Agency and I've been
[3:34:31.800 --> 3:34:39.400]  writing about how people at work there have been subjected to psychological and psychiatric abuse
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:44.520]  by the medical department there as a way to basically pull their clearances that they're
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:51.080]  considered not to be working within the system. And recently I found out that the NSA security,
[3:34:51.080 --> 3:34:56.200]  which is called the Q group, and the NSA medical are working together now prescribing what they
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:03.000]  call happy pills. This is Prozac and Zolot for employees who show that they're not throwing
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:10.280]  the line. So here we have another example of what can only be described as how the Soviet Union
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:15.960]  handled incidents. They had these Fikushka psychiatric hospitals. If you were against the
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:21.720]  Soviet system, they thought you were crazy and they would put you in a psychiatric hospital.
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:27.720]  Now we see that happening here within some of our own intelligence agencies. Well, it was,
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:35.240]  I mean, watching documentary films and reading history books about Nazi Germany, most of the
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:42.200]  tyranny from 33 to 38, before they really started the big official camps, was psychiatry
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:46.760]  and it was merged with eugenics and they were the ones that would come and take your kids and raise
[3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:50.840]  them in government dorms. They were the ones who would come take your kid who had a problem and
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:56.920]  then euthanize them. And I would bring this up. I mean, I brought up the famous inventor of lobotomies,
[3:35:56.920 --> 3:36:02.040]  how he would do public lobotomies with an ice pick and he just said, that's not true. And I,
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:08.200]  in fact, search engine, start page.com or Google or whatever for people right now on screen,
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:16.840]  lobotomy with an ice pick and you'll have mainstream news. And I even gave this to him
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:21.560]  and he would just giggle and say, I was crazy on the other end of the phone. I mean, who are these
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:26.760]  people, Wayne Madsen? Are they all like on power trips and they love going in and having women
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:31.720]  come into them and lay down and you have mental illness? I'll help you. I mean, it sounds just
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:41.000]  like a Spingali con artist's guild. Well, when we look at this CIA report on how they treated
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:49.240]  the detainees with prolonged bipering, extended nudity, you have to wonder what kind of perverts.
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:54.680]  And I think that's where this investigation is going. I've written about Dick Cheney. I've written
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:59.160]  about Scooter Libby. When you look at what these two individuals, I won't call them gentlemen
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:03.960]  because they're not gentlemen by any stretch, but when you look at what these two individuals were
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:10.280]  involved in, Libby writing a novel about turn of the century Japan in the early 20th century where
[3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:18.520]  there's references to bestiality and pedophilia. And we know about Dick Cheney had a predilection
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:25.240]  for some of the escorts provided to Halliburton by Pamela Martin and Associates, which was run by
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:30.760]  the late Debra Jean Palfrey. I think we're getting to the actual crux of what the last
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:37.080]  administration was all about. Well, absolutely. Here's NPR. We just searched Engine Lobotomy
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:43.400]  with Ice Pick and you can click on it and watch photos and videos of them ramming the ice pick
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:50.280]  into the corner of the eye, into the skull with pleasure. And I, and I sitting this NPR article,
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:37:57.320]  NPR, and he just laughed, man, it's funny. I mean, it's funny that they're this psychotic guild
[3:37:57.320 --> 3:38:03.480]  out enjoying itself, having its way with everyone. And the new freedom initiative wants to drug half
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:09.480]  of the school children in America. I mean, that came out mainstream news and I would bring that up
[3:38:09.480 --> 3:38:16.200]  and he would just laugh. I mean, it's not funny. And I don't think they realize their mind games
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:22.120]  aren't working with us anymore, Wayne. No, definitely not. And I think, you know, that's why I think
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:27.880]  what we're seeing now stuff come out of the White House talking about shutting down the
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:33.720]  internet. If there's a national emergency, obviously there's, there's no interest in having information
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:38.280]  available when you've got people like this with their agendas running the show.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:46.280]  Well, Wayne, let's get into some other issues here. I digress. It's just,
[3:38:48.200 --> 3:38:53.720]  what do you call it where the mainstream media will say we're setting up a world government to be
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:59.080]  run by private banks and it's going to be a planetary regime and we're going to drug your water
[3:38:59.640 --> 3:39:05.880]  and then we read it. And then they write articles saying we're insane. It doesn't exist
[3:39:05.880 --> 3:39:11.480]  in sometimes the same publications a month later. What, I mean, is that double speak, double think?
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:18.120]  I mean, what is that? Well, I think it's just a different approach to creating conflict, creating
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:23.320]  chaos, constant chaos. When you have constant chaos, of course, people can take advantage
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:28.280]  of that situation. And we've seen it happen time and time again. I'm actually sitting across
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:32.920]  from the CBS News Bureau here in Washington right now. That's why you're hearing the traffic
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:38.760]  noise. But I mean, if you talk to these journalists individually, those who are left who haven't been
[3:39:38.760 --> 3:39:46.200]  laid off with this downturn in the economy and this extreme change in how news is covered in
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:50.680]  the United States, you talk to them individually. They don't know these things, but they'll never
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:57.880]  get it through the producers and the editors to get it on the air on the major news network.
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:05.960]  Yeah. All that's left now is a really seedy guild of mercenary media people who will just do
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:13.640]  whatever they're told. And I think that's only going to accelerate the discrediting of them
[3:40:13.640 --> 3:40:19.640]  quicker because these are such a lazy hit pieces they do on the freedom movement. I mean, don't
[3:40:19.640 --> 3:40:25.720]  they understand this is only confirming to everyone just how scum-filled they are?
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:34.680]  Well, I think it gets to this whole idea of the elitism with, you've got all the major networks
[3:40:34.680 --> 3:40:42.360]  now controlled by big corporations and it's a cybery tower approach. I cover the news inside
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:48.520]  the beltway, but the term inside the beltway has always been used to describe this sort of
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:55.320]  incestuous relationship that politicians, journalists, and others, what they call quote-unquote
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:00.280]  movers and shakers, have in this town. And obviously, if you're reading from something
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:06.600]  that isn't part of the official script, you're always criticized and made fun of and intimidated.
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:12.360]  Well, I'm also seeing this drumbeat against myself and other activists that were violent
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.320]  and were calling for violence, even though I'm calling for the opposite. That's in psychology
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:22.760]  today. Within hours of Poplowski doing what he did, the Southern probably law center said it was
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:30.840]  my fault. I've got some of the Soros people now coming out and saying Obama is not calling for
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:35.880]  national service and I'm a dangerous liar. Why am I, because I know this happens to you too,
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:39.480]  but I mean, really, it's happening bad now. And I'm wondering if in your expertise,
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:43.080]  you think they're building up to something. Because in my experience, they demonize you
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:47.560]  just to demonize you and discredit you, or they demonize you in preparation for something else.
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:52.200]  And I hope that's not what it is. False charges, my murder, whatever the case may be,
[3:41:52.200 --> 3:41:57.080]  and whatever the case is, I'm ready for it. And this is the path I'm on. And it's an honor to
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:01.400]  fight these people. But why do you think they're really coming after me right now?
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:09.080]  Well, as I say, we've always had an element of this in the past where journalists who didn't
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:15.640]  fall into line were criticized. And certainly, Jack Anderson faced a lot of that criticism.
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:21.160]  I have stone as he's stone faced that criticism and others. But now we're seeing with this
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:28.360]  conglomeration of the media, the corporate media having a lot more power to demonize
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:33.000]  those who basically call them out on how they cover these stories. And certainly,
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:41.320]  we see that time and time again. And as you say, months later, for example, NBC Dayline
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:48.920]  is reporting that the vaccines or vaccines may not be safe. They featured this man, Dr. Wakefield,
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:53.960]  who has been criticized by his peers who said, look, these vaccines have to be looked at.
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:42:59.400]  I haven't done all the research, but the research should be conducted. And we should have
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:06.920]  an independent verification by professionals as to whether these vaccines are in fact safe.
[3:43:07.720 --> 3:43:11.720]  Well, that's the thing is they're now admitting Gardasil's killing a bunch of people and that in
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:17.160]  flu vaccine trials in Europe, it's killed a bunch of people. I got that wrong and flipped it to
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:21.480]  Texas. They were worried in Texas, but the deaths are in Europe. We showed those articles.
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:28.680]  I mean, I'm just wondering where all this is going because there seems to be a crisis in
[3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:34.040]  confidence. And instead of the establishment being more truthful, they're now more and more
[3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:39.160]  just intensifying the lying or they're talking out of both sides of their mouths, almost like
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:46.360]  they're committing suicide politically in front of us. Well, as I say, the proof will be in the
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:52.920]  pudding. If the people who are suggesting that we all take the vaccine for H1N1, if they really
[3:43:52.920 --> 3:44:00.200]  feel that way, let's see them be the first in line when these vaccines are available and are
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:05.880]  being administered. Let's see whether Schwarzenegger is the first one to get the vaccine in Sacramento
[3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:13.720]  and whether President Obama is on camera showing him getting it and his family. But if we don't
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:19.400]  see that, obviously, we're not going to believe politicians, especially when your health,
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:23.640]  your very life may be at risk. Well, Wayne, I don't believe anything they say. They could take
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:27.240]  a shot of saline solution. They've been caught doing similar stunts in the past. I believe
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:32.040]  nothing they say. And I think that's what the establishment hasn't quite yet figured out.
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:35.240]  And the longer it takes for it to figure it out, the better because, you know,
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:40.680]  if they get more sophisticated, they'll be harder to beat. Just their ball face lying about everything
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:45.480]  is really helping us awaken everybody. But shifting gears, I got to toot your horn again.
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:48.280]  That's why I really respect you, Wayne Madsen. And by the way, you're in the upcoming film
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:55.160]  Fall of the Republic with Max Kaiser and many others. I remember, you know, it's like you have
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:44:58.520]  the knowledge. You forget everywhere you saw it, unless you go Google it and pull it up.
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:07.640]  But I remember Psyhersh, you, other people, Ray McGovern, three, four, five years ago,
[3:45:07.640 --> 3:45:11.160]  and then you really in the last year, especially saying, look,
[3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:15.880]  Blackwater's running hit teams, Delta forces involved. They're killing political enemies.
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:23.080]  Then I tied that into UPI, AP, Jerusalem post, 2003, Israel bragging, we got hit teams even in
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:28.520]  America. So a lot of this is from the hit teams themselves. And then Merck putting out in federal
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:34.520]  documents that they have hit teams, quote, liquidating doctors in a seek and destroy program.
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:40.680]  And then Merck says, oh, that's just a joke. We give to these mercenaries.
[3:45:40.680 --> 3:45:48.040]  You were one of the first people to break this. A, what was your intel on that, if you can tell us?
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:54.680]  And then B, it appears we just uncovered like the very tip of the iceberg. And it's this huge
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:46:01.560]  archipelago or constellation of murder gangs. And I was watching congressional hearings yesterday
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:06.680]  with all this starting to come out. I mean, my God, it looks like it was worse than we even thought.
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:12.680]  I'll tell you one thing that surprised me. I never thought that Blackwater was as close to the CIA
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:18.520]  as we now know it was, that they got these sole source contracts that, first of all,
[3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:23.800]  engage in covert actions around the world, that they were using foreign mercenaries to conduct
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:31.640]  targeted assassinations. And they were using US retired, US military personnel to do the same
[3:46:31.640 --> 3:46:38.760]  thing. The reason I say that is because we were told that there was a major difference of opinion
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:43.080]  between Donald Rumsfeld when he was Secretary of Defense and the person in charge of the
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:48.600]  counterterrorism center at CIA, corporate Black, who, by the way, then went after President of
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:54.120]  the State Department. He went to work for Blackwater's intelligence gathering arm,
[3:46:54.120 --> 3:47:01.320]  the total information systems. Now we see with Buzzy Kroengard, the executive director at the CIA,
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:07.160]  leaves the CIA and winds up on the advisory board for Blackwater. His brother Cookie Kroengard is
[3:47:07.160 --> 3:47:13.160]  the inspector general of the State Department, basically covering up all the Blackwater contracts
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:20.280]  and the malfeasance at state. We know that other CIA officials went to work for Blackwater.
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:25.960]  I guess the biggest surprise was the initial reports were that there was a skid in between
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:31.560]  the Pentagon and the CIA, but now we know that that was probably just a mere turf battle,
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:34.760]  had nothing to do with the use of Blackwater whatsoever.
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:40.840]  So how much murdering is going on? Because they admit it was Chinese enemies, not just, quote,
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:47.640]  Al-Ciada. I mean, who were they killing? Well, when I first heard about George Tenet's
[3:47:47.640 --> 3:47:53.560]  attack matrix, worldwide attack matrix, I was looking and I was told by sources
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:48:01.000]  close to the CIA that they said, look, it's not just in Iraq and Yemen and Afghanistan
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:07.080]  are targeting people. They told me about politicians in Lebanon being targeted, people
[3:48:07.720 --> 3:48:13.960]  with various human rights movements and successionist movements from Indonesia to
[3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:23.000]  Colombia also being targeted. So this, in fact, was what Tenet told all the members of the cabinet
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:28.680]  and President Bush's senior advisors at Camp David just a few days after 9-11. It was, in fact,
[3:48:28.680 --> 3:48:35.880]  a worldwide attack matrix. And when you've got a sociopath like Dick Cheney sitting there,
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:41.880]  basically calling the shots, it was get even time, obviously, for him and his closest advice.
[3:48:41.880 --> 3:48:47.240]  Well, let me ask you this. From the MO we've got from when Rumsfeld brought in Cheney during
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:52.840]  Ford, as you know, that it's really Rumsfeld is the one, even through the last administration,
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:59.320]  that was really the real president. People say it was Cheney, but in that weird relationship,
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:06.840]  do you agree that Rumsfeld was actually above him? Well, this was a mentoring type relationship
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:12.440]  that they had. These two individuals are like frickin' track when it comes to
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:20.920]  modern American politics. And certainly, it was Cheney that was very upset when Bush,
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:24.760]  I guess, listened to his daddy and said, look, it's time to get rid of Rumsfeld.
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:32.360]  And Cheney was very much opposed to that as much as he was against Bush's decision,
[3:49:32.360 --> 3:49:38.520]  not the part in Scooter Libby. I think we see what the network was that committed these war crimes,
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:43.560]  and that's why- But is Rumsfeld at the top of the Cheney Pyramid, or is Cheney there?
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:50.680]  I think, you know, you'd have to separate these two guys with a crowbar. I think they're basically,
[3:49:50.680 --> 3:49:58.680]  they're almost like brothers in arms. Certainly, Rumsfeld, in the Ford administration,
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:02.600]  was the Chief of Staff went on to become the Secretary of Defense, and then, of course,
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:09.800]  Cheney moved up to become Chief of Staff for Ford. But their whole purpose in the Ford
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:16.440]  administration was to make sure the New Democratic Congress, in the wake of Watergate, did not take
[3:50:16.440 --> 3:50:23.000]  all these imperial powers away from the White House. In fact, they expanded it. They wrote
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:27.960]  the current COG that the National Security Council is using for the Northcom Takeover,
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:34.120]  and now the Pentagon, as you know, Lane, wants 400,000 troops. A year ago, it was 20,000. Now,
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:39.400]  it's 400,000 on the streets of America? That's right. That's right. And certainly,
[3:50:39.400 --> 3:50:46.040]  we know that they were the ones behind the CIA, you know, getting rid of Bill Colby as CIA director.
[3:50:46.040 --> 3:50:51.960]  Bill Colby was trying to come clean on a lot of these issues, including assassinations,
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:58.600]  Allende and Chile, and other things that came out. Stay there. Final segment. I want to ask you what the big CIA news is.
[3:50:58.600 --> 3:51:01.160]  You said you were in the archives, got something breaking. Stay with us.
[3:51:01.720 --> 3:51:06.600]  Finally, in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:11.480]  have now penetrated our power grid. Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer,
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:16.120]  we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid. Some say that this summer's
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.720]  demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power
[3:51:21.720 --> 3:51:27.160]  outages across the country, putting us all in the dark. Are you prepared for the next round of
[3:51:27.160 --> 3:51:31.800]  storm-related outages or government-created blackouts? Have you ever thought about taking
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:37.480]  steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power? If so,
[3:51:37.480 --> 3:51:42.520]  this will be the most important information you have ever heard. Solar-powered generators are
[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:48.280]  finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas
[3:51:48.280 --> 3:51:54.440]  whatsoever. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com. That's

[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:07.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.640 --> 3:52:13.160]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:18.600]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:23.880]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day
[3:52:23.880 --> 3:52:28.680]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:52:28.680 --> 3:52:35.560]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:43.320]  fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[3:52:43.320 --> 3:52:50.600]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[3:52:50.600 --> 3:52:58.440]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception,

[3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:37.960]  ladies and gentlemen. In closing, Wayne Madsen, Wayne, you were getting into Blackwater and the
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:43.160]  sex slave children. We talked about that years ago with Halliburton and Dinecore, congressional
[3:55:43.160 --> 3:55:49.960]  hearings, Chicago Tribune, psychology today makes jokes about it. I mean, we're not schizophrenic.
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:54.440]  It's in congressional hearings about this now. You've got some more intel on that with them tied
[3:55:54.440 --> 3:56:01.400]  into Thailand. Well, just in the last couple of days, under a new Justice Department program
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:07.320]  called Twisted Traveler, they busted the first time under this program, three Americans and
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:13.240]  Cambodia for engaging in sex with kids there. The problem is that the State Department was
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:18.040]  said to have been involved with this investigation through the Diplomatic Security Service.
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:24.200]  I've checked this out. I mean, the US embassies in Southeast Asia are rife with pedophiles.
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:31.080]  They're diplomats. I've actually discovered that they provide, in some cases,
[3:56:31.080 --> 3:56:37.800]  child prostitutes for visiting US VIPs, including members of Congress. I've been trying to get a
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:44.200]  list of all the congressional delegations that have been down there since the 1990s, specifically
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:52.120]  1996 to the present time. When these guys get caught, instead of prosecuting them, sending
[3:56:52.120 --> 3:56:56.680]  them back to the United States, they simply transfer them to another embassy in Southeast Asia
[3:56:56.680 --> 3:57:03.240]  where they're allowed to continue these decadent practices. So it's fine. The Justice Department
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:09.000]  is looking at it. They're getting the low-hanging fruit here, though. They're not going after the
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:15.320]  diplomats, the CIA stations that are involved in this, especially for blackmail purposes.
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:21.560]  Everything from local businessmen to members of Congress.
[3:57:21.560 --> 3:57:28.040]  Well, Wayne, in closing, every time I'm researching globalism, I'm not even looking for it, and you
[3:57:28.040 --> 3:57:34.840]  run into pedophiles. From your research, is it a pedophile guild at all levels of government
[3:57:34.840 --> 3:57:37.720]  in key man positions that are really running things?
[3:57:38.600 --> 3:57:42.840]  Well, I have to say that in the State Department, it's one of the worst-case
[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:49.880]  scenarios for this type of thing. The State, as I say, the Diplomatic Corps in Southeast Asia,
[3:57:49.880 --> 3:57:55.640]  including ambassadors, either are involved with this or give a wink and a nod to it, consular
[3:57:55.640 --> 3:58:04.120]  officials do the same thing. We're talking about an underground court that basically looks out
[3:58:04.120 --> 3:58:09.640]  for one another. Well, that's what we find, even in state investigations. I mean, we kick open the
[3:58:09.640 --> 3:58:16.680]  doors, and it's always satanic pedophiles and weirdos and scum, and God help us with these people.
[3:58:16.680 --> 3:58:20.200]  That's the New World Order. Wayne, when you can get on the landline in the next few days,
[3:58:20.200 --> 3:58:25.240]  I want to be back on on this subject specifically. WayneMadsonReport.com,
[3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:30.600]  WayneMadsonReport.com, or TheWayNMadsonReport.com. Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[3:58:30.600 --> 3:58:35.720]  Better be with you, Alex. All right, there he goes. We'll be back tomorrow live at 11-3 p.m.
[3:58:35.720 --> 3:58:39.480]  Keep spreading the word about this show as we fight tyranny. Retransmission starts now
[3:58:39.480 --> 3:58:48.680]  in FullWars.com. Great job, crew. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:55.480]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[3:58:55.480 --> 3:58:59.800]  generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[3:58:59.800 --> 3:59:05.000]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[3:59:05.000 --> 3:59:09.560]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[3:59:09.560 --> 3:59:14.600]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[3:59:14.600 --> 3:59:18.680]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[3:59:18.680 --> 3:59:23.080]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[3:59:23.080 --> 3:59:27.800]  lose their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:59:27.800 --> 3:59:32.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[3:59:32.520 --> 3:59:37.400]  offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at
